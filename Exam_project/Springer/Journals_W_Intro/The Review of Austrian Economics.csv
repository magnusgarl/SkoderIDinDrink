Professional sports leagues do their best to ensure vigorous athletic competition between teams, which attracts fans and increases revenue. This sporting competition between teams is also a type of economic competition vis a vis the rest of the economy, in the sense that a better baseball game product attracts consumers who might otherwise spend their money at the movies or the opera. However, sports leagues try to curtail profit-eroding economic competition between the teams by establishing exclusive territories, by limiting individual or overall salaries, and by limiting the competition for new talent. The concepts of sporting competition and economic competition should be kept conceptually separate, but of course, the two are connected. More wins means more attendance and more revenue. Meanwhile, more expenditure on talent means more wins. The owners of a sports franchise instruct their front office executives to somehow balance the cost of extra talent with two dimensions of benefits, namely, winning games or championships, and earning extra profit. The exact nature of this balance is a matter of contention. Some owners may care more about championships than dollars, and others may care more about the bottom line. In one sense, however, there is no controversy between these objectives. In a constrained optimization setting with a given budget for player salaries, the objective of maximizing wins is coincident with the objective of maximizing profit because of the assumed strictly positive relationship between gate revenues and winning percentage. The goal of either a win maximizer or a profit maximizer would be the efficient expenditure of the given budget.Footnote 4
 It is the efficient and innovative, expenditure of a given budget by the Oakland Athletics that the paper examines in the empirical section. This is important because we can examine the outcome of the sporting competition, that is, winning percentage with much better data than the outcome of any economic competition. Indeed, league reporting of its costs and revenues and the reporting of such by individual teams are notorious for their obfuscation. One other aspect about competition deserves mention here. The sporting competition, by definition, is a zero-sum game if only the teams are considered. One team's win is another's loss. However, if the fan's enjoyment is also considered, then heightened sporting competition is welfare-increasing. Meanwhile, some forms of economic competition may be negative-sum games for the teams involved but zero-sum games overall. Consider, for example, an auction type bidding war for a free agent. As teams bid against each other the league owners as a collective lose out, but, except for the bargaining cost, the player and his agent gain dollar for dollar what the owners pay over and above the reservation wage. Compare these cases with what happens in the competition phase of the Kirznerian story. Competition to Kirzner means that imitators copy the entrepreneur's discovery, thus lowering the market price and costing the suppliers as a whole their profits. However, the lost profits to the sellers are not lost to society, they show up as increased consumer surplus in a positive-sum game for society in general.",2

The lecture, organized by Theodor Adorno of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, has come to be known as the “positivist dispute” in German sociology. It was not much of a dispute, however, because Adorno mistook Popper for a positivist and Popper did not know about Critical Theory. Popper already had the positivism debate in the 1930s when he lived and worked in Vienna and engaged the members of the Vienna Circle (D’Amico, 1990-91). Popper has been mistaken for a positivist due to his defense of the similarity of natural and social science inquiry. In The Poverty of Historicism, he pursued the unity of science as an epistemological and methodological understanding. The study of society can be as scientific as the study of the natural world because science is about method, not subject matter. Scientific theories are capable of falsification; they are expressed in statements that can be disproved by empirical tests. Social scientists engage in science to the extent that they express their theories in statements that can be refuted (Stokes, 1998, p. 75). Natural and social science are alike in that they both begin with problems. Popper dismissed the positivist method, of beginning with systematic observation and the collection of statistical data, and then proceeding by induction to generalizations and theories, as “misguided naturalism” (Popper, 1992). He particularly disliked the attempt on the part of social scientists to “ape the physical sciences” by practicing methods of measurement they believed to be practiced in natural science. “The doctrine that there is as much science in a subject as there is mathematics in it, or as much measurement or ‘precision’ in it, rests on a complete misunderstanding” (Popper, 1983a, p. 7). Social scientists cannot predict a singular event with reference to universal laws and initial conditions because there are no empirical laws in social science. Trends exist, and they are a useful statistical device, but trends are not universal. Scientific inquiry, Popper argued, is theory-driven. Theories represent attempts to solve certain problems. What makes this exercise a matter of science is “critical discussion,” the attempt to eliminate a flaw or an error within the theory (Popper, 1994, p. 158). In his lecture to the Department of Economics, Harvard University, in 1963, Popper summarized his view of the scientific method.
 We select some problem—perhaps, by stumbling over it. We try to solve it by proposing a theory as a tentative solution. Through the critical discussion of our theories our knowledge grows by the elimination of some of our errors, and understand our problems, our theories, and the need for new solutions. The critical discussion of even our best theories always reveals new problems (Popper, 1994, p. 159). Critical discussion essentially involves comparison of two or more theories. Theories become provisionally accepted because they offer greater explanatory power over rivals. Theories lose credibility through inconsistency, including inconsistency with the results of empirical tests (Popper, 1994, p. 160). Popper himself, however, did not apply the principle of falsification to social science consistently (Oakely, 1999, p. 26; Caldwell, 1999, p. 18). He rarely discussed falsification in connection with social science. Instead, he emphasized how the study of human conduct differed from the study of the physical world (Hands, 1993, p. 68). One important difference, as Jarvie (1982) points out, is the “Oedipus Effect.” This idea is easy to grasp but also easy to underestimate in importance. “In general, the Oedipus Effect can be observed wherever the social scientist adds to the stock of information on which people predicate their actions” (Jarvie, 1982, p. 87). Popper chose the title as an allusion to “obliging dreams” in psychoanalysis; Freud admitted that the dreams reported by subjects were colored by the theories of their analysts. Initially, Popper surmised that the Oedipus Effect distinguished social science from natural science, but later, became aware of the influence of theories on empirical observations in natural science as well (Popper, 1976, p. 121).Footnote 6 He saw the reflective quality of social science as a unique moral obligation. This principle advocates a cautious approach to the acquisition of social-scientific knowledge; because social scientists know so little, they may unwittingly make things worse. Social scientists incur a moral obligation because sociological knowledge concerns the “use and misuse of power, plain and simple” (Popper, 1994, p. 127). The social scientist, who devises social technology capable of endangering human freedom incurs the moral responsibility to warn people of the dangers and strive to discover effective counter-measures. Morally-responsible social scientists encourage dialogue between social experimenters and the targets of their experiments, even of small-scale social experiments. If social scientists are truly interested in critical discussion leading to improving their theories, part of this task must include uncovering the views of those who have experienced the consequences of such experiments. Stokes (1997, p. 76) summarizes Popper's point well when he says: “Criticism of social theories and their resultant social policies is not simply the province of social scientists but also those whose lives may be altered by them.” The most important difference between social and natural science is that human conduct displays rationality (Stokes, 1997, p. 69). Popper suggested that the social scientist starts out with an advantage over the natural scientist because of the rationality of human behavior. The purposive character of human conduct makes the social world less complex than the natural world (Jarvie, 1982, p. 88; Redman, 1994, p. 76). Popper's discussion of the rationality principle has been trivialized by the suggestion that he is simply referring to the concept of a person in neo-classical economics, that of the information-processing, cost-benefit optimizer (Zafirovski, 1999).Footnote 7 Popper insists that he is not talking about an empirical conjecture but a methodological device (Notturno, 1998). When offered as an assumption about human nature, that people act to maximize their self-interest, Popper argues that the assumption of “rational choice” is almost certainly false, because a principle that is not universally true is false. Yet he insists that the rationality principle serves as an unavoidable part of every testable theory. Criticism of a social science model should focus on failure of the model rather than the assumption of rationality because we can learn more by improving the model than by seeking to explain the irrationality of behavior (Popper, 1983b, p. 359). In this sense, Popper contributes to the long history of “as if” philosophy; that is, he does not seek to portray reality, but offers a construct for finding our way more easily in the world. There are many examples of deriving meaningful insights from a starting assumption known to be false (Vaihinger, 1965).Footnote 8
 It is not the assumption of maximization of benefit which constitutes the basis for situational logic. Rather, it is the principle of human agents making problematic choices among alternative courses of action. The range of choices is a function of situation, an approximation of the alternatives afforded by the social context. Situational logic consists of “analyzing the situation of the acting person” (Popper, 1992, p. 79). In linking the economic person of marginal utility with a sociological view of situations, as I explain below, Popper references the idea of rationality within the Austrian School. The Austrian economists viewed economic behaviors as embedded in social interactions; they regarded economics as a branch of sociology (Prendergast, 1986, p. 3).Footnote 9

Bradley Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"F.A. Hayek (1952, p. 52) stated, “It is probably no exaggeration to say that every important advance in economic theory during the last hundred years was a further step in the consistent application of subjectivism.” Hayek's insight rings true for mineral-resource economics, where an economist outside of the Austrian tradition, Erich Zimmermann, developed a subjectivist (mind-centered) theory in the 1930s for understanding the nature of so-called depletable (or nonreproducible) minerals and explaining a paradox of economic phenomena—the expanding supply of believed-to-be-wasting natural resources. Zimmermann's neglected beginning, when combined with brief insights provided by Ludwig von Mises, and the empirical work of M.A. Adelman regarding crude oil and Julian Simon regarding minerals in general, offers a theory of resource expansion that challenges the distinction between renewable and nonrenewable resources and the depletionist mindset it engenders. Location and the institutional environment—not chemical nonreproducibility—are important as the chief characteristics of minerals for social-science theory and applied economics. This essay surveys the history of mineral-resource thought, identifying the precepts of a formalistic, objectivist theory that captured the mainstream of economics. The views of William Stanley Jevons in the nineteenth century, and L.C. Gray and Harold Hotelling in the first third of the twentieth century, are prominent. The perspective of Austrian-school economists are next considered, followed by the contributions of the institutionalist Erich Zimmermann, whose “functional theory” was more developed, and, in places, even more “Austrian.” Using Zimmermann and Mises as the starting point, the essay presents key elements of a thoroughgoing subjectivist theory of mineral economics.",19

Hayek",March 2007,Daniel B. Klein,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This volume collects 10 of Ronald Hamowy's previously published papers. Each article appears in its originally published images. Roughly half of the papers deal with the Scottish enlightenment, and half with Hayek. Thus, the book explores two ends of the doctrine of spontaneous order, but does not form an integrated whole. The essays offer great value to anyone interested in the Scots or Hayek. Hamowy is learned, insightful, and eloquent. In my opinion, the reader may put great trust in his judgment. Hamowy's essays on the Scots focus on David Hume, Adam Smith, and especially Adam Ferguson, and mention Francis Hutchison, Lord Kames, Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Reid, John Millar, and Dugald Stewart. The main theme is that the Scot's adumbrated the idea that good results and institutions often come from a skein of actions and experiments that had aimed elsewhere. Since Hayek, this idea has been called “spontaneous order.” Its most developed form is market theory, based on local knowledge, price signals, and the pursuit of individual gain. The Scots, especially Smith, richly developed that form of spontaneous order. However, Hamowy's book teaches that the Scots maintained an idea of undesigned beneficial order that extends far beyond market-process theory. They inferred invisible hands that reached to the dynamics of moral sentiments, culture, and the historical evolution of political institutions. In these contexts, “spontaneous” would not translate into “free.” The Scots certainly tended to be libertarian in their policy views, and the libertarian idea of liberty was fundamental in their thought (e.g., 167). But, those features can divert readers from the fact that they believed in invisible hands at the level of governmental selection and emergence. This is true also of Adam Smith, whose statements about moral sentiments and the history of political institutions often assert invisible-hand results that would involve mechanisms quite beyond the level of Hayekian spontaneous order. As Hamowy summarizes the Scot's key theme:
 [Social] structures come into being as a consequence of the aggregate of numerous discrete individual actions, none of which aims at the formation of coherent social institutions. Society is not the produce of calculation but arises spontaneously, and its institutions are not the result of intentional design but of men's actions which have as their purpose an array of short-term private objectives. (p. 39) The complex social patterns of Smithian market dynamics are not the only, and maybe not even the most central, representative of Scottish spontaneous-order thinking. Their focus was more on the historical emergence of institutional structures, not on the price mechanism and the like. The spontaneous-order belief lent itself to a certain pride and confidence in current institutions. The Scots were disposed to the “Whig theory of history,” which said that the centuries leading up to the present (the eighteenth century) were a history of progress, arrived at by spontaneous developments, not intelligent design. Hamowy points out the key tension in Scottish thought, a tension between two meanings of “spontaneous.” At the higher, historical level, where “spontaneous” involves episodic political machinations, the Scots exhibited what Hamowy calls a “conservative bias,” a Whiggish pride, that “militates against any program of comprehensive reform” (p. 71). At the market-theory level, where “spontaneous” means free, spontaneous order theory would seem to call for comprehensive reform wherever political institutions still stood in the way of freedom. Hamowy's essays have helped me to understand the Adam Smith paradox. Adam Smith generally propounds natural liberty, often quite ardently, and closely linked natural liberty with his system of justice. Yet, on numerous interventions that Smith should have opposed and that were the status quo in his Scotland, Smith either waffles (e.g., on education) or gives endorsement (e.g., on usury, the option clause, small-denominated notes, paying workers in kind). Hamowy's book helps one to understand that the Scottish circle was a kind of cultural royalty, and that Smith was the king. Smith may have felt that making challenging claims for liberty would not have befitted his cultural position and in the long term would have forsaken the royal air that he enjoyed and cultivated. Further, Hamowy's insight into the larger, Whig spontaneous-order view, suggests that Smith was simply unenthusiastic about any systematic program aiming to reforming policy to fit a simple maxim like the liberty maxim. Maybe Smith's oppositions to libertarian reforms (such as on education) were sincere, maybe some (such as on the financial restrictions) were more diplomatic, because lifting his declared adherence to the liberty maxim from 90 to 97% would have offended the gradualist Whig sensibility, and, again, would have sacrificed the air of cultural royalty. In the later case, maybe Smith figured that he would leave some of the policy battles to future liberal authors. After Bentham smashed Smith on usury restrictions, Smith, it is said, conceded orally to his intimates that Bentham was right, but he did not put such concession into print, nor did he revise his endorsement of usury restrictions in the subsequent editions of The wealth of nations. (By the way, Benthan's critique is a brilliant and inspiring sample of Hayekian criticism of interventionism.) Hamowy often says or implies that the Scots developed a theory of spontaneous order, which had applications both at the level of government itself and at the level of social processes like the market economy and evolution of language. Here, I offer a criticism. Hamowy seems to count as “a theory of spontaneous order” any discussion that maintains that results, especially beneficial social structures, tend to come about without design. Although the Scots maintained that political institutions adapted and improved historically toward structures that were never foreseen, they do not seem to have formulated mechanisms in that realm that would provide a general account of such beneficial results. From reading Hamowy's essays and Smith, I have the impression that the Scots do not have a theory of spontaneous political order like they have a theory of spontaneous economic order. It seems, rather, that they trace the evolution of institutions historically and show spontaneous development, without really formulating general mechanisms that characterize those developments. In treating political institutions, the Scots put forth a doctrine of spontaneous order, but did they provide a theory of spontaneous order? I’m not so sure they did. Of the six essays on Hayek, three are significant criticisms. The criticisms again revolve around the tension between guarding the gradual process of political adaptation and criticizing existing political institutions for not being more libertarian. The first critical essay is Hamowy's famous criticism of Hayek's efforts at defining liberty in The Constitution of Liberty. In that great work of political philosophy, Hayek never came out and defined liberty in the intuitive, classical fashion of Locke and the Scots, rooted in the reciprocal logic of property and consent. In brief, liberty is freedom from others messing with your stuff. Instead, Hayek offered a series of circumlocutions, including ones about “abstract rules,” “general rules,” and being free of the “arbitrary will” of another, all deriving from his emphasis on the rule of law. As I see it, Hayek characterized liberty by reference to some of its important and appealing correlates, but avoided saying what liberty is. Hamowy dissects the various characterizations offered by Hayek, and shows that they do not provide a viable definition of liberty. Hamowy was the first of many to take Hayek to task on this matter. Next, Hamowy criticizes Hayek's model of an ideal constitution, offered in the third volume of Law, legislation, and liberty. In offering formal qualities of law and a structure for law and government, Hayek again resorts to abstract circumlocutions of unknown and dubious content. Hamowy hammers him again for failing to get down to brass tacks: Only by placing unequivocal, substantive limitations on what laws may be enacted would it be possible to control the areas in which the legislature may intervene, and, even then, one would still require a vigilant and suspicious judiciary to ride herd on the legislature. The decisions concerning which areas must be off limits to the legislature can be made only on the basis of a theory of rights, which logically precedes a theory of government. This is a conception that Hayek, for some reason, fails to come to grips with… (p. 235) Hamowy writes that Hayek's whole model of government is “conceived in the mistaken notion that the political mechanism in society can itself be made subject to its own order” (p. 236). Again, Hamowy faults Hayek for not recognizing that within liberal civilization, a presumption of Hayek's conversation, there sits on the tabletop of our cultural living-room what Smith called “the obvious and simple system of natural liberty,” plain and intelligible to common understandings. Hayek should recognize its availability, its independent status, and explicitly use it as brickwork in his notes on a model political constitution. The final critical essay concerns Hayek's tale of the common law. Hayek's idea of spontaneous order is most prominently applied to the complex workings of the economy—“the incredible bread machine”—but also finds application in the evolution of customs, language, law, and science. Hayek was keen to show the viability of capturing a dynamic system of law under the conceptual umbrella of spontaneous order. In making his case, he portrayed the English common law as such a system. Hamowy looks hard at the history and character of English common law, and concludes that Hayek's historic tale fails on two counts: first, its substance was not all that libertarian, and second, its evolution was not all that spontaneous. Hamowy advises us against citing the English common law as an example of spontaneous-order law. Although not stated as such, the underlying theme of the volume is that, when the idea of liberty finds a kind of historical ascendancy, it is tempting for the libertarian to claim some kind of invisible-hand process at work in that ascendancy. But, the institutions within which liberty was ascendant will not be entirely libertarian. They may in some respects be even grossly antilibertarian. Liberty might then be used as an engine of criticism of the status quo. The principle criticizes and proposes to change the very set of institutions from which it draws authority. Hamowy's essays provide insights into this tension. If they have a tendency, it is toward the view that authority ought to flow not from institutional lineage, but rather from responsible argumentation and learning. Hamowy's ideas of liberty and justice are more in keeping with his close friend Murray Rothbard, who saw liberty as an unrelenting challenge to any form of institutionalized coercion. Oddly, not once does Hamowy mention or cite Rothbard. Incidentally, the spirit of unrelenting criticism is something that links Rothbard and Bentham. The collection is not an integrated work, and I have passed over a couple of essays on Hayek that are rather trifling. But, most of the essays are extremely valuable investigations, and illuminate large and important issues in liberal thought.",1

Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The following symposium was inspired by the publication of the distinction of Kohn (2004) between value and exchange as distinct research programs for the organization of economic analysis. The value paradigm characterizes economic observations as equilibrium observations of maximizing action. In contrast, the exchange paradigm characterizes economic observations as processes of development, wherein the world we experience is generated through interaction among those who participate in it. Kohn also notes that many scholars have tried to straddle the two programs through the employment of hybrid theorization, but concludes that this hybrid is indigestible. As Kohn notes, his claim hearkens back to the argument of Buchanan (1964) that the object that economists should study is not well represented by problems of maximization and is better represented by problems of exchange and conflict. The differences in theoretical vision articulated by Buchanan and Kohn are reminiscent of the differences in vision articulated by Léon Walras and Carl Menger. What Kohn describes as the value paradigm was given cogent articulation by Walras, and the subsequent post-Walrasian development offered a theoretical window through which all economic phenomena were envisioned as equilibrium states with maximizing agents. In sharp contrast to Walras, Menger examined economic phenomena through a different window through which the observations were of on-going processes of development and where the individual agents (or at least a good number of them) were adventuresome explorers in combinatorial space. The Walrasian and Mengerian visions of economic phenomena point in opposite directions, much as do the two parabolas X
2 and −X
2 once you get away from their neighborhood of common origin. These divergent directions, moreover, were recognized by Menger even if not, perhaps, by Walras. In one letter to Walras, where Menger responded to Walras’s argument that they were kindred spirits analytically speaking, Menger stated: “There is indeed a resemblance between us. There is an analogy of concepts on certain points but not on the deeper questions.”Footnote 1 The deeper questions to which Menger referred entail the use of two distinct windows for conceptualizing the object that economists examine.",17

Axtell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Mathematical economics has been with us for something like a couple of generations, the vagaries of dating intellectual history being what they are. While the early pioneers of the approach were often quick to circumscribe the applicability of the assumptions they found necessary to make for analytical tractability, today such caveats are less commonly noted in print, although no less necessary for satisfactory interpretation of results (Mirowski 1989, 2001). Whether this norm of (non-)exposition is simply an efficiency standard or rather a behavioral adaptation to avoid dealing with unpalatable falsehoods is, for present purposes, immaterial. What I am interested in exposing is the microstructure of these assumptions and their inter-relation—their ecological character, as it were. Consider the assumption of rationality. It is a standard postulate of our field that agents can figure out—whether through induction, deduction, or in combination—the future of their world, at least on average. They then act to give themselves maximum welfare in that world, or so goes the common specification of behavior. This stipulation manifests itself in a variety of ways, from “no arbitrage” conditions to “profit maximization” assertions to claims that real people do not throw money away. For a span of time only briefly shorter than its existence, this notion of rationality has been the focus of caustic, even withering criticism (Simon 1957; Kirman 1993; Simon 1997a, b, c). The logical arguments used against it include the obviously bounded capacity of humans to figure out how to best behave (Simon 1978), the intrinsic (e.g., computational) difficulties associated with certain classes of computation (Papadimitriou and Yannakakis 1994), and the lack of procedural or algorithmic bases for the assumed rational behavior (Simon 1976). Empirically, we have today very strong and accumulating evidence for the systematic ways that human behavior departs from rationality requirements in a large number of experimental conditions. Indeed, while it was conventional early on to term these departures from rationality “anomalies,” the phenomena are now so well-entrenched empirically, so reproducible in distinct laboratory settings, and so robust across economic environments, that what seems genuinely anomalous is the idea that human behavior could ever even approach true rationality. Furthermore, while it could be the case that the assumption of rational behavior is credible for a small subset of people, it is certainly the case that not all agents are equally rational, as is implicit in conventional theoretical models. Assumptions about agent heterogeneity span the spectrum in economic theory, from arbitrarily heterogeneous agents in general equilibrium theory to representative (and thus essentially homogeneous) agents in macroeconomics. The norm in many economic models is to have some finite number of agent types, although even this finiteness restriction is sometimes relaxed in game theory. The foibles of representative agents are by now well-known (Kirman 1992), but do not seem to have much discouraged their use. This is especially strange because it is the differences between people that lead them to “...truck, barter and exchange...” in Adam Smith’s ([1776] 1976) now well-known phrase. If people were identical there would be little reason for them to interact in the first place. A peculiar feature of neoclassical economic models is that agents do not directly interact with one another, but rather with abstract economic objects like price vectors and aggregate economic statistics (e.g., the unemployment rate). This lack of interaction has been noted by various authors (Kirman 1997), and its significance is increasingly well understood. Indeed, there are important streams of economic research today that try to relax this assumption, but doing so can necessitate the relaxation of agent homogeneity and rationality assumptions mentioned above. Thus, this is a delicate business and one must proceed with great caution. Finally, perhaps the core conviction of neoclassical oriented economists has to do with agent-level equilibrium. While some recognize that equilibrium is rarely realized or even unrealizable, and serves instead simply as a kind of ideal state, most conventional work in microeconomics and game theory today pursues agent-level equilibria as a matter of course. That is, when models are articulated, the only configurations of them that are deemed to be of interest are fixed-point equilibria at the level of individual decisions (e.g., Walrasian equilibria, Nash equilibria). Because of micro-equilibrium stipulations, an ancillary assumption is that all fluctuations in an economy are exogenous, which results in the awkward situation of economists usually seeking the basis for economic change in non-economic phenomena. At the very least this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, if not a downright dereliction of duty—why cannot economic dynamics be produced by the economy itself? This set of assumptions—agent rationality and homogeneity, non-interactiveness and equilibrium—constitute what might be called the neoclassical sweet spot—a group of interlocking and mutually reinforcing specifications for which relaxation of any one can lead to the impetus, if not the absolute necessity, to relax others. For instance, invocation of bounded rationality naturally leads to heterogeneous agents, as there is one way to be rational but many ways to depart from rationality. Similarly direct interactions—as soon as one permits local interactions between neighbors, say, there is no easy way for agents to be globally rational, and so their actions are inherently out of (global) equilibrium. In this fashion we see that the neoclassical sweet spot is subject to unraveling once any of its primary stipulations are varied. It is an old saw that in economics “it takes a theory to beat a theory,” an example of which is the pervasiveness of rationality specifications in today’s journals despite the critiques by proponents of bounded rationality who, unfortunately, have no (simple) theory to stand in its place. However, the existence of this de facto meta-rule of economic methodology is also evidence of the weak empirical grounding of economic theory, for one can scarcely imagine such an assumption surviving in a strongly empirical discipline. For example, in chemistry or physics what would be the status of a theory that has been proven empirically incorrect, even if no substitute were available? Up until recently there has been no alternative to the neoclassical “sweet spot,” but all this has changed significantly in the past decade, driven in part by advances in experimental methods and computational hardware and software. After further discussion of the neoclassical position below, and ultimately arguing that it is a brittle, fragile position, unstable to certain variations, I describe how new forms of computational models in economics may provide the basis for a methodology to take economics beyond mere mathematical expression and deductive inference. I believe that progress on the “exchange paradigm” agenda has little to do with Wolfram’s New Kind of Science and a lot to do with the importation of multi-agent systems computational techniques and tools into economics for purposes of model building. Some early results with such models constitute the several examples described in the body of the paper. I conclude by asking whether it is realistic for any economic principles of great generality to exist in a world where the neoclassical assumptions no longer hold and, if not, does it matter?",62
20.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,27 March 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-007-0017-1,Exchange and evolution,September 2007,Jason Potts,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Kohn (2004, p. 305) argues that the Hicks–Samuelson research program—which he calls the value paradigm—“is in trouble”. It has “promoted a kind of sterile armchair theorizing” and a “significant narrowing of theoretical agenda”. It has little to say about the major questions of economics and only oblique policy relevance and modern econometrics is now largely atheoretical with little connection to the value paradigm. However, this “theoretical impasse” has been met, Kohn argues, with the emergence of a new research program based about transactions, institutions, market processes, and the economics of information, which he calls the exchange paradigm. The exchange paradigm offers a way forward by focusing on the economic process as an open system, and this provides crucial insight into processes of growth and development, market processes, and economic coordination. This refocus of theory on processes leads to a different conception of the role of institutions in coordination and different normative evaluations of government intervention and the proper role and scope of economic policy. The exchange paradigm thus offers a renewed focus on economic history and engagement with the empirical details of how institutions work as reasserted through an “appreciative” style of theorizing. The value paradigm–exchange paradigm distinction is an enormously useful demarcation to make between the research program focused about closed system allocation and control problems vs the new research program focused about open system processes of coordination and ongoing endogenous change. However, while Kohn makes a lucid case for the difference between the two paradigms, and for the efficacy of the exchange paradigm, it remains a somewhat loose and motley entity: “a growing body of work” with “important common themes”, “a different way of thinking about the economy” (Kohn 2004, p. 307). He associates it with a broad camp of “new institutional economics, transaction cost economics, Austrian economics, public choice theory, law and economics, and the economics of information”, yet, its methodological precepts and analytic foundations are distinctly those of Austrian economics and the concept of exchange as an ongoing open process. Kohn, however, offers no systematic outline of the analytic foundations of the exchange paradigm beyond appeal to the inherent coherence of the Austrian program augmented with a series of methodological imperatives relating to growth, coordination, institutions, and intervention. This is certainly a positive step in guiding us beyond the impasse, yet I contend that it does not go far enough. Instead, I propose that the value and exchange paradigms can be further abstracted into a more general framework of generic and operant analysis derived from evolutionary economics (Dopfer and Potts 2007). The motive for this analytic reconception is to connect the central concepts of the exchange paradigm (e.g., opportunity, market processes, institutions, coordination) to the analytic building blocks of evolutionary economics in the generic concepts of rules, carriers, systems, and processes. Coordination is a generic process and so the exchange paradigm, I shall argue, is more cogently understood from the perspective of the “generic paradigm”.",5
20.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,07 April 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-007-0015-3,Methodological interactionism: Theory and application to the firm and to the building of trust,September 2007,Bart Nooteboom,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper I employ a perspective of “embodied cognition” to develop a framework of “methodological interactionism” that transcends the methodological individualism of (most) economics, which yields under-socialization, and the methodological collectivism of (some) sociology, which yields over-socialization. Sociology is relevant in economic analysis because it is geared to look at conduct as embedded in social structures in a way that economics is not. The individual is constructed individually, but in interaction with others. This opens up a perspective for an integration of elements from economics, sociology, and social psychology, in a new, unified social science. The approach builds upon processes of exchange, and thereby connects with a Mengerian perspective in economics. It accounts for diversity of perception and knowledge, and thereby connects with a Hayekian view of distributed knowledge. In sociology, it connects with the symbolic interactionism of G.H. Mead. It also connects with the “structure-agency” problem. In economic systems, on the level of organizations and on the higher level of economic systems, institutional arrangements (organizations) and institutional environments (wider institutions), which constitute structure, enable and constrain the activities that fall within their compass, but those activities (agency) feed back to reconstruct those institutions. This is the problem of “structuration” in sociology (Giddens 1984; Archer 1995). The key idea here is that people conduct perception, interpretation, understanding, preference formation, and value judgments on the basis of mental categories that they construct in interaction with others. As they construct such categories, and do so along their life trajectories, they develop and maintain individuality, so that knowledge is various and distributed (Hayek) and “different people think different things” (Lachmann 1978). There is “embodied realism” (Lakoff and Johnson 1999) in the sense that mental structures are constructed from experience in the world. Reality forms a “material cause” of cognition. Different people see the world differently to the extent that they have developed in different social and physical surroundings and have not interacted with each other. This yields what I call “cognitive distance” (Nooteboom 1992, 1999). A possible misunderstanding of terminology should be eliminated from the start. In this paper, the terms “knowledge” and “cognition” have a wide meaning, going beyond rational calculation. They denote a broad range of mental activity, including proprioception (sense of touch and grasp), kinesthetics (sense of movement), perception, sense making, categorization, inference, value judgments, feelings, and emotions. Following others, and in line with the perspective of embodied cognition, I see cognition and emotion (such as fear, suspicion), and body and mind, as closely linked (Merleau-Ponty 1942, 1964; Damasio 1995, 2003; Nussbaum 2001). The perspective of embodied realism provides the basis for a constructivist, interactionist theory of knowledge and meaning that does not necessarily wind up in radical postmodern relativism. According to the latter, the social “constructionist” notion of knowledge entails that as knowledge is constructed, rather than objectively given, any knowledge is a matter of opinion, and any opinion is as good as any other. This would lead to a breakdown of critical debate, and a surrender of argument to the exercise of power. Embodied realism saves us from such radical relativism in two ways. First, our cognitive construction builds on bodily functions developed in a shared evolution, and possibly, also on psychological mechanisms inherited from evolution, as argued in evolutionary psychology (Barkow et al. 1992). Second, by assumption, we share the physical and social world on the basis of which we conduct cognitive construction. That constitutes a reality that is embodied (Lakoff and Johnson 1999). As a result of shared psychological mechanisms of cognitive construction and a shared world from which such construction takes place, there is a basic structural similarity of cognition between people. This provides a basis for debate. Indeed, precisely because one cannot “climb down from one’s mind” to assess whether one’s knowledge is properly “hooked on to the world”, the variety of perception and understanding offered by other people is the only source one has for correcting one’s errors. The paper proceeds as follows. First, I summarize the conceptual roots of the perspective of embodied cognition, in cognitive science. Second, I discuss a corresponding theory of meaning. Third, I apply this perspective for the summary of a cognitive theory of the firm developed in Nooteboom (2006a). Third, I apply and further develop the perspective, using insights from social psychology, in an analysis of the process by which trust gets built or broken down in interaction between people, on the basis of “relational signaling”.",5

A plea for theorising by inclusion,September 2007,Erik S. Reinert,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Meir Kohn’s thoughtful and thought-provoking essay on the impasse of mainstream economic theory – in particular, the fact that ‘on the great issues of today, it has been virtually silent’ (Kohn 2004, p 306) – highlights the need for alternative approaches. Kohn himself identifies two alternative paradigms, one based on ‘value’ (Walrasian) and one based on ‘exchange’ (Mengerian). This paper adds to the discussion by introducing a third category – which very well may be considered a version of the Mengerian one – a paradigm based on ‘production’. This paradigm emphasises the Menger–Schumpeter line of Austrian thought, while at the same time retaining key features of the German economics tradition as it relates to the understanding of uneven economic development (Reinert 2005a). I have previously argued that the Menger–Schumpeter line of Austrian thought also retained key features of traditional German economics, in particular the core importance of context-specificity and history (Reinert 2005b). This paper is, then, an attempt to reconcile the two sides of the late 19th century Methodenstreit, in particular, as the two sides of this debate coincide in sharp contrast to the Walrasian paradigm and to the Hicks–Samuelson research programme. This, I feel, is also very much in the spirit of Schumpeter’s first book (Schumpeter 1908); the one which still has no English translation. This approach would create an Austro–German evolutionary economic approach to the problems of Third World development, based on production rather than on value or exchange. Here, the clues to the problems of economic development would be found by studying differences in the structures and systems of production. I find the Austro–German label particularly fitting also because of the solid German roots – in Werner Sombart and Friedrich Nietzsche – of Schumpeter’s production-based creative destruction so much in vogue today (Reinert and Reinert 2006). I will attempt to show that this approach can be compatible with, and enriched by, insights and elements from pre-Smithian economics, from the history of economic policy, and from classical development economics (post-World War II). This is particularly important when policy recommendations are introduced into new contexts where institutions and circumstances that can be taken for granted in the First World are not necessarily present. The paper argues that a dynamic theory of economic change requires that all neo-classical assumptions be relaxed at the same time, while re-introducing the many factors that used to be recognised long ago as contributing to the unevenness of economic development. Sometimes, new approaches are stifled by the mainstream’s ability to usurp and absorb them, while at the same time neutralising their most novel aspects. Keynesian economics was one example of this. ‘New institutional economics’ is another. This approach became neo-classical economics with some static institutions (mainly property rights) added, which is a very different type of theory from a much broader ‘old’ institutional school tracing its roots back to Thorstein VeblenFootnote 1. As I see it, there is presently a risk of a similar development within evolutionary economics that a ‘new’ evolutionary theory is created consisting essentially of standard economics with an added ‘Schumpeterian’ variable. This risk of blending neo-classical and evolutionary elements is evident today in the European Union. The Lisbon Strategy – in its conception, an evolutionary theory – is increasingly becoming a Schumpeterian icing on a solidly neo-classical cake. The same danger is present when applying evolutionary theories in the Third World, where – in its simplest form – we risk that ‘evolutionary economics’ is created by substituting ‘investment’ for ‘innovation’ in an otherwise standard neo-classical approach. I suggest here going in another direction: that a series of old insights – particularly as these are brought together systemically – are both useful and necessary to complement present approaches. As I see it, by bringing in underlying technological elements, evolutionary economics may sometimes even reinforce old arguments and explain why both mercantilists and classical development economists were often right. This will be illustrated by a discussion by Schumpeter’s student Hans Singer’s seminal article (Singer 1950) below. This paper attempts to map the most important of these factors which, alone and cumulatively, add to the complexities of Austro–German development economics.",

On the one hand, the field is one of those—along with public choice and Austrian economics—in which the exchange paradigm rules (Kohn 2004, p. 307). In effect, neo-classical economics—constrained by the conceptual limits of the value paradigm—is usually viewed as a-institutional but also as unable to take seriously institutions into account; the methodology neo-classical utilizes is an obstacle to an understanding of institutions (Coase 2005). Therefore, an analysis that focuses the impact of (legal) institutions on activities clearly represents an attempt to develop theories that overcome the limits of the value paradigm. However, on the other hand, “law and economics” developed and its importance undeniably grew, among economists and jurists as well, but as an “economic analysis of law”. In other words, “law and economics” developed within the very limits of the neo-classical assumptions of the value paradigm. Thus, one of the most important and famous promoter of an economic analysis of law, Richard Posner, also happens to be considered by Kohn as a representative of the value paradigm: for Posner, “economic theory and the value paradigm are the same” (Kohn 2004, p. 334). Hence, an interrogation arises: how could a field be, at the same time, the locus of the emergence of a “different way of thinking about the economy” (Kohn 2004, p. 307) and an instance of a successful application of the value paradigm, or how the conceptual framework of neo-classical economics can be at the same time an obstacle (to the understanding that and how rules and institutions are important) and a means (for a better understanding of why rules and institutions are important)? An answer is that so different approaches can indeed exist because they rest on different conceptual frameworks, in other words, and this corresponds to what Richard Wagner suggests in his introduction, “law and economics” and the “economic analysis of law”, which examines the same “object”—legal phenomena and matters—through different conceptual lenses or “windows”. These approaches use different tools and assumptions to analyze the same object. This is how we interpret what Coase, for instance, argued when he stated that As I see it, the subject is divided in two parts. One is … the use of economics to analyse the law, the economics analysis of law. Now an economist really isn’t much interested in this part of law and economics—at least this economist isn’t me. I am interested in the working of the economic system … I am interested in the effect that the working of the legal system has on the working of the economic system (in Epstein et al. 1997, p. 1138; see also, e.g., Coase 1996). Undoubtedly, the use of distinct conceptual frameworks is important to understand why there are differences between distinct approaches in “law and economics”. But, and this is the argument we propose, there is another explanation to the existence of two approaches and to the ensuing differences between them. They use different tools because they do not retain the same definition of economics, and then, this is one important consequence we would like to emphasize, they do not analyze at the same object. More precisely, the exchange and value paradigm do not adopt the same definition of legal rules because they do not use the same definition of economics. To illustrate this twofold argument, we compare the perspectives that the two outstanding representatives of each paradigm, Buchanan and Posner, adopt on law and economics. We, thus, show that the reason of the differences between their respective positions comes, rather than from the differences between their conceptual frameworks (exchange and value), from the fact that they use different definitions of economics (respectively, by subject matter and by method). It then appears that, first, in Buchanan’s views, the application of the exchange paradigm implies limitations as to what economists can legitimately analyze as “law and economics”. Then, legal rules, defined as the product of exchange activities, do not belong to the subject matter of the discipline. By contrast, Posner no longer reasons in terms of subject matter but defines economics as a set of tools. The use of a different conceptual framework also entails a transformation in what Posner proposes to study: rules are transformed into objects that lawyers produce and economists can analyze; in other words, economists can analyze legal rules because they are transformed into objects. In other words, a move from the exchange to the value paradigm in “law and economics” implies a change in the law and legal rules.",8

The best work in the last 30 years has emphasized the importance of examining the social and economic institutions that underlie the patterns of economic outcomes we observe and understanding the way in which those institutions continue to change. As distinct from standard neoclassical economics (with which it shares much in common), recent work in Austrian economics has given special attention to decision making in conditions of real-word uncertainty (radical, genuine, as opposed to parametric, uncertainty). Starting with individuals who form expectations in particular institutional environments, informed by their own particular knowledge base, Austrian approaches recognize that expectations and the plans and valuations to which they lead may differ among individuals, giving rise to a situation of “plan disequilibrium.” The market process approach associated with the Austrian school allows for imperfect information, structural uncertainty, and disequilibrium outcomes. This approach has gained relevance lately because of the variety, extent, and rapidity of the social changes that have occurred and are still occurring. There is generally a growing recognition in economics of the need to include and account for changes in the underlying institutions within which transactions of various types occur.Footnote 1 However, one institution that plays a central role in the lives of economic actors has yet to be subject to an analysis along these lines. There has not yet been a fundamentally Austrian/market process analysis of the causes and effects of the far-reaching changes in the family as a social institution.Footnote 2 This paper offers a partial remedy for that gap.",2

Footnote 1. It is one of the fundamental constraints that limit extensively the political possibilities for controlling the economic situation as well as social changes. To a final extent, it accounts for the gap between the opportunities for trade available in the society and the opportunities perceived by actors. This inevitable gap is caused by a phenomenon involving the dispersion of knowledge between individuals who are considered to be subjective, which, thus, poses the problem of the inter-individual coordination of actions. However, the concept of ignorance allows each actor to be a part of open-ended environments, within which, the opportunities to be discovered are, in principle, endless. This article aims to show that this concept of ignorance can be applied not only to the potential interactions and exchanges with others in society but also to the infra-individual environment. The idea that we shall defend here is that an individual is not only in a situation of ignorance about the other actors (external ignorance) but also about himself. In other words, he does not perceive all the opportunities for satisfaction that are available within his own subjective environment. This gap between the infra-individual opportunities perceived by an actor and those which he disposes of entirely can be defined as an internal constraint of ignorance, a self-ignorance. This constraint raises, in turn, the question of infra-individual coordination, i.e., the capacity of an actor to mirror the structure of his internal knowledge with the architecture of his own subjective environment. We will then examine how certain analytical tools used by the Austrians to overcome the difficulty of the inter-individual coordination of actions (“external” coordination) enable us to deal with the problem of infra-individual coordination (“internal” coordination). More precisely, we will show that the development of the theme of the entrepreneur can provide insight into the analysis of how the individual mind works. The article is presented as follows: in the first section (Section 1), we will put forward the determinants of the concept of internal ignorance, highlighting the fact that their origins can be found in the already-established Austrian analytical corpus; in the second section (Section 2), we shall define the implications and stakes of this self-ignorance in terms of infra-individual coordination; the third section (Section 3) presents the attitudes and mental conditions that are likely to solve this problem of coordination; and in the last section (Section 4), we will illustrate the limitations of a process of reducing internal ignorance.",10

Unlike most advocates of democracy, however, he denies that democracy causes better policies than dictatorship. On Mises’ view, public opinion determines policy in democracies and dictatorships alike.Footnote 1 As he explains in Theory and History: A statesman can succeed only insofar as his plans are adjusted to the climate of opinion of his time, that is to the ideas that have got hold of his fellows’ minds. He can become a leader only if he is prepared to guide people along the paths they want to walk and toward the goal they want to attain. A statesman who antagonizes public opinion is doomed to failure. No matter whether he is an autocrat or an officer of a democracy, the politician must give the people what they wish to get, very much as a businessman must supply the customers with the things they wish to acquire (1985a: 187). The root cause of bad policies is not, therefore, the form of government but the quality of public opinion. The advantage of democracy over dictatorship, for Mises, is simply that it reaches the inevitable political outcome with minimal bloodshed: Civil war and revolution are the means by which the discontented majorities overthrow rulers and methods of government which do not suit them. For the sake of domestic peace liberalism aims at democratic government. Democracy is therefore not a revolutionary institution. On the contrary, it is the very means of preventing revolutions and civil wars. It provides a method for the peaceful adjustment of government to the will of the majority (1998a: 150). One could even say that Mises sees democracy much as John Stuart Mill sees money: “It is a machine for doing quickly and commodiously, what would be done, though less quickly and commodiously, without it…” (Mill 2006: 506). The upshot, explored at length by Mises’ student Murray Rothbard, is that political thinkers have to explain why every government, even the most despotic, is popular—a problem that Rothbard dubs “the mystery of civil obedience” (de la Boetie 1975: 13). When governments adopt policies they disapprove of, many thinkers argue that public opinion has been ignored. Mises will have none of this. Not just Roosevelt but Hitler himself enjoyed popular support: It is a fact that the policy of the New Deal has been supported by the voters. Nor is there any doubt that this policy will be entirely abandoned if the voters withdraw their favor from it. The United States is still a democracy. The Constitution is still intact. Elections are still free. The voters do not cast their ballot under duress. It is therefore not correct to say that the bureaucratic system carried its victory by unconstitutional and undemocratic methods (1983a: 5). It is probable that today about 80 per cent of all German-speaking Europeans are Nazis. If we leave out the Jews, the Austrians, and the German-speaking Swiss, we might say that more than 90 per cent of the Germans support Hitler’s fight for world hegemony (1985b: 243–244). For political theorists who assume that voters are rational, Mises’ position is hard to accept. Many dictators choose policies that lead to poverty and war. How could such policies be popular? Mises’ answer is that people suffer from systematically biased beliefs about economics, foreign policy, and more (Caplan and Stringham 2005). They mistakenly believe that counter-productive policies are the path to prosperity: Democracy guarantees a system of government in accordance with the wishes and plans of the majority. But it cannot prevent majorities from falling victim to erroneous ideas and from adopting inappropriate policies which not only fail to realize the ends aimed at but result in disaster (1998a, p.193). In fact, Mises maintains that dictatorship itself is often popular. Many are willing to ignore common sense and put their faith in a charismatic dictator: It cannot be denied that dictatorship, interventionism, and socialism are extremely popular today. No argument of logic can weaken this popularity (1998b: 85). But what precisely is the mechanism that, holding public opinion constant, leads democracy and dictatorship to converge on equivalent policies? Does Mises recognize any loopholes in what we may call his Democracy–Dictatorship Equivalence Theorem? More importantly, is his analysis correct? Is it really true that—collateral damage aside—we should not expect replacing dictatorship with democracy to lead to systematic changes in policy? In an earlier paper (Caplan and Stringham 2005), my co-author Edward Stringham and I argued that Mises was a political economist ahead of his time, whose writings offer promising directions for new research. The current paper pursues one of these directions. It explores Mises’ view that the threat of revolution forces dictators to choose the same policies that would have prevailed under democracy. It then argues that Mises overlooked several compelling objections to his account. Despite these weaknesses, however, Mises’ conclusion is better than his arguments. Although dictators are unlikely to be overthrown for defying public opinion, there are several alternative mechanisms that help make dictators’ policies popular.",1
21.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,27 November 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-007-0027-z,The complex role of Karl Menger in the Viennese economic theory,March 2008,Giandomenica Becchio,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Menger described the period in Vienna from 1927 up to 1938 in his Reminiscences, published posthumously in 1994. Their drafts are conserved in the archive of Perkins Library, Duke University, Durham (North Carolina, USA). On reading these drafts, one finds that many parts of the original text are still unpublished. The reason for the book’s incompleteness is Menger’s precarious health while he was working on it.Footnote 1 These unpublished chapters are of great interest because they describe the methodological and epistemological break between Karl Menger’s Kolloquium and the universalistic and encyclopaedic project pursued by the Wiener Kreis during the 1930s.Footnote 2
 During the 1920s, the philosophical atmosphere in Vienna was influenced by the fact—strongly stressed by Karl Menger—that “Austrians never contributed to the German type of metaphysics that culminated in Fichte, Schelling and Hegel” (Menger 1994 p. 18). Austrian philosophy was oriented in discussions around epistemology and logics: “the great thinkers born in the Austrian empire, Bolzano and Mach, used to philosophise along scientific lines” (Menger 1994 p. 18). The rejection of both idealism and neokantism culminated in the raising of the new empiricism. According to Menger’s Reminiscences (Menger 1994) between the 1920s and the mid-1930s, many circles developed in Vienna: they were groups of discussion not necessarily linked to academic world. Among them the socialist groups, the psychoanalytic circles, the literary groups and the philosophical circles (some oriented to historicism, others to existentialism, where the “Kierkegaard renaissance” started). Which was the place of economics in such a context? As Oskar Morgenstern recalled—during a seminar at the New York University held with Fritz Machlup (April 1975)—the Viennese locations in the 1930s in which economics was studied were the University, the Institute of Business Cycle—leaded by Ludwig von Mises—the group around the Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie, and some circles such as the Schilck’s one (the famous Wiener Kreis) and the Mathematische Kolloquium. The origin of the Wiener Kreis lies in the ‘Philosophical Society’ which, as early as 1907, under the influence of Ernst Mach and Ludwig Boltzmann, devoted itself to the study of the crisis of mechanicism and positivist scientism and to clarify the nature of scientific theories. This attitude was in complete antithesis to the philosophical attitude prevalent in German-speaking world in those years, which was rife with neo-Kantism and idealism. The Wiener Kreis was founded in 1922 as a philosophical circle by the physicist Moritz Schlick, who organised meetings every Thursday evening to discuss philosophy and the natural and social sciences, to which the members endeavoured to apply the neoempiricist paradigm (or logical empiricism). It was based on two levels of truth: the empirical ones (linked to mere facts) and the logical ones (able to coordinate data). Logical empiricism leaves out every sentence not verifiable either logically or empirically: all old philosophy must be replaced by the new scientific language. The epistemological model of this new empiricism was set out in Schlick’s Theory of Knowledge (1918), in which he distinguished between kennen (mere intuitions in the stream of sensations) and erkennen (concepts linked to symbols to produce scientific knowledge). These concepts must always be verified: not, however, by correlating them with mere perceptive data, but by finding a tool able to remove heterogeneity between empirical observation and logical elaboration. Logical verificationism is possible by using mathematics in any analytical discourse. Scientists working in numerous disciplines joined the Wiener Kreis. Hans Hahn and Kurt Reidmeister were mathematicians: the former arrived in Vienna from Prague in 1923, to take up the chair of philosophy of science (previously occupied by Mach and Bolzmann). Otto Neurath was interested in mathematics, economics and sociology. Victor Kraft was a historian and Felix Kaufmann a lawyer. In 1926, the philosopher Rudolph Carnap joined the group and introduced the Wittgenstein’s Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s statement that “everything that can be said, can be said clearly” (T 4.116) became the Kreis’s intellectual directive: it expressed not only an a-metaphysical but also an anti-metaphysical point of view. After the introduction of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, any form of realism and psychologism was refused in the Wiener Kreis: philosophy must free any concept from semantic inaccuracy; it must definitely become a philosophy of language and its duty will be to discover new propositions (laws or theorems). In 1929, Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung: Der Wiener Kreis was printed and signed by Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath and Rudoph Carnap (Hahn et al. 1929).Footnote 3 This was regarded as the Kreis’s manifesto. The Manifesto was dedicated to Moritz Schlick “as token of gratitude and joy at his remaining in Vienna” (Neurath 1973, p. 299): at the beginning of 1929, he was in fact invited to Bonn, but “after some vacillation”, he declined the invitation. As it is written in its Preface: “for the first time it became clear to him [Schlick] and us that there is such a thing as the ‘Vienna Circle’ of the scientific conception of the world, which goes on developing this mode of thought in a collaborative effort” (Neurath 1973, p. 299). Nevertheless, Schlick did not participate to its elaboration because he was spending a visiting professorship at Stanford University from where he returned at the end of October 1929, while the Manifesto was in fact published in September 1929 on the occasion of the Prague conference on “the Gnoseology of Exact Sciences”. According to Philip Frank, the expression “wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung” (i.e. a particular scientific conception of the world) was used instead of “Weltanschaung”, a term with excessively metaphysical connotations. This scientific world conception was not a particular philosophy, but “a basic attitude [whose] goal [was] unified science. The endeavour is to link and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science” (Neurath 1973, p. 306). The Manifesto stated the intention of the Viennese scientists to extend the Kreis’s project to the entire scientific community, and then to society as a whole, the purpose being to free scientific and common knowledge from metaphysics, and to replace old materialism with modern empiricism. This desire for openness became evident in the so-called ‘internationalisation’ of the Kreis during the 1930s, when its activities focused on the organisation of international congresses (Könisberg 1930; Prague 1934; Paris 1935; Copenhagen 1936; Paris 1937; Cambridge, Mass 1938; Harvard 1939) to promote its project for an International Encyclopaedia of Unified Science, which was finally presented at the “First Congress for the Unity of Science” held in Paris (1935). The first volume of the Encyclopaedia was published in 1938, and it was, according to Neurath, the natural development of the Manifesto’s programme. This universalistic approach able to unify all the empirical sciences from a methodological point of view by the use of rigorous language (so-called physicalism), was pursued by the Kreis during the period of its international acme (Stadler 2001). In 1927 Karl Menger returned to Vienna (where he had been born and where he had studied physics and mathematics) on invitation by Hans Hahn, his old friend and mentor, (Menger 1994). From 1924 to 1927 he had worked in Amsterdam as Brouwer’s assistant. Disappointed by Brouwer’s intuitionism, he came back to Vienna, where he was appointed professor of geometry and took over the chair previously occupied by Kurt Reidmeister (who had moved to Prague). He joined the Kreis on invitation by Schlick and Carnap, who were very interested in his studies of curve theory. In 1928, Menger organised his Mathematische Kolloquium, in collaboration with the Warsaw School: these were informal meetings held in the evenings with some of his students and colleagues, among them Kurt Gödel and Abraham Wald. Many foreign visitors attended Menger’s seminars as well, for instance, John von Neumann. Oskar Morgenstern recalled some of them: Knight, Ohlin, Kaldor, Robbins, Marget, Perroux, Viner, Balogh, Schneider, Lange, Zeuthen, Robertson, Anderson, Nurske, Robinson, Alan and Paul Sweezy, Graham.Footnote 4
 In 1931 Menger became the editor of Ergebnisse eines Mathematische Kolloquium (I series, Vienna, 1931–1937),Footnote 5 in which papers given at the Kolloquium’s meetings were published. The Mathematische Kolloquium was the natural place for Menger’s thought to develop. Mathematical inquiries were not its only concern: in 1935, Menger wrote a paper in Italian in which he explained the Kolloquium’s principal interests. It discussed geometry, mathematics and logics, but the social sciences, especially economics and ethics, soon became themes of great interest to it. Menger wrote: “in this Kolloquium, beyond studying the recent developments of geometry and logics, we are interested in the new applications of exact sciences to sociological problems” and in a note he added: “for example on the existence and unity of solutions for production equations in mathematical economics, see Schlesinger-Wald, Ergebnisse 6, p. 10”, [Menger 1935a, b, p. 327 (my translation)].Footnote 6 As Menger (1979, p.2) said, the aim of his researches, all long his life, was to find a “theory of the application of mathematics to science”, and among these sciences, he included economics. In the meantime, many member of Kreis had left Austria after Dolfuss’s assassination; as Menger wrote: “in 1934 Schlick, Waismann (at that time both completely under Wittgenstein’s spell) and Kraft were the only members of the original Circle left in Vienna” (Menger 1974, p. 114). Nazi domination definitively destroyed freedom in Austria and all the Viennese intellectual movements.",6

Barkley Rosser Jr.,Marina V. Rosser,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"In an address to the International Economic Association in August 1992, 8 months after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the then Premier of Russia (and leading economic reformer), Yegor Gaidar, declared, “Henceforth books on comparative economic systems will be found on the shelves dealing with economic development” (Rosser and Rosser, 2004, p. 575). This remark reflected the reality that the collapse of the socialist bloc associated with that now defunct nation largely ended as a serious study of the traditional comparison between capitalism and socialism that was the central topic of old comparative economics.Footnote 1 However, while development economics involves study of how different economic systems perform in the context of poorer nations’ growing and developing, the study of how economies vary from each other has continued regarding the higher-income nations as well. Even if (almost) all of the world is market capitalist of some sort or other now, there remain substantial systemic differences along a variety of dimensions between economies that seem to relate to their economic performance in a variety of ways. This has led to the idea that different nations may have different appropriate institutions. The study of what constitutes appropriate institutions for different societies has led to the emergence of a new comparative economics. Neologization of this term and advocacy of this approach can be found in Djankov et al. (2003), although it has been developing for some time and can be argued to be a new formalization of the new institutional economics of Coase (1937), Williamson (1975), and North (1981) at the societal level rather than at the firm level. Among those supporting this approach have been Boettke et al. (2005), even though its argument that increases in “dictatorship” may be necessary in some societies if there is too much disorder can be argued to go against Austrian perspectives. Whereas the old institutional economics of Veblen (1898) and Commons (1931) emphasized the evolution of an intertwined set of social, cultural, political, and legal structures, the new institutional economics argues that such evolution involves some form of optimization. For firms this optimization is the minimization of transactions costs as firms define the boundaries of their zones of control and action. For the particular new institutional version of the new comparative economics, it is minimization of general social costs of disorder and dictatorship that should determine the appropriate set of institutions for a particular society, even as a society may not achieve such an optimum, especially in situations of colonialism where another nation may “transport” inappropriate institutions to the colony that impede its eventual development. While recognizing that there are a variety of institutions involved in this potential optimization, Djankov et al. attempt to create order out of the stew of different kinds of institutional frameworks by imposing a new overarching framework to replace that of market capitalism versus command socialism.Footnote 2 This framework is embodied in the idea of the institutional possibilities frontier (IPF),Footnote 3 which varies from disorder to dictatorship, arguably a more generalized replacement for the older tradeoff. Whether one is talking about legal frameworks, methods of socially controlling businesses, or other issues, possible institutional solutions are arrayed along this IPF, whose position is determined by social, cultural, and other factors, with closer-in IPFs supposedly reflecting lower general social costs of institutions and presumably arising from greater levels of civic capital. Given its shape there will presumably be some locus on this tradeoff for the various institutions that will minimize social costs. This paper will consider this argument in more detail and the broader argument for a new comparative economics. We will find some problems with certain specifics of the arguments made by Djankov et al. and will question more broadly whether their presentation of an IPF is really the best way to proceed in formulating a new comparative economics. However, we agree with Djankov et al. as well as Boettke et al. that there is a need for a new comparative economics, and that this will involve a broader analysis of what constitutes appropriate institutions for specific societies. We shall note some other factors that should be considered in this analysis, but with the breakdown of a central ordering mechanism, this may move our recommended approach somewhat more in the direction of the old rather than the new institutional economics in spirit.",9

As Boettke et al. (2005) have noted, for much of the twentieth century political economy was focused on the economic function of prices and the ability of planned economies to operate in the absence of market prices. As this debate was settled decisively in favour of the view that genuine market prices are an essential pre-requisite of advanced economic order, attention shifted to the broader institutional pre-requisites of a successful economy. It now appears that this debate has been settled decisively in favour of the view that an advanced economy requires the institutional foundations of secure property rights, the rule of law and sound money. Now, the debate has taken a further twist, centred on the role of cultural norms in which an advanced economic system needs to be embedded. This article focuses on one aspect of this debate: the role of ‘social capital’ in the economy. A successful economy cannot develop, let alone survive, in the absence of generalised social trust—social capital. Communitarian critics argue, however, that markets do not produce the social capital necessary for their own functioning and, indeed, that the excessive penetration of market-like processes into public life may undermine the trust in other people necessary to sustain a functioning market order. The role of government in planning and managing the economy is said to remain as important as ever, but today, the government is charged with the task of cultural planning: The government must, it is suggested, plan to ensure the supply of appropriate levels of social capital. This article challenges the basis of the communitarian critique by showing how an advanced market economy may be socially and culturally self-sustaining; social capital, we suggest, is not antithetical to the market but is an intrinsic component of commercial society. After this introduction, Section 2 defines social capital and elucidates the distinction between ‘bonding’ and ‘bridging’ social capital that is central to our argument. Section 3 presents the communitarian critique of liberal markets as based upon excessively ‘thin’ moral and cultural values. Section 4 questions the communitarian perspective by setting out the role of ‘thin’ values or ‘bridging social capital’ in linking people with often very different values and ends. The role of market institutions in the creation of bridging social capital is set out in Section 5, while Section 6 explores the role of markets in ensuring the appropriate mix between bonding and bridging social capital. Section 7 concludes.",13

John Lie (1997: 342) The market occupies a peculiar position in mainstream economic thought. It is in one sense ever-present. The market is the site where buyers and sellers meet, prices emerge, and resources change hands. As such, it is the scene where all the action in contemporary economics occurs. On the other hand, the market is more often in the background of economic analysis than in the fore. If the entrepreneur is the forgotten man in mainstream economic theory, then the market is certainly the forgotten place. Its existence is often assumed. The usually unspecified cultural, political, and social institutions that are necessary for it to function correctly are similarly assumed to be present. And the narrow “theory of exchange” is assumed to capture all of the meaningful events which occur in the market. The market as a system of social rules/norms and a stable pattern of relationships embedded within a broader social context rarely enters into the calculus. Moreover, the market is seldom if ever discussed as a space where meaningful social action and interaction occurs. Swedberg (1994) has argued a similar point. He sees the market as a “specific type of social structure” that is not just an “abstract price-making mechanism” but is also a “social phenomenon in its own right” (ibid.: 255). By calling the market a “specific type of social structure,” he simply means that the market is the result of “recurrent and patterned interactions between agents that are maintained through sanctions” (ibid.). He sees the market as a network of buyers and sellers engaged in competition and exchange. Sellers are hawking their wares and competing with one another for costumers. Buyers are trying to get the largest bangs for their bucks while competing with one another for bargains. According to Swedberg, these two elements, “exchange in combination with competition,” should be of primary interest to analysts of the market; everything else should be secondary (ibid.: 271). Drawing his inspiration from Weber, Swedberg insists that this view of the market as “competition for exchange” will lead to a richer understanding of the market by economists and sociologists; both, in his view, tend “to analyze the market as if they were little but mechanisms for exchange” (ibid.). “By connecting the element of competition to that of exchange,” Swedberg (ibid.: 272) writes, “a much fuller theory of markets than the current one emerges.” Swedberg is right of course. But, he is diagnosing a problem with mainstream economic theory that modern Austrians have consistently recognized and prescribing a treatment that neo-Austrians have long since taken to heart. The Austrians have articulated a theory of the market which seems very much in line with the “fuller theory” that Swedberg endorses. For Austrians, the market has always been a central concern. And Austrians have always argued that the market is a social structure. “The market,” Mises (1949: 312) has stated, “is a social body; it is the foremost social body. The market phenomena are social phenomena. They are the resultant of each individual’s active contribution.” In addition, he (ibid.: 258) has explained that: The market is not a place, a thing, or a collective entity. The market is a process, actuated by the interplay of the actions of the various individuals cooperating under the division of labor. For Austrians, then, the market is a social structure or a spontaneous order which emerges as the result of the interplay of actions of various individuals who are both competing against each other for resources and cooperating with one another in the provision and distribution of goods and services (Ikeda 1994: 29). Austrians have fruitfully analogized the interplay of actions that occurs in markets to a conversation. Hayek (1948: 86), for instance, has suggested that “we must look at the price system as … a mechanism for communicating information if we want to understand its real function.” Market participants use the price system to communicate with each other. In functioning markets, price changes are meaningful utterances that communicate to individuals that the world has changed in some way and signals to them that they should adjust their activities accordingly. As Horwitz (1995) points out, there are several connections between money and language. Both money and language, he writes, “mediate social processes … money is the ‘medium of exchange’ … while language is the ‘medium of experience’” (ibid.: 164). Austrians believe that we can and do use prices to “speak” to one another in markets and that the market is a particular kind of extended social discourse. The market, however, is more than a social structure or a particular kind of extended discourse. The market is also a social space. Although Austrian economists are quite right to focus on the conversation of the market, I believe that something is lost when we fail to appreciate that the market is also a space where meaningful extraeconomic conversations take place. Mises’ assertion that the market is not a place was, in my view, a bit overstated (although his claim that the market was primarily a process was correct). Certainly, as Austrians have consistently demonstrated, the market is not just a place.Footnote 1 But, it is not just a process either. It is also a space where social relations (beyond commercial relations) develop. The market is both a conversation and an arena where meaningful conversations can occur. It is a scene where noncommercial and commercial relationships develop. This paper is an effort to focus attention on the meaningful conversations that happen in markets; conversations that express more than bid–ask; conversations that are not just bartering and negotiations; conversations between socially bonded market participants concerned with more than simply making a deal.Footnote 2 A variety of meaningful social relationships is buttressed by markets and would not exist if markets did not exist. Think of the coworkers on the factory floor that also bowl and barbeque together, the father and son working in the family hardware store, and the office romance that developed at the water cooler. My rationale is threefold. First, I believe that highlighting the market as a social space will lead to a better understanding of what actually occurs in markets. Certainly, focusing on the market as a process should be our chief concern as Austrian economists. But also paying attention to the rich nexus of extraeconomic interactions that take place within the market and that facilitate and are facilitated by the market process might very well yield a fuller theory of the market of the sort that sociologists, anthropologists, and others have recommended. Second, viewing the market as a social space enables us to engage the debate taking place in sociology and anthropology about the relationship between the market and the community (e.g., Is the market a product of the community? Is the relationship between the market and the community mutually reinforcing or antagonistic?). In my view, conceiving of the market as a social space is quite compatible with the Austrian view of the market. Indeed, a third reason to pursue this course is to defend and extend Rothbard’s plausible but unsupported assertion that it is much more likely that markets make feelings of friendship possible than it is that friendship is a necessary context for functioning markets. As Rothbard (1993: 85) asserts, “in explaining the origins of society, there is no need to conjure up any mystic communion or ‘sense of belonging’ among individuals … In fact, it is far more likely that feelings of friendship and communion are the effects of a regime of (contractual) social cooperation rather than the cause.” Unfortunately, economists do not pay much attention to the extracatallactic relationships that can occur in markets. And economic anthropologists and economic sociologists, the social scientists most likely to be concerned with the intersection of sociality and markets, only begrudgingly accept the notion that meaningful social relationships (beyond exchange and competition) can develop within the market.",85

It is treated as both a factor of production and as consumption good. It has been viewed not only as a link in a social network but also as the network itself, the knowledge carried over that network, or the norms that support it. The virtue or vice of social capital is sometimes said to lie in the exclusivity it provides to a community and sometimes in the inclusiveness and openness it fosters. Considering the importance now placed on the concept by economists employing a market-process framework (many of whom are represented in this volume), such looseness of meaning may be unhelpful and potentially confusing. The goal of this article is therefore to find an interpretation of social capital that may be particularly useful for understanding the entrepreneurially driven market process. It is not meant to be definitive for all uses of the concept.",24

The nature and significance of trust has been the subject of numerous books, articles and journal symposia. However, the burgeoning literature on trust contains few contributions from an Austrian perspective. There is, for instance, no entry on ‘trust’ in the Elgar Companion to Austrian Economics (Boettke 1994). Not 1 of the 36 articles in a recent Edward Elgar reference volume on trust was written by an Austrian (Khalil 2002b). In addition, ‘trust’ is conspicuous from the indexes of many of the great works of Austrian economics, such as Mises’s ([1949] 1966) Human Action, Hayek’s (1960) The Constitution of Liberty and his Law, Legislation and Liberty (Hayek 1982) and O’Driscoll and Rizzo’s (1985) The Economics of Time and Ignorance.Footnote 1 Moreover, even where the term ‘trust’ does feature in the writings of Austrian economists—as sometimes it does in Austrian papers on social capital, on the linkages between culture and economics and on the difficulties faced by transition economies—it tends to do so more in passing rather than as the object of sustained analytical attention.Footnote 2 Additional examples could be adduced, but they are, perhaps, unnecessary to make the point that Austrian economists have tended rather to neglect the phenomenon of trust.Footnote 3 The present paper is intended to help remedy this omission by developing an account of the nature and significance of trust that has a distinctively Austrian flavour. More specifically, the analysis of trust developed below is consistent with the three basic methodological tenets of radical subjectivist Austrian economics namely, methodological individualism, radical subjectivism and a focus on economic processes in a world of uncertainty (Boettke 1994: 4).",15

Hargreaves Heap,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Put broadly, the question addressed by this paper is whether there is a difference between the social capital of group identification and snake oil, and if there is, what this difference holds for public policy. Social capital is a device for introducing individuals who value social embeddedness into economics. It is clever because it piggy-backs on a key category in economics, capital, which has already been successfully elaborated (as when we now talk about ‘human capital’). This rhetorical flourish only explains a bit of why the concept has been so quickly assimilated into the vocabulary of economics. The literature on happiness does much of the rest. There is considerable evidence that having extensive social networks and feelings of trust contribute to individual subjective well-being (e.g. see Layard 2005; Frey and Stutzer 2002). These variables also seem to help explain cross-country differences in well-being (e.g. see Helliwell 2006). It is also not uncommon to suppose that the two might be related: that is, belonging to social organisations helps trust between individuals to grow. After all, people who belong to the same group will probably share whatever values distinguish that group, and such sharing plausibly enables members of the group to trust each other on occasions when those values might affect decision making. These shared ideas also probably address in one way or another the big questions of, so to speak, life, death and the universe and so contribute to happiness by reducing existential uncertainties. A natural question follows from this line of argument with respect to the prophylactic power of groups: how might public policy encourage the growth of social capital that comes from participation in groups of this kind? Several possible answers to this question have been suggested. One is that policy should be directed at building stable families, communities and workplaces (see Layard 2005). Stability is important because groups cannot be meaningful said to exist when there is rapid turnover. In addition, game theory teaches us that repetition is quite crucial in building apparently non-selfish behaviour among otherwise selfish individuals, and if behaviour of this kind spawns additional rationalising ethical beliefs, as much psychological evidence suggests (see Festinger 1957), stability within a collection of people will be important for seeding and reinforcing the defining beliefs of a group. The character of these social relations also seems to matter in the sense that participation in the group’s decision making contributes to happiness; and this is perhaps not surprising if what membership of a group helps give to the individual is a sense of identity. In the next section, I consider another way in which the existence of groups can affect individual well-being: one that arises because relative comparisons seem crucial in people’s experience of well-being, and these comparisons are likely to be sensitive to group identifications. The analysis in this section together with what has already been said, so to speak, makes the case for encouraging strong and distinct group identifications. In Section 3, however, I develop another set of arguments that point rather differently. It is not so much that the encouragement to group membership is a latter day kind of snake oil but that simple inferences of the kind that people will be happier when they have more developed social networks are wrong because the character of these groups is quite crucial in how group membership impacts on human happiness. Or to put this point more directly, as one concerning social capital, whether groups and group allegiances in society constitute significant social capital depends critically on the character of the beliefs which bind people to those groups. I use Section 4 to make a connection between this qualification regarding the nature of the influence of groups and some distinguishing arguments in the Austrian tradition. In particular, it is important that group identification, if it is to form social capital, should not be accompanied by a set of discriminatory attitudes towards those who are not members of that group; otherwise strong group identification will likely fuel inter-group animosities. This is, of course, a tricky requirement because it is natural to view one’s own allegiances as worthy, and this could easily seem to entail an adverse judgement on other groups. What prevents the ‘logical’ jump from ‘my group = good’ to ‘others = bad’, I argue, is the existence of uncertainty; and this is the connection to the Austrian tradition that I draw out. Austrians have long argued that the appropriate response to uncertainty is an open, liberal society, and in a similar fashion, I shall argue that the constitutive beliefs of the groups within a society need positively to embrace the value of pluralism if differences in belief are not to turn into animosities. This qualification to the prophylactic power of groups has, perhaps not unsurprisingly, important implications for social-capital-driven public policy. As the spread of the market is a key contributor to the disruption of groups of one kind or another, it is not surprising that public policy debate around social capital has tended to focus on how best to draw the boundaries for and therefore the influence of the market in social life so as to secure the kind of stability in which group identifications might flourish. It therefore tends to reproduce a rather familiar policy choice between the market and the state (or some other form of collective agency). I want to argue, however, that the more nuanced understanding of groups proposed in Section 3 opens up another dimension for public policy. Quite independently of where one locates on the market-state (or weak-strong group spectrum), the form of state or collective intervention (or the character of the groups) can matter deeply. I illustrate this point in a slightly different way in the last section of the paper. There is a rather more specific indictment that is sometimes levelled against television in the story that is told about dwindling social capital. Television, it is claimed, has substituted for traditional forms of entertainment which brought people together in a community (see Putnam 2000). It is also passive in a way that more traditional forms are not (and there is evidence that participation both directly contributes to subjective well-being and builds group values), and it feeds material expectations through advertising in ways that create a treadmill for us between the growth of income and our needs (see Layard 2005). In section 5, I set out the other side of what television does and some of the evidence on cross-country differences in the relation between television and well-being and trust. As those differences can be related to the actual form of public service broadcasting in those countries, they illustrate rather well how the character of public intervention can affect well-being and may matter rather more than where one locates on the market–state continuum. Or to use the modality of groups rather than individual versus collective agency, it is the character of groups that can matter as much as whether the bonds of group identification are weak or strong.",1

Carilli,Christopher J. Coyne,Peter T. Leeson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the sociologist James Coleman (1988) introduced the term “social capital”, social science scholars ranging from political science (Putnam 1992, 2000; Putnam and Feldsteing 2002; Fukuyama 1995, 1999) to economics (Knack and Keefer 1997; Glaeser et al. 2000a; b) have incorporated the concept into their research in various forms.Footnote 1 Important recent work by Chamlee-Wright (2008) points out that social capital, which includes the array of relationships, norms and interactions that facilitate interactions, should be viewed as a complex structure of complementary components that are constantly evolving.Footnote 2 Just as the entrepreneur is the agent of change in the realm of economic capital, so too can we envision entrepreneurs acting in the realm of social capital. In the economic realm, entrepreneurs must align heterogeneous capital goods that have multi-specific uses. Similarly, entrepreneurs in the social realm act to align and discover new combinations of social capital.Footnote 3
 Because of its importance in the functioning of society, over the past decade, policymakers have also devoted increasing attention to the nature and role of social capital. The World Bank, for instance, has incorporated the concept as a key element of its programs aimed at fostering economic development.Footnote 4 Along these lines, the Bank has emphasized promoting the creation of social capital in underdeveloped countries as a critical step in changing their economic and social trajectories. Several authors have considered some of the potential problems with government intervention aimed at manipulating the structure social capital. Elinor Ostrom (2000: 180–1) discusses the knowledge problem associated with government intervention. External agents may not even realize that their actions are destroying existing social capital combinations. She also highlights the possibility of government intervention crowding out private investments in social capital, as well as discussing the public choice issues associated with interventions aimed at affecting its structure (Ostrom 2000: 182). Ikeda (2002, 2004) discusses the dynamics of intervention as it relates to social capital,Footnote 5 and points out that these interventions may generate unintended consequences that require further interventions to achieve the desired end. Missing, however, is a mechanism that explains how these perverse outcomes of intervention occur. For instance, why does government intervention crowd out private investment in social capital? Likewise, why does government intervention generate unintended consequences that may require further intervention? To answer these questions, this paper focuses specifically on one type of government intervention in the structure of social capital—state-directed attempts to create homogeneity within a society. One example of this type of intervention is Quebec’s language laws that govern many aspects of life in the province. These laws not only make French the official language of the province, but also mandate specific guidelines for the preparation of documents and advertising. For instance, the laws state that all legal documents in the province must be in French, as well as requiring that all store signs contain twice as much French as English.Footnote 6 Other examples of attempts to impose heterogeneity include public education systems and the current efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan to establish centralized political, economic, and social institutions. Our core thesis is that interventions by government to manipulate the structure of social capital with the aim of creating homogeneity have undesirable effects on the social and economic order. Our analysis applies Leeson’s (2007a, b) theory of social-distance reducing signaling for trade expansion in the context of social capital. Government interventions in the structure of social capital produce a signal extraction problem whereby the signals that naturally evolve between social actors through existing social capital combinations are distorted. As such, the natural rate of interaction and exchange are distorted as well, retarding entrepreneurial discovery of new social capital combinations and eroding existing ones.Footnote 7

Some, most notably those of Western Europe, the overseas extensions of Great Britain, and more recently the Asian “Tigers,” have grown to be fantastically wealthy. Sustained economic growth has been a relatively recent phenomenon limited to a small handful of areas. Von Mises (1996) characterized physical capital goods as “a conservative element,” meaning that physical capital constrains economic change because each capital good is specific in its function and limited in its convertibility. This characterization is extended to examine how social capital networks and institutions, which North (2005: 48) defines as “formal rules, informal norms, and their enforcement characteristics,” constrain economic and social change. Some of the mechanisms by which this occurs are examined with case studies of lynchings in the American South, which serve as a stark reminder of the difficulties of institutional change. Von Mises (1996) argues that specific capital goods of limited convertability will constrain the path of economic change. In many cases, specific capital goods cannot be easily translated from one context to another. Entrepreneurs form expectations and invest with reference to the existing structure of production, which will consist of a complex array of inputs and institutions. Mises’ characterization of physical capital is extended to analyze the interplay between social capital and institutions, particularly the new structure of private property rights that emerged in the American South after the abolition of slavery.Footnote 2
 The South after the Civil War and Reconstruction exemplified massive institutional change. Southern economic, political, and social institutions had developed on a double foundation of slavery and the political needs of the cotton economy during the years preceding the Civil War. The relatively abrupt change in property rights, combined with the institutional upheaval of Reconstruction, created uncertainty and insecurity in the Southern economic, political, and social environment of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Footnote 3
 Scholars have proposed many explanations for Southern poverty. These include labor market isolation (Wright 1986), depredations during the Civil War and Reconstruction (DiLorenzo 2002), discrimination and racism in capital markets (Ransom and Sutch 1977), and the contractual arrangements that emerged after Reconstruction (Alston and Ferrie 1993, 1999). One notable fact about the region was that poverty persisted in spite of what was, at first glance, a move toward apparently superior institutions—namely, liberal private property rights in man with the abolition of slavery. Purely factor-oriented theories of economic development have been measured and have been found wanting (Gwartney, Lawson, and Holcombe 1999, 2005; Easterly 2005; Coyne and Leeson 2005). The New Institutional Economics re-oriented the research agenda on the wealth of nations. A growing body of theoretical and empirical literature shows that the formal rules, informal norms, and enforcement mechanisms comprising a society’s institutions are at the foundation of development. Institutions evolve slowly, and the complex interaction between different groups and cultures creates conditions under which people make investment decisions. The Southern institutional environment appears to have been constrained by the “thinking, choosing, and acting of bygone generations,” to use von Mises’ (1996: 506) phrase—particularly the thinking, choosing, and acting of racist governments and mobs. The essence of the argument is as follows. Institutions shape returns on investment in particular inputs and contracting arrangements. The extent to which these factors are limited in their convertibility will determine the society’s ability to adjust the structure of production to new institutions. Social capital may provide networks of relationships that reduce transaction costs and lead to economic growth, or malevolent forms of social capital may in fact increase transaction costs and reduce economic growth. In the case of the South, resistance to nominal legal equality between the races may reduce the extent to which factors of production are allocated efficiently. Social capital is limited in its convertibility, and this may generate productivity—reducing instability as societies address the incompatibility between the new institutions and the structure of social capital. Case studies of Southern lynchings, which were one outlet through which whites expressed their dissatisfaction with life after slavery and Reconstruction, illuminate and illustrate some of the mechanisms through which this may occur.",7
22.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,26 August 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-008-0064-2,The rules of abstraction,March 2009,Douglas Glen Whitman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One simple illustration of intermediate abstraction can be found in the rules of etiquette at the dinner table. One rule is to say “Please” when requesting a service from someone, such as handing you the butter; another is to say “Thank you” after a service has been performed; another is to keep your mouth shut while chewing; and so on. Now, imagine if we replaced all these rules with a single, highly abstract directive: “Be polite.” That directive would not provide much useful guidance. Lacking more information, the decision maker would have to decide for each and every table interaction what would be the “polite” thing to do. On the other hand, what if we had a different prescription for every possible table interaction? One directive for when someone passes the butter, another for when someone passes the salt, another for when someone serves food onto your plate, and so on. The decision maker’s problem would be very similar to that which he encountered under the abstract “Be polite” rule. Any time he encountered a novel situation—and arguably, every situation is novel in at least some infinitesimal degreeFootnote 3—he would have to decide the correct action, without much assurance that it is correct (would it be okay for him to use the passing-the-butter response the first time someone passed him I-Can’t-Believe-It’s-Not-Butter?). So far, we have only discussed dinner table etiquette. But we could imagine the highly abstract rule (Be polite) being applied to all types of interactions, from proper treatment of the opposite sex to proper behavior in an elevator. Or we could imagine having a different highly specific rule of etiquette for each and every different activity or interaction, however minutely defined. But we have neither of these. The actual rules of etiquette possess an intermediate degree of abstraction, neither so broad as to include all situations nor so narrow as to differ for each and every specific situation.Footnote 4 They identify abstractly defined types or kinds of situation. The same analysis applies to legal rules. A rule of tort liability that said “Do the right thing” or “Be careful” would not be very helpful in guiding behavior, unless the decision maker had some strong notion of what other people think is right in more narrowly defined categories of situation. But if the categories were too narrow, depending too much on the particular characteristics of the particular situation, the decision maker’s dilemma would be the same. A more useful rule of tort liability tells the decision maker how to act in situations with an intermediate degree of abstraction, e.g., “Always yield to cars already on the freeway when merging.” This rule picks out some relevant features of a situation (who is merging versus who is already on the freeway), while ignoring countless other features of the situation (relative speeds of the cars, types and models of cars, colors of cars, ages of drivers, number of occupants, ultimate destinations, and so on ad infinitum). Actual tort law, and law generally, does rely on rules with an intermediate degree of abstraction. But there is a spectrum from perfect specificity to perfect abstraction, which means that intermediateness lacks clear boundaries. Although the law generally does not incorporate directives at either extreme, it does sometimes rely on modes of decision making that veer in one direction or the other. In the direction of highest specificity, we have case-by-case decision making: the notion that judges ought to consider the particulars of each case, decide based on those features, and refrain from drawing conclusions that stray too far from the particular facts before them. In the direction of highest abstraction, we have the ubiquitous standards of the common law—such as “reasonable man” tests, which direct judges and juries to decide a wide range of cases according to whatever factors would be relevant to a typical, decent person with rational faculties, and “balancing” rules, which ask judges and juries to decide based on an array of relevant factors without necessarily specifying the weight that should attach to each factor. The virtues and demerits of such abstract decision making guidelines have been discussed extensively in the legal literature on rules-versus-standards, which will be addressed later. For now, it is worth noting that standard-based decision making and case-by-case decision making have much in common; arguably, they are the same thing. In order to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, decision makers are likely to appeal, at least implicitly, to broad principles in order to decide what is relevant and what is not. In order to apply standards, decision makers end up having to decide each individual case based on its particular merits. Moreover, both forms of decision making lack the certainty of rules with an intermediate degree of abstraction; this impedes the ability of agents subject to the law to know how to behave in their own situations. To predict the effect of either pure case-by-case or pure standard-based decision making, the agent must possess and process an untenable amount of information and predict the behavior of an untenable number of other agents. The informational burden and cognitive load are simply too great. Examples aside, I will now attempt to lay out the general problem. Although the word “rules” is sometimes used broadly to refer to any kind of directive for decision making, or any regularity of behavior, it also has a less general connotation. Rules are those directives that help people make decisions with some degree of certainty about which behaviors are acceptable (or expected) and which are not. That is, the primary function of rules is to lend predictability to one’s own choices as well as the choices of others (including their responses to one’s own choices).Footnote 5 Predictability results from a reduction in the amount of information individuals must collect and process, and it is desirable because it enhances individuals’ ability to make plans and to coordinate with each other.Footnote 6 This does not mean that predictability is the only function or value that rules serve. Rather, what distinguishes rules from other kinds of directives, such as case-by-case or standard-based decision making, is their effect on predictability. This predictability—which is, of course, never perfect—is achieved by attaching specific outcomes or behaviors to classes of situations. The breadth of these classes corresponds to the degree of abstraction of the rules. If the classes are defined very narrowly, the rules lose some of their rule-like quality because of the difficulty of discerning which class includes one’s own situation. When class definitions depend on a virtually infinite number of characteristics of a situation, the human mind may fail to grasp them all. Some of the characteristics might be difficult to measure, and others might simply be forgotten or not conceived in the first place. As a result, the decision maker faces greater uncertainty when assessing the acceptability of his actions and in projecting their likely results. In addition, other agents will face greater uncertainty about how the decision makers will act (for instance, potential litigants will find it harder to predict both each other’s actions and judges’ actions). Virtually the same problem emerges if the classes are defined too broadly; again, the rules start to lose their rule-like quality. This occurs because very broadly defined classes generally correspond to broader sets of possible outcomes in order to allow a better match between outcomes and the particular features of the situation (the possibility of very broad classes corresponding to narrow outcome sets will be considered later). Here, the decision maker has little difficulty discerning the class into which his situation falls, but he still faces a knowledge problem: he does not know exactly how the general principles will govern in his case. He does not know which factors will be deemed relevant, and he does not know the precise values to be attached to these factors. In short, the decision maker still faces great uncertainty in determining the acceptability or likely outcome of his decisions. Figure 1, below, depicts the emerging relationship between abstraction and “ruleness,” where ruleness refers to the quality of directives that guide behavior by reducing uncertainty of application. The straight line shows increasing ruleness (from left to right). The circular curve shows increasing abstraction (in a clockwise direction); the endpoints of extreme specificity and extreme abstraction approach each other.Footnote 7 Those directives which are most rule-like will generally display an intermediate degree of abstraction, as shown at the right edge of the abstraction curve.
 Abstraction and Ruleness. Figure 2 illustrates three different degrees of abstraction. The left panel is characterized by a very low level of abstraction (innumerable distinctions being made among cases), the right panel a very high level of abstraction (no distinctions made among cases), and the middle panel an intermediate level of abstraction (a few distinctions made among cases). The spaces between lines can be understood as the classes defined by rules. The uncertainty generated by a proliferation of low-abstraction rules corresponds to the difficulty of determining which space one’s own case falls into; there are so many spaces, delimited by so many relevant factors, that it becomes difficult to distinguish one space from another—and therefore difficult to determine the acceptability of one’s decision. That source of uncertainty does not exist in the case of extreme abstraction, but it is replaced by something very similar: although you know what class your case falls into (because there is only one), that is not sufficient to determine acceptability of your decision, as cases within this large class are treated differently based on all conceivably relevant factors.
 Degrees of Abstraction. The reason why most rules worthy of the name rely on intermediate abstraction is closely related to the reason why we use abstraction in general. Abstraction is a device that allows our minds to cope with literally limitless amounts of information. As Hayek puts it, “[A]bstract concepts are a means to cope with the complexity of the concrete which our mind is not fully capable of mastering” (1973, p. 29). We deal with that complexity by filtering it, deeming some features relevant while ignoring others. Hayek again: “We never act, and could never act, in full consideration of all the facts of a particular situation, but always by singling out as relevant only some aspects of it…” (1973, p. 30). The more we abstract, the more features we choose to ignore in order to focus attention on the remaining features deemed relevant. But there is a limit to the usefulness of the process because at some point, abstracting further means excluding some features that could be important for some purposes. Indeed, this is true even at the lowest level of abstraction, but the steepness of the trade-off increases as the level of abstraction rises. Statements at the highest level of abstraction will often have a tautological or vacuous character, as they no longer allow us to make useful distinctions. Consider, for example, the use of abstraction in social scientific modeling. Koppl and Whitman (2004), drawing on the ideal-type analysis of Schutz (1932), observe that models of human behavior can be placed on a spectrum of “anonymity.” A model with low anonymity makes very specific assumptions about the characteristics of the people modeled; the least anonymous model would attempt to predict the behavior of just one person—say, Napoleon (Koppl and Whitman 2004, p. 302). A model with very high anonymity makes very generic assumptions about people’s characteristics; the most anonymous model would only make assumptions literally true of every single human being. An example of a highly anonymous ideal type would be Ludwig von Mises’s model of a human being as someone who acts “to substitute a more satisfactory for a less satisfactory state of affairs” (Mises 1949, p. 13, cited in Koppl and Whitman 2004, p. 304). The analogy to the level of abstraction in rules should be clear: highly specific ideal types are analogous to highly specific directives, highly anonymous ideal types to highly abstract directives. And it turns out that the advantages of rules with an intermediate degree of abstraction correspond to the advantages of ideal types with an intermediate degree of anonymity. The use of ideal types allows us to make predictions about entire groups or classes of people, economizing on mental effort. But there is a precision-versus-accuracy trade-off involved in moving to higher levels of abstraction; as our models become more abstract, the kind of things we can say about any abstractly defined group become less precise (Koppl and Whitman 2004, p. 305). In the extreme, we can abstract so much that we can say almost nothing at all. The Napoleon ideal type is not useful for predicting the behavior of anyone but Napoleon. The Misesian ideal type is not useful for predicting much behavior at all, except in the very broadest of terms, without filling in more specific details about the type of people whose behavior we wish to predict (e.g., that they prefer leisure to work, that they discount the future, etc.). The highly specific end of the spectrum is all precision, no accuracy; the highly abstract end is all accuracy, no precision. But these turn out to be very similar! If your point is to be able to say something useful, to make a prediction about behavior, then both have the same problem. The highly abstract end of the spectrum requires us to get more information to make a sufficiently precise statement. The highly specific end also requires us to get more information to determine which model to use—Napoleon or Idi Amin or George W. Bush? So the most useful social scientific models will be those in the intermediate range (although more and less anonymous models will be useful for some purposes). By settling on models with intermediate levels of anonymity, we can be reasonably (though not perfectly) confident about which ideal type applies in understanding any given social situation. Rules with intermediate abstraction provide an analogous benefit. Adopting rules that abstract from specifics and focus on a few relevant factors allows us to make predictions for entire groups and classes. For those classes, we can make reasonably confident predictions about “correct” behavior. But if the rules become too abstract, the classes become larger, and we become less confident about our ability to determine “correctness” for any given member of a class. Why, if rules with an intermediate degree of abstraction have the advantages I have stated, are such rules occasionally displaced by either more abstract or more specific directives? This question is best answered by reference to examples from law, language, and etiquette. But first, we need some additional terminology. As noted earlier, we can imagine a very abstract rule whose effects are nonetheless easy to predict. If every case within the entire class will be treated exactly the same way, then the breadth of the class poses no problem at all. It is easy to determine what class one’s case falls in, and it is easy to predict the outcome. In writing, an example of this kind of rule would be, “Always end a sentence with a period.” The rule would be clear and easy to apply. Of course, it would also rule out the use of question marks and exclamation points. But there would be little or no problem of uncertainty. In tort law, an example would be, “The plaintiff shall always win and receive damages in the amount of $1 million.” This rule might produce all sorts of problems, but it would be highly predictable in its application. So there is no necessary connection between high-level abstraction and uncertainty. I will argue, however, that there is a systematic and empirical connection. Borrowing from Pierre Schlag, I will use the word “directive” broadly to refer to any mode of assessing appropriateness or determining outcomes, whether a command, rule, or standard. As Schlag puts it, “The formula for a legal directive is ‘if this, then that.’ A directive thus has two parts: a ‘trigger’ that identifies some phenomenon and a ‘response’ that requires or authorizes a legal consequence when that phenomenon is present” (1985, p. 381).Footnote 8 The same is true of non-legal directives as well. Any system of directives creates a mapping from situations to outcomes. The mapping divides the set of all cases into a number of input sets; these sets may be wide or narrow, as illustrated earlier in Fig. 1. Thus far, I have implicitly defined the abstraction of rules solely in terms of the breadth of input sets. But the mapping also designates an output set corresponding to each input set. The output sets may also be wide or narrow. So a system of directives creates a mapping from input sets to output sets. Figure 3A–C illustrates the input sets and output sets of case-by-case, rule-based, and standard-based decision making, respectively. In each figure, the system of directives is illustrated by arrows leading from situations (cases) to outcomes. Within the “situations” column, the divisions separate input sets, so having more divisions means having more (and narrower) input sets. Within the “outcomes” column, the divisions separate different outcomes (for simplicity of presentation, I have assumed only three possible outcomes). The divisions do not distinguish output sets. For any given input set, the corresponding output set is all outcomes with arrows from that input set.
 Input Sets and Output Sets. A Case-by-Case, B Rules, C Standards. For a directive system with a low level of abstraction—that is, very narrow input sets as shown in Fig. 3A—uncertainty is likely to result regardless of the size of the corresponding output sets. Even if each input set maps to a singleton output set (only one outcome, as in the figure), the decision maker has to determine which input set his case falls in. If other “nearby” input sets that differ only in minute details nevertheless map to different outcomes, then the decision maker cannot effectively predict the outcome. For a directive system with a high level of abstraction, the breadth of output sets matters. It is relatively easy to determine the relevant input set, but uncertainty can arise from a too-broad output set. In Fig. 3C, there is only one input set, but it maps to all possible outcomes (a wide output set). We can imagine a version of Fig. 3C in which there is just one arrow, leading from the only input set to one possible outcome. But in reality, that sort of directive is rare, and wide output sets are more common. For instance, the standards observed in law—such as balancing and reasonable man tests—are characterized by the vagueness of their recommendations. They specify relevant factors, not particular outcomes. In language, and specifically in writing, style guidelines like “be concise” and “avoid run-on sentences” are similarly vague in their specification of outcomes; they identify some relevant factors to consider in one’s speech and prose, but their application to particular cases is not apparent a priori (for instance, was the previous sentence a run-on?). The directives we most often think of as rules have intermediate-sized input sets with relatively small output sets. In Fig. 3B, there is only a handful of input sets, thereby minimizing uncertainty about where one’s own situation falls, and each input set maps to a single outcome (a singleton output set), thereby minimizing uncertainty about the rule’s application. Although we can imagine directives with very wide input sets and very narrow output sets, such beasts are rarely found in the world. When input sets are large, output sets tend to be large as well. As we shall see in the next section, this fact results from the desire to achieve a desirable match between situations and outcomes.",5

This was most probably partly due to the revival of interest in the concept of “entrepreneur”, for which Kirzner put Say’s works forward. Kirzner re-introduced Say’s views with a stand different from that of Classical economics. Also, and partly due to the importance given by Rothbard to French Liberalism (as opposed to Scottish and British, Smithian and Ricardian, Liberalism), some hints were given to assess that Say was as much of a great forefather of the individualistic method as Smith. We shall here point out that in the second volume of his Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought dedicated to Classical Economics, Rothbard always mentions Menger (four times) with respect to the French tradition, that is, once in the first chapter about Say (see Rothbard 1995, p. 37), twice in the last chapter about French laissez-faire (see Rothbard 1995, p. 471 and 475), and once in the chapter on the failure of the Ricardian system, siding Menger with Butt and Longfield, but also again with Say (see Rothbard 1995, p. 135). In the volume, many quotes show how much Rothbard appreciated a “French” foundation of political economy alternative to “Classicism”. By way of illustration, Rothbard (1995, p. 3) writes: “One of the great puzzles in the history of economic thought […] is why Adam Smith was able to sweep the field […] The mystery is particularly acute for France […] The mystery deepens [with] the great leader of French economics after Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say.” He also writes (ibid.): “We shall see the precise nature of Say’s thought and his contributions, as well as his decidedly ‘French’ non-Smithian, and ‘pre-Austrian’ logical clarity and emphasis on the praxeological axiomatic-deductive method, on utility as the sole source of economic value, on the entrepreneur, on the productivity of factors of production, and on individualism”. Commentators have later drawn upon those remarkable intuitions. According to them, some “influence” may then be traced from there to Menger. Whether they were cautious enough in saying so, we shall here briefly examine. We shall then argue that it is only in acknowledging clearly Menger’s reading of Say’s works that the extent of the importance that Menger gave to Say can be definitively assessed. The question is not whether Menger did give importance to Say’s ideas, but to which extent those were positive contributions to Menger’s own assertions. The question is to which extent one may draw upon that relationship in order to assess Menger’s own views. And we may well have to qualify some statements made by (over)enthusiastic commentators, who made the case more definitive than it may be. Let us first point out some slight mishaps in present views regarding Menger’s relationship to Say. In “A Note on Say and Menger Regarding Value”, Sanders (1994) intends to bring a short rejoinder to the seminal article written by Salerno (1988, already mentioned above). Sanders (1994, p. 141) presents “as evidence of an intellectual kinship on value between Say and Menger”, two quotes that he assumes are enough to support the parallel he draws between both authors. It is, on the one hand, a letter by Say to C. R. Prinsep dated 1821 and, on the other hand, a page taken from Menger’s (1871) Grundsätze. We shall not discuss here the contents-matter of those quotes, which are indeed interesting and pertinent, but we shall only stress that mentioning “similar sentiments” (Sanders 1994, p. 142, italics added) may not be enough to make a hard case. No sound evidence is to be found in such a blunt parallelism. As indicated in the introduction above, the problem in history of economic thought stands as a matter of principle. Truly, when Sanders (1994, p. 143) concludes that “A reading is recommended of Say’s Cours complet d’économie politique (1828–1833)”, one cannot but agree. So what exactly did Menger do? What did he read? The kinship will be more interesting if it is documented, and if it is proven rather than intuited. One must, therefore, ask first of all: what material was really available to Menger regarding Say? We are here concerned with the facts and, fortunately enough, archival work enables us to know them. We shall therefore present here the reader with the results of our inquiry in the archives.Footnote 4
 Indeed, Menger had read Say. He owned the whole series of Say’s re-editions of his Traité d’économie politique (1803, 1848 and 1848–1852) and the German translation of its fourth edition, as well as the Catéchisme d’économie politique (1848, in Oeuvres complètes) and a volume of Mélanges (Miscellaneous Writings, posthumously collected by his editor 1853). The latter included in particular Say’s correspondence with Ricardo and with Malthus (all letters are in French, those of Ricardo being translated). Let us point out that Menger mastered the French language, and let us also pick out one detailed example, that is Menger’s comments on the exchange of letters between Say and Ricardo. That shall give us the touch-stone we are looking for in order to clarify Menger’s appreciation of Say. In the last paragraphs of the present section, we shall then be able to characterize a reasonable position sustained by archival evidence about Menger and Say. Let us first categorize those sources available for investigation. The handwritten comments by Menger that can be found in the Mélanges supply the more abundant source. In particular, notes on the Say–Ricardo correspondence are of interest. In the six French editions of Say’s Traité d’économie politique that Menger owned, and even in the German translation, Menger left but a few annotations. Upon meticulous examination of the volumes, one finds only a word here and there, or a pencil-stroke underlining a word. Notes are almost inexistent in some of the volumes while, in others, only elliptical—and that is contrary to his usual outburst of expressions in other marginalia: one must stress how surprising that fact is, given Menger’s strong tendency to litter the text of the volumes in his personal library with notes. As a matter of fact, Menger’s judgments, usually in abundance, are simply not present in those volumes by Say, and there is consequently not much to do with those fewer than expected (or rather, fewer than wished for) notes. For instance, scarce and disseminated as they are, it is altogether impossible to determine Menger’s appreciation of Say’s various stages through the successive editions of his Traité. Mastering French, Menger could have systematically compared the volumes he owned, and that would certainly show in the notes. Unfortunately, it does not. Menger did not systematically annotate those volumes. Thus, in order to proceed methodically, as it is difficult from that source to make up one’s mind as to the nature of Menger’s reading (mere interest, approval or disapproval?), we had rather let it go than over-interpret. And we must accept, as historians, to deal with what we do in fact have, and look at other sources than the Traité where there is simply not enough to confirm assessments by Sanders and his enthusiastic likes. Historical work cannot be grounded on mere intuition, how smart it may be, if it is not documented. Therefore, Sanders’ position needs at least some qualifying. Now, there may be different kinds of restatements: firstly, the assessment of any “influence” may have simply been erroneous—which is clearly not the case, as Menger was aware of Say’s works; secondly, the assessment may be correct, but not supported by enough evidence in order to make a hard case (Menger “finding ideas” in Say, especially on that focus matter, that is the theory of value); last, the assessment could have been correct and somewhat documented, although overrated while there may not be as much evidence for the claim as wished for. We infer from archival work, that the latter obtains. That is why a “reasonable” assessment of Menger’s interest in Say is necessary, as well as of his actual readings and criticisms. An analysis based on archival material other than the Traité is possible, and the evidence it shows we present in the following. The most illustrative instance of Menger’s comments upon Say is to be derived from his manuscript notes upon the correspondence between Say and Ricardo as it appears in the posthumous volume of Miscellaneous Writings by Say. Menger owned a copy and annotated the exchange that had lasted for a few years, beginning with the letter sent by Ricardo to Say on August 18, 1815 (after Say had just visited Ricardo in Gatcombe Park). The two economists had undertaken a dispute on several topics of fundamental economics that quickly turned into a confrontation of theories. The letters continuously show a very deferential Say, full of compliance and of the desire not to offend his English counterpart. Nevertheless, the way in which Say presents his own thesis, as well as the way how he reformulates Ricardo’s opinions, always leave the English economist dubious whether Say had really understood him, or if he only pretended to. Menger’s notes are numerous. They show that Menger tried hard to clarify both standpoints for himself, and that, despite the politeness of the exchange on the part of Say, he spotted the reluctance by the latter to really accept Ricardo’s views. Rather, miscomprehension seemed reciprocal. Not only did Ricardo keep reproaching Say with misunderstanding him, but he offered counter-examples to statements by Say that he found ambiguous. But those were not simply ambiguous. They were antagonistic to Ricardo—even though Say kept asserting they were not. At stake were some of the most important concepts and premises of Classical economics: the nature of value, wealth, etc., as those concepts appear in Ricardo’s works (1846, especially regarding Ricardo, 1817 owned by Menger in German translation, Ricardo 1837–1838). Menger’s notes show that his interest was focused on those issues. They were to decide the question of the validity of the Classical paradigm in his eyes—and negatively, as Menger proposed a different theory of value. Menger also perceived the misunderstanding between the two Classical economists: Ricardo reproached Say with confusing his theory of labor-value and of costs of production with the idea that there would exist a direct proportion between the quantity of labor incorporated in an object of trade and its pricing on the market. That is precisely what Ricardo tried to avoid through comparing proportions of labor used in order to produce different goods and their resulting pricing relative one to the other. But Menger points out that that is exactly what makes Say’s attempt deeply original in the light of the Ricardian framework. And Say’s economics were thus unfit for that frame. And that was fortunate. In Ricardo’s eyes, it was Say who, based on a naïve reading of Adam Smith’s works, was wrongly summing up ground rents, wages and profits in order to get the price of a good. In Menger’s eyes, it was Ricardo who failed to understand Say. Reading and commenting the exchange, Menger writes in a note that: “He [Ricardo] has totally misunderstood Say”. According to Menger, if Say’s arguments may at times happen to seem incoherent, it is because Ricardo had not grasped in the least what were Say’s ideas, and Say had, with all due deference, to explain his point all over again.Footnote 5
 The concepts of the incipient science of political economy were at stake, because that contribution by Say allowed the interpretation that if one of the factors of production were to rise, the total price would rise as a consequence: Say seemed to favour that view which Ricardo discarded. How did Menger react to Ricardo’s negative reaction to Say? In Ricardo’s eyes, Say fails to understand him when he (Ricardo) argues that if the cost of one factor of production increases, then another factor will decrease according to a reverse proportionality. That idea, in turn, meant that there must exist a severe competition between employers and employees for their share of the income that comes from the price of the good produced. It is this “fight” for a share of income that would later orientate Marx’s insights. But that Ricardian view is not at all endorsed by Say. On the contrary, that skipped Say’s mind altogether, according to Ricardo and his followers.Footnote 6 As a matter of fact, Menger found that gap welcome. The Austrian welcomed precisely what had seemed wrong to Ricardo, what the Englishman had regarded as lacking in Say’s position. Menger views Say’s divergence as the symptom of a possible alternative standpoint in political economy, other than Ricardo’s. And Menger sought in other works by Say that he had in his own library whether the French economist had stressed that divergent viewpoint elsewhere. He then found that, for instance, in the Catéchisme d’économie politique, Say sustained the idea that the utility of things is the fundamental element of their value. It is thus clear, both from the letters and from the Catéchisme, that what Ricardo had criticized in the first place as some kind of confusion in Say was, on the contrary, a deep divergence in their respective understandings of economics. Ricardo meant to re-establish that truth, that indeed, Say refused to admit as right. And Menger would later refuse it just as well—and rebuke Ricardian economics. In both Say’s and Menger’s views, that was no truth, but a deep mistake on the part of Ricardo. Now, Say did not dare to say it so bluntly—or rather, at least Menger judged that did not appear clearly enough. Much later after the exchange of correspondence, Say would stress that however courteous the exchange, he thought they had truly fought.Footnote 7
 Let us note here that the point about the imputation of value by Say was indicated by Rothbard when he wrote that “in short, in a prefiguring of the Austrian Menger–Böhm–Bawerk insight, the value of consumer goods, determined by the subjective utility of the goods to consumers, is imputed back on the market to the various factors of production, which will be set equal to the marginal value productivity of each factor […] Unfortunately, this excellent Say–Longfield–Butt tradition of productivity theory had no influence and no successors” (Rothbard 1995, p. 135). The reason for that lack we find in the correspondence, where Ricardo argued against Say that, although utility is undoubtedly a ground for value of things in general, “The utility of things are without contest the ground of their value; but the degree of their utility could not be the measure of their value. A merchandise hard to produce will always be more expensive than that which is easily produced, even if all men could unanimously agree that the latter is more useful than the former”Footnote 8. Ricardo therefore reproaches Say with a confusion between “value in use” and “value in exchange”, using there the terms of their common master Smith. While Ricardo wanted to modify Smith’s view, Say would have, according to Ricardo, missed the point altogether and brought economics back to a situation prior to that distinction. Exactly at that point, Menger argues that Ricardo failed to understand Say (see footnote 5). To Menger, Say was not a prisoner of older Smithian concepts in his works (see Smith 1811–1812, reed. 1976–1983) that he would have been misusing, but he was in fact breaking ground through breaking away from Ricardo. Say used a notion of utility that was not objective, but rather subjective. That is the true reason why his concern about value could never fit in the Ricardian frame. Menger’s notes make blatant that the Viennese professor, who had already developed his own views in the Grundsätze (1871) at the time he was reading Say, indeed took comfort and a subject of confirmation from the French economist’s text.Footnote 9
 If the main question asked about Menger and Say by “Austrian” historians of economic thought is whether the latter was anticipating marginalist insights, then the analysis should bear on Say, not on Menger. And that is not our purpose here. What is at stake when some Austrian commentators stress, somewhat hastily, that very point, is rather how Menger read Say on the nature of the concepts of wealth, the theory of goods (Güterlehre) and valuation of the goods. Once again, marginalia on the Say–Ricardo correspondence are illuminating. According to Ricardo, Say confuses the following: wealth, utility and exchange value, simply because Say would forget that commonsensical view according to which a man is rich by the quantity of the goods that he owns. Ricardo bases himself upon Say’s formulas where quantity seems to be systematically replaced by value (for instance, Say says that the wealth of a given person is proportional to the value of the goods he/she owns). The question is whether value is referred to quantity. Ricardo goes on showing that the reasoning becomes contradictory when some “Say’s pupil” (fortuitously introduced—for the sake of politeness?) added that the measure of such a “value” is the exact quantity of all the other goods that the owner has the power to command through using the goods he owns (if he wants to do so). To put the argument in a nutshell: according to Ricardo, on the one hand, Say would say that wealth is proportional to value and value proportional to the quantity of goods. And then, wealth must be proportional to the quantity of goods and still, Say would support the view that it is only proportional to what he calls the value, as subjectively measured by the individual, that is as measured by the individual self-indulgence or moderation in his/her desires, and not any more through the quantity of owned goods. Here, Ricardo seemed to defeat Say.Footnote 10 However, putting up with the length of the demonstration, Menger stresses that, in any case, Say would not accept Ricardo’s conclusion. When Say argues that one is not rich by that which he owns, but by his/her own valuation of the goods at his/her disposal, he is not reflecting as a Stoic philosopher would, as Ricardo thinks. Rather, Say answers Ricardo as follows (and Menger double-underlines that answer): “I did not mean to say, like the Stoics, and as you are accusing me, that one is all the richer as one has less desires, but all the more as one may acquire at a cheaper price the goods of his/her desire, whatever they are, that is to say: houses, servants, horses, according to desire”.Footnote 11 Accordingly, the only judgement of utility that counts is that of the individual. Thus, any pricing system (in a pair of partners, or even more) is based on reciprocal individual considerations. Say argues that value as understood by the individual self is the only possible measure, and it is a subjective measure. From the point of view of practical economics too, Say’s view can be supported better than Ricardo’s. When a manufacturer accounts the value of his goods, he/she means, as a matter of fact, their value, but not with respect to some “ideal” intrinsic value (or whatever else which Menger also finds illusory—as shown in Campagnolo 2005a,b). The manufacturer wants to know what is in stock at the moment of the computation, and what can be commanded in other goods at that very moment at the current prices. Far from being delusory, current prices are the only true indicators of sales at the very time when the manufacturer wants to know the extent of his/her wealth. On the contrary, delusion comes from ignoring that current valuation of goods in the name of some “standard” value. And that would result from Ricardo’s “theoretical views”, whereas, for Say, “facts are our masters”.Footnote 12
 After the analysis presented in the previous pages, we may now better understand why commentators have been keen on pointing out the relation between Say and Menger. But we may also anticipate that the position that one may want to find within Menger on Say is easy to exaggerate, like Sanders did. About the concepts at stake, some conformity between them is blatantly to be found, all the more as Menger agrees in his notes with many concepts put forward by Say. Also, some of Menger’s own concepts (like marketability—that is “Absatzfähigkeit” in Menger) may in retrospect seem particularly fit for ideas introduced in economic thought by Say (like the “loi des débouchés”—which has retained in English the name of Say in “Say’s Law”). Unfortunately, the latter case was discussed by Menger neither in the notes on the correspondence examined here, nor in any place in his notes on Say’s works. However, from what we do have at our disposal in the archives, then, indeed, Menger reacted as if he saw in Say hints that pointed to ideas that were his own. He also seemed to think that Say could have orientated the young science of political economy in another direction completely different from that taken under the guidance of Ricardo and his followers—had Say gone all the way in that direction. Let us explicitly assess it in a global “reasonable” position upon the issue of the relation between the two authors. As a matter of fact, Menger’s global reaction to Say in the exchange with Ricardo is to take side along Say. But he also appears, in the end, as resentful towards Say for being reluctant to confront openly and bravely the English master of labor-value. In Menger’s eyes, coherence in Ricardo’s works was gained through an ever more erroneous understanding of the true nature of value, and through a theory of distribution which is altogether different from the way that Menger sees economics as a science. Ricardo focused on some objective substratum of value and tried to find some unique and unchangeable standard of value in order to measure and rank proportionalities of value incorporated within goods. To Menger, this is where Say should have engaged swords. As a matter of fact, that was also a criticism made earlier by Bailey directly to Ricardo.Footnote 13 Menger’s notes show that he was expecting that from Say too, and that he found too little confrontation in the texts at his disposal. Obviously, for Say, like for Menger, the goal that Ricardo had set himself (an unchangeable standard of value) was unattainable. It was all the more so for Menger that value could not be what Ricardo had exposed in his Principles of Political economy and Taxation. As Menger held value to be subjective, it was impossible to ever measure it objectively. If value only emerges in prices, still value did not appear as such because it would have been something hidden inside the good and that would have thus been suddenly revealed. Say did not go as far as to assert that. Still, in his notes, Menger showed impatience at not finding such a conclusion he would have expected from the Professor at the Collège de France: in the margins of the parts that deal directly with the concept of exchange, words like “Preis”, marks like “?” and “!” are more and more recurrent… as if Menger was waiting for those words to appear, as if Say had ever been about to write what Menger himself thought—however, Say was not. Manuscript annotations make us think that Menger felt so close to the criticisms formulated by Say against Ricardo that he felt like completing the work himself. But as far as Say was concerned, value did in the end remain measurable on an objective basis, although it was a relative and not an absolute standard (contrary to what Ricardo had sought) and even if Say had in fact distinguished a concept of utility which costs nothing (like natural things) from a concept of utility that brings about costs. If we now consider that latter distinction by Say between goods that cost labor and other goods, then, once more, both interest and disappointment appear again under Menger’s pen. In fact, when Ricardo reproached Say (once more) with forgetting the difference between value in use and value in exchange, Say answered: “of course, I deliberately neglect it” (our italics). And Menger and Say appear most akin. However, whereas subjective utility would be the reason given by the Austrian for that choice, Say put forth a distinction between “value-less” utility (namely, utility of the goods that nature provides) and “costly utility” (utility based upon human labor). Thus, Say wrote: “The utility of some good whose price diminishes, comes close to the utility of the air, which costs us nothing, although it is very useful” (Say 1819, vol. II, p. 89, our translation). Menger underlined again and again the words of “natural riches” (richesses naturelles), which represent “costless utility” to Say’s mind. Say answered Ricardo about the fact that he neglects the two Smithian values: “You say p. 336 that M. Say always forgets the difference that exists between value in use and exchange value. Of course, I neglect it deliberately because, in political economy, we can deal but with the portion of utility that was presented with costs, for the reason that value-less utility could not enter the valuation of our goods, just as good health does not, except for pointing that enjoyment which results from it”.Footnote 14 Menger happily observed the notion of enjoyment coming after all close to his own “satisfaction of needs” (Bedürfnisbefriedigung), but he was puzzled by Say’s turning back to labor-costs that Menger obviously rebuked.Footnote 15
 What shows that surprise and disappointment is that the more Say’s argument goes, the more numerous “?” and “!” appear in the margins of the volume. Clearly, Menger seems to end up being fed up with a controversy that does not go along the track he would expect, and his notes become scarce and vanish in the end. It is therefore a reasonable hypothesis to say that it is out of frustration in front of what he regarded as the final failing of Say, maybe out of deference for Ricardo, to re-orientate economics towards subjectivity, whereas Say had pointed out a deep and pertinent criticism of Ricardian principles. Let us point out that Menger may have been somewhat unfair to Say, as he did not know that Say had in fact criticized Ricardo’s idea of a standard measure of value, called it a “pure chimera”Footnote 16 and argued that values could only be measured by other values which are essentially variable measures—and that point is in line with Menger’s later writings (see Campagnolo 2005b). What is then the conclusion to be drawn from the facts in the archives, as well as from the detailed examination of Menger’s position regarding the Say–Ricardo correspondence? Altogether, Menger seemed to judge that Say had stopped midway of his possible breakthrough. As one can guess from the annotations Menger left, to his mind, Say had lacked the courage to face the consequences both of his own argument, and of fighting Ricardo to the end. On the one hand, Say was brought to incoherence within his own arguments because he desperately sought to answer Ricardo’s criticisms, and nevertheless he always still went around them in order to re-state his own views. Thus, Say lost ground continuously, although he did not surrender and while he preferred, instead, to change constantly the terms of the debate, reformulating the very same objections to Ricardo in various modes. Menger approved of the attacks, but felt they were not going as far as discarding Ricardian views. On the other hand, Ricardo rightfully felt himself continuously disregarded by his French counterpart. He also got the impression that their debate was hopeless. As a matter of fact, he was above all, and despite great politeness, under some severe criticism that did not say its name, and that he resented, although he showed no room for doubt in his own position. Say went on and on, both claiming faithfulness and simultaneously clutching to views that were contradictory with his alleged faith. His annotations show us that, while Menger approved of those criticisms, Ricardo too, in turn, felt frustrated by the fact that his arguments seemed to slip on Say, just as the fish slips off the hook, if we may say. However, thus, in Menger’s eyes, Say only hinted at a truly new approach, without ever finalizing ideas that Menger himself would put forward. Say failed to make a coherent scheme of the non-classical political economy. It would be Menger’s own task to work out such a new science. As already pointed out in the case mentioned above of a manufacturer accounting the value of his goods, Say’s motto (already quoted: “Facts are masters to all of us”) was endorsed by Menger. The sentence became one of Menger’s methodological credos that can be found many times in his notes (see footnote 12). The importance of facts has clearly to do with Menger’s realism, as well as his worry that economics be a general science true in all places and at all times. Quoting Say again, Menger insists that such facts are not a matter of historical change, but the essence of reality put in the fore. Menger conscientiously confronts Say with Knies, for instance, and he insists that an economist must seek the truth that is not dependent on countries and epochs, but that which rests upon unshakable fundamental truths, so that it may be of use in all nations at all times.Footnote 17 Thus, on the basis of archive material this time again, Menger’s wish for realism and a greater generality in science truly both come in line with commentators who stressed his realistic standpoint as related to his reading of Say.Footnote 18
 Also, in the traditional debate of the nineteenth century “induction vs. deduction”, Say ranked among those “pro-induction” theorists who saw induction as a rich heuristic device. However, whereas Menger did not approve of pure induction, he did not criticize those parts of the “logic of science” in Say’s works—contrary to what he did for some parts of John Stuart Mill’s Works (also kept in his library). To Menger’s mind, Classical political economy in Mill bore witness to the Ricardian British evil of forgetting facts. Starting from an opposite standpoint, the Frenchman did not fail in that way. As to his contemporary colleagues, the German Historicists, overreacting to the British Classics, they ended up regarding all facts only within a perspective of space and time, and that was a fatal error. On the one hand, if facts were neglected, the economist would err through a realm of non-existing ideas (standard value, intrinsic properties of goods and money) and thus fail to explain how prices get formed. On the other hand, if facts were not “typified”, they would lose all theoretical interest and only remain mere data for historical–statistical studies. Both were wrong and Say was right. What Menger found in Say’s positions was then the confirmation of his views about “facts”, making sense within a framework, at the same time theoretical and realistic.Footnote 19
 Other comparisons between Menger and Say could then be tempting in his Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences, and Political Economy in particular (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften, und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere: Menger 1883). For instance, and as we incidentally mentioned above, what about Menger’s “Absatzfähigkeit” (usually translated as “saleability” or “marketability”) with the so-called Say’s Law? Here again, annotations display evidence that is not incompatible with, but that is somewhat different from, that wished for: it can be found in the manuscript notes to the 1871 Grundsätze that Menger referred to Say when he considered the issue of the capacity of supply and sale according to the satisfaction of needs, but Menger then crossed out his own note.Footnote 20 Then, on the contrary, Menger stressed the contradiction in Say’s in his use of the concept of sacrifice about an economic agent that Say, judges Menger, did not go as far as to declare “subjective”. If Menger surely learnt from Say’s methodological viewpoints, he thus also criticized some of them. In the end, Menger found in Say confirmations of some concepts he intended himself to put forth. But he also found many contradictions—as already mentioned, for example, regarding the fact that Say turned again to labor-value (see footnote 15). So, what is then to be labeled “deep influence”? The concept is too vague. At least, one may be sure that Menger acknowledged Say’s endeavors to escape the Ricardian frame. The archival material also makes us think that, if Menger judged that Say had failed, as the evolution of his notes suggests, then he may well have meant that someone else would succeed in engaging the fight to the end. So, indeed, even if Menger felt Say had not ventured far enough to change the fate of political economy in his time, still, both his ideas and his methodology was of much relevance to Menger’s own project. And if Say had not defeated Ricardo, then Menger could see that task as his own to achieve. If, besides German Historicists in the “Dispute over Methods” (the Methodenstreit), Menger’s first opponent was in fact Ricardo, then Say was a most important ally. And Menger looked for evidence of alliance. And that is the most reasonable conclusion to draw from the available material.",7
22.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,10 May 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-008-0046-4,Ludwig von Mises on the epistemological foundation for social sciences reconstructed,March 2009,Gregor Zwirn,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this essay, I attempt to reconstruct Ludwig von Mises’s proposed epistemological foundation for the social sciences. Mises represents an interesting case for several reasons. First, he is a very prominent member of the Austrian school of economics, who not only regards himself as standing in the tradition of Carl Menger, but also brought Austrian subjectivist foundations into the twentieth century (see Oakley 1997, 3). Second, Mises was interested in a ‘sound theory of knowledge’ (Gordon 1994, 95) and thus attempted to establish a specific method for economic/social research that would generate useful (that is realistic or adequate) insights of socio-economic issues (see Mises [1949] 1966, 68). Third, there are diverging opinions amongst Austrian economists as to whether or not praxeology offers the method of the Austrian school (see Huussen 1989). For instance, the claim that the Austrian methodology was, is, and should be praxeological as articulated by Laurence Moss (1997),Footnote 1 Murray Rothbard (1976), and George Selgin (1988), is challenged by other Austrian economists, such as Bruce Caldwell (1982, 137).Footnote 2 Finally, it is interesting that competing interpretations of major aspects of Mises’s writings appear in the relevant (Austrian) literature, whereas each author can provide textual support for his/her particular reading. There is once more Caldwell (1982, 1984), who rises what he calls an ‘internal criticism’ against Mises, which, in turn, is challenged by Patrick Gunning (1991).Footnote 3 Gunning argues that Caldwell ‘by focusing on the fundamental and difficult works of Mises [...] fails to uncover the essence of the Misesian system’ (Gunning 1991, 163, 164, italics added). More recently, Gunning (2005a) challenged the criticism raised by Rothbard against Mises as regards the relationship between value freedom and laissez faire, which, in turn, was contested by Walter Block (2005).Footnote 4
 Hence, I propose a reconstruction of Mises’s epistemological foundation for the social sciences, which allows identifying, on the one hand, why the writings of Mises appear to be so difficult and engendered different as well as competing readings, and, on the other, whether or not Mises indeed offers us a sound theory of knowledge. In section 2, I present Mises’s line of reasoning, that is, his distinction between the natural and the social world (section 2.1) and respective sciences (section 2.2), which leads him to his formulation of an alternative approach for social analysis. A philosophical ground clearing is undertaken in section 3. I distinguish between ontology and epistemology in section 3.1 and clarify concepts such as understanding and explaining in section 3.2. Praxeology and Mises’s proposed alternative approach for social analysis are presented in sections 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. Section 5 starts with a reconsideration of Mises’s epistemological position and ends with some points of criticisms in section 5.1. I finish with some concluding remarks in section 6.",3

Hayek’s academic contributions span an impressive number of fields, including monetary and capital theory, constitutional economics, law, psychology, and political philosophy. Throughout his career, his work has challenged the mainstream economics profession by arguing against the acceptance of scientific socialism by mainstream economists, questioning the assumption of given information and static (rather than dynamic) markets, and denying the positivist methodology—which is still dominant—in favor of emphasizing the complexity of social phenomenon. Peter Boettke argues, however, that most people recognize Hayek for his “political vision and not his economic analytics” (2000: xii). He notes that Hayek’s early prominence as an economist turned to “ridicule” with the rise of Keynesianism. The Road to Serfdom restored Hayek’s fame but firmly established him as an ideological opponent to socialism instead of an economist, and he notes that even a distinguished economist like Paul Krugman believes that if it were not for his politics, Hayek would be “virtually forgotten” (ibid.). Hayek’s broad-ranging research program has eclipsed his economic contributions. To what extent, then, has Hayek’s work actually influenced economists?Footnote 1
 This paper provides empirical evidence on Nobel Prize winners’ influences on other Nobel laureates. I examine all of the Nobel laureates’ Prize Lectures and tally the number of citations to other laureates. The lectures are primarily summary works about the contribution mentioned by the Nobel Committee, so citations in the lectures should reflect accurately the influences on the laureates’ main work. I use only the lectures listed as the “Prize Lecture” on the official Nobel Prize webpage. Many of the laureates have published variations of their prize lecture in journals or written commentaries in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, and using the lectures on the official webpage seems like the least arbitrary method for choosing among different versions. I examine the written lectures, not the prize speech which is sometimes included and different. I exclude two laureates from this study.Footnote 2 I exclude John Nash because the Nobel website does not provide a Prize Lecture for him; instead, it lists a Prize Seminar with commentary by Kuhn, Harsanyi, Selten, Weibull, Damme, and Hammerstein with some limited discussion by Nash. William Vickrey died before giving his lecture, so Jean-Jacques Laffont gave a speech in his honor. Although likely to be consistent with each laureate’s research influences, the citations are not actually attributable to them. Clearly, this is not a perfect test of Hayek’s influence. It is possible that an economist works in a field that Hayek initially inspired, but the field has since lost that explicit distinction. Alternatively, an economist may simply not cite Hayek despite a clear influence. For example, even James Buchanan—who cites Hayek roughly three times more than either Kenneth Arrow or Milton Friedman in his collected works (Buchanan 2002)—does not cite him in his Nobel lecture. There is also variation in the length and style of the prize lectures, with some being shorter, more biographical pieces and others being detailed elaborations of the laureate’s contribution. Moreover, the internet may have increased access to academic materials and may bias the later winners to cite more people or more often. Despite these shortcomings, starting with the Nobel Prize lectures seems like a reasonable place to start to understand Hayek’s influence on the other laureates in economic science.",13

Tollison,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The choice of rules and institutions is a black box. To the extent that it has any content, one could observe that the people and groups that dominate normal politics would likely dominate constitutional politics, as was the case with the US Constitution (McGuire and Ohsfeldt 1984) Various ideas about how to generate disinterested behavior at the constitutional stage of decision making have been proposed to get around this problem, but the issue of how to obtain better institutions and better people at the constitutional stage, if the decision makers are not angels but ordinary mortals, remains with us as a practical manner. The US Constitution was a powerfully productive document, propelling a young nation along a path to prosperity and freedom. And it was crafted by individuals (Madison, Jay, Hamilton) who fit Besley’s model of principled agents. Yet it did nothing about slavery, and, arguably, the individuals who wrote it wound up running the government they created for the next 30 to 40 years (capture?). The design of better institutions starts with the design of better institutions to choose the rules we live under. The difficulty of this problem cannot be understated. Think of it this way. Suppose we convened a constitutional convention in the US? Who would participate? What would happen? What type of institutions would be selected? We often forget that we abandoned a pretty good form of government when we adopted the Constitution, namely, the Articles of Confederation. After all, we fought and won the Revolutionary War under the Articles. This was a form of government in which power flowed from the bottom-up. States could refuse to go along with policies with which they disagreed, thereby limiting moves by the central government that did not produce something like a consensus. For the most part, the Articles have a bad reputation because of the issue of slavery and secession. But set aside social issues and consider economic issues such as tariffs or pork barrel spending and it seems clear that the ability of lower units to opt out of policies that are not in their self-interest would deter tariffs and other costly policies. Viewed in this way, selective secession is not such a bad idea.",
22.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,26 March 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-009-0072-x,"Politics, selection and the public interest: Besley’s benevolent despot",June 2009,Geoffrey Brennan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Tim Besley’s (2006) book is an attempt to secure a kind of rapprochement between conventional public economics and public choice theory. As he states in the preface, his object is to leap “…the divide between the so-called benevolent dictator view of government and the public choice view” [p viii]. On the face of things, this is a serious challenge because the public choice approach originally arose out of an explicit opposition to the so-called benevolent despot model of politics (BD henceforth). For that reason it may be helpful in locating Besley’s project, to rehearse what might seem to be ancient history and examine the benevolent despot critique afresh. In public choice circles, it is something of a cliché to observe that the standard approach in public economics, virtually unquestioned until the public choice critique emerged in the 1950s and early 1960s, was characterised by its application of normative criteria directly to the set of policy instruments. The central question for policy analysis was taken to be this: Given what we know about the responses of individuals to different policy instruments, what policies would be best? It was seen to be the task of welfare economics to supply a conception of “best” (what we might term the ‘normative foundations’ of the policy enterprise) and up to the public economist to apply the normative criteria derived from that conception to alternative policy options. It is worth emphasising in this connection that the policy of doing nothing can never be “best” in any context where there is identifiable “market failure”: Therefore, in relation to market failure associated with public goods in particular, a “better” outcome (“better” in terms of conventional Paretian concepts) can always be found by definition. According to the public choice critics, this approach implicitly assumes that political processes are such that the policies isolated as best would actually be chosen. In that sense, so the line went, conventional public economics was committed to a BD model of government, and it was this model of government that the public choice critics found so singularly objectionable. The BD critique had two strands. The “despot” strand criticised the abstraction from democratic electoral (and other political) constraints. Actual policies emerge from democratic political processes and the assessment of the normative properties of policies most likely to be chosen requires some modelling of the political processes themselves. Moreover, such modelling had better be conducted on the basis of the best analytic apparatus available—hence the call for a proper ‘economic theory’ of democracy. Public choice theory was the response to this call. The other strand of the critique revolved around the “benevolence’ issue. Here, the complaint focussed on the motivational asymmetry between policymakers and policytakers. In the normative assessment of policy options, appeal has to be made to some model of the consequences of alternative policies, and the classes of models used routinely assume that ordinary agents are motivated more or less exclusively by self-interest. Simple methodological presumption would suggest that policymakers be modelled in the same way: The onus of proof should, it was argued, lie with those who would dispute motivational symmetry. Hence, in the development of models of political processes, all agents ought to be taken to be essentially self-interested, just as in the standard market models. Therefore, voters and bureaucrats and politicians and interest group officials (and any other figures relevant for political processes, including public economist/policy advisors) are all to be attributed the same self-interest motivations. Indeed [as declared by Dennis Mueller in chapter 1 of all three versions (Mueller 1979, 1989, 2003) of his sequentially monumental survey books], this “behavioural postulate” is to be seen as a defining feature of public choice scholarship. The despot and benevolence aspects of the critique are independent. It would be possible to assume that political agents exercise wide discretion in the choice of policy instruments (as in public economics orthodoxy), thus retaining the ‘despot’ element, but concede that such political agents ought to be modelled in terms of self-interest motivations. This exercise is indeed precisely what Buchanan and I set out to pursue in The Power to Tax (Brennan and Buchanan 1980)—attempting to reveal what tax norms would be normatively appropriate in a political setting where democratic electoral constraints are ineffective. In one sense, that exercise was conceived as a morality tale—with the aim of exposing just how sensitive orthodox tax policy nostrums are to political assumptions. Our object was to drive a conceptual tent-peg into the relevant terrain—to offer a kind of limiting case in the array of possible political assumptions against which policy recommendations might be checkedFootnote 1. It would, however, also be possible to address the motivational asymmetry assumption by modifying the self-interest assumption in the market setting. Imagine a spectrum of motivational possibilities running from complete self-interest to complete benevolence (public interest understood in a simple utilitarian sense): Motivational symmetry could be secured by choosing a motivational ‘model’ anywhere along that spectrum. To be sure, doing so at any point other than the self-interest limit would seem to run against the economist’s traditions; however, the move would not lack enthusiastic supporters from both outside and within the economics profession (Frank Knight, Tibor Scitovsky, Amartya Sen, Robert Frank and a large number of experimentalists, to name a few notable examples of the latter group.) In The Reason of Rules (Brennan and Buchanan 1985), Buchanan and I argued explicitly against such a strategy. On the basis of the ‘Humean principleFootnote 2’ that “in designing the various checks and balances of the constitution every man ought to be supposed a knave and have no other object in all his actions than self-interest”, we developed the defence that homo economicus assumptions were a strategic abstraction distinctively apt for comparative institutional design (or constitutional political economy, as the field came to be called).Footnote 3
 I have since changed my mind on this matter. Not that I think the arguments offered in The Reason of Rules entirely lack cogency. But I now believe that the Humean principle is too restrictive in terms of the institutional mechanisms it admits. In the years since 1985, I have become a proponent of what Tom ChristianoFootnote 4 has dubbed “revisionist” public choice theory—partly on the basis of the “expressive” account of voting (of which more anon), partly on the basis of the kinds of ‘selection’ possibilities that are the focus of Besley’s book and partly on the basis of a recognition of the role that the desire for esteem plays in social affairsFootnote 5. I still think that the incentive structures that different institutions embody are an important aspect of their operation. However, I also think selection effects are important and that material incentives are not the only ones that are relevant. In any event, conventional public economists could always defend their activities on strictly normative grounds. They could respond to their public choice critics by insisting that the approach does not assume that their policy recommendations would actually be chosen. All that was claimed was that the policies isolated are indeed the best and ought to be chosen. At this level, no claim about the operation of politics is entailed. Or, if some claim about policy choice is to be invoked, it is the weaker one that normative considerations sometimes exercise some weight. To deny this, public choice critics would have to make strong claims about human motivations—that moral considerations are always totally irrelevant in human action. The motivational asymmetry point would then be met by an appeal to (another) methodological principle: In market action where invisible hand mechanisms are in place, we can safely abstract from moral motivations; but in political settings where invisible hand processes cannot be presumed, moral motivations are an important part of what we depend on. The upshot of all this is that it is not entirely clear what the BD critique amounts to and hence what a proper response to it might be. Here are several claims that the critique might be seen as embodying:
 Strict economic egoism is the empirically most descriptive motivational assumption. It should be accepted on empirical grounds. Normative considerations can therefore play no role in policy choice. Conventional public economics is simply irrelevantFootnote 6. Accordingly, all the economic analyst can properly do is to explain and predict policy (like other social phenomena)—there is simply no room for any normative role. Conventional public economics focuses its normative attention at the wrong level. The proper domain is not “policies”, which simply emerge from political process without the mediation of normative considerations, but rather the rules of the socio/economic/political game. At this more abstract ‘constitutional level’, normative considerations do emerge because agents are sufficiently uncertain as to their future positions in the economic order to ignore “general interest” arguments. This line is familiar from the work of Buchanan and others under the “constitutional economics” rubric. Proper normative analysis of policy choice must include a recognition of the electoral and other political constraints within which policy choice operates. Failure to take those constraints into consideration will lead simply to wrong policy recommendations (just as failure to take all constraints into consideration in other arenas of choice will lead to inferior choices). The “best” policy choice must include any feedback effects on institutional arrangements, since both those arrangements and policy choices under them are of normative concern. In the face of this, where might one locate the Besley enterprise? I think somewhere between 3 and 4. It is clear that he rejects the first version. Agents in the Besley world are not all exclusively self-interested. Most of them (perhaps all) are not. More importantly, there is motivational heterogeneity: Some people are more publicly interested than others. Accordingly, when I, as a principal, come to choose among possible agents, I will choose with an eye to how extensively that agent internalises my interests. I will of course also try to set the terms of the contract between us so as to give the agent chosen an incentive to operate more closely in my interests—but in general, both selection and incentive aspects will be in play. The relation between these selection and incentive aspects is important. Sometimes, the two will be independent; sometimes, they will be mutually reinforcing; but perhaps, sometimes they will be in conflict—in which case there will be relevant trade-offs to be made. Specifically, it seems likely that in some cases (perhaps most), the amount of discretion I will give my agent will be a function of how much I believe that agent to have internalisedFootnote 7 my interests. In applying this general insight to policy choice, it seems to me that Besley is driven by three considerationsFootnote 8. The first relates to a general observation likely to be made by anyone who is close to policy advising (or to policy determination, as Besley is in his current role with the Bank of England) that lots of the players in those arenas appear to be motivated primarily by public interest considerations. I take it that part of the reason why it never occurred to public economists to think that policy advisors are predominantly self-interested is that their contact with policy advisors (including introspection) never suggested any such thing. Of course, casual observation and introspection can be misleading—but they are not to be totally disregarded. Second, Besley’s work with Ann Case on final-term State Governors in the USA suggests that, although the absence of electoral constraint seems to make a difference to gubernatorial behaviour, it does not make the kind of difference in policy choice that a self-interest model would suggest (Besley and Case 1995). Third, Besley and Coate’s (1997) citizen-based model of representation is hospitable to a selection story among voters. Begin with the question as to why candidates stand for office. Besley and Coate’s answer is that candidates care about the policy outcomes that emerge from that process: Candidates can therefore be characterised by their own private policy preferences. In selecting that agent whose preferences are closest to my own, I can be reasonably sure that she will deliver on the policies that she (and I) wants. Of course, there may be political agents who are attracted by the rents that political office offers. However, if I can distinguish between agents of that type and agents who are motivated to bring about their privately preferred policy outcomes, I will prefer the latter (other things—and specifically, chosen policy positions—equal). This then is my interpretation of where in the broad normative policy landscape Besley’s enterprise in Principled Agents lies. In what follows, I shall focus attention on three issues that Besley’s treatment, so characterised, raises. I shall not deal with the specifics of his basic model. This is not because of any antipathy to formal modelling as such. Indeed, as I shall indicate, I believe that formal modelling is indispensable in such settings as a means of disciplining the analyst’s intuitions (which, speaking from experienceFootnote 9, can often run riot in such settings). However, I think that my comparative advantage here will be to direct attention to a number of conceptual issues that seem to me to be of interest and relevance to the Besley project.",2

Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"An agent uses capital supplied by a principal to act on behalf of the principal. If this relationship works well, the agent will duplicate what the principal would have done had he been able to do the job himself. If it works imperfectly, the agent will convert some of the principal’s wealth to his own account through inadequate performance: This conversion could flow directly into the principal’s account through excessive charges for the quality of the service supplied; alternatively, it could accrue indirectly through wastage attributable to shirking. The agency relationship has potential perils, as set forth by Berle and Means (1933) in their description of the separation between ownership and control in corporations. There are, however, a variety of socially generated protections that limit the real force of this nominal separation. Indeed, the very ability of corporate bodies to survive and thrive suggests strong limits on the real force of this nominal separation. Most significantly, corporate managers must attract capital, they cannot conscript it. Agents must attract business from principals and principals can hire and fire agents at will. The canonical model of agency pertains to corporate bodies where investors entrust their capital to a manager. There is scope for a manager to convert investor wealth to his own account, but there are also several sources of protection that operate as well, as illustrated by competition for corporate control (Meckling and Jensen 1976) and the future implications of present manager performance (Fama 1980). A reasonable summary of this literature would conclude that agents are tethered to the service of principals, though the tethering device has elasticity (whether it might be somehow optimally elastic is inconclusive). What is of particular significance is that all of the various tethering devices and practices operate through the presence of transferable ownership in corporations. The quality of present management is summarized in the market value of the firm. A managerial challenger’s claim to be able to operate the firm more efficiently can be summarized by a hypothesized alternative value for the firm. A corporation might have one million shares each presently valued at $100. There is no way to obtain certain knowledge as to whether this observed value reflects efficient managerial deployment of corporate assets; however, transferable ownership provides a framework for economic calculation that facilitates the creation and testing of hypotheses about managerial performance. A claim that incumbent management is inefficient implies that corporate value could be higher than what is presently observed and with that gap in value indicating the degree of managerial inefficiency. Transferable ownership makes possible the use of a simple metric for gauging the quality of corporate management. A challenger’s objection to incumbent management would typically be represented by an alternative programmatic structure for the corporation. For instance, a challenger might propose to spin off some operations, acquire some new ones, reorganize some offices, and undertake some new activities. Projections can be formed regarding the impact of this alternative managerial program on the value of the firm. Suppose this projection calls for a firm value of $130 million, which in turn leads the incumbent to tender an offer for shares at $120, subject to the acquisition of at least 700,000 shares. The challenger proposes alternative corporate policy and is able to reduce the numerous features of those policy differences to a simple scalar. It is easy for shareholders to evaluate the incumbent relative to the challenger, for all they have to do is decide whether they want to keep their shares or sell them for $120; they do not need to pursue the details of the incumbent’s business plan. The challenger, moreover, has strong reason to be realistic in forming projections because he is the residual claimant to the accuracy of his projections. Rectitude is a blessing that pays in this setting. Instead of tending an offer for shares, the challenger might simply campaign on behalf of an alternative slate of corporate directors. This situation starts to resemble the situation with political elections. The challenger still claims that the present management is inefficient, only he is no longer willing to bet on the accuracy of his claim. It is understandable that such claims are discounted by the cheapness of ordinary talk, though even in this case, it is plausible to think that shareholders would agree that higher corporate value is superior to lower corporate value (De Angelo 1981; Mankowski 1983). Takeovers are rare in the corporate setting, and there is good reason to think that processes of managerial selection work well in securing high-quality managers.",2

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Besley (2006) views politicians as agents of the citizens who elect them and sets out on a search for principled politicians who, once elected, will support policies that further social welfare. He lays out two views of government that he considers the extremes: the benevolent despot model in which government works to further the public interest and the public choice model in which those with political power use it to reward themselves rather than the citizens at large. But the way in which Besley frames this issue seems to imply a resolution he ultimately rejects. Besley considers the benevolent despot model to rest on some notion of the social welfare. “Making sense of good government requires a performance metric. The standard economic notion is social welfare.” (2006: 21, emphasis original in all quotations). Besley (2006: 22) goes on to note, “While the social choice literature has produced elegant axiomatizations of certain kinds of social welfare functions, they are not a particularly helpful way of resolving this issue on a practical level. It is clear that the practical question is whether there are procedures that are regarded as reasonable ways of making collective choices, especially when it allocates coercive power to particular individuals. The remarkable thing about representative democracy is how readily it has been accepted as a legitimate way for this to be done.” Referencing Arrow (1951), Besley notes that even defining a measure of the social welfare is problematic, but as Samuelson (1956) argued, ultimately, we do make public policy choices according to some criteria, and those criteria define the social welfare function. Besley says that the criteria are defined by representative democracy, which has been readily accepted as a method for making social choices. Besley’s own framework reconciles this benevolent despot model with the public choice model in two short steps. First, Besley argues that representative democracy has been accepted as the set of procedures that define the public interest, and second, as Besley (2006: 24) goes on to say, “Society may be willing to have a lower level of total income or average utility in exchange for policies that promote the well-being of socially favored groups.” How does one determine who belongs to those socially favored groups? Besley has already answered this by noting that representative democracy has been readily accepted as a legitimate procedure for identifying the social welfare. The rent seekers, the interest groups, the self-interested politicians—those are the socially favored groups under representative democracy. Besley argues, first, that representative democracy is accepted as the method of defining social welfare and, second, that societies accept lower average utility in exchange for promoting the well-being of those socially favored groups. So, even though the rent seeking that provides benefits for socially favored groups lowers total income or average utility, Besley’s argument supports this as welfare enhancing because it is a product of the democratic political institutions that define social welfare. Because Besley is willing to accept democratic procedures as determinants of social welfare, it is difficult to see on what basis he can object to the actual outcomes in representative democracies.",1

The Political Economy of Good Government (2006) is a gracious effort to find a middle ground between traditional welfare economics and Virginia-style public choice. Traditional welfare economics plays ostrich in the face of government failure, blithely assuming that politicians maximize the well-being of the public. Virginia-style public choice makes the seemingly more realistic assumption that governments are composed of self-seeking individuals who face amazing opportunities to enrich themselves at the public’s expense. However, this pessimistic framework ignores the diversity of leaders’ motivation and, in any case, fails to explain why the world is not far worse. To resolve this tension, Principled Agents? (henceforth PA) gives a guided tour through the modern scholarly literature on principal–agent problems in politics. Besley is a major contributor to this body of work. However, his book is primarily a defense of the insightfulness and relevance of the contemporary mainstream approach—an approach he believes has corrected the errors of earlier scholarly debates. Traditional welfare economics erred by implicitly assuming that the well-being of the public is the sole argument in the utility function of every politician. Virginia public choice erred by embracing the opposite assumption of universal venality and by ignoring the ability of political institutions to channel politicians’ self-interest in socially beneficial directions. To truly understand democracy, Besley argues that economists must accept two great lessons: Good government is in part associated with designing an institutional framework which affects the incentives of those who make policy decisions. But good government is not entirely about incentives: it also requires good leaders—persons of character and wisdom. (Besley 2006: 2) The rest of the book focuses on formal models that capture these lessons. Besley briefly discusses some stylized facts about democracy and some econometric results from the US states. However, his main task is theoretical: formally modeling if and how voters can make their leaders serve the public interest. 
PA is careful, readable, and demonstrates a mastery of the literature. Its sincere effort to reconcile extremes and reach a reasonable middle ground will win over most academic readers. Nevertheless, Besley’s book unintentionally showcases the fundamental flaw of modern political economy: the assumption, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that voters have rational expectations—that their beliefs are, on average, trueFootnote 1. This means, for example, that if voters think that 80% of protectionist measures are socially beneficial, then 80% of these measures really are socially beneficial. While the literature freely grants that people are fallible, it insists that their mistakes are random rather than systematic and particular rather than structural. The rational expectation assumption colors Besley’s entire analysis. If, on average, voters understand their own interests, there is no need to second-guess public opinion. The pressing issue for political economists then becomes accountability—how to make leaders do what voters wantFootnote 2. In contrast, if voters have deep misconceptions about their own interests, accountability is largely a red herring. If the public systematically misunderstands its own interests, who cares whether politicians stray from public opinion?Footnote 3 The important topics then become (a) how popular misconceptions distort policy and (b) whether agency failures mitigate these distortions—or amplify them. The next section of this review briefly reviews the empirical case against the rational voter assumption and explains why blatant voter irrationality is a more compelling explanation for real-world political failure than subtle principal–agent problems. Section 3 goes on to argue that if voters were rational, many real-world political agency failures would be easy to fix. Common-sense institutional changes and voting strategies could put government on a tight leash; political slack persists largely because common sense is not so common. Section 4 concludes.",6
22.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,06 February 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-009-0075-7,The principal difficulty: Besley’s neo-Rousseavian aspirations,June 2009,Michael C. Munger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"But the literature to which Prof. Besley is contributing would clearly accept the “principal–agent” premise, and it is useful. Even at my most pessimistic, I certainly believe that some forms of government are worse, perhaps much worse, than others, and the idea that accountability and responsiveness are best analyzed in a model with clear microfoundations is so obvious that it needs no defending. So, let us evaluate Besley’s enterprise, on its own terms, accepting the premise. Jean Jacques Rousseau was the first to unbottle the genie that Besley is trying to model. For Rousseau (1762/2008), the “general will” was an anthropomorphic entity, an organism with an independent existence and volition. Responsiveness to the general will, or the set of interests that are collectively (in fact unanimously) shared by self-interest properly understood, is the objective of the model. Electoral majorities would rarely, if ever, direct agents toward the general will because they are composed of aggregations of particular wills. Instead, what would be necessary is the active selection of a particular kind of leader, the lawgiver or législateur. My reading of Besley, then, is that the législateur is the principal. It is the only conception that makes sense of his presentation. Invoking “the” median voter will not do it because there is no median voter, or, rather, there are too many, with every division of the dollar, every new majority coalition, constituting a new and contradictory principal. Once we understand Besley’s neo-Rousseauvian aspirations, the rest follows pretty easily. The main problem of the political system is to induce the proper selection, to ensure that politicians who manage to get elected are either preference clones of the mythical législateur or else are responsive, highly competent, and dutiful agents, who act as the législateur would have them act. Rousseau’s solution here, as in all contracts, is to inscribe the law on a man’s heart, rather than impose it as an external constraint. This solution is perfectly conventional, in Europe, but reflects a different conception of politics than usually seen in America. Besley cites Madison as being concerned about selecting a “natural aristocracy,” and this was in fact a concern for the Founders. But I read Madison’s primary goal as what we would now call mechanism design: “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.” In Federalist #51, Madison (1788/2008) puts it this way: 
This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other—that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State.
 That is, Madison was skeptical of the whole “better motives” approach, on which Besley rests most of his hopes for “Principled Agents.” Instead, Madison believed that supplying antagonistic private interests was the answer to the principal–agent problem, making each individual a “sentinel.” So, while Besley is quite right to specify means by which selection could be made to work for us, optimism for this approach is not widely shared on the western side of the Atlantic, in 1788, in 1974, or in 2009.",1

The fourteen chapters (not including the Introduction authored by the editors) critically examine U.S. foreign policy with a particular emphasis on the relevance of noninterventionism as an alternative to current policy. This book is not intended to be a specific contribution to Austrian economics. That said, Austrian economists will find this volume intriguing because they have long engaged in the economic and historical analysis of foreign policy and global interventionism. In light of the United States’ long history of global interventionism, the insights of this volume and the writings of Austrian economists on these issues are of the utmost contemporary importance. The purpose of this essay is twofold. First, I aim to provide the reader with an overview of the main contents of Opposing the Crusader State. Second, I discuss some of the central themes in the writings of Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek and Murray Rothbard on the topics of U.S. foreign policy, global interventionism, and the alternative of noninterventionism. In doing so, I hope to show how elements of the insights of the authors in Opposing the Crusader State can be found in the work of these scholars. Although not explicitly intended to be a contribution to Austrian economics, many of the papers in the volume under review complement and expand on the earlier writings of Austrian economists.",1

It is a sprawling collection of historical anecdotes, biographic miniatures, and theoretical concepts from economics. This sprawl results from the multiple goals that the book tries to achieve, including:
 providing a sense of the professional life of economists, from graduate school and the pressures of publishing, on through the cycle of conferences, classes, and research presenting a history of economic thought, from Adam Smith (with comments about the Physiocrats and other precursors to Smith) up to Paul Romer’s 1990 paper “Endogenous Technological Change” (also known as Romer 90) convincing us that the adoption of ever-more-difficult mathematics (frequently referred to by Warsh as “rocket science”) has been the key to progress in economics describing the evolution of a particular tension within economic theory, between the idea of increasing returns (the Pin Factory) and competition based on diminishing returns (the Invisible Hand). Approached correctly, this kind of collection is like a good rummage sale. You can find random little treasures littered throughout, so long as you keep moving and don’t let yourself get stuck at any particular point wondering “What is this thing and why is it here?” One example of a little treasure is Warsh’s account of Greg Mankiw’s stubborn loyalty to the Solow model, which helps to put a human face on an otherwise awkward theoretical position. There is also a wonderful reminiscence from Paul Krugman about his presentation to the 1979 Summer Institute of the NBER and how that one presentation validated him as a serious economist and catapulted him into professional success. There are lots of interesting little nuggets like these in the book; more than enough to sufficiently reward readers for their efforts. Unfortunately, the book’s problems arise from this same rummage sale character, or rather, from Warsh’s attempts to weld this miscellany into a single narrative, a story line with heroic protagonists: the “Moderns” who embrace “rocket science.” By implication then, the story also has villains: literary and less-mathematical economists. Warsh portrays economic history as essentially being one long march towards the rightful and necessary triumph of the idea of increasing returns and, more specifically, Paul Romer’s 1990 paper “Endogenous Technical Change.” But the history of economic thought does not fit well into a single storyline, and the ideas Warsh touches upon suffer from his efforts to make them fit. The most glaring example is probably his treatment of the idea of increasing returns itself. To build his narrative, Warsh conflates several different ideas under the single label of “increasing returns.” He uses this label, at various points in the text, to describe: the benefits of specialization, as in Adam Smith’s Pin Factory; the manufacturing cost advantages of traditional increasing returns to scale; the phenomenon of network benefits, where an increase in the number of users directly increases the value of the network for each user; the theory of monopolistic competition; the ideas of technological path-dependence and lock-in; the non-rivalrousness of knowledge; the peculiar, near-zero marginal production costs of digital goods; specialization as formally defined in Romer’s model as consisting of new goods and services; and the fact that industrialized economies enjoy seemingly endless positive rates of growth. In truth, some of these concepts are related to each other, and certainly all of them can be operating simultaneously in a given industry, for example, computer operating systems. But the fact is that they are all different phenomena, with different causes, and whose influence (or even presence) varies wildly from industry to industry and era to era. They can all be described and communicated effectively without reference to the others. By reducing them to a level of abstraction where they can all simply be described as “increasing returns,” Warsh largely empties them of their meaning and value. And his account of them, therefore, is so brief and generalized, so limited to asserting their role in supporting his narrative, that readers who are not already familiar with them will be confused at best and actually mislead at worst. Knowledge stands as a warning of the dangers involved in trying to force economic theory into a storyline where we are encouraged to root for particular ideas and economists.",

The work of experimentalist psychologists (Kahneman, Knetsch, Thaler and Vernon Smith) has enabled the appearance of a certain number of anomalies and biases. Holcombe concentrates on the contributions of experimental and behavioral psychology to reveal the differences between the neo-classical and Austrian approaches to individual behaviour. The Austrians’ analysis of the decision shares the same character of axiomatisation with the neo-classics but in contrast with the latter its results are not incompatible with the empirical conclusions of the new experimental economy. ‘The behavioral assumptions underlying the Austrian approach to economics are considerably less restrictive that those underlying neo-classical economics, and are not inconsistent with the findings of behavioral and experimental economics’. Holcombe calls for the use of alternatives to the traditional methods for widening the field of decisional theory, by applying it to the study of questions of public policy and welfare theory. The robust behavioral foundations of the Austrian theory enables it to be used as a base for such a widening, at the same time connecting it with existing views. Vernon Smith takes into account the institutional dimension and thus moves the experimental economy closer to themes to which the Austrians have long been wedded. In a complementary approach to Holcombe’s, Paul Dragos Aligica and Anthony Evans attempt to clarify the real nature of the Austrian methodology, relating it to his recent developments. Their article advances the idea that the contemporary Austrian tradition offers in an original way ‘a balanced combination of abstract reasoning and empirical analysis’. The authors identify the comparative and counterfactual research strategies available to the Austrians, allowing the mixing of conjectural history, the study of the spontaneous orders and empirical analysis. The counterfactual and comparative approach, based around the notion of ‘thought experiments’ takes pride of place in the Austrian methodology: “From a formal perspective an application focused on an implicit contrast between an imagined ideal case and the real life examples, has the same structure with the comparison and contrast between two or more real life cases.... Counterfactual analysis and causal comparative analysis are two faces of the same coin”. These twin axes have always been part of the Austrian cognitive agenda, not only in the older generations (for example the evenly rotating economy or the method of imaginary constructions) but also in the new ones, especially through the recent institutional economy of comparative economic systems. In this way, the authors clamour for a vital effort for advances in the strategy of qualitative and comparative studies in the analysis of social phenomena. This approach aims to validate the Austrian tools’ operational status, with concrete case studies, all the while avoiding the descriptivist trap. Aligica and Evans find that Rothbard’s (1963) analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s is the perfect illustration of the strengths of this approach, which also can be found in many contemporary works such as Boettke’s, Stringham’s, Coyne’s and Leeson’s. Christelle Mougeot and Francis Bismans’ article corresponds well to such an effort of application of the Austrian tools. These two authors are part of a movement aiming to bring empirical contents to the Austrian cycle theory. They revisit in an interesting way Austrian issues with statistical treatment. The power of the theoretical frame is demonstrated by historical interpretation; as they say themselves, from this angle, empirical proof can be seen as similar to historical proof. The article establishes an empirical test of sequences of the Austrian theory of the cycle. The authors’ question is this: does Mises’ and Hayek’s approach, based around questions of interest rates, relative prices and disequilibrium between spending on investment goods and consumer goods enable the explanation of observed fluctuations in the whole economic activity? Using a panel data econometric model, their answer is yes. Agnes Festré and Pierre Garrouste aim to re-evaluate Hayek’s legacy of norms in their article. They examine the highly delicate subject of group selection in Hayek’s thinking, much debated by the Austrians; many see in this reference of Hayek’s a contradiction with the principle of methodological individualism so dear to the Austrians. For these two authors, however, the critiques concerning the way Hayek defines unity of selection underestimate the distinction between social and individual rules (a crucial distinction for Hayek). Their claim is that there is no contradiction from the moment that a double selection process, that is individual and collective, is revealed. Based on recent works validating this type of approach, the authors re-establish the legitimacy of the notion of group selection; however, they do stress that this view is limited by other aspects of Hayek’s thinking, notably his connexionist mind analysis of individual perception. So they integrate tools of games theory and experimental economy into Austrian analysis in order to remove certain obstacles and better examine the process of the emergence of norms. This special edition combining the contributions of two reviews, the Review of Austrian Economics and the Revue Française d’Economie, would not be complete without showing the roots of Austrian thinking in France. Gilles Campagnolo’s article does this admirably. Menger’s lineage of authors such as Say, Rossi, Chevalier and Bastiat has already been recorded in Austrian literature. Gilles Campagnolo, however, offers us a new and precise view of the way that Menger’s work has inspired the French, based on first-hand examination of the archives in the Menger collections of Hitotsubashi University in Japan and Duke University’s Perkins library in the USA. It only remains for us to thank the authors and also the many, without whom this special edition could never have seen the light of day: among the representatives of the Review of Austrian Economics, Peter J. Boettke, Christopher J. Coyne and Pierre Garrouste for having accepted the original idea of a joint special Franco-American project of a special issue published by two academic reviews; among the French, Christian Schmidt on the one hand and Philippe Trainar and the whole editorial committee of the Revue Française d’Economie on the other for having respectively relayed and enthusiastically welcomed this project; Pascale Casati, whose kindness, patience and efficiency were key to the project’s smooth running; finally, a special mention to Loïc Sauce, who generously contributed his time and knowledge of Austrian thought to the French translation of the Aligica/Evans and Holcombe texts.",2
22.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,08 July 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-009-0089-1,A reformulation of the foundations of welfare economics,September 2009,Randall G. Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The appropriate place to begin in formulating a foundation for welfare economics is to look at what one is trying to measure. Following Pigou’s lead, welfare economics should begin by looking at factors that improve people’s material well-being. And, if one takes as a point of departure people’s well-being in the real world rather than some theoretical framework, in the real world welfare is improved through economic progress. People were better off at the end of the twentieth century than they were at the beginning, for example, not because the economy was any closer to Pareto optimality at the end of the century, as neoclassical welfare economics seems to imply, but because economic progress had enhanced people’s opportunity sets. Increasing incomes allowed people to consume more of everything, and at least as important, economic progress has offered people the opportunity to consume new goods and improved versions of old ones that nobody had the opportunity to consume in the past. Many of the transactions people can undertake today that would not have been in their opportunity sets in the past were made possible by transactions that had preceded them, as progress in one market enables progress in others. For example, supermarkets replaced corner grocery stores because the development of the automobile allowed supermarkets to attract customers from a wider area who were able to buy more each time they shopped because they could carry their purchases in their cars. Similarly, “big box” retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy rely on automobile travel to draw customers from a wide geographical area who bring with them the means (their automobiles) to transport their purchases home. The development of the automobile led to the development of the supermarket and the big box retailer, giving shoppers a greater variety of choices at lower cost. Economic progress has increased the efficiency of the production process, replacing hand production with assembly lines—sometimes under robotic control—and has produced a new array of goods and services that people could consume. Rather than traveling by horse and buggy, or by steam locomotive, people travel in air-conditioned automobiles and jet aircraft. They communicate via cellular telephones and over the internet rather than by mailing letters. They watch television for news and entertainment, in addition to reading newspapers and magazines. And they consume more of everything because increases in productivity came along with improvements in the types of goods and services produced. Looking at real-world economic welfare, it is apparent that welfare maximization is not accurately described as arriving at a Pareto optimal allocation of resources. Rather, welfare is maximized by creating an institutional environment that facilitates economic progress and gives entrepreneurs the incentive to introduce innovations into the economy that consumers value more highly than the status quo. Following Smith (1776), this enhances the division of labor, which Smith says is the source of “the greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour.” Economic progress occurs as the division of labor increases as a result of an ongoing expansion in the availability of mutually agreeable exchanges. Innovators search for profit opportunities, understanding that they can benefit by offering others exchange opportunities they would prefer to the status quo. This suggests a process-oriented approach rather than the neoclassical outcome-based approach that depicts welfare maximization as a static outcome. Welfare is improved by lowering impediments to mutually advantageous exchanges so that people can engage in transactions that were not previously possible and buy goods and services that were not previously available. The opportunity for such exchanges gives entrepreneurs the incentives to take risks and innovate to bring better products to market. As Smith (1776: 423) notes, the entrepreneur “intends only his own gain,” but is “led by an invisible hand” to “promote the public interest.” Welfare is maximized by policies that enhance this process that generates economic progress.",3
22.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,27 February 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-009-0082-8,"Thought experiments, counterfactuals and comparative analysis",September 2009,Paul Dragos Aligica,Anthony J. Evans,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Austrian economists tend to agree that “thought experiments”, broadly defined, are an important element of their school of thought. In their own influential overview, Peter Boettke and David Prychitko include the “method of imaginary constructions” as being among the five main characteristics of the Austrian school and briefly elaborate the notion (Boettke and Prychitko 1994: 289–90). Thought experiments, which were known as the gedankenexperiment in the natural sciences, allow scientists to take existing information that is based on known phenomena and mentally manipulate it into new configurations that can advance the frontiers of knowledge. Consequently, they can be seen as either a close companion—or form of—the deductive approach to scientific investigation. New knowledge is created from empirically grounded old knowledge through a special mixture of imagination and deductive logic. The Austrians agree that when information about events, actors and phenomena are combined using basic intuitions or theories about the nature of human action, the new configuration emerging out of the mental exercise may bring important new insights, and new knowledge may be created. While there is implicit agreement on the importance of thought experiments to the Austrian tradition, the consensus breaks down when it comes to assess the details of the method and especially its place within the recent developments—or “post-revival”—period of the school. The split was clearly articulated by Lawrence Moss in a paper explicitly “stressing the importance of imaginary constructions in Austrian economics” (Moss 1997:151). Moss makes the case that contemporary Austrians “have kept a cautious distance from the several classic imaginary constructions that have guided the Austrian school throughout much of its history” (Moss 1997:151) and that the emphasis has shifted to a more empirical and historical approach. “The contemporary effort is to appreciate how spontaneous social formations can outperform conscious design and produce coordinative market outcomes. The emphasis has shifted towards the conjectural history that we find in Adam Smith and the other Scottish social theorists of the eighteenth century and away from the logical search for the necessary and sufficient conditions needed to sustain an organized society” Moss (1997:151) Thus, Moss sees a divide between the older Austrian economists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—for whom thought experiments were important elements of their theorizing—and the new generation that has “abandoned” such methods. However, it is important to note that beyond this claim, Moss’s concerns run deeper: his worry is that in a rush for empiricism, “existential descriptions of the market process have replaced the clever logical arguments that once confronted all serious students of Austrian economics”, and that “the method of imaginary constructions is in rapid retreat” (Moss 1997:167). Indeed, he fears that Austrian economics might “dispense with abstract reasoning altogether”, “specializing in existential descriptions of reality” (Moss 1997:161). This paper could be seen as an attempt to bridge the intellectual divide articulated by Moss, to contribute to the further development of the core elements of Austrian methodology and finally to outline several frameworks that offer concrete tools for empirical work that retains the rich Austrian tradition. The paper assesses Moss’ argument and demonstrates why what may be perceived as “abandonment” bolsters rather than precludes the role of thought experiments and related modes of analysis in the Austrian paradigm. The article takes a step further and identifies an entire family of comparative and counterfactual analysis research strategies available to the Austrians, all enjoying a solid epistemological and methodological grounding. The article points out that the domain and potential of these strategies seem to be considerably larger than one may think and that the fine examples offered by current and older Austrian work until now are tapping just a small part of this potential. Consequently, the newer tradition that stems from the likes of Boettke and Prychitko (1994) offers a balanced combination of abstract reasoning and empirical analysis that is far from being a “poor substitute for the classic Austrian thought experiment” (Moss 1997:166).",11

22.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,03 September 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-008-0063-3,"A symposium on Theodore Burczak’s, Socialism after Hayek",September 2009,Andrew Farrant,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Though candidly ceding that advocates of government “activism in the economy ignore Hayek’s insights at their intellectual peril” (Burczak 2006, p. 2), Ted Burczak provocatively argues that the goals of classical socialism can be “achieved without central planning and the abolition of private property” (p. 3). Although Austrian political economy has traditionally deemed Marxian socialism to necessitate full-blown command planning and the wholesale abolition of private property (see, e.g., Lavoie 1985; Boettke 2001), Burczak’s Marxism is of the decidedly postmodern UMASS–Amherst variety (exemplified by the group associated with the journal Rethinking Marxism) and bears scant resemblance to the centralized “command and control” planning schemes that Ludwig von Mises ably demolished in the early 1920s. Similarly, postmodern Marxism (see, e.g., Resnick and Wolff 1987) involves the blanket rejection of old-style essentialist Marxian theory: e.g., the deterministic “base implies superstructure” baggage that so irked Mises. Indeed, rather than critiquing private property and the market economy per se, the Amherst school argues for the abolition of exploitative class processes (whether capitalism of the US private or Soviet state variety), with Burczak explicitly denying any necessary “one-to-one relationship between the presence or absence of private property, markets, and central planning and the existence of exploitative class processes” (p. 7). For the Amherst school, exploitation occurs whenever workers produce a surplus that is appropriated by someone other than the workers themselves (see, e.g., Wolff 2007, p. 324). Accordingly, Burczak argues that democratic labor-managed enterprises would facilitate the attainment of the goals of classical socialism (e.g., the abolition of exploitation), while not simultaneously falling foul of the Hayekian knowledge problem. In arguing his post-Hayekian socialist case, Burczak provides a rich and highly persuasive synthesis of Hayek, Bowles, Gintis, Resnick, Wolff, Sen, Ellerman, and Nussbaum. Similarly, the late Don Lavoie’s path-breaking work on the knowledge problem features heavily throughout Burczak’s argument. Indeed, Burczak readily accepts the Mises–Hayek critique of command planning: Central planners cannot rationally plan an advanced modern economy (pp. 7–8). Intriguingly, Burczak’s favored post-Hayekian socialism squarely fits with Lavoie’s insight that although market processes and private property are vitally necessary engines of social coordination, it is not necessary that… [private] ownership be of any particular historically familiar form. It is only necessary that ownership be polycentric as opposed to centrally planned… Owners could be workers’ councils, stockholders, wealthy capitalists, maverick entrepreneurs, or any combination of these or other as yet unimagined arrangements so long as their plans are separately devised, their person and property legally protected, and their projects permitted to strive in open competition for scarce resources (Lavoie 1985, p.48, italics added). Burczak truly appreciates the arguments made by Mises and Hayek during the socialist calculation debate of the 1930s and 1940s. Similarly, Burczak is well aware of the standard Austrian objections to the labor theory of value. Accordingly, rather than grounding his argument for collective appropriation (the democratic labor-managed firm) in traditional Marxian value theory, Burczak creatively combines David Ellerman’s labor theory of property (Ellerman 1992) with postmodern Marxist class theory (Resnick and Wolff 1987) to argue for a post-Hayekian market socialism where the workers responsible for producing a firm’s output jointly appropriate the product of their labor. Thus, Burczak favors the abolition of the traditional capitalist “wage-for-labor-time” exchange, considering the latter to perpetuate the legal fraud that workers can factually alienate their will and responsibility for their actions (p. 112): The workers in a capitalist firm assuming “the legal status of things” (Burczak 2006, p. 117). Burczak’s argument should generate much interest (and counterargument) from economists of an Austrian persuasion. Burczak argues that capitalist economies are systematically biased against the asset poor, thereby challenging Hayek’s “contention that market economies improve the life chances of anyone chosen at random” (p. 59). Burczak provocatively combines the credit-rationing literature and Bowles–Gintis contested exchange theory (see, e.g., Bowles and Gintis 1993; Bowles 2004) with Austrian insights to persuasively argue that large-scale asset redistribution would allow society to benefit from the tacit knowledge of the currently asset poor (unable to take advantage of whatever unique entrepreneurial insights they have since—lacking collateral—they are unable to obtain credit at any price). Similarly, Burczak contends that sweeping changes in residual claimancy status (making the relevant decision makers residual claimant on their noncontractible actions) would attenuate various incentive problems. Burczak here deftly weaves together Hayek’s work on tacit knowledge and subjectivism with Bowles and Gintis’s argument that capitalist residual claimancy rights exacerbate incentive-compatibility problems (see, e.g., Bowles and Gintis 1993). Bowles and Gintis consider the capitalist economy an inherently political structure (the capitalist firm is a “command and control” power structure), with endogenous claim enforcement (contingent renewal strategies) proving the norm in markets with incomplete contracts (contested exchange markets such as the markets for labor and credit). Accordingly, contested exchange markets do not clear in competitive equilibrium (the cost of job loss would otherwise be zero, with contingent renewal strategies accordingly lacking any bite in clearing markets), with involuntary unemployment and credit rationing proving an inevitable attribute of a capitalist economy. Austrians will challenge Burczak’s contention that democratic labor-managed firms can reap efficiency gains that are unavailable to the conventional capitalist firm. Indeed, Peter Boettke (1998) has suggested that labor-managed firms have “not passed a basic survivorship test” (p. 88). Thus (assuming Burczak is correct), we can ask why the Coase theorem is inapplicable? After all, Burczak’s view that democratic enterprises are more efficient than their capitalist counterparts presumably implies that a firm’s workforce place a higher value on residual claimancy rights than the capitalist owners, with the latter proving readily willing to sell their control rights and cash flow rights to the former. Any such “Coase-type” objection to the alleged efficiency properties of the labor-managed firm, however, rather heroically assumes away incentive problems in credit markets (e.g., moral hazard and adverse selection), and tacitly presupposes complete contracting (see, e.g., Bowles and Gintis 1993; Bowles 2004). With incomplete contracting, by contrast, incentive problems cannot merely be wished away. While any debt-financed transfer of firm ownership would attenuate incentive problems within the firm (e.g., incentive incompatibilities relating to worker effort), similar incentive problems would then arise relating to debt repayment. Similarly, with incomplete contracting, incentive problems arise if the labor-managed firm leases rather than owns its capital equipment. There is much in Socialism after Hayek that will generate fruitful dialog between postmodern Marxists (among others) and Austrians (see, e.g., Storr 2007). For instance, Burczak rather persuasively argues that much of the corpus of Hayek’s social theory (e.g., Hayek’s analysis of the common law) is decidedly inconsistent with Hayek’s postmodern economics (p. 58). Similarly, to what extent do postmodern Marxists (other than Burczak) appreciate the Mises–Hayek critique of command planning? For instance, Wolff (2007, p. 332) appears to consider that centralized planning may be a feasible option, remarking that, under communism (clearly to be understood in Amherst school terms as the absence of exploitative class processes), enterprises will coordinate their activity through market “mechanisms or centralized planning or decentralized planning or various combinations of all three.” Burczak rightly argues that heterodox economists (of whatever stripe) would do well to pay serious attention to Hayek’s postmodern economics rather than dismissing Hayek as merely a conservative reactionary (p. 1). Market process economists will hopefully pay similarly serious attention to Burczak’s arguments. Indeed, as David Prychitko notes on the cover to Socialism after Hayek, Burczak is well on his way to persuasively answering Austrian objections to Hayekian socialism.",

Not only is it historically a well-informed tapping into the roots of our discipline but also lends itself to modern theoretical and experimental developments. Of particular interest is the role that the work of Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis can play in helping to flesh out the concerns of Burczak and Hayek. Bowles, Burczak, Gintis, Hayek, and Knight all see a central role for human sociality to play in economics. When thinkers with so very different ideological orientations find common ground, there is surely something to be gained by a creative synthesis of their insights. Burczak’s Socialism after Hayek (2006) has already made the crucial first steps. Let us hope that others will take up his invitation to follow.",

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In his discussion of behavioral economics, Kahneman (2003) describes individual behavior as boundedly rational, following Simon (1955). Kahneman (2003: 1449) notes that people have systematic biases in their behavior and beliefs that make people’s actual choices different from those that are assumed in the rational agent models of neoclassical economics. Kahneman goes on to note that the findings of behavioral economics have implications for economic research generally. When compared to the neoclassical utility maximization framework, some choices people systematically make appear to be anomalies, according to Kahneman et al. (1991). They go on to describe empirically documented anomalies in which people do not act as the neoclassical model predicts, and indeed where actual behavior appears to be suboptimal, using neoclassical utility maximization as the benchmark. Vernon Smith (1982) makes a similar point with regard to experimental economics, where he differentiates what economics has created from what it has discovered. The theories and hypotheses generated by economics are creations, but economists cannot be confident that those creations represent the facts of the world until they have been found to correspond to reality by observation. Smith (1974: 321) criticizes neoclassical economics, “…the microeconomic theory of the pre-1960s…” as a “dead end.” He says, “Fortunately for the economy, but unfortunately for academic economics, this formulation of Pareto efficiency is not the problem that real markets and other allocative institutions attempt to solve.” Smith (1994) echoes sentiments similar to Kahneman’s in describing the role of experiments in economics. Theories can be tested in the laboratory, and when theories fail, the reasons for the failures can be explored in a laboratory setting. Smith notes the same anomalies as Kahneman et al. (1991) and argues that an experimental setting can help uncover the reasons for those anomalies. Isaac (2002) discusses the free rider problem, noting studies by Smith (1980), Palfrey and Prisbrey (1997), Ledyard (1995), and others showing that in experimental settings, people do not behave as the neoclassical framework would predict. Smith also emphasizes that institutions matter. People make choices in settings that appear identical within the choice-theoretic setting of neoclassical economics but that have subtle institutional differences. Camerer (2003) gives a good overview of experimental results that find regularities in human behavior outside the predictions of neoclassical utility theory and that show how subtle differences in institutional structure can lead to measurably different choices on the part of individuals. Naturally, this points toward analyzing the institutional framework within which people engage in economic behavior rather than analyzing behavior in a setting that is purposefully designed to be devoid of institutional details. In theory, an advantage of analyzing behavior in a setting that is devoid of institutional details is that the conclusions of such analyses should be applicable across a variety of institutional settings. In practice, however, because the institutional setting does affect the choices people make, this apparent advantage of an institution-free framework turns out to be a disadvantage, at least when the goal is to understand the way that people behave in real-world settings. The line between behavioral and experimental economics is blurred because both use experimental methods to search for empirical regularities in individual behavior.Footnote 1 In practice, behavioral economics has tended to focus more on behavioral anomalies that appear to contradict the axioms of neoclassical utility maximization, whereas experimental economics has tended to focus on finding behavioral regularities in settings where the predictions of neoclassical utility theory are ambiguous. Even this generalization does not always hold up, however, so this paper discusses behavioral and experimental economics as if they are two components of one broader area of inquiry based on their common experimental methodology. Behavioral and experimental economics are relatively new as economic subdisciplines, having appeared only in the last half of the twentieth century. While the economics profession treats them as subdisciplines, they are perhaps more accurately viewed as alternative methodologies for developing theories of economic behavior. The mainstream method in economics of developing theories of behavior is conjecture based on axioms of rational choice. But it is clear from behavioral and experimental economics that people do not actually behave as those axioms dictate in many real-world situations.",10
22.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,05 September 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-008-0058-0,Hayek and liberal pedagogy,December 2009,Robert F. Garnett Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Hayek’s concepts of knowledge and learning, and his alertness to “the epistemic-cognitive properties of alternative institutional arrangements” (Boettke 2002, 265), suggest a provocative reframing of the basic pedagogical problem: How to educate? In “Economics and Knowledge” (1948a [1937]), Hayek poses what he deems “the central problem of economics as a social science”: How can the combination of fragments of knowledge existing in different minds bring about results which, if they were to be brought about deliberately, would require a knowledge on the part of the directing mind which no single person can possess? (1948a [1937], 54) Hayek employs this “division of knowledge” argument to criticize standard equilibrium models of a market economy. Hayek regards these models as epistemologically statist, despite their pro-market pretenses, because they assume that all relevant knowledge is “given to a single mind” (a Walrasian auctioneer) and thereby reduce society’s economic problem to the allocation of known resources among known alternative uses. Hayek amplifies these points in “The Use of Knowledge in Society” (1945) by asking, “What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational economic order?” On certain familiar assumptions the answer is simple enough. If we can start out with from a given system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of the available means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic… This, however, is emphatically not the economic problem which society faces (Hayek 1948b [1945], 77). The actual problem, Hayek argues, is how to utilize “the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use,” despite the fact that this knowledge “is not given to anyone in its totality” (Hayek 1948b [1945], 77–78). This redefinition of society’s economic problem leads Hayek to emphasize the value of each individual’s “man-on-the-spot” knowledge: [T]here is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation (1948b [1945], 80). In later work, Hayek stresses that each individual’s unique knowledge is largely tacit or inarticulate (Lavoie 1995a), and that this latent knowledge becomes active only when a person is “faced with a problem where this will help” (Hayek 1979, 190). The central economic problem, therefore, is not merely how to aggregate the separately held pieces of “unique information” but how to induce “those who know where the relevant information is to be found” to employ their unique abilities to discover and convey previously unknown or inarticulate knowledge (Hayek 1979, 190; Lavoie 1995a). Transposed into the pedagogical realm, this set of propositions suggests that our central task as teachers—indeed, the defining task of a liberal pedagogy—is to increase our students’ connectivity to local and extended orders of learning (e.g., the knowledge and feedback of peers, professors, and wider intellectual communities) in order to discipline and inspire their thinking, cultivate their intellectual autonomy, and enrich their contributions to the learning of others. A Hayekian perspective further implies that educational order is best conceived as grown rather than made, a cosmos rather than a taxis (Hayek 1973, 35–54; Hayek 1978, 72–76). The taxis view of education equates teaching with instruction: a top-down process in which learning is engineered by a teacher/planner who is assumed to possess all relevant knowledge about the ends and means of the educational enterprise. In contrast, a Socratic minority of educators has long sought to recast the college classroom as a spontaneous order, a series of rule-guided interactions among separate individuals that yields—for each learner and for the class as a whole—not just an “accumulation of data” but “an enhancement of our interpretive powers and our tacit understanding of an unfolding reality” (Lavoie 1985b, 58), “a kind of ‘intelligence’ that is far greater than the sum of its parts” (Lavoie 1995a, 125).Footnote 1 In this cosmos model, teaching is not the delivery of information but the institution of decentralized learning processes through which students develop their own connections to a set of ideas, subject to the constraints of formal and informal academic rules and guided by critical feedback from teachers, peers, professional literature, and the subject matter itself. By utilizing more of the existing knowledge (and ignorance) in our classrooms, an education-as-cosmos model has the potential to generate more and better learning for students and teachers alike. The more teachers can persuade students to put their unique insights, questions, and confusions on the table, the more effectively the classroom cosmos can transform students’ privately held ideas (“money in their pocket”) into intellectual resources (“money in the bank”) for the learning community as a whole.Footnote 2
Taxis pedagogies truncate this web of learning by presuming that all relevant knowledge flows from the top down, from expert teachers and textbooks to untrained, empty-headed students.Footnote 3
 This broadly Hayekian rubric could be used to recast the aims and methods of liberal learning at many levels of academic life, not just in individual courses but across departmental and university curricula and even within the minds of individual students where learning arises from the discovery of connections among previously disparate strands of knowledge (Horwitz 2000, 24). At every level, the presence or absence of order coincides with the achievement or non-achievement of learning.Footnote 4 This paper is concerned with one specific form of emergent learning: that which defines our task as college teachers. The following discussion focuses primarily on the philosophy and theory of the classroom order, but the penultimate section suggests strategies for implementing Hayekian pedagogies in practice.",4
22.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,26 November 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-008-0068-y,Different employment of capitals in vertically integrated sectors: Smith after the Austrians,December 2009,Ferdinando Meacci,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"After arguing that “Smith’s failures to persuade economists were, like his successes, of two sorts: failures that were proper and failures that would have been successes”, Stigler (1976) claims that “the most conspicuous of Smith’s proper failures was the hierarchy of employments of capital, presented in book 2, chapter 5, ‘Of the Different Employments of Capital’”Footnote 1. Stigler’s position is not isolated. Chapter 5, book 2, of The Wealth of Nations (henceforth: chapter 5) has attracted so many criticisms both in the classical period (“a doctrine so manifestly erroneous”, McCulloch 1864: 121) and in modern times (“the most illogical argument”, Cannan 1917: 68; “at first sight this is an awful muddle”, O’Brien 1975 [2004]: 208; “an argument that has struck many commentators as tortuous in the extreme”, Blaug 1962: 56; “among the less successful parts of the edifice”, Campbell and Skinner 1976: 32; “ambiguous, confusing and mutually inconsistent”, Negishi 1989: 95) that nowadays it is either ignored as an innocuous divertissement or is regarded as one of the gravest contradictions of Smith’s system of thought.Footnote 2
 The purpose of this paper is to part from the mainstream of these interpretations and to show that chapter 5 is rather one of Smith’s “failures that would have been successes”. It will be argued that the key for getting to this conclusion lies in two notions that have been developed in economic theory long after Smith wrote the Wealth. One is the old Austrian notion of time-consuming methods of production and the related principle of the higher productivity of more roundabout methods (Böhm-Bawerk 1888 [1959]). The other is the notion of vertical division of labour (Hayek 1941: 73–74) and the more modern notion of vertical integration (Hicks 1973; Pasinetti 1973). These notions, it will be argued, are implicit in Smith’s theory of capital and can be utilized in reconstructing his arguments on the different employment of capitals. This reconstruction will be achieved in this paper by determining not so much what Smith meant (an impossible task if it is true that his arguments are not only “tortuous” but also “ambiguous, confusing and mutually inconsistent”), but rather, what he should have meant to be consistent with other parts of his theory or, more precisely, what his arguments mean after the improvements added to the intergenerational theory of capital by the Austrians (by Böhm-Bawerk, in particular). In this sense, the paper is an attempt to specify Marshall’s remark on Smith that “there is scarcely any economic truth now known of which he did not get some glimpse” (Marshall 1961: 757) or Samuelson’s more general remark that “inside every classical economist is a modern economist trying to get out” (Samuelson 1977: 42)Footnote 3. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a sketch of the links between the Classical (Smith’s) and the Austrian (Böhm-Bawerk’s) theory of capital through Hicks’s and Pasinetti’s notions of vertical integration. Sections 3 and 4 focus on the different arguments of Smith’s chapter 5 and on the two points of view (of an individual and of society at large) from which capital can be observed and without which these arguments cannot be understood. The arguments of chapter 5 are then re-examined in Sections 5 to 10 in the light of the Austrian principle of the higher productivity of roundabout methods and of the two viewpoints from which capital can be observed. The notion of vertical division of labour is utilized in Section 8 in association with this principle in order to reconstruct Smith’s own notions of “quantity” and “productivity” of productive labour. A summary of our reconstruction of Smith’s arguments is provided in Section 11.",1

A Massachusetts Fruit Growers Association monument captures the essence of countless memorials to Appleseed: “He planted seeds that others might enjoy fruit” (Price 1967: 9). These traditional representations, found in many myths and folk stories, have distorted the true history of a successful entrepreneur into a myth about a simple botanical benefactor. The reality was quite different. John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed’s real name) had a successful nursery business beyond the frontier in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana from 1797 to 1838. He planted orchards and sold the young trees to newly arriving settlers. Chapman would clear a patch of land “where he thought at a future day appletrees would be wanted; then, in the fall, repair to Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and wash out of the pomace at cider mills a bushel or two of seeds, and return with them on his shoulder, plant them at the proper time, enclose the spot with a brush fence, and pay some attention to the cultivation” (Price 1967, p. 36). This basic endeavor—collect seeds at a mill, transport them beyond the frontier, and plant orchards to sell to future settlers—made Chapman a relatively wealthy man. In his lifetime, “...he had owned either by deed outright or on long-time lease no less than twenty-two properties totaling nearly twelve hundred acres. These holdings never represented great wealth, but they were considerably better than those of the average settler in the Middle West” (Price 1967, p. 224).Footnote 1
 Chapman’s fortune grew by selling apple trees to settlers, but his trees also performed an important function. Depending on the location, apple trees were a formal or informal requirement for obtaining property rights to a piece of land. Selling apple trees to settlers was equivalent to selling them a stronger and better-defined property right. Anderson and Hill (2002) argue that the creation of property rights is a two-step process. First, alert entrepreneurs identify unowned and unpriced attributes of a resource. Second, entrepreneurs contract to limit access to those newly identified resources.Footnote 2 Citing Kirzner, they note that allocation decisions “are not arrived at merely by mechanical computation of the solution to the maximization problem implicit in the configuration of the given ends and means,” rather, entrepreneurship requires “the very perception of the ends-mean framework within which allocation and economizing is to take place” (Kirzner 1973, p. 33). Entrepreneurs do not intentionally pursue perception of the ends–means framework, so alertness constitutes a nonreplicable input. In this way, property rights entrepreneurs capture profits. Anderson and Hill have fruitfully applied Kirznerian alertness to explain why profits remain for entrepreneurs. This paper applies Kirzner’s two fundamental insights—the role of local knowledge and subjectivist interpretative schema—to explain why any particular entrepreneur is alert to a profit opportunity. Alertness is nonreplicable but it is also not random. The frontier in the Northwest Territory (now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin) provides a fertile historical setting for understanding the importance of local knowledge and interpretive schema in the property rights entrepreneurial processFootnote 3. The life of one particular entrepreneur, Johnny Appleseed, provides evidence on how local knowledge and subjectivism drives this alert process of discovery.",8

Williamson,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 2006, $103.6 billion dollars of foreign aid flowed to developing countries. Over the past 50 years, the amount of foreign aid dispersed totals over $2.3 trillion 2006 dollars (Easterly 2006a, p. 4). However, despite a large amount of time and resources devoted to development assistance, a lack of theoretical consensus surrounding the effectiveness of foreign aid remains. Two competing theories have emerged. The public interest theory argues that foreign aid is necessary to fill a financing or investment gap, and this will in turn lift countries out of a so-called poverty trap (for example, Sachs 2005). This remains the core argument for the use of foreign aid over the last 50 years. A contrasting theory, a public choice perspective, contends that foreign aid is ineffective and possibly damaging to recipient countries (Bauer 2000; Easterly 2001). Upon recent examination, a large empirical literature illustrates that foreign aid exhibits a zero effect on growth or any other indicators of poverty, supporting the public choice theory (Boone 1996; Svensson 1999, 2000; Knack 2001; Brumm 2003; Ovaska 2003; Easterly et al. 2004; Djankov et al. 2006a; Easterly 2006a; Powell and Ryan 2006; Williamson 2008). Svensson (1999) and Burnside and Dollar (2000) do find a positive effect of aid on growth when combined with the right conditions, specifically the right policy and institutional environments. However, Leeson (2008) offers an alternative explanation. Most developing countries have weak institutions and bad policies, contributing to why they are poor. Thus, where aid is needed, it will be unhelpful because the necessary institutions are lacking. Where it can do some good, in those countries with good policies and institutions, it is not needed. For example, Easterly (2007b, p. 4) states that “$568 billion in today’s dollars flowed into Africa over the past 42 years, yet per capita growth of the median African nation has been close to zero. The top quarter of aid recipients…received 17 percent of their GDP in aid over those 42 years, yet also had near-zero per capita growth. Successful cases of development happening due to a large inflow of aid and technical assistance have been hard to find...” Also, Easterly notes that the recent success stories of China, India, and Vietnam received a small percentage of aid relative to their GDP (Easterly 2007b). The stated goal of foreign aid is a rather large one: to end extreme world poverty and achieve development in poor countries (United Nations Millennium Project 2005). Jeffrey Sachs supports this broad goal and argues that extreme poverty can be ended in our lifetime (2005). Comparing these goals with the strong empirical findings, suggesting that development aid does not actually achieve development, is leading many economists to call foreign aid a failure. It should be noted that small successes such as increasing adult literacy in Africa have been achieved with the use of foreign aid. However, proponents of aid argue that it can deliver widespread prosperity, not marginal successes. Therefore, when foreign aid’s goals are compared with its achievements, the results are extremely disappointing. This paper explores potential explanations as to why foreign aid does not deliver economic success. Not only will this insight shed light on why foreign aid aimed at economic development failed in the past but this analysis can be extended to explain why we should not expect foreign aid to achieve economic development in the present or the new human development goals, as outlined by the Millennium Development Goals. With the recent resurgence surrounding the capabilities of foreign aid, an examination of why foreign aid fails is called to order. This paper explores the failure of foreign aid with a twofold approach. My framework includes arguments that rely on the role of incentives and information. Foreign aid alters incentives for both governments and citizens within these countries. I explore in depth how incentives in donor countries, aid agencies, and recipient countries shape the ultimate outcome of foreign aid. Secondly, the paper demonstrates the role of information, or knowledge, in effecting aid outcomes. I show how both donors and recipients may not have the information or knowledge to actually target and achieve the desired effects. These conjectures are mainly conceptual and are supported largely by case studies, examples, and anecdotal evidence available in the current literature. Several studies highlight how foreign aid fails and give possible conjectures as to why (Prokopijevic 2006; Leeson 2008; Coyne and Ryan 2009). My work can be viewed as an extension of these studies. While previous research illustrates the importance of either incentives or a lack of information, they do not fully bring these arguments to bear nor do they rely on both powerful arguments simultaneously. For example, some proponents of aid argue that the incentive problems can be overcome (for example, Sachs 2005). In these debates, how to overcome the lack of information or knowledge is often overlooked. On the flip side, some argue that tapping into the knowledge of how to achieve development is possible (for example, Easterly 2006a). However, overcoming the incentive issues is usually not addressed. I attempt to establish a more general framework relying on both incentives and information in order to understand why foreign aid fails to deliver. When combined, the incentives/information argument is a double-edged sword that deflates the optimism surrounding proponents of foreign aid. Although I separate out the arguments into either incentive or information based, these issues are intertwined and connected to one another. Incentives and information go hand in hand. For example, it may be the case that the incentives are not in place to gather critical knowledge. It is also a possibility that once an intervention takes place without the sufficient knowledge, individuals operate with a different set of incentives than they previously faced. Many of the examples that follow do not fall neatly into one category and may illuminate both an incentive and information failure. Therefore, relying on both incentives and information provides a deeper insight into the key problems with foreign aid. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses incentives faced by both donors and recipients. This section first outlines the theoretical framework for the analysis using insights from public choice. A subsection for both donors and recipients is provided to give specific illustrations of the various stakeholders’ incentives that must be overcome. Section 3 discusses the role of information in designing and implementing foreign aid policy. A theoretical framework is also provided in this section, drawing largely from Hayek, with following subsections to describe the knowledge problems for both donor and recipients. Section 4 concludes.",73

Robert Subrick,Andrew T. Young,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, for better or for worse, fundamentally changed the way that students of economic policy and the business cycle ply their trade. Their contributions, both in terms of methodology and specific theories, are widely influential. Their methodological contributions consist of the general equilibrium approach (GEA), now a mainstream method of business cycle (and, more generally, macroeconomic) analysis, and the game theoretic approach (GTA) to economic policy, which has become standard in models that stress the role of credible commitments.Footnote 1 Their enduring theories include real business cycle (RBC) theory (Kydland and Prescott 1982, 1991a; Prescott 1986) and the time inconsistency of optimal economic policy (Kydland and Prescott 1977). This paper is mostly concerned with Kydland and Prescott’s (henceforth KP’s) methodological contributions. We lay out the basics of those contributions and argue that they have tenets similar to those of Austrianism. Furthermore, the methodologies themselves parallel Austrian methodology in several significant ways. First, with regard to constructing macroeconomic models, the GEA accepts that (1) constructed models are severely false, (2) there is underlying economic theory that must be assumed a priori, and (3) associations inferred from economic data using the models can tell us only about the past, not about the future. Based on these tenets, the GEA involves (4) building a model based on the a priori embraced theory, (5) using data to recreate features of a historical environment, and (6) using the model to explain and make statements about historical episodes and counterfactuals. Second, the GTA formalized and extended the critiques of planning models by demonstrating their incoherence due to (1) a lack of consideration of agents’ reactions to policy changes, (2) the absence of laws of motion for economies, and (3) the fact that, within the models, rules provide better long-run outcomes than discretionary policies. Austrians pursue similar approaches to the above and we elaborate on the parallels between the GEA and the GTA to Austrian methodology. We are not the first to note certain parallels. Hoover (1988) and Laidler (1982) argue that, to some extent, Austrian approaches parallel aspects of the New Classical Macroeconomics. The parallels are not perfect. For example, by asserting that both KP and Austrians accept some underlying theory that must be embraced a priori, we do not assert that they embrace the same underlying theory. At a very fundamental level, RBC theory differs from the Austrian theory of the business cycle. Monetary factors have, at best, a secondary role in RBC theory. Also, the level of aggregation that KP accept undoubtedly raises concerns within Austrian circles. Furthermore, Austrians have raised significant concerns regarding the applicability of game theory to economic phenomena. However, this should not entirely preclude gains from trade between the contributions of KP and Austrians. We conclude by suggesting that the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 2004 to Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott is, in one sense, encouraging to Austrians. It demonstrates that their methods can appeal to a wider audience. In another sense, however, it is an implied criticism of Austrians in that they have failed, where KP have succeeded, to present their ideas in ways that convince, or at least evoke a response from, a wider audience. Furthermore, Austrians have failed to recognize this movement of mainstream macroeconomics at least marginally towards a more Austrian-like methodology and to, in turn, encourage and applaud such movement.",2
23.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,02 April 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-009-0086-4,From contract to mental model: Constitutional culture as a fact of the social sciences,March 2010,Nikolai Wenzel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Constitutional political economists have already written at length about the inherent paradoxes of constitutional constraints. At the root of the worry lie two paradoxes: the Weingast Paradox and the Liberal Paradox. Weingast (1995) explains that “the fundamental political dilemma of an economic system [is that] a government strong enough to protect property rights… is also strong enough to confiscate the wealth of its citizens.” Simply put, restraints are tricky things, and we find ourselves walking a tightrope “between anarchy and Leviathan,” to use the title of Buchanan (1975). A government strong enough to bind itself is ipso facto strong enough to break its own binds (Leviathan). Conversely, a government that is not strong enough to bind itself also defeats the very purpose of constitutionalism, as it will not be able to control itself or citizens vying for power (anarchy). Similarly, constitutionalism faces a Liberal Paradox, as the prevention of coercion requires coercion by the state. Ostrom (1984, 422) explains that “the very nature of government involves the legitimate use of force in ordering human relationships. The use of force in human relationships is of the nature of an evil. The use of instruments of evil as a necessary means to realize the advantage of ordered social relationships creates a fundamental moral dilemma that can be appropriately characterized as a Faustian bargain. A reasonable expectation, given the Faustian bargain, is that government will fail.” Rothbard (1996[1973], 67) dismisses constitutionalism as a failure: “In a profound sense, the idea of binding down power with the chains of a written constitution has proved to be a noble experiment that has failed.” He then slices through the Gordian and moves from the failure to the impossibility of constitutionalism, proposing the anarcho-capitalist alternative (see Rothbard 1996[1973], generally, as well as Lemieux 1988). But lest the student of constitutionalism find solace in this elegant solution, the acidic words of Buchanan (1979, postscript) remind us that it is just not that simple: “The libertarian anarchists who dream of markets without states are romantic fools who have read neither Hobbes nor history.” Well. We appear to be at an impasse. I am reminded of French cynic Alphonse Allais’ (possibly apocryphal) conclusion that “marriage is an institution that allows two people to solve the problems they would not have had if they had remained single.” Yet, constitutions do exist, and some even do a decent job of limiting the governments they create. Oppression may be the norm for most of humanity today, but it is not universal. How is this possible? How can paper limit power? In sum, how are we to prevent the state Mephistopheles from claiming his due—and somehow ensure that the Faustian bargain of government does not end in tears? The answer lies not in the formal. It cannot. Constitutions are ultimately mere parchment—and the formal enforcement mechanism of last resort. Indeed, there can be no outside appeal to any other formal institution beyond the constitution, hence the importance of informal constraints in maintaining constitutional order. Hardin (1988) explains that “without support from relevant people, perhaps often in the grudging form of those unable to co-ordinate in refusing support,…rules would not be worth the paper on which they are recorded.” Similarly, Alexander Hamilton sensibly noted of the US Constitution that it was a “frail and worthless fabric” in the hands of the wrong people. Informal constraints—a willingness to be bound (generally, see Elster 2000 and Hardin 1999)—maintain a central importance for constitutionalism. If a critical mass of individuals refuses to be bound, if it rejects constitutionalism generally or the constitution specifically, if it does not accept the deferral of current power for long-run stability, the entire constitutional undertaking will fail. Expediency will trump principle. Power will prevail over rules. And short-term gain will win over long-term coordination. In the words of Franklin and Baun (1995, vii), “in the constitutional state the rule of law prevails, not because the courts or police say it should, but because there exists a general acceptance of and confidence in the law.” Formal constitutionalism relies heavily on informal factors, such as popular understanding and willingness to be bound. These forces are captured in the concept of constitutional culture, the approach to constitutionalism, constitutional constraints, and the institutions that govern the organization of human affairs. Constitutional culture can best be understood as a Hayekian mental model, a heuristic to make sense of the world. In sum, constitutional culture, as part of the beliefs, customs, norms, and tacit knowledge on which people rely to make constitutional decisions, constitutes a “fact of the social sciences” (Hayek 1948). Section 2 describes the contractual shortcomings of the constitutional political economy (CPE) literature and the more comprehensive coordinationist approach; it then defines constitutional culture. Section 3 uses Hayekian insights, mostly from The Sensory Order (Hayek 1952) to offer a cognitive foundation for institutions. Section 4 combines the two insights—constitutional culture and Hayekian mental models—to present constitutional culture as a fact of the social sciences. Section 5 proposes four areas for further exploration. The final section concludes.",17

Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Shapiro seeks to marry political philosophy and social science. Where political philosophy brings concern with the nature of the good life in human societies to the marriage, social science brings recognition that people and societies are as much subject to laws as are other mammals, social insects, and, indeed, all of nature. A philosopher’s dreams might be limited only by the creativity of his imagination, but human societies are as much subject to laws as are the tides, even though the laws that govern human societies are different from those that govern the tides. Shapiro seeks to bring this marriage to bear on the welfare state; hence, normative arguments from political philosophy will have oomph only to the extent they are found to be feasible or plausible when filtered through the findings of social science. Shapiro describes this marriage as a means of avoiding the Nirvana fallacy, which otherwise allows science fiction to masquerade as science. To be sure, the articulation of law is difficult, complex, and contestable, so the distinction between science and fiction is subject to judgment and involves various margins of controversy. It is thus possible to accept Shapiro’s desire to avoid the Nirvana fallacy while yet differing on just when that fallacy has been committed. Shapiro’s effort to operate within the realm of feasibility brings to mind both James Buchanan’s (1959) articulation of a similar orientation and Clarence Philbrook’s (1953) caution about being overly concerned with feasibility. Shapiro proposes that state-based enterprises be replaced with market-based enterprises with respect to all three components of the welfare state. Those market-based enterprises, however, would be financed by forced saving along with some modest provision for redistribution. Such proposals have, of course, been around for quite some time and Shapiro explains these proposals nicely. These proposals would not, however, abolish the welfare state but rather would change its mode of operation. Shapiro would maintain state compulsion, only he would channel that compulsion through market-based enterprises rather than through state-based enterprises. His acceptance of state compulsion locates Shapiro as a proponent and not an antagonist of the welfare state, though one who advocates considerable reform in its mode of operation. It is perhaps unfortunate that Shapiro expounds on the Nirvana fallacy, for this invites the thought that his approval of the welfare state is only pragmatic: if the welfare state will not go away, one might as well try to do the best one can with it. But Shapiro’s support for the welfare state is not pragmatic; it is supported by the philosophical principles he embraces. His opening sentence offers the supposition that “justice requires minimizing inequalities that arise through no choice or fault of one’s own [p. 1].” This supposition allows collective judgments to trump the patterns generated by market interaction, and also brings into the foreground subtle and complex issues concerning the distinction between fate and choice. For instance, the family setting into which one is born is a matter of fate (what Shapiro calls brute luck) and not choice (what Shapiro calls option luck). Plato recognized this distinction in his call for the communal raising of children, a prospect that Aristotle noted would promote the equal neglect of all children. While Shapiro does not examine families and inheritance, the implications that stem from what he regards as unexceptional philosophical formulation should surely create cautionary if not skeptical posture toward those formulations. Such formulations necessarily incorporate planning into processes of spontaneous ordering. In selecting his point of departure, Shapiro embraces a welfare state by supporting policy efforts to make the outcomes of spontaneously ordered processes conform to some requirements of planning. As a conceptual matter, any activity that a state can promote through a budgetary operation can be promoted as well through a market-based regulation. A state can tax-and-spend or it can regulate; the difference is just a second-order matter (which does not imply that it is insignificant). It is a common practice for governments to require dog owners to have their dogs inoculated against rabies. Alternatively, governments could provide those inoculations through public veterinary clinics. On a larger scale, governments could pretty much eliminate spending on elementary and secondary education simply by requiring parents to send their children to state-approved schools. It would even be possible to mitigate some of the distributional consequences that might result by requiring people without children to help support neighboring children. Under either organizational format, there is state presence with respect to children and dogs. In both cases, there is a rejection of the spontaneously ordered features of market-generated patterns because these are subordinated to some collectively expressed desires to which those patterns should conform. There is tension between the market order and the welfare state, and this tension cannot be eliminated. The aggregate patterns that form through market interaction are simply objects to be observed and are not objects of any person’s choice. Such patterns as the distribution of wealth or the organization of medical care and insurance are products of interaction among the members of society and are not products of some overarching plan; rather, they are the unintended by-products of interaction among many plans. In contrast, the welfare state seeks to incorporate some vision of plan into the aggregate patterns that would otherwise emerge through societal interaction.",2

Pecquet,Clifford F. Thies,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Following the occupation of New Orleans by Federal troops in 1862, the Union commander repudiated the city’s Confederate currency. This left state-chartered bank notes, municipal notes (or municipal scrip), and merchant-issued change notes (or shinplasters) to function as the city’s hand-to-hand currency. We show how these monies adequately served the city’s needs until after the war. We also examine the breakdown of this monetary arrangement, e.g., the overissue of municipal scrip, its depreciation, and its spontaneous rejection. This historical episode speaks to several matters of continuing interest, including how the postwar monetary arrangement left much of the South poorly able to develop (or redevelop) its economy (see Ransom and Sutch 1977). This episode contributes to the tax-backing of money literature. The tax-backing theory of money refers to making noninterest-bearing, small-denomination notes receivable for taxes so as to induce their use as a medium of exchange. Bruce Smith (1984, 1985a, b, 1988) examined fiat currencies issued by several American colonies during the eighteenth century and argued that tax-backing contradicted the quantity theory of money, but others argued that Smith ignored specie flow (Bordo 1986; Bordo and Marcotte 1987; McCallum 1992; Michener 1987). In two early nineteenth century episodes, Pecquet and Thies (2006, 2007) have shown that tax-backing supported the value of paper currencies within certain limits. Calomiris (1993) contended that tax-backing could be effective in maintaining the value of silver currency relative to gold during the Silver Agitation period, provided that the silver currency was limited relative to the taxes for which it was acceptable. In New Orleans, noninterest-bearing, tax-backed municipal scrip was initially accepted at par in retail transactions and at only a small discount in broker transactions because of its liquidity service. Later, the excessive issue of municipal scrip precipitated its demonetization, and it became priced at a discount relative to interest-bearing municipal bonds. The New Orleans experiment conforms nicely to Calomiris’ restatement of tax-backing. The New Orleans monetary episode also exemplifies Selgin’s (1996, see also 2003) “salvaging” of Gresham’s law. While commonly and incorrectly simplified as “bad money drives out the good,” this is only the case when “bad” money is supported by legal tender laws. With choice in currency, the effect is reversed, and good money drives out the bad.Footnote 1 Hayek (1978) fundamentally reconsidered the role of the state with regard to money, arguing that, upon an end to legal tender laws, money whose value was defined by a robust set of commodities would be chosen by the market. This argument seemed to put the position of Austrian economics on its head, as it had previously been associated with the restoration of a gold standard. Since then, there has been a lively debate among Austrian economists, some advocating a 100% gold standard position and others a free banking position.Footnote 2 This article, by examining a historical episode involving the spontaneous rejection of inferior money, marshals some support for the free banking view.",5
23.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,23 June 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-009-0088-2,Competition as market progress: An Austrian rationale for agent-based modeling,June 2010,Guinevere Liberty Nell,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"John Hicks said that, without competition, “the basis on which economic laws can be constructed is therefore shorn away.” Similarly, Francis Edgeworth said that, under conditions of monopoly, rather than competition, theoretical economists “would be deprived of their occupation.” John Stuart Mill said, “Only through the principle of competition has political economy any pretension of a science” (Hutchison 1981: 226). Each of these economists regarded market competition as the basis for the science of economics. Without it, the science could not answer basic queries about production, allocation of resources, efficiency, or any other economic question. Marx agreed with this. The “bourgeois” science would be dead. However, he also believed that this science would not be necessary, as the “bourgeois” economic laws would no longer apply.Footnote 1 Yet, denying the laws of economics, and everything economists have learned from them, could not erase them. While it is true that competition is the basis of our models of economics, economic laws do not disappear when competition is suppressed. The experience of an economic system entirely without competition, but still with the same universal economic laws, provides insight into the process and real value of the competitive market system. These insights can inform more realistic and useful models. Many economists, arguably even Austrians (Boettke et al. 1986), have understood the central importance of competition to mean that an equilibrium framework is necessary for market analysis. There has been disagreement among Austrians as to the utility of the equilibrium framework (Selgin 1988). The lessons of the socialist calculation debate and the Soviet experience illustrate the danger of the equilibrium framework. A model of the competitive process compatible with Austrian insights must avoid assuming the static end state of equilibrium. One such modeling technique is agent-based computational modeling. Others have pointed to the connection between the Austrian School and the complex systems and agent-based modeling methodology. Roger Koppl (2006) explores the overlapping features of the two schools, using the acronym BRICE, for bounded rationality, rule following, institutions, cognition and evolution. Vriend (2002) makes the case that von Hayek should be seen as the founder of the school of agent-based computational economics (ACE). This paper focuses on the problems of equilibrium and the advantages of agent-based approach for Austrian market theory modeling. The first part of the paper explores the errors found in the Walrasian model during the calculation debate and as evident in the Soviet experience, and considers whether the equilibrium framework is fatally flawed. The second part argues that shortcomings of the equilibrium approach are evident in even the most sophisticated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, but agent-based models do not rely on equilibrium and allow for an Austrian understanding of competition and the market process. Hence, there is a potential for a synergistic relationship between agent-based modeling and the Austrian economics.",29

What good might have come from the hermeneutical Austrians’ call for an “interpretive turn” was lost because of the sharp resistance that those calls met in Austrian circles. At least two of their arguments, however, deserve a fresh hearing: (1) their attempt to provide a philosophically sound justification for the contention that praxeology is a science of meaning and (2) their effort to justify an approach to empirical/historical work that favors ethnographic methods. The answers that the hermeneutical Austrians offered to these questions, I contend, appeared more controversial than they in fact were. Because the hermeneutical Austrians primarily relied on philosophical hermeneutics, I suggest, their arguments concerning meaning and culture fell under a cloud. Arguably, Gadamer and Ricoeur (the leading figures in philosophical hermeneutics) were too alien, too easily misunderstood, too easily linked with “real nihilists” like Derrida, and so brought too much baggage with them the discussion. Alfred Schütz (a close friend of Mises and a member of the Austrian school), I believe, can help us to clear the air.Footnote 1 An Austrian economics that is focused on meaning and is complemented by a qualitative empirical method that offers thick descriptions of particular cultural contexts, I believe, does not need to rely on hermeneutics for its philosophical basis but can instead be articulated along Schützian lines. This article is not an attempt to rehearse the disagreements over hermeneutics, to argue for either side, or to change the conventional view of who won and who lost that “debate.” Rather, it is an attempt to rescue two arguments (about the meaning of meaning and the role of thymology) that I believe are consistent with Mises’ praxeology, that were articulated and stressed by the hermeneutical Austrians, and that have significant but under-explored implications. The next section offers a brief history of the hermeneutics debate and argues that the hermeneutical Austrians would have been better served had they relied more extensively on Schütz. The rest of the article explores what praxeology and history pursued along Schützian lines would look like.",19

Much recent work has raised diverse new points that demonstrate new rationales for the unsustainability of the boom. Huerta de Soto’s (1998: 667) application of the prisoner’s dilemma has shown that ABCT is not necessarily inconsistent with the rational expectations’ assumption.Footnote 2 Evans and Baxendale (2008) have demonstrated that not all entrepreneurs must err in clusters for the bust to occur. Rather, the marginal entrepreneurs are sufficient to entice this change. Additionally, “herding behavior” has been forwarded as an explanation consistent with ABCT to explain asset bubbles (Koppl 2002; Bagus 2008). This paper will build on this existing literature and further strengthen the argument that the boom is unsustainable, as well as demonstrate a new problem inhibiting a speedy recovery from the bust. To these ends, we advance two new knowledge problems. First, informational cascades serve to demonstrate why entrepreneurs are unable to discern the true sustainability of the boom. As information loses quality through its shared usage, its transmission results in the deterioration of the quality of any decision making based upon it. The deterioration, and in some cases complete loss of knowledge, can be explained within the framework of ABCT when augmented with some of the existing literature (notably Huerta de Soto 1998/2006; Bagus 2008). Tullock (1987: 73) posits that there is no particular reason why credit inflation, even high levels thereof, cannot continue unabated for lengthy and sustained periods of time. Current rationales for the change from boom to bust in ABCT show that under inflationary conditions, more investment is undertaken than real resources exist to sustain. Eventually, a resource constraint will become binding, with a necessary shift from boom to bust. Of course, if this were the trigger of the bust, we would expect to see skyrocketing input prices, as scarce resources begin to be intensely bid up to complete projects previously undertaken with the expectation of greater resource availability. However, in reality, the boom need not always reach this point. Instead, it will be demonstrated that entrepreneurs who have first-order knowledge of the sources of the credit inflation will exit the market when they sense profits under unsustainable conditions have been maximized. This sends a strong signal to the second-order users of knowledge—those who have gained access to the knowledge of the augmented credit supply only later through the informational cascade—and who adjust their expectations accordingly. A fragile situation built upon little knowledge of the true situation is broken. Market participants operating at the margin become the fuel that feeds the decline, acting as triggers upon which other marginal entrepreneurs are affected negatively. Second, we argue that the turning point in the cycle can best be demonstrated as a knowledge problem. As entrepreneurs shift from less to more profitable activities to maximize their own personal profit levels, the structure of knowledge concerning production undergoes a shift as well. Previously, profit was sought through aligning the real structure of production with the needs of consumers via an appropriate Wicksellian natural rate of interest. As profit opportunities become relatively abundant in the financial sector augmented with fresh credit, an entrepreneurial shift occurs, which displaces activity in the real economy by the financial economy. A resultant shift in the structure of knowledge occurs simultaneously, as different factors become the focus of profit-seeking activity, and as more attention is paid to the monetary authorities at the expense of consumer want preferences. Finally, the particulars concerning the severity and duration of the bust can be explained by two factors. Sticky prices in the real economy relative to the highly flexible financial economy cause a time spread between the relative adjustment processes. Adding to this lag in the real recovery process, however, is the knowledge shift that occurred during the boom. As entrepreneurs focused their attention on the financial economy, significant knowledge concerning the real economy was ignored or lost. As a result, a rebuilding of the structure of knowledge must occur prior to (or at least concurrent with) to any rebuilding in the structure of production that eliminates the imbalances of the boom. Activity that inhibits the rebuilding process of this structure of knowledge will necessarily affect the rebuilding of the structure of production to the detriment of consumers.",17

Yeager,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Should banks be allowed to hold only fractional reserves against demand deposits (and bank-issued currency, if any)? Or must they hold 100% reserves in the most ultimate kind of money—base money like central-bank liabilities or conceivably even gold coins? Here, I will focus only on a noneconomic yet prominent aspect of the discussion: the hundred-percenters' style of argument and their assertions about property rights and insistence on moral, legal, and logical aspects of the issue. This line of argument predominates in writings of Hoppe et al. (1998) and Huerta de Soto (1998, 2006) and, more generally, of other adherents to the tradition of Murray Rothbard (Rothbard 1983, esp. chap. VII and pp. 263–269 of chap. XVII). Their arguments center around words and classifications. To focus on this aspect, let us set aside questions of how well alternative systems might function—issues of efficiency, financial intermediation, capital formation, growth, risk, and stability or instability of production and prices. First, let us keep assertions about law, morality, and the meanings of words from trumping the economics. The writers cited contend that demand deposits and banknotes are, or pretend to be, titles to property in the form of base money. If the banks hold less base money than what their deposits and notes represent titles to, fraud is afoot. Just as valid titles to automobiles cannot exist in excess of the actual number of automobiles, so valid titles to base money cannot exist in excess of its amount. Even if all concerned—depositors, banknote holders, and bankers—understand and consent to fractional reserves, so keeping this pretense of multiple titles from being downright fraudulent, the practice remains illogical, almost contrary to objective reality, immoral, and illegal. A related strand of the 100%-reserve argument is that even if fractional reserves do not harm but even benefit banks and their depositors, note holders, and loan recipients, the system still harms innocent third parties. But that subsidiary issue concerns the economics of alternative money and banking systems and so is outside the scope of this paper. Huerta de Soto stresses legal aspects. Far from representing loans granted to a bank by holders of its notes and deposits, these holdings represent titles to actual money that has been deposited. Huerta distinguishes between the legal concepts of regular deposit and irregular deposit. The former is temporary transfer by one party to another of specifically identifiable property, say a work of art, probably for safekeeping. The transferor retains title to the object and can have it back whenever he wants (If such a transfer is not the same as a bailment, the difference is slight enough to escape me.) As for an “irregular deposit”, the adjective itself does not imply anything improper. The difference from a regular deposit is that the property transferred is fungible: for all practical purposes, individual units of it cannot be distinguished. Examples are wheat of a definite grade and ordinary coins and notes of no additional collectors' value. This distinction between specific and fungible items deposited does not relieve the depositary (bailee) of the obligation to hold the full amount deposited. Huerta de Soto documents, in many languages, recognition and application of this legal principle from Roman times to the present. Well, he continues, deposits and banknotes are evidences of fungible property deposited, namely (base) money. The depositor should pay the bank for its caretaking services. If the so-called depositor receives interest, he must receive it on an actual loan to the bank, a loan repayable only after a definite period or, anyway, not on demand. Present-day fractional-reserve demand deposits stand in almost immoral violation of the established legal principle governing deposits of fungible as well as specific property.Footnote 1
 Such an argument squeezes present-day bank money into the category of certificates for irregular deposits of property and then insists on the legal and moral principles governing that category. Money probably did often originate, as Carl Menger explains, from ordinary goods that were useful both in themselves and as instruments of indirect barter, although the unit-of-account function may have come before the medium-of-exchange function at some times and places. Through gradual steps over many centuries, money has evolved into something different. Appropriate though the old category of property routinely exchanged in indirect barter may once have been, today's bank money does not fit comfortably into it. An erudite history of monetary institutions and legal principles does not make it fit.",12

Prychitko,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"I would like to begin by acknowledging some “common ground” between Minsky and the Austrians—specifically, the work on entrepreneurial innovation by Minsky’s Harvard thesis advisor, Joseph Schumpeter. We are all aware of Schumpeter’s explanation. The economy, he assumes, already enjoys complete coordination. Enamored with Walrasian theory, Schumpeter suggests that the economy can be considered to be in a state of general equilibrium. Production plans repeat themselves; so do the plans of capitalists, workers, consumers. Prices do not change. Entrepreneurs merely earn standard rates of return. By the nature of the equilibrium, all economic profit opportunities are dried up, so something must change for the awareness of new profit opportunities, the appearance of new entrepreneurial knowledge, and the incentive to act upon that knowledge. It is an exogenous source of change. Schumpeter finds a way to acknowledge the disequilibria and rough-and-tumble dynamics of capitalism by pushing a new profit-seeking entrepreneur into the general equilibrium setting. He argues entrepreneurial innovation and the recombination of capital goods disturb equilibrium (1961, pp. 128–56). Entrepreneurs will display bold “leadership” capacity, they will “blaze new trails,” they will innovate in ways that offer new and previously unforeseen capital combinations and, if their expectations that guide their decisions are correct, entrepreneurs will enjoy economic profit and set the economy into disequilibrium. The entrepreneurial leap from equilibrium to disequilibrium represents modern capitalism’s “creative destruction” (1976, pp. 81–86). Other imitators might soon rush in. We cannot determine, a priori, if entrepreneurial imitation will initially push markets further away from equilibrium, or if imitation provides an immediate process back toward a general equilibrium state. As a description of modern capitalism, Schumpeter’s ideal types (boldness, creativity, leadership, etc.) offer some clues about the systemic rationality encouraged and developed within the institutions of a modern monetary economy. His “creative destruction” thesis, his metaphor that the entrepreneurial faculty, though rational and calculating, is “at the same time a child and a victim of economic development,” offers a provocative description of the unforeseen and unintended results of entrepreneurial re-combinations of capital and its role in long run growth (1961, p. 154). The growth path itself is never stable. Equilibrium disturbed, Schumpeter suggests, might very well represent a period of instability before the new equilibrium, itself potentially unstable, evolves. Presumably. But as a matter of pure theory, Schumpeter’s general equilibrium model does not satisfy. It is ad hoc—the entrepreneurial disturbance is merely assumed. His entrepreneurial innovator plays a strictly exogenous role, a kind of deus ex machina who comes from nowhere to get the dynamics, Schumpeter’s story, moving along. The dynamic is the interesting part; indeed, the dynamic is the whole story. But Schumpeter never bothers to explain how this process reverses itself. Is there any kind of corresponding dynamic? How does this bold entrepreneur, or his imitators, ever lead us back, if even unintentionally, toward general economic equilibrium? Schumpeter does not explain.Footnote 1

And since this language—or at least its most important parts—is metaphorical, the facts and experiences represent a challenge to the metaphors that constitute the theoretical structure of the prevailing orthodoxy. By way of clearing the ground, it may be well to establish, first, what is meant by ‘metaphor’ in a general sense or from the point of view of literary theory and, second, the function and significance of metaphor in science and the mirroring of this function and significance in the particular theoretical and scientific discipline called financial economics. Orthodox financial economics is a crystalline structure of mathematical–metaphorical mappings between elements of the economic reality and mathematical objects. As such, the discourse of financial economics orthodoxy is confined to its crystalline structure, and new facts and experiences may not be spoken or written about meaningfully without some, perhaps substantial, change to the structure of the orthodox position. Or the new facts and experiences may highlight long-standing deficiencies within the crystalline theoretical–mathematical structure that render it invalid. Once the difficulties presented by these theoretical deficiencies become insurmountable, there may take place a reordering of competing explanations.",1

Evans,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"According to conventional wisdom, the collapse of communism in central and eastern Europe (CEE) resulted in a wave of ‘neoliberalism’. Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine (Klein 2007) demonstrates the extent to which this view has occupied the public’s conscious, and despite its lack of scholarly rigor, the likes of Kuttner (1997), Soros (1998) and Stiglitz (2002) bolster the view that Western ‘market fundamentalists’ were the instigators of policy reforms. But a surprising aspect of the literature is the relative scarcity of empirical cases that systematically document idea diffusion. One would imagine that a claim of a spread of ‘market fundamentalism’ and the anti-state philosophy upon which it rests would be based upon a number of studies focused on alternative aspects of the phenomenon. But not only is there a lack of clarity as to what constitutes ‘neoliberal’ ideas, there are few cases that actually document their diffusion. This article aims to redress this balance and take seriously the claims mentioned above. To do so, we present the Austrian school of economics as being the intellectual tradition that most resembles the charge of ‘market fundamentalism’ and then provide an intellectual history of the spread of these ideas in eastern Europe—before, during and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Indeed, this article contributes to three separate research agenda that have been neglected. Firstly, it is a rare history of ‘centre-right’ political ideas in eastern Europe (Aligica and Evans 2009). As Sean Hanley points out, The paucity of literature on the centre-right in Post-communist Europe contrasts with the voluminous, detailed and often sophisticated comparative literature on the left—usually focused on communist successor parties—and, to a lesser extent, the far right. (Hanley 2006b, p. 9) In relation to the more common accounts of far left and far right, ‘neoliberal’ ideas are typically categorised as centre-right, and even those that do exist tend to focus on specific countries (such as Hanley’s account of the centre-right in the Czech Republic; Hanley 2006a). But the charge of neoliberalism seems to transcend the political spectrum, and indeed, the second relevant research agendum is the development and influence of a particular brand of political philosophy—libertarianism. Whilst it is understandable that the documentation of communism in CEE has received more attention than competing ideologies (see Service 2007), post-Soviet Europe is simply an extreme example of a broader scarcity of histories of libertarianism. To be sure some exist—for example Woodcock (1962) presents a history of libertarian ideas—Doherty (2007) looks at the American libertarian movement,Footnote 1 whilst Lowy (1992) is an intriguing history of Jewish libertarian thought in central Europe, and finally, the third research agendum that this article contributes to is intellectual biographies of neglected economists that belong to the Austrian school. Vaughn (1994) is the documentation of the ‘migration’ of Austrian economics from Vienna to America, outlining the central characteristics of the school and providing biographies of the main protagonists. This article can therefore be viewed as a minor extension to Vaughn’s work, expanding into a new geographical frontier.Footnote 2 Therefore, this article contributes to the literature on centre-right politics in eastern Europe but is also an example of two further distinct (but related) areas of epistemic histories: of the Austrian Economics epistemic community and of the political philosophy of libertarianism more generally.Footnote 3

This comment is perhaps better titled “toward dissertation topics for Peter Leeson’s PhD students” because there is much to be done at the intersection of his research on pirates and (for example) Avner Greif’s (2006) research on cooperation and the development of institutions, Sudhir Venkatesh’s (2006) explorations of criminal gangs and informal urban economies, Ronald Findlay and Kevin O’Rourke’s (2007) recent history of international trade, and many other areas of inquiry. Some more specific further directions concern the development of institutions to manage the commons, the development of property rights over resources like large bodies of water, and the relationship between violence and order—particularly in a rent-seeking society. Economic analysis has a few central ideas that do most of the heavy lifting. Man acts. People respond to incentives. Trade creates wealth. Et cetera. Of crucial importance too is the idea that transaction costs prevent trade and, therefore, impede wealth creation.Footnote 2 Institutions, which Douglass C. North defines as the rules, norms, and enforcement mechanisms that determine the “rules of the game,” develop as the intended and unintended consequences of human action (North 2005:48). Sometimes, these institutions reduce barriers to trade, and sometimes, these institutions raise barriers to trade. Institutions lead to the development of organizations, and suffice it to say that human organizations are not always successful, nor is organizational change always aimed at expanding our options. Indeed, people, good and bad, develop institutions and form organizations that impede cooperation and reduce economic growth. In addition to being enjoyable and informative, The Invisible Hook spotlights the importance of freedom and voluntarism by (perhaps ironically) exploring the workings, operations, and organization of brigands and marauders. Leeson lays a foundation for further work contrasting the organization of “private” providers of violence like pirate bands with “public” providers of violence like states. Emerging from Leeson’s work is the conclusion that one of the common objections to free-market capitalism—that it relies on unrealistic assumptions about human goodness—is irrelevant because we can get sustained cooperation even among these “certaine lewd and ill-disposed persons.”",1

Should we think of pirate captains as constitutionally constrained political leaders? Should we think of the “pirate code” as a constitution? On the surface, this is exactly what Prof. Peter Leeson is arguing in his fantastic book on the political economy of piracy, The Invisible Hook. As Leeson (2009: 24) writes, “pirate democracy extended the unrestricted right to pirates to have a say in the selection of their society’s leaders nearly 150 years before the Second Reform Act of 1868 accomplished anything close to the same in Britain.” And “pirates created and operated their democracy within a sophisticated and more elaborate system of institutionally separated power” (ibid.). Not only were these pirate crews fully functioning democracies, the rules that governed their societies ensured that their leaders did not abuse their crews and that these bands of thieves were able to cooperate in their marauding ventures. Interestingly, the pirate societies that they created were much more orderly than one might expect. As Leeson (ibid.: 46) writes, “pirate life was orderly and honest.” Also, “pirates’ system of private governance was highly successful, a fact reflected in the success of piracy itself” (ibid.: 79). How did pirates accomplish this? How were they able to create democratic procedures that prevented conflict between fellow pirates and ensured that pirate leaders did not engage in predation? How did they, in short, escape Madison’s challenge? By devising a complex system of rules (called the “pirate code”) and procedures for electing their leaders, pirate societies seemed to have escaped the key paradox in constitutional political economy, that is, they created governance structures where the leaders were strong enough to “control the governed” but were not strong enough to break the constraints that bound them. There is, however, a “hidden catch” within The Invisible Hook. There are important differences between pirate crews and societies, between pirate captains and political leaders, and between the pirate code and constitutions. Moreover, understanding these differences is critical for understanding how criminal bands were able to accomplish a feat that still proves problematic for many societies.",1

Bylund,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In The Invisible Hook (2009), Peter Leeson makes a valiant attempt to provide insight into pirate organization through applying rational choice theory to their organizational structure. As the study of pirates overall lacks of economics’ powerful explanations of behavior and therefore should rely too heavily on interpretations of social or political aspects, the book is a welcomed contribution. Leeson assumes that the piratical enterprise was essentially a business firm striving to maximize profit. The assumptions of rational behavior and economic theories are applied from this perspective and supposedly explain the institutional nature of piratical organization. Indeed, Leeson claims that the pirate ship, albeit the criminal nature, to some extent “resembled a Fortune 500 company” (Leeson 2009, p. 6). Furthermore: “piracy was a business. It was a criminal business, but a business nonetheless, and deserves to be examined in this light” (ibid.). He maintains that the relevance of likening the pirates with a “sea-going stock company” (Pringle 1953, p. 106; quoted in Leeson 2009, p. 41) is illustrated by the topics in the book. But no succinct reasons for the assumption that pirates were entrepreneurs (in the layman sense) are given, so the reader is expected to accept the author’s judgment. This is problematic since the economic theory and illustrations provided in the book show only how pirate institutions supported their organization and purpose—not necessarily that the organization entailed a firm. Undeniably, that the pirates were formally and even contractually organized, and their collective endeavor motivated by profit, are certainly common and even necessary traits of firms. But they are not sufficient conditions. Contrary to Leeson’s view, pirate organization seems strikingly similar to that of traditional cooperatives (cf. Chaddad and Cook 2004, p. 351). CooperativesFootnote 1 are often, like business firms, for-profit ventures, but suffer from unique governance problems: their basis in “ill-defined ownership” (Cook and Iliopoulos 2000) gives rise to collective action problems (Olson 1971) that require organization different from business firms (Hansmann 1988). Whereas the firm relies on ownership and control of assets as regulators of internal behavior, the cooperative often deals exclusively with members who have equal ownership rights and may be the cooperative’s only customers. Many cooperatives, like the pirates, are “not primarily in the business of providing services to anyone other than their members” (Leeson 2007, p. 1051) and therefore often establish bylaws to regulate member influence as well as agents’ authority. In the remaining sections, I discuss economic theories of the firm and how they pertain to Leeson’s exposition. I show that there is insufficient theoretical support for the piracy/firm analogy—and that the cooperative is a much more viable theoretical analogy.",6

North,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In The City of God, Augustine compared a kingdom without justice to a band of robbers, referring to a tale told originally by Cicero. Alexander the Great had captured a pirate and asked the pirate what he had meant to do by “infesting the sea.” The pirate’s reply was to the point: “The same as you do when you infest the whole world; but because I do it with a little ship I am called a robber, and because you do it with a great fleet, you are an emperor.”Footnote 1 Peter Leeson’s book The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates carries this idea forward to the Golden Age of Piracy: like a great and powerful state (and maybe even better than one), pirates were able to organize themselves efficiently and rationally to achieve the greatest profit possible for themselves. One way in which pirates managed this feat was through creation of their own body of law—the so-called pirate codes. In Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean movie franchise, Captain Barbossa says that the pirate code is “more what you’d call guidelines than actual rules.” In reality, though, these codes were a lot more than guidelines; they were a powerful factor in keeping order aboard ship. In this essay, I consider Leeson’s work from the perspective of how property rights—such as pirate codes—could have evolved. In Section 2, I discuss the law and economics literature on the evolution of property rights, followed in Section 3 by a diversion into Pierson v. Post, a case commonly studied by first-year law students in the opening days of their introduction to the law of property. In Section 4, I tie each of the previous sections together with the pirate codes discussed in Leeson’s book. Section 5 concludes.",

My goal in The Invisible Hook was to apply rational choice theory to pirates and, in doing so, to shed light on their unusual, entertaining, and sometimes shocking practices. I would like to interpret the fact that all the papers in this symposium discuss pirates as rational decision makers as a sign of success. None of the contributors object to my basic, overarching argument: pirates were economic actors. Of course, all of them are economists. So this may not be saying much. My goal in this article is to offer a few reactions to each of the contributors' papers on my book. These papers accept that we can and should analyze pirates using economic theory. But they raise important questions about, and offer important challenges to, some of the particular ways in which I use that theory to understand pirates in The Invisible Hook.",7

The question is, of course, an Austrian question, grounded primarily in the work of FA Hayek. Hayek was interested in the role the price system plays in social learning. My work extends these insights to non-priced environments of social exchange. In my book The Cultural and Political Economy of Recovery, I examine both priced and non-priced social learning in the context of post-disaster recovery in the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina (Chamlee-Wright 2010).Footnote 1 By examining the post-disaster context in which much of the order we take for granted is (at least for a time) shattered, we have an extraordinary opportunity to learn about how the social order works (and what can inhibit it from working) more generally.Footnote 2
 The argument I wish to make here, however, is not about the substance of my analysis but the empirical methods that lay behind it. My work on informal markets in sub-Saharan Africa and post-disaster recovery has been informed by qualitative methods, principally in the form of interview-based ethnography. After briefly describing these methods, I will offer a defense for why, despite the abundance of quantitative economic data, economists might consider the merits of qualitative research methods. If I am successful, I persuade the standard economist that, alongside quantitative methods, there is a complementary role qualitative methods can play in researching complex political–economic questions.Footnote 3 The complementary role is justified not only because we might not always find appropriate quantitative proxies but also because for some political–economic questions, it is qualitative analysis that in fact would be more appropriate. In addition to making the relatively modest point that qualitative methods have a role to play alongside quantitative analysis, I also have a more ambitious argument in mind and that is that Austrian economists who seek to advance understanding of complex social systems ought to be particularly interested in adopting, deploying, and teaching qualitative methods given our core emphasis on the importance of local (often tacit) knowledge and discovery in the market process.",12
23.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,21 July 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-010-0124-2,The non-productive entrepreneurial process,December 2010,Christopher J. Coyne,Russell S. Sobel,John A. Dove,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Could entrepreneurship be the catalyst of economic stagnation? Typically, entrepreneurship is viewed in the positive context of increased efficiency and economic growth (see, for example, Audretsch 2006; Audretsch et al. 2006; Harper 2003; Holcombe 1998; Kreft and Sobel 2005). Along similar lines, the market process literature emphasizes the dual role of the entrepreneur as an arbitrageur and as an innovator (see Kirzner 1973, 1992, 1997). As an arbitrageur, the entrepreneur continually reallocates resources in a more efficient manner which pushes the economy closer to a given production possibilities frontier. As an innovator, the entrepreneur shifts the entire production possibilities outward, allowing for higher levels of output for a given level of inputs. This real increase in output, due to a real increase in productivity, is the essence of economic growth. A related literature explores different ‘types’ of entrepreneurship. Baumol (1990) differentiates between productive, unproductive, and destructive entrepreneurship.Footnote 1 Productive entrepreneurship refers to the aforementioned, positive-sum acts of arbitrage and innovation resulting in economic growth. In contrast, unproductive and destructive (i.e., non-productive) entrepreneurship is inherently predatory in nature because non-productive entrepreneurs seek transfers from those who are productive. Such acts benefit the non-productive entrepreneur while reducing social welfare.Footnote 2 Examples would include rent-seeking and crime. There are two implications of recognizing the different types of entrepreneurship. First, institutions are central because they influence the payoffs associated with the various types of entrepreneurship. Second, while entrepreneurship can be beneficial (i.e., productive entrepreneurship) in terms of increased efficiency and growth, it can also be a determinant (i.e., non-productive entrepreneurship) to the allocation of resources and economic development. While the existing market process literature provides insight into the process through which productive entrepreneurship takes place, there is no equivalent for non-productive entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap. Our core thesis is that entrepreneurs are the driver of economic stagnation. While entrepreneurs can be a source of increased efficiency and growth, they can also be a catalyst of economic decline and underdevelopment. We explore the non-productive entrepreneurial process, and in doing so, illuminate the various channels through which one non-productive activity can generate subsequent non-productive opportunities culminating in economic decline and stagnation. Drawing on examples of non-productive entrepreneurship from both underdeveloped and developed counties, we provide insight into why economic stagnation persists in the former and why economic decline can occur in the latter. While a situation where all entrepreneurship is productive is a ‘first best’ outcome, real-world economies are characterized by a mix of productive and non-productive activities. As such, we need to understand not only the process of productive entrepreneurship, but also the non-productive entrepreneurial process. The importance of the non-productive entrepreneurial process can be traced back to Adam Smith’s discussion of “publick debts.” Smith (1776: 930) noted that “it [the public debt] occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of private people; enriching in most cases the idle and profuse debtor at the expence of the industrious and frugal creditor, and transporting a great part of the national capital from the hands which were likely to increase it and improve it, to those which are likely to dissipate and destroy it.” Smith’s point is that public debt often transfers resources from productive to non-productive activities. Our goal is to explore and generalize the implications of this insight by understanding how non-productive activities emerge and create subsequent non-productive opportunities. Our analysis contributes to several strands of literature, the first of which is the existing market process literature discussed above. Within this literature, our analysis is closest to Holcombe (1998) who explores the connection between entrepreneurship and economic growth, and specifically how economic growth occurs in a market setting. He concludes that the actions of entrepreneurs “…create an environment within which innovations build on themselves, leading to continually increasing productivity” (1998: 47). Although not explicitly stated, Holcombe’s main focus is clearly on the activities of productive entrepreneurs. The current paper can be seen as the flipside of Holcombe’s analysis. We argue that, like economic growth, economic stagnation is the result of previous entrepreneurial activities. While Holcombe is correct to conclude that one productive activity generates subsequent entrepreneurial activities, it is also the case that one non-productive activity generates subsequent non-productive activities. Ultimately, the ability to experience and sustain development is a function of whether the benefits of productive entrepreneurial activities trump the negative effects of non-productive entrepreneurial activities. This helps to explain why some countries can become mired in economic underdevelopment. Where institutions encourage non-productive activities, entrepreneurs will tend to exploit those opportunities. In doing so, they create subsequent non-productive opportunities. Each non-productive activity has a multiplier effect contributing to further decline. From this standpoint, non-productive entrepreneurial activity is the catalyst of economic decline and stagnation. Our analysis also contributes to the literature on the rise and decline of nations. Olson (1982) argued that distributional coalitions could lead to economic decline through rent-seeking. Further, he claimed that stable democracies, without some form of substantial upheaval or shock (e.g., war, revolution, natural disaster, etc.) would tend to accumulate an increasing number of distributional coalitions. Our analysis provides insight into how distributional coalitions can accumulate and how wealthy countries can experience economic decline. One non-productive activity generates several others and this process continues resulting in economic stagnation. We proceed as follows: the next section provides an overview of the institutional view of economic development, which emphasizes that alternative institutional environments generate different payoffs to productive and non-productive activities. The dominance of productive or non-productive activities, in turn, determines economic growth or the lack thereof. Section 3 provides insight into the non-productive entrepreneurial process. We explain how the cause of economic stagnation is non-productive entrepreneurship and, more specifically, the subsequent opportunities created by non-productive activities. In doing so, we identify three main channels through which one non-productive activity creates subsequent non-productive opportunities. Section 4 reviews the implications of our analysis while Section 5 concludes.",63

Unfortunately, these free zones, reformed and renamed special economic zones (SEZs) in 2005, have not been as successful at promoting exports and job creation as might have been hoped (Gopalakrishnan 2007; Seshadri 2010).Footnote 1 While some EPZs like those in Bombay and Madras do appear to be thriving, most of the others are not doing very well (Kundra 2000; Aggarwal 2004). Moreover, the combined exports of all Indian EPZs and SEZs are (and have historically been) only a fraction of total Indian exports (Palit and Bhattacharjee 2008; Menon and Mitra 2009). Additionally, their employment creation ability has proven to be minimal (Aggarwal 2005, 2007). Kumar (1989), Kundra (2000), Aggarwal (2004), Mukhopadhyay (2009), and Palit and Bhattacharjee (2008) have attributed the poor performance of EPZs in India to inadequate infrastructure, bureaucratic delays, and procedural complexities as well as regulatory issues associated with other parts of the economy. As Engman et al. (2007, 18) write, “the Indian EPZ policy of the twentieth century failed to address issues related to administrative inefficiencies, rigid customs procedures for bonding and bank guarantees, foreign ownership, and infrastructural shortcomings.” Similarly, as Ranjan (2006, 23) suggests, “Dysfunctional policies, regulations, lack of single window clearance facilities, poor attitude of the officials, centralized governance, stringent labor laws, poor physical and financial infrastructure, all accounted for an undesirable investment climate and thus EPZ failed to create employment.” Although India’s SEZ scheme is quite new and was enacted to address some of the issues associated with the earlier EPZs, the new and reconstituted SEZs suffer from similar problems and have not performed significantly better than their predecessors. As Goswami (2008) states, “It is also certain that a large number of notified or approved SEZ proposals will not translate to any facility worth the name. Today, for many, the situation is no different than an old fashioned ‘license grab’: let us get a bunch of guys together with some political connections; apply for a small to middling SEZ; get it approved and notified; and then see what value can be generated out of this state-approved piece of paper.” Additionally, as Mukhopadhyay (2009, 60) has explained, “based on an examination of data available from the ministry’s own website, while the costs appear very real, the benefits of SEZs appear to be a mirage.” Although the shortcomings of both the EPZ and SEZ regimes listed above are substantial (i.e., bureaucratic delays, inadequate infrastructure, etc.), they do not address what is a key (and perhaps insurmountable) challenge facing any development effort that relies on free zones rather than nationwide economic and regulatory reform. Officials responsible for encouraging, licensing, and regulating EPZs must overcome the knowledge problems inherent in deciding (a) “where” to locate new zones, (b) “what” industries to promote within established zones, and (c) “which” proposed units are likely to be successful and so should be permitted to operate within the zones. It is unlikely that officials embedded in the political, bureaucratic, and regulatory processes which inform these decisions will discover the requisite knowledge. As Mises (1944, 56) argues, bureaucracies fail because of “the unavoidable weakness of any administration of public affairs. The lack of standards which could, in an unquestionable way, ascertain success or nonsuccess in the performance of an official's duties creates insoluble problems. It kills ambition, destroys initiative, and the incentive to do more than the minimum required. It makes the bureaucrat look at instructions, not at material and real success.” Simply put, the officials responsible for EPZs are unlikely to know the “where,” “what,” and “which” that they need to know if they are to successfully plan an EPZ. In many ways, then, the problems of India’s EPZs and SEZs should not have been surprising given the context in which they were established. If knowledge problems are inherent in any top-down government economic development program, they are more intense in socialist and quasi-socialist contexts where government officials qua central planners cannot make use of the information generated in markets about the plans, purposes, preferences, and proficiencies of potential entrepreneurs, employees, and consumers. EPZs in India were developed within the restrictive trade regime of India at a time when India closely followed socialist central planning models (see Shenoy 1968, 323; Bardhan 1984, 65). The Indian Planning Commission was charged with the responsibility of determining priorities, assessing all of the country’s resources, augmenting deficient resources, and formulating plans for the most effective and balanced utilization of resources across regions.Footnote 2 At root, then, it was assumed that the central planning commission was able to arrive at the right configuration of production and exchange that will help the economy progress. A knowledge problem of the sort that made the failure of India’s central planning regime inevitable also hampered India’s experiment with EPZs. Officials in India did not have sufficient knowledge to plan their economy nor did they possess sufficient knowledge to plan and implement these zones. This article is an attempt to highlight some of the knowledge problems inherent in developing successful EPZs and to explain the poor performance of Indian EPZs as a result of India’s EPZ administrators being unable to overcome these problems. The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 highlights some of the more successful and failed zone policies in different countries and focuses on the history and structure of EPZs in India. Section 3 then discusses the knowledge problems associated with setting up a successful EPZ and how these knowledge problems which plague all EPZs have proved particularly challenging in India because of the way their EPZ and now SEZ regimes are structured. Section 4, then, looks at the most successful Indian EPZs to see if important lessons can be learned from Indian officials’ apparent successes at overcoming the knowledge problems associated with creating EPZs in those contexts. Finally, Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",

Bitros,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Once durable goods are put in place, in the overwhelming majority of cases, their earning capability starts to decline. This happens for many reasons. One is the intensity with which they are used because frequently it is responsible for their wear and tear or physical deterioration. Another is that all durable goods are designed and built for normal usage under certain conditions of maintenance; so, if owners cut corners with regard to manufacturers’ recommendations for proper maintenance, the quantity and at times the quality of their services decline. Lastly, a third reason is that with the passage of time, older durables become economically inferior because there appear newer ones that are able to produce the same amount of services with less resources since they embody the most recent advances in science and technology. However, in as much as the owners of durables have significant control over these and other influences, to transform the non-stationary replacement problem that Preinreich (1940) had posed, Terborgh (1949) introduced initially two simplifications. These were that the operating costs of durables in place increase and that the operating costs of newer vintages decline at constant rates per unit of time. As a result, he did manage to derive the optimal useful life of durables in the steady state of a perpetual stream of reinvestments, but at the cost of quashing the effects of utilization, maintenance, and technological obsolescence on the processes of replacement and scrapping. The field remained in the above state until Smith (1961) revisited it in a truly remarkable contribution to the theory of capital-using enterprise. As Terborgh did over a decade earlier, he continued to approximate the operating cost and salvage value functions involved in the perpetual replacement problem with linear forms. But, his modeling of the process by which market and engineering factors combine to reduce the efficiency of capital services was ingenious. In particular, he hypothesized that these factors work through two channels. One of them is the useful life and the other is the multitude of non-age-related forces that are responsible for the normal wear and tear of durable goods. Thus, to capture their impact on capital services, he postulated that the firm solved the following problem:Footnote 1
 where the various symbols have the following meanings: C = total cost; O = output; x = variable input like the amount of energy consumed; K = quantity of durable goods used in production; T = average useful life of the stock of durable goods; m = unit cost of variable input; q = purchase unit cost of the stock of durable goods; b = age-related rate of deterioration in the usage of the variable input; a = age-related rate of deterioration in the services from the incumbent durables due to embodied technological change in newer vintages; r = a constant rate of interest, and \( \hat{\delta } = \)a constant non-age-related proportional rate of deterioration in capital services. Now, from Eq. 1, it is clear that the notion of proportionality was adopted as a hypothesis for the first time by Smith (1961, p. 166), and it was motivated by his concern to allow for the impact on capital services of the numerous non-age-related factors.Footnote 2
 By contrast to the above, in a very influential paper that appeared 2 years later, Jorgenson (1963) stipulated in different but equivalent terms that the firm solved the problem:
 Clearly, this conceptualization constituted a major break from all past endeavors in this area, which centered primarily on the role of useful life in the services of the stock of durables. Therefore, the justifications that warranted this far-reaching departure from the received theory were of particular importance. In this regard, here is how Jorgenson (1963, p. 251) supported his assertion that the rate of deterioration of capital services is a constant proportion δ of the stock of durables involved: The justification for this assumption is that the appropriate model for replacement is not the distribution of replacements of a single investment over time but rather the infinite stream of replacements generated by a single investment; in the language of probability theory, replacement is a recurrent event. It is a fundamental result of renewal theory that replacements for such an infinite stream approach a constant proportion of capital stock for (almost) any distribution of replacements for a single investment and for any initial age distribution of capital stock. This is true for both constant and growing capital stocks… Thus, in view of its grounding in renewal theory and the forcefulness with which Jorgenson (1965) returned with further details to defend its validity, the theorem of proportionalityFootnote 3 (henceforth to be referred to as “the theorem”) started to take hold in economic theory as well as in econometric studies and policy applications. However, soon after it was launched, several researchers began to raise doubts about its underpinnings. Some of them emanated from theoretical considerations. Some other derived from empirical studies; and still some other sprung from the nature of the theories and practices adopted in neighboring scientific fields. But, all shared a common feature. Namely, they refuted the theoretical and empirical foundations on which it rested. Consequently, one would have expected that after a while it would have been abandoned or at least reconsidered.Footnote 4 Instead, what transpired was that the theorem came to dominate capital theory and its applications in computing capital stocks at various levels of aggregation through the perpetual inventory method. So, the questions that come naturally to mind are: Why have all arguments against this theorem failed to attract significant following among researchers and practitioners? What inferences might we draw in this regard from the program of research in macroeconomics, including the theories of economic growth, business cycles, and investment? Where else outside the confines of neoclassical economics might we look for insights regarding the processes of depreciation and replacement of durable goods? Are there alternative grounds on which to judge its validity? My objective is to assess the relevant literature in the expectation that it may shed some light on these questions and perhaps help settle the controversy that surrounds this theorem, if not in general, at least in those fields of economics where procedural consistency and precision in the measurement of capital is of utmost importance. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the views that have been expressed in favor and against the theorem by researchers working in the core areas of neoclassical economics. In particular, while early on the focus is on the theories of replacement, subsequently, the attention turns to macroeconomics, including economic growth and business cycles, and industrial organization. Then, Section 3 highlights the insights that may be derived from two sources. First, from the controversy on capital, which was instigated by several renown University of Cambridge, UK, economic theorists; and, second, from the Austrian theory of capital, which, by stressing the notions of roundaboutness and other essential characteristics of durable goods, is closely related to the issues under consideration. Section 4 assesses the theorem from a methodological point of view and sketches the rudiments of a model that may yield a better theorem, and, lastly, Section 5 closes with a synopsis of main findings and conclusions.",2

Seagren,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Austrian economists have provided a rich and unique perspective of economic science since the time of Carl Menger and Eugen Bohm-Bawerk. While there is some controversy over the extent to which mainstream economists have assimilated Austrian ideas, it is plain that the revival that began in the 1970s has yet to succeed in convincing the mainstream of the academy to jettison their physics-based mathematical models in favor of the sort of models and forms of argumentation that contemporary Austrians advocate. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate how Austrian economists might employ agent-based computational models as a means to complement research on traditional Austrian themes as well as improve the possibility of reaching a wider audience for those ideas. Whether you believe the label “Austrian” economics remains useful, or prefer to think in terms of ‘good’ economics and ‘bad’ economics, the primary methodological tenets of Austrian economics are an adherence to methodological individualism, subjectivism, and the notion of the market as a process through time. Recent advances in the broader fields of social science offer economists the opportunity to maintain consistency with respect to these methodological tenets while applying new tools that not only may provide insight into topics of concern to Austrians, but also positively influence the mainstream regarding Austrian ideas. For example, through their research agenda in cultural economy, Chamlee-Wright and Storr (2009) are pioneering ways in which economists use qualitative field studies to examine such important concepts as individual’s expectations of government actions and capabilities. A number of researchers such as Vernon Smith (2005), Kevin McCabe (2005), and Holcombe (2009) have pointed out areas where Austrian ideas overlap with advances in experimental and behavioral economics. Likewise, agent-based modeling is gaining traction among economists as an interesting alternative to strict neoclassical doctrine. All three threads of research offer great potential to breathe new life into the broader Austrian narrative. While agent-based modeling (ABM) is still in its relative infancy, it is gaining recognition among economists disenchanted with the neoclassical paradigm. A significant amount of criticism of neoclassical economic theory has to do with the fact that the assumptions required in order to maintain tractable mathematics also render the resulting model as woefully unrealistic. Agent-based modeling offers an alternative that enables researchers to examine the process of the emergence of complex phenomena while maintaining tractability. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the methodological consistencies between agent-based modeling and Austrian economics and chart a ‘way ahead’ of how one might develop a research agenda that leverages this technique. I argue that agent-based modeling can be used to enhance Austrian theorizing and offers a viable alternative to the neoclassical paradigm.",16

Young,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In Young (2005) I propose a simple test of Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT; Hayek 1933, 1935) using US industry-level quarterly job reallocation data and the federal funds rate as a monetary policy indicator. The econometric framework is based on a partial-adjustment model of reallocation. I find that ABCT accounts for an economically small portion of variation in job reallocation from 1972:2 to 1993:4. Murphy et al. (2009) claim that my effort “fails on several grounds” (p. 73). They claim to find “significantly different parameter estimates” and, furthermore, that my analysis, “even conducted flawlessly, would still be an improper ‘test’ of ABCT.” The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it responds in detail to the criticisms of Murphy, Barnett, and Block (henceforth MBB). Second, since MBB offer no positive suggestions for future econometric analysis of ABCT, I offer my own. MBB are content, ultimately, to dismiss such efforts entirely: “it is a mistake to think that one can [with regression analysis] illustrate, much less ‘test,’ ABCT” (p. 77). I argue, alternatively, that the analysis in Young (2005) incorporates two critical features for evaluating the economic importance of ABCT vis-à-vis other theories of the business cycle: the analysis (1) is quantitative—it distinguishes between statistical and economic significance and (2) attempts to exploit a hypothesis that is both a prediction of ABCT and not a prediction of competing monetary theories of the cycle. I review econometric studies of ABCT over the last 10 years and evaluate them in terms of their embodiment of (1) and (2). To motivate what follows, I first briefly review the analysis of Young (2005), which analyzes job reallocation in relation to the stance of monetary policy. The analysis of job reallocation is motivated by the Austrian emphasis on “a disaggregated capital sector whose constituent parts make up an alterable structure of production” (Garrison 1985, p. 310). Production processes and stages are heterogeneous and, therefore, hard to quantify. However, “changes in processes are initiated by reallocation of labor to different and/or new stages [and] reallocation both equips [...] and carries out [...] the stages” (Young 2005, p. 276). Labor flows are (relatively) homogenous and quantifiable relative to the resulting production structures. Furthermore, in contrast to other studies of monetary effects on reallocation (e.g., Davis and Haltiwanger (1996, 2001)), ABCT suggests a distinct hypothesis involving asymmetric effects. Since the lengthening and shortening of production processes both require movement of labor from some stages into others, total reallocation (i.e., job creation plus job destruction) will be positively related to both inflationary and deflationary (in the Austrian, credit-based sense) policy stances. Therefore, changes in the federal funds rate enter the regressions in absolute value. This focus on asymmetric effects is both consistent with ABCT and avoids the problem of observational equivalence with competing, aggregate-demand-based theories of the effects of monetary policy. As stated above, Young (2005) reports that ABCT accounts for an economically small portion of variation in job reallocation from 1972:2 to 1993:4. The (asymmetric) effect of policy of job reallocation is statistically significant. Taken at face value, this implies that ABCT cannot be rejected as “true” in that it is consistent with the relationships found in the data. However, it is not economically significant in accounting for job reallocation over the 1972:2–1993:4 period. A standard deviation change in the federal funds rate is associated with only 11% of a standard deviation change in job reallocation. MBB raise various criticisms of my paper. First, the authors argue that there are “internal problems” (p. 73) with the partial-adjustment model on which the regressions are based, as well as the data employed in that context. Second, they claim that the parameter estimates reported in Young (2005) are incorrect. Moreover, MBB claim that the correct estimate monetary policy’s effect on reallocation actually “bolsters ABCT” (p. 76). Third, MBB raise broader methodological concerns about any efforts to “test” ABCT. This paper is organized as follows. The three major criticisms that MBB levy against Young (2005) are addressed in Sections 2, 3, and 4, respectively. My responses, in advance and concisely, are
 The internal criticism does not highlight fundamental flaws but rather opportunities for positive contributions and/or robustness checks (which MBB make no effort to pursue) Even if MBB’s parameter estimates are correct, they still represent economically small effects and, therefore, do nothing to bolster ABCT The broader criticism concerning ABCT being illustratable but not testable is largely semantic, at least in the context of the current research MBB’s contribution is entirely negative. In addition to being (in my opinion) largely mistaken, it is also unproductive. Having defended my own research, but recognizing that future positive contributions are needed, Section 5 reviews other recent econometric evaluations of ABCT and makes suggestions for future research. Section 6 concludes.",10

Garnett Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"To the ear of the market-minded economist, pleas for pluralism sound like coercion: well-intentioned demands for scholarly balance or inclusiveness that are illiberal and ultimately impractical. Peter Boettke voices precisely this concern in a recent essay on “Methodological Pluralism and the Austrian School of Economics” (Boettke 2007).Footnote 1 Boettke is no enemy of pluralism. His professional activities and published works over the past 25 years show an abiding commitment to intellectual openness and inter-paradigmatic exchange. Yet he rejects the notion that individual scholars must think or act in a pluralistic manner in order for pluralism to thrive in the marketplace of ideas. To the contrary, he argues that the most powerful engines of intellectual progress are individuals who specialize without apology, who “pursue truth as they see it” and “pursue it doggedly even in the face of great doubt and resistance” (ibid.). To insist that scholars adhere to pluralist protocols is to tax their pursuit of comparative intellectual advantage and thereby diminish their unique contributions to the scholarly community. The invisible hand of academic truth, on Boettke’s account, renders pluralism a valuable “by-product, [but] not a cause, of scientific progress” (ibid.).Footnote 2
 This paper offers a Smithian revision of Boettke’s position. I find Boettke’s market process view of pluralism instructive, and I appreciate his efforts to encourage colleagues and students to spend more time developing positive Austrian insights and less time negotiating the morass of meta-economic correctness. Yet in attending to these legitimate ends, Boettke reverts to an economically Walrasian and ethically Mandevillian conception of the intellectual marketplace that diverges from the Smith/Hayek/Lavoie/Buchanan/McCloskey tradition of economic and meta-economic thinking of which he is an exemplary champion. In the hope of eliciting further discussion on this matter, I propose a definition and rationale for pluralism that is congenial to Boettke’s market process approach. Pace Backhouse (2001, 163), I define pluralism as “methodological awareness and toleration,” a scholarly ethic that asks each scholar to “be aware of the [methodological] choices they have made, the grounds on which these choices rest, and the limitations of these grounds.”Footnote 3 Under this definition, pluralism can be regarded as a constitutional rule of academic life—a virtue ethic that promotes learning and intellectual freedom by mitigating tyranny and autarky in the republic of science. Drawing from the writings of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Deirdre McCloskey, James Buchanan, Don Lavoie, and Boettke himself, I argue that scholarly pluralism has been, and continues to be, a necessary condition for the flourishing of Austrian economists as free, responsible, efficacious thinkers.",4

Garnett says his pluralism is like the ethics of Adam Smith, whereas Boettke’s pluralism is like Mandaville’s amoralism. Both scholars err by practicing representative agent methodology. My objections to representative agent methodology are based on social epistemology and epistemological naturalism, which have been enjoying increasing popularity in Anglo-American philosophy. Boettke and Garnett both place their methodology in the context of writers such as Polanyi (1969) and Thomas Kuhn (1970), who emphasize the social dimension of science. Science is a social process and the dispute between our two authors should be understood within that context. And yet each of them seems to invoke a model of science that radically simplifies its social structure. Boettke (2007) distinguishes only two types of agents, the “caretakers of the institutional framework of the republic of science” and the individual scientist, whom he encourages to be “doggedly committed.” Garnett has a slightly more complicated model in which he distinguishes a third type of agent, “disciplinary and school-of-thought leaders.” Boettke thinks pluralism should be an explicit concern of the caretakers of the institutional order, but not individual scientists. Garnett thinks disciplinary and school-of-thought leaders should also be concerned with pluralism. Garnett thinks it best if “all scholars participate in the constitutional process of defining and enacting the epistemic rules of the game.” Disciplinary and school-of-thought leaders have a special responsibility, however, because they have power. In the models of Boettke and Garnett, scholars differ only in their opinions and which of a small number of roles they might play in the system (two for Boettke, three for Garnett). There is no cognitive or epistemic diversity and no explicit attention to comparative advantage. There is very little attention paid to the “intellectual division of labor” (von Mises 1935, p. 102) in science and none to the intellectual division of labor that exists within schools of thought. This relatively thin picture of the social structure of science that has led both Garnett and Boettke to ask how “individual scholars must think or act.” In other words, they both ask how the representative scholar should behave. My criticism of Boettke and Garnett echoes the criticism D’Agostino (2009) makes of Kitcher (1990) and of his own earlier work. Kitcher’s influential paper, “The Division of Cognitive Labor,” made several points that seem to harmonize more with Boettke than Garnett. He notes that truth-seeking scholars might all bet on the same theoretical horse, generating collectively suboptimal portfolio of active research programs. There is a gap between individual and collective rationality. He notes the more vain and venal scientists might find it in their interest to bet on a long shot they do not quite believe in because priority of discovery would bring fame or fortune. “The very factors that are frequently thought of as interfering with the rational pursuit of science—the thirst for fame and fortune, for example—might actually play a constructive role in our community of epistemic projects” (Kitcher 1990, p. 16). For Kitcher, private vices lead to publick virtues. “[S]ocial institutions within science might take advantage of our personal foibles to channel our efforts toward community goals rather than toward the epistemic ends that we might set for ourselves as individuals” (p. 16). Kitcher even seems to anticipate Garnett’s concerns about the power of disciplinary and school-of-thought leaders. If everyone is working on the more probable of two theories, for example, then it may well be that no individual scientist (whether piously truth seeking or hot for fame and fortune) has an incentive to work alone on the less probable theory. The problem is that the chance of a breakthrough depends on the number of persons working on a theory. Thus, the lone maverick may have too small a chance of reaching a breakthrough. In this situation, Kitcher says, powerful leaders may be able to get “several people to jump ship together” (p. 17). He is thinking of laboratories and not schools of thought, but that difference does not seem to affect the underlying logic of the case. As if to purge any doubt that Kitcher is identifying a benefit of epistemic power, he compares labs to medieval fiefdoms. “Imagine,” he says, “that the community is divided into fiefdoms (laboratories) and that, when the local chief (the lab director) decides to switch, the local peasantry (the graduate students) move, too.” This forced march produces an epistemic benefit for the community by diversifying its portfolio of active theories. Kitcher draws the moral that “a certain amount of local autocracy...can enable the community to be more flexible than it otherwise would be” (p. 17). Kitcher clearly sides with Boettke when he says, “Perseverance, personal investment, personal and national loyalties, and devotion to political causes may, on occasion, help” to bring the number of rival theories or methods up toward the collectively rational level (p. 18). D’Agostino criticized Kitcher, complaining, “Kitcher never really dealt with a proper division of labor, in the sense of Adam Smith or Karl Marx” (2009, p. 103). He forthrightly confesses, “Neither did I in earlier work. . . . What none of us did was consider whether, for example, a project of enquiry might be subdivided into different tasks that could then be distributed across different individuals or teams within the community” (103, emphasis in original). The contributions of Kitcher and D’Agostino come out of two related trends in Anglo-American philosophy, the trend to social epistemology and the trend to epistemological naturalism.",7

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Pluralism “…takes as its starting assumption that no universally applicable, logically compelling method of theory appraisal exists.” (Caldwell 1982: 245) There is a strong argument supporting pluralism, based on the methodology that underlies the economic research of all schools of thought. Economists work within the framework of models that are built on simplifying assumptions, and different approaches make different assumptions, yielding different insights. While heterodox economists—including Austrians—often criticize the economic orthodoxy as if it is monolithic, it actually is very pluralistic, something Holcombe (2008) argues is rarely recognized. The pluralism of the profession as a whole lends more insight into economic analysis than would a narrower approach to economic analysis. While mainstream economics is pluralistic, most economists are not, regardless of where they fall on the mainstream-heterodox continuum. Garnett (2010) and Boettke (2007) consider whether Austrian economists should be pluralistic. Heterodox economists, such as those in the Austrian school, need to be more pluralistic in their understanding than mainstream economists, just to get their ideas heard beyond the confines of their school. Austrian school economists must be able to frame their ideas within the mainstream literature to get a hearing. But this does not imply that Austrian school economists should take a pluralistic approach to their research. The reason: when doing research, as in other activities, specialization makes one more productive.",1

Garnett Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This exchange has clarified my thinking on the place and meaning of pluralism in the republic of science. I agree with Boettke that “We don’t need individuals committed to pluralism in economic explanation.” The pluralism I advocate is academic, not methodological. It does not require scholars to hold ‘plural’ allegiances to multiple paradigms. It is an ethic of responsible academic citizenship that urges scholars to conduct their business in a more cosmopolitan, less sectarian, manner, animated by a desire “to learn from those who [do] not share their ideological or methodological perspective” (Boettke 2004, 379), and an understanding (tacit or conscious) that our ultimate commitment as academics is to the conversation of the academy at large, e.g., Conant's citadel of learning (Conant 1956), Oakeshott's conversation of humankind (Oakeshott 1959), Polanyi's society of explorers (Polanyi 1966), or Bloom's community of man (Bloom 1987). Schools of thought play a vital role in the republic of social science as catalysts for academic liberty and learning. Their positive epistemic effects are blunted, however, when the scholarly norms of paradigm communities are geared primarily to intra-group production and exchange of ideas, as often occurs in historically marginalized groups or institutionally insulated mainstreams. Ridley's celebration of intellectual promiscuity stands in stark contrast to the images and ideals of intellectual monogamy that still prevail in the academy, particularly within non-mainstream schools of thought. In the monogamy model of science, the good scientist marries a tradition as a young adult and sticks with it, come what may. In Boettke's original statement, for example, he claims that “scientists... have to commit themselves to an approach and pursue it doggedly even in the face of great doubt and resistance by [their] peers” and, similarly, that “we all are forced at some point to make a choice of what perspective we are going to pursue in our economic work” (Boettke 2007). Boettke's references to a singular commitment (one “approach,” one “perspective”) at a single moment in time (“at some point”) are suggestive of an exclusive, once-and-for-all vision of theory choice. Such a vision also suggests (though Boettke himself may not hold this view) that ‘promiscuous’ scholars who practice serial monogamy or who circulate among various traditions without ever making an exclusive commitment to any one of them are likely to contribute less to science than those who marry a single perspective for life. Our intellectual lifestyle options are of course not limited to ‘promiscuity’ or ‘monogamy.’ Even if we think only in terms of these two categories, each can be enacted in very different ways depending on the formal and informal rules, by which they are governed. Scholars can be worldly yet committed monogamists, for example. On the other hand, when paradigm communities promote monogamist images of the good scientist without also advocating a strong ethic of scholarly pluralism, they are encouraging restrictions on the flow of ideas, the depth of verstehen, and the extent of trust, rivalry, and learning within and among schools of thought. Ridley would not approve, nor would Hayek, Lavoie, McCloskey, or Adam Smith. For the paradigmatically committed scholar, Smithian pluralism inspires greater intellectual imagination and alertness, and provides a way to produce more creative and compelling arguments than its provincial alternatives. These are ends and means that every Austrian economist can liberally endorse.",

The question arises, to what extent the style of economic thought which has been predominant for about half a century, at least in the Western World, can do justice to the problems of human action in a rapidly changing world, and, in particular, in a tempestuous epoch. Ludwig M. Lachmann (1984, p. 1) This essay confronts three bodies of methodological literature with one another: the growth of knowledge literature on the methods of the sciences in general, the continental philosophy known as “hermeneutics” (or the science of interpretation) on the methods of the social sciences, and the methodology that the Austrian school economist Ludwig von Mises called “praxeology” (or the science of human action) on the methods of economics in particular. The upshot of this confrontation will be that all three bodies of literature argue for what will be called an “interpretive” approach to scientific explanation. My aim is to introduce to philosophers and economists two specialized methodological literatures that go by such obscure names as hermeneutics and praxeology by using themes from a body of literature with which both philosophers and economists are quite familiar, the growth of knowledge tradition. The growth of knowledge literature gives us important insight into the nature of human knowledge in general but unfortunately confines its attention to the natural sciences. The hermeneutics literature fills this gap with important explanations, broadly consistent with the central message of the growth of knowledge approach, of those aspects of knowledge that are particularly important to the social sciences. But hermeneutics itself, at least in its modern revivals, fails to address its insights about social scientific methods to one of the most important of the social sciences, economics. The methodology Austrian economists call praxeology can be seen in turn as exemplary of a hermeneutical approach to economics. And all three of these methodological literatures lend support to a common conclusion that neoclassical economics is badly in need of reform and that this reform could be described as a restoration of the interpretive dimension to our economic discourse. The style of modern neoclassical economics which Ludwig Lachmann labels “late classical formalism,” and which Austrian economists frequently lament, may be attributable to an intrusive methodological bias against the “interpretive” dimension of economics. This bias became dominant relatively late in the history of economics (Lachmann dates it from about the 1930s) and can be seen as an unfortunate symptom of the philosophical perspective that the Austrian economists often called positivism and that will here be called objectivism. Objectivism, I contend, has led to an inappropriate devaluation of the very features of neoclassical economics which have been best advanced in its Austrian branch. These “interpretive” features of economic explanation will be elaborated below and for now will be simply named the historical (both history proper and history of ideas), linguistic, narrative, dialogical, perspectivistic, tacit, and sociological aspects of economic explanation.Footnote 1 Objectivism has been so powerful an influence in economics that, even though many of the most prominent economists of the 1930s such as Keynes and Knight stressed the importance of many of these interpretive aspects of explanation, the dominant schools of thought that claim to descend from Keynes and Knight have come to seriously neglect this dimension. Fortunately, within philosophical circles objectivism has now been largely repudiated, most notably in the famous “growth of knowledge” literature.Footnote 2 But before its demise, objectivism left a profound legacy of what could be called scientifically inappropriate prejudices in all the disciplines it touched, including, besides economics, psychology, political science, history, sociology, and linguistics.Footnote 3 Now, reinforced by the growth of knowledge tradition, as well as several other developments in contemporary philosophy, the methodological grip of objectivism is loosening in most of these disciplines and their interpretive dimensions are becoming correspondingly enriched. Economists have not, luckily, taken their objectivism so seriously that it has prevented them from understanding the real world or from improving upon our theoretical and empirical knowledge. It may be the case, however, that the progress of knowledge in our discipline has been retarded by this bias against the interpretive dimension. We have been consistently misrepresenting the nature of economic explanation. As McCloskey pointed out, though it is usually economists’ interpretive skills that guide them when they think about the economy, and it is only the explanations they themselves find interpretively compelling that persuade them, it is only the econometrics or the mathematical proofs that they consider the scientific part of their work.Footnote 4 Theories, we solemnly teach our students, must be accepted or rejected only on the basis of their predictive accuracy or mathematical rigor. A mere “interpretation” of an historical episode cannot compete effectively for space in our contemporary journals with an econometric test of a specific quantitative model. Nor can a mere interpretation of the meaning of an economic theory compete on equal terms with the rigorous development of a new formal model. There remains in economics a strong “objectivist bias” against the qualitative/interpretive aspects of research in favor of the quantitative/predictive aspects. Worst of all the objectivist bias has made economics boring. Several minority schools in the contemporary profession—from Marxists, institutionalists, and post-Keynesians to supply siders—may be said to be relatively free of this objectivist bias compared with mainstream neoclassicism. Neoclassical economists, however, seem to view these schools as if they were Barbarian Hoards at the Gates of Economic Science, threatening to undermine the positive standards, and thus the most fundamental principles, of microeconomics.Footnote 5 While this fear is certainly exaggerated, many mainstream economists may legitimately wonder whether the progress which was made as a result of the marginalist/subjectivist revolution in micro could be lost to the anti-theoretical historicism of institutionalists, or the predominantly macro perspectives of supply siders and post-Keynesians, or the complete reversion to nineteenth century economics in the objective value theory of Marxism. The basic truths we economists teach our principles students about supply and demand and the logic of choice may seem, to many of us, to be genuinely threatened by the growing dissatisfaction with neoclassical microeconomics. On the other hand, the flourishing of such diverse schools of thought may be seen as a hopeful sign that the profession is starting to stir, if not yet awaken, from its methodological slumber. Economics today is, as Lachmann put it, in tempestuous season. It comes more and more to reflect an interesting rivalry among divergent perspectives, each begging for clear interpretation from the others, rather than a monolithic system of objectively “tested” quantitative relationships which neither asks for nor seems to require any interpretation. As such, it appears increasingly likely not only that each of the minority schools will have to extend the interpretive dimension of their research, in order to explain in plain language what their theory is supposed to mean, but also that the neoclassical mainstream may be compelled to do so if it intends to defend those cherished principles of choice theory against the “hoards.” When it does, it may find that of the three great branches of marginalist/subjectivist economics that emerged in the 1870s, the interpretive side of economics has been best advanced in the tradition that followed Menger rather than Walras or Jevons. The thesis of this paper will be that economists should free our research from the objectivist bias and correspondingly alter our style of scientific discourse. Economists should, in light of the growth of knowledge and hermeneutics literatures, restore to its pre-objectivist status the interpretive dimension of our work. Economics will have to become, once again, more a forum for the open contention among interpretations of theory and history, than the kind of simulated laboratory for the objective testing of hypotheses, or ivory tower for the proof of mathematical theorems, it is now. This challenge to neoclassical economics is not an external but rather an immanent criticism. It does not urge the overthrow of the basic analytical content of modern economics as it arose from the marginalist/subjectivist revolution in the 1870s. The conclusion at which this paper aims is a demonstration that in the Austrian branch of neoclassicism, we can discover a way to reinstate an interpretive dimension into the style of economic discourse without opening the gates to the anti-microeconomic “hoards.” The subsequent argument will be organized into three stages representing a progressive narrowing of focus, moving from science, to social science, and then to economics. These three stages of argument can be usefully summarized by reference to three recent books on methodology that provide successive parts of an argument on behalf of the Austrian variant of neoclassical economics. T.W. Hutchison’s The Politics and Philosophy of Economics, Marxians, Keynesians and Austrians (1981), although broadly very supportive of the contributions of the Austrians, interprets Mises’s praxeology as a pre-Popperian methodology that has been made obsolete by the growth of knowledge literature. Bruce Caldwell’s Beyond Positivism: Economic Methodology in the Twentieth Century (1982) argues that, contrary to Hutchison, praxeology is fully consistent with the valid message of Popperianism and with the growth of knowledge literature in general. Richard J. Bernstein’s Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis (1983), although it contains no specific references to economics or Austrian methodology, can be seen as showing why an approach like praxeology should be considered a post-Popperian methodology for economics, a methodology that is consistent with, but goes beyond, that of the growth of knowledge literature. Despite Hutchison’s rather favorable assessment of the “essential Austrian message of individualism and subjectivism” (1981, p. 224), he objects strenuously to what he sees as a “pretense of knowledge” in some Austrian writings, a pretense with which the growth of knowledge literature is in “an absolutely fundamental philosophical clash” (1981, p. 229). Hutchison, for example, ridicules Mises’s and Wieser’s notion that one of the primary sources of knowledge for economics is “introspection,” to which Hutchison disdainfully refers as some sort of “infallible inner voice.”Footnote 6 Methodologies like Mises’s and Wieser’s, he argues, depend on private knowledge and thus are in principle unfalsifiable. Therefore, Hutchison concludes, according to the basic ideas stemming from the growth of knowledge literature, praxeology is unscientific dogmatism. Bruce Caldwell, on the other hand, offers a more sympathetic reading of Austrian methodology, and argues that the usual attacks on it, including Hutchison’s, are inadequate. Instead of applying Popperian falsificationist standards, which Caldwell finds neither as clear-cut as Hutchison seems to think, nor as appropriate to addressing the Austrians’ argument, Caldwell (1982, pp. 128–135) provides an outline of what a critique that “meets the Austrians on their own ground” would look like: A different route for criticizing praxeology makes use of the notion of theory choice.... On what grounds do we choose among competing theories?....But we find in the Austrian literature no discussion of theory choice. The reason is not difficult to discover: since the Austrian system is presumably founded on a priori true postulates, it is either true or false... However [this stance] does run into problems of its own, chiefly because a priori true postulates (and the systems that follow from them by deduction) at least seem capable of multiplication. Thus Caldwell urges the Austrians to specify more definite criteria for theory choice than they have, but unlike Hutchison he finds nothing in the Austrians’ methodology that renders it inherently unscientific. The growth of knowledge literature teaches us to adopt an attitude of tolerance with respect to schools of thought which may apply different criteria of theory choice than does mainstream neoclassical economics. For Hutchison, the chief lesson economists should learn from the growth of knowledge literature is that we should strive for more falsifiable theories, from which he concludes that methodologies like those of some Austrians are to be rejected. For Caldwell, on the other hand, the lesson is that economists should be more tolerant of divergent approaches and should promote a methodological pluralism, from which he concludes that methodologies like those of these same Austrians ought to be taken more seriously. Evidently these conflicting assessments of Austrian methodology are traceable to diametrically opposed interpretations of the growth of knowledge literature. To resolve their conflicting interpretations of this literature, the Hutchison and Caldwell books need to be supplemented by a third book on methodology, Richard J. Bernstein’s Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis, which offers an intriguing comparison and integration of the growth of knowledge tradition with “hermeneutics.”Footnote 7 Bernstein’s analytical procedure is to juxtapose, and as far as possible, integrate together three literatures including both the growth of knowledge and hermeneutics literatures examined here as well as a Marxian perspective not to be considered here, namely Habermas’s philosophy of “Praxis.” As the title of this paper suggests, my analytical procedure will be to extend Bernstein’s integrative effort, and in particular apply it, as he did not, to economics, by substituting praxeology for praxis. The scholarly tradition that traces back to Menger’s “subjective” value theory in economics ought to be at least as conducive to hermeneutical and growth of knowledge perspectives as is the tradition that traces back to Marx’s “objective” theory of value.Footnote 8
 Bernstein’s work discusses (and is an example of) a recent flourishing of interest, within philosophy and most of the social sciences, in the continental tradition of hermeneutics, but this development has unfortunately left economics almost untouched. It reveals a characteristic of the whole modern hermeneutic movement when the editors of an excellent new book of readings (Rabinow and Sullivan 1979, p. 10) declare that their aim is to present modern hermeneutics to “a wide audience” and then list historians, sociologists, anthropologists, psychologists, historians of religion, scientists, and philosophers. Economists might have earned this neglect but economics doesn’t deserve it. In fact the pioneers of hermeneutics such as Dilthey and Weber had a great interest in economic issues, and the general methodological lessons hermeneutics can teach social scientists seem eminently applicable to economics. It is from insights into the nature of human understanding arising in this tradition that a path for the adjudication of the Caldwell/Hutchison disputes can be found. According to Bernstein’s interpretation of the growth of knowledge debates, scientific explanation necessarily involves not only a “predictive” dimension but also what has been called a hermeneutical or “interpretive” one. Not only must a theory predict accurately, it must also interpret intelligibly, that is, it must tell a plausible story about how the results explain some otherwise problematic aspect of reality. While an appropriate vehicle of expression for prediction is formal mathematics, the only appropriate medium for the expression of interpretation is the full language of a culture. Previous to the growth of knowledge literature, philosophers of science tended to believe that science is nothing but measurement and quantitative prediction and that theories are always and only tentative hypotheses with which objective, unambiguous “facts” are confronted. The growth of knowledge theories of science, as Patrick Heelan (1983a, p. 197) put it, “introduce a hermeneutic dimension into natural science.” Today, philosophers and historians of science widely agree that the “objectivist” image of the natural sciences is both undescriptive of the actual methods of scientists and internally incoherent as a feasible way of advancing knowledge. In particular, it fails to leave room for an interpretive dimension in which the qualitative plausibility of an explanation can be judged on a par with its quantitative accuracy.Footnote 9
 The goal of this paper, then, is to reconstruct an interpretation of economic methodology that is capable of answering the lines of criticism of the Austrians represented by both the Hutchison and Caldwell books, on the basis of the methodological approach elaborated by the Bernstein book. Like all three, my point of departure will be a methodological lesson drawn from the growth of knowledge literature. The next section will summarize the central message of that literature, along the lines elaborated by Bernstein, as a demonstration of the indispensability of the interpretive dimension of all the sciences, as well as the implication of this fact for the problem of theory choice raised by Caldwell against Austrian methodology. Part 3 will then describe some of the main themes of the hermeneutics tradition and the answer it implicitly contains to the problem, raised by Hutchison against the Austrians, of uncriticizable introspective knowledge. Part 4 will then outline a case, based on Mises’s methodological writings, that the Austrians’ approach represents an application to economics of the insights into human understanding that have been supplied by both the growth of knowledge and hermeneutics literatures.",41

Worst of all, the objectivist bias has made economics boring. —Don Lavoie (2011) Through his scholarship and training of graduate students, Don Lavoie advocated the development of an economics of meaning by bringing the interpretive turn to the economics discipline. In keeping with the Austrian tradition, an economics of meaning is one that recognizes the essential connection between purpose, plan formation, expectations, action, and learning at the individual level, on the one hand, and widespread patterns of social coordination on the other. In one respect, the impulse to ground explanations of economic phenomena in individual action is well-honed within the economics profession, but the “individual” is more often than not a generic individual devoid of historical context, culture, gender, or identity. Or as Deirdre McCloskey frequently describes, the universe of mainstream economists is populated with “Max-U’s.” Because Max-U is devoid of any particular interpretive frame (other than generic self-interest), standard economics has no reason to and no means to go beyond the most basic levels of meaning and purpose. Lavoie argued throughout his career that the connections between purpose, action, plan formation, expectation, and learning remain beyond the investigator's intellectual reach without a deliberate introduction of the interpretive dimension. Thus, we cannot understand questions that are most essential to economics, for example, Hayek's (1984 [1948]) question of how it is that people come to possess relevant pieces of and effectively use the knowledge dispersed in society, without including the interpretive dimension into our discipline. Lavoie develops his argument favoring the interpretive turn in economics primarily by building off of Gadamer (1975a, 1975b), Bernstein (1983), Ricoeur (1965, 1981), and others working within the hermeneutic philosophical tradition, Geertz (1973, 1979) and others within interpretive social science, and by identifying the interpretive themes within Mises (1966, 1969, 1978, 1981a, 1981b) and other members of the Austrian school. Lavoie saw the interpretive turn as possessing a natural affinity with the Austrian school's emphasis on the necessary connection between meaning, purposefulness, and action (Mises 1966). Furthermore, Lavoie saw the Austrian school's focus on the link between individual action and unintended patterns of social coordination as one ripe for interpretive analysis, just as it had been applied in the study of language and the transmission of cultural norms.Footnote 1 Lavoie recognized that science must possess a predictive element, but the lesson he drew from the interpretive turn was that if it was to be good science, it must also tell a plausible story. Good scientific stories are those that render complex circumstances intelligible to the trained mind. Quantitative methods are useful for the predictive dimension, but to get at the interpretive element, the research must draw upon the “full language of a culture” (Lavoie 2011). Lavoie profoundly influenced several generations of Austrian scholars, many of whom became convinced that the intentions and subjective meanings of subjects operating within particular institutional and cultural contexts ought to feature prominently in our economic investigations.Footnote 2 In his teaching, in his selections for readings groups, in his mentoring of graduate students, and in some of his later writing, it was clear that he considered qualitative empirical methods, such as in-depth case analysis, archival investigations of first-hand accounts, ethnographic interviews, and participant observation to possess appealing qualities that the quantitative empirical methods so dominant within the economics profession lacked (Lavoie and Chamlee-Wright 2000).Footnote 3 But Lavoie's own work was largely focused on the history of economic thought and grounded in the literature on the philosophy of the social sciences. Though Lavoie was an enthusiastic advocate of empirical work influenced by the interpretive dimension, he was not in a particularly strong position to offer specific guidance on the nuts and bolts of qualitative methods (something for which he received a fair amount of good-natured ribbing from his graduate students).Footnote 4 More importantly, and perhaps because he was not a practitioner of qualitative methods himself, Lavoie's explicit argument connecting the case for the interpretive turn and the case favoring qualitative methods remained underdeveloped. The argument I make in this paper is that implicit within Lavoie's advocacy of the interpretive turn is a case for a particular mode of discovery that resists the excesses of formalism common within professional economics and instead puts the investigator, the investigator's theoretical lens, and the subject under investigationFootnote 5 in close proximity to one another. With the nodal points of this triangulated relationship in closer proximity to one another, an iterative learning process emerges that is an essential source of social scientific discovery. A greater use of qualitative research methods can help to correct economics' excessive reliance upon quantitative analysis in its empirical investigations and reduce the distance between the investigator and the subject under investigation. My intent is to make these implicit arguments explicit.Footnote 6 Specifically, I will argue that the economics discipline's excessive reliance on formal theoretical models and quantitative empirical methods have inhibited the discovery that would otherwise unfold. Furthermore, I will argue that qualitative empirical methods generally eschewed by the economics profession are an essential component of operationalizing an economics of meaning.",9

As a graduate student who arrived at George Mason the year this essay appeared as a working paper, it was an introduction to Don’s vision of Austrian economics, and it pointed in the directions that many of us at the time thought Austrian work needed to take more seriously. Beyond the details, the ideas in this paper were inspiring to those of us who were grad students at the time because they represented an opening of a window in the house of Austrian economics. For understandable reasons, there had not been that many genuinely new ideas among Austrians in the years leading up to the 1980s. Don’s work pointed in radically new directions, from methodology, to theory, to history, to the relationship between economics and politics. The air he let into the room was mostly fresh, though not all of his ideas stood the test of time. Of those ideas, one of the most important for the work that was to follow in the last 25 years was his discussion of the relationship between theory and history. The small numbers of Austrians that populated the economics discipline in the 1960s and 1970s meant that Austrians devoted the vast majority of their time to clarifying the theoretical foundations of their approach, with little time to show how that approach might pay off in its applications. This perspective was reinforced by a sense among many, coming perhaps from a misreading of Mises, that theory was primary and history was secondary. After all, if history could not “prove” anything and theory was “apodictically certain,” then why bother doing history when theory was where the action and glamour were? The “Interpretive Dimension” essay was part of a broader perspective Don brought to his training of graduate students that emphasized the importance of applying Austrian ideas by offering better historical narratives about major issues of professional contention than did other economists and scholars outside economics. For Don, the fertility of Austrian economics was in its ability to illuminate history, including the very recent history sometimes called “policy analysis.” The dissertations he supervised all included historical work, and many of them became published books.Footnote 1 This emphasis continues today with Peter Boettke encouraging his own graduate students to pursue “analytical narratives” by bringing in ideas from Austrian economics and other related traditions in economics to do history that combines good theory and good up-close empirics. In this paper, I want to pay tribute to Don’s inspiration along these lines by using the current recession as an example of many of the ideas on theory and history that are found in the “Interpretive Dimension” paper. More specifically, I start from the premise that all history comes from theory because it is theory that guides what we count as “facts” or “data.” From Menger onward, a core element of the Austrian approach has been to see the purpose of theory as rendering human action and its unintended consequences intelligible. We do that by telling historical narratives where theory is the logical glue that holds the story together. Austrians tend to break theory into two pieces: the core theoretical insights, often called praxeological laws, and the auxiliary assumptions we make when we apply theory to particular historical episodes. Together, these provide the “glue” that enables us to give a narrative account of the historical episode in question. Lavoie also argues that history can be an inspiration for theory by providing us with questions we may not have ever asked before. In what follows, I will look at the Austrian story of the Great Recession in light of these ideas.",4

In economic life, as we shall see, people’s reliance on shared traditions plays a key role in enabling them to overcome uncertainty about the future and thereby act in a purposeful fashion. In the history and methodology of economics, it is tradition that helps to direct scholarly attention to some types of problem, deemed to be important, rather than others (Lavoie 2011). The importance of tradition is readily apparent in the framing and focus of Don Lavoie’s elegant and insightful essay on “The Interpretive Dimension of Economics” (Lavoie 2011). The essay is oriented towards the Popperian and Lakatosian tradition of thought that dominated economic methodology in the 1970s and 1980s.Footnote 1 In keeping with those approaches, Lavoie’s essay is primarily concerned with various epistemological questions concerning our knowledge of the economy, centering most notably on the choice of criteria for appraising economic theories, the epistemic status of the knowledge claims that emerge from that process of appraisal and the possibility of deriving an algorithm or set of methodological rules specifying best practice in economic research. In addressing such issues, Lavoie’s aim is to find the middle ground between the polar extremes of foundationalism, whether that comes in a rationalist (Euclidean) or an empiricist guise, and an ‘anything goes’ relativism that deprives us of any grounds for judging one theory to be superior to another. Drawing most prominently on the writings of Hans-Georg Gadamer ([1975] 1993) and Richard J. Bernstein (1983), Lavoie situates his preferred middle ground in the debates that take place within the relevant community of scholars. More specifically, according to Lavoie’s ‘interpretive’ or ‘hermeneutic’ approach, theories should be judged, not by reference abstract methodological rules derived from the philosophy of science, but rather by their ability to command support in the course of scholarly debate and conversation. Accordingly, we should treat as provisionally and fallibly true those theories that have won the support of the majority of the relevant community of scholars (Lavoie 2011).Footnote 2
 There is, however, another facet of economic methodology, discussion of which is largely absent from Lavoie’s work, namely social ontology. Since the late 1980s, there has been an increasing concern with the ontological presuppositions of economic theories (that is, with what those theories presuppose about the nature of the economic world). While few, if any, of Lavoie’s publications focused explicitly on the topic of social ontology, there are at least three reasons to believe that a focus on ontological issues would have proven congenial to him. First, in keeping with many heterodox economists, Lavoie pitched many of his arguments in favour of his own preferred approach to economics on ontological grounds (in particular, the importance of choosing methods of economic analysis, such as case studies, that are tailored to suit the ‘interpretive’ or subjective nature of economic life) (Lavoie 2011). Second, one of the distinguishing features of the philosophical approach employed by Lavoie, namely philosophical hermeneutics, was that it marked an ‘ontological turn’ in interpretive social science. Hermeneutics or verstehen was now portrayed, not in epistemic terms as a distinctive social scientific method, but ontologically, as an account of human nature and human being in the world. Third, while Lavoie’s published writings contain little if any explicit ontological analysis, there is some evidence from records of Lavoie’s lectures that he was sympathetically disposed towards the approach to social ontology outlined below (Prychitko 2009: 192 n. 9). The fact that philosophical hermeneutics involves a turn towards ontology is potentially interesting because it offers scope for connecting Lavoie’s approach with some of the other, more ontologically oriented developments in economic methodology that were gaining momentum at around the same time as Lavoie and his students were developing their own ‘interpretive turn’ (see, for example, Lawson 1989, 1994; Runde 1993; Fleetwood 1995).Footnote 3 Forging such a connection is the aim of the current paper, which seeks to show how an explicit focus on ontological issues can complement and support the ‘interpretive turn’ via a case study of one of the inspirations of, and contributors to, that project, namely Ludwig Lachmann.Footnote 4
 Lachmann was an early advocate of an interpretive turn in economics (see, for example, Lachmann 1970; also see Lachmann 1990).Footnote 5 As would subsequently also be true of Lavoie and other supporters of hermeneutics, Lachmann was often accused of nihilism, on the grounds, discussed below, that he was said to have abandoned any attempt to undertake systematic economic theory. This line of criticism is, it will be argued, misplaced. While the arguments advanced by Lavoie and his supporters take us some of the way towards a rebuttal of the charge of nihilism, it will be shown that paying closer attention to the ontological issues raised by Lachmann’s work can provide additional clarification of the precise nature of his theoretical contribution, thereby further strengthening the case in his favour. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly outlines Lachmann’s work, before describing how Lavoie and his co-authors attempted to use philosophical hermeneutics to defend Lachmann against his critics. Section 3 draws on the literature on social ontology to highlight and outline a number of key concepts—most notably, the notions of ‘emergence’, ‘emergent properties’, ‘tendencies’ and ‘causal mechanisms’—that can be, and in Section 4, are used to bring out more clearly the precise nature of Lachmann’s theoretical contribution to Austrian economics, thereby bolstering Lavoie’s defence of Lachmann. Section 5 brings the threads of the preceding argument together and draws conclusions.",16
24.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,22 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-011-0145-5,Dr. Anderson and the Austrians: Price formation as a cumulative process,June 2011,Jack High,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Don Lavoie’s published work was mainly theoretical. He was concerned with the market as a system of interpretation and communication, and with the kind of science most conducive to studying complex social orders. However, the work of Lavoie’s doctoral students was both theoretical and historical. They not only advanced economic theory, but also used it to elucidate historical episodes, such as worker self-management in Minnesota, the failure of the Soviet economic system, free banking in the USA, female entrepreneurs in Ghana, and privatization in Poland. There are no doubt many reasons for this shift in research focus, but one reason was the emphasis on empirical work that resulted from Lavoie’s work in hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is a philosophy of interpretation, and the main task of economics, as Lavoie saw it, was to interpret the actions of consumers, producers, and entrepreneurs. A vital part of this research agenda was to study these agents up-close, to pay more “scholarly attention… to the life world, the everyday meanings” of agents in the market. Studying the life world and everyday meanings of past events is the traditional domain of historical research. In an effort to exploit the common ground between hermeneutics and history, Don Lavoie and his students launched an “Austrian Empirical Workshop” at George Mason University in 1986. This workshop, taught for many years by Clayton Coppin, trained economists in historical research methods, which were often used by Lavoie’s students in their doctoral dissertations.Footnote 1
 As a member of the early empirical workshops at George Mason, I became convinced that economic theory benefited from historical research; using economic theory to interpret history keeps theory anchored to human events and leads to new theoretical insight. I also came to suspect that Mises’ regression theorem, in which today’s money prices are necessarily linked to those of the past, had an importance beyond enabling economists to apply marginal utility theory to money. This essay confirms that suspicion; it argues that the modern price system is a carrier of history, to use Paul David’s apt phrase. Unless we recognize that today’s prices are the result of agents’ interpretations of the recent past, we have no realistic theory of price formation (David 1994). This was a subject of some debate in economics, thanks to the work of B. M. Anderson, Jr. (1886–1949). Anderson was one of the economic profession’s foremost critics of marginal utility theory and one of its ablest proponents of social value. As a critic, Anderson directed most of his attention towards Austrian economists, especially Wieser, Boehm-Bawerk, Mises, and Schumpeter. As a proponent of social value theory, Anderson built mostly on the work of American economists, especially J.B. Clark, E.R.A. Seligman, and David Kinley. Anderson did his graduate work at Illinois and Columbia, where he studied under these economists. His doctoral dissertation, which was published in 1911 under the title Social Value, was supervised by Seligman. Anderson also relied heavily on the work of sociologists, especially Andre Tarde and Charles H. Cooley, in constructing his theory of social value.Footnote 2
 In what follows, I consider Anderson’s criticisms of price theory and his theory of social value. (I do not consider his monetary theory or his views on New Deal policy, which had much in common with the Austrians.) Anderson’s criticisms of price theory were detailed and often trenchant, and his exposition of social value attempted to broaden the foundations of economics, so that economic value is a species of general human value. In response to Anderson, I will argue that he identified a difficulty with price theory that is even today not sufficiently recognized. Addressing Anderson’s criticisms requires us to recognize the historical development of prices and institutions in our theory. In short, I argue, economic theory requires an historical element, an element that is fully embraced by Lavoie’s interpretive economics. In criticizing Austrian utility theory, Anderson was not trying to replace the modern theory of price with something fundamentally different. Although his criticisms are sometimes similar to those of Thorstein Veblen, Anderson, unlike Veblen, was trying to provide a surer and more logically consistent foundation for price theory. He considered marginal utility unequal to the task of building a foundation for prices, but he thought that price theory itself was sound. “As a theory of value, as a theory to explain the nature and origin of value,” he wrote (Anderson 1966 [1911], 188), “I am convinced that the Austrian theory is utterly and hopelessly inadequate. And yet, for the work of the Austrian economists, taken by and large, I have the highest admiration… their detailed work in the price analysis, despite the utterly inadequate basis which the utility theory of value affords for it, has been marvelously accurate, sound, and useful.” Anderson criticized Austrian utility theory for containing a vicious circle. True, Anderson (1966 [1911], 46) says, Austrian theory avoids the English school’s circular definition of value, “which made the value of A equal to what it would exhange for, B, the value of B being in turn equal to what it would exchange for, namely, A. Wieser clearly recognizes that “the value of a good must be treated as an absolute thing, independent of the particular exchange that happens to be made.” Furthermore, for an isolated individual, or for a communistic society, Wieser’s explanation of value involves no circular logic. “But when the Austrians come to the explanation of value as it exists in society as actually organized, the attempt to explain value in terms of individual desires for economic goods fails, and a circle again emerges: Why has the good A value? Because men desire it? No, that is not enough; the men who desire it must have other economic goods, i.e., wealth, with which to buy it. And why will these other goods buy it. Because they have value!” (Anderson 1966 [1911], 46–7; italics in original.)Footnote 3
 Anderson also criticized Austrian monetary theory for exhibiting the same vicious circle, to wit: The marginal utility of money depends on what a unit of money will purchase, which depends on prices, which depend on the marginal utility of money. “This circle,” Anderson writes (1917, 89–90), “present in every form of the Austrian theory which seeks a causal explanation of value and prices by means of marginal utility, though often less obviously present, is here quite glaring.” Anderson analyzed Schumpeter’s and Mises’ attempts to avoid the logical circle for the value of money. Anderson acknowledges that Schumpeter’s treatment of money and prices avoids the circle. By basing his theory on Walras’ general equilibrium, in which all prices in all markets are determined simultaneously, Schumpeter is able to derive exchange ratios without falling into the circle of Wieser and Boehm-Bawerk. However, because Schumpeter’s theory is one of a general equilibrium, Anderson notes, (Anderson 1917, 93) it is “quite impossible to apply the doctrine to any functional theory of the value of money, or to bring money in any realistic way into the scheme.” Here, Anderson recognizes what general equilibrium theorists later made explicit. Debreu, in his pioneering Theory of Value, writes (Debreu 1959, 28), “No theory of money is offered here, and it is assumed that the economy works without the help of a good serving as a medium of exchange.”Footnote 4 So, Schumpeter has avoided a logical circle for the values of money and prices, but at the expense of any relevance for monetary prices or calculation. Anderson also criticizes Mises’ method for avoiding the logical circle. Mises employed a temporal regress; i.e., the idea that the marginal utility of money today rests upon the exchange value of money yesterday, and the marginal utility of money yesterday depends on the value of money the day before, etc. Anderson (1917, 101) acknowledges that this avoids the circle and “opens the way to a theory of money based on marginal utility.” Nevertheless, he rejects Mises solution for two reasons (Anderson 1917, 104): “[I]t is illogical to mix a logical analysis with a temporal regressus. But, more fundamental than this logic point, is this: the forces which have historically begot a social situation are not necessarily the forces which sustain it.” Interestingly, Anderson had himself considered, and rejected, temporal regress as a means of avoiding the value circle in Social Value, which appeared a year before Mises’ Theory of Money and Credit. Anderson also criticized the individualism on which marginal utility theory is based. Methodological individualism, he thought, led to the vicious circle in the theory of value. Austrian analysis, he wrote (Anderson 1966 [1911], 45), “makes two abstractions, neither of which is allowable: first, it abstracts the ‘individual mind’ from its vital and organic union with the social milieu; and second, it abstracts from the ‘individual mind’ thus abstracted, only those desires and thought which are immediately concerned with the consumption and production of economic goods…” David Hume and Adam Smith introduced abstract individualism into economics. In their world, wrote Anderson (1966 [1911], 65), “The individual is all-important; his world of thought and feeling is shut off from that of every other man; social relationships are largely mechanical, and grow out of calculating self-interest on the part of the individual; social laws are conceived after the analogy of physical laws.” Philosophy and sociology had outgrown isolated individualism and so, too, thought Anderson, should economics. From his criticisms of marginal utility theory, the goals of Anderson’s theory of value are readily apparent. He wanted to construct a causal theory of economic value that incorporated the social interdependence of individual valuations, and thus integrate economic value with ethical, religious, legal, and aesthetic values. He was not concerned with logical consistency alone, but with a general theory of value applicable to all its social manifestations and able to provide a foundation for the modern theory of price. Anderson’s theory of social value consists of several propositions. Firstly, value is a quality of an object. The object need not be physical; a utopian social system or the kingdom of heaven count as objects. Secondly, this quality, like weight or other qualities of objects, is quantitative. Anderson explicitly argued that value is measurable in the same way that weight and distance are measurable. “… the real terms of our ratios are so many units of abstract weight, or of abstract value, as the case may be.” When a good is divisible, the value of successive units will diminish; that is, Anderson fully accepted the law of diminishing utility in its cardinally measurable form.Footnote 5 Thirdly, the importance of value in society is that it influences behavior. These propositions lead to Anderson’s definition of value (Anderson 1966 [1911], 106) as “a quantity of motivating force, power over the actions of a man, embodied in an object.” This definition covers not just economic, but also ethical, aesthetic, and legal values. For each individual, economic value influences, and is influenced by, other values; economic value is not a watertight compartment that operates independently of a person’s ethical, political, and aesthetic values. Fourth, values are created socially. Anderson (1966 [1911], 115) expresses it thus: “…every individual mind is part of a larger whole; everything in the individual mind has been influenced by processes in the minds of others; every process in the individual mind influences, directly or indirectly, processes in the minds of others. There is a social mind.” In this social whole, some persons are more influential than others. A wealthy person has more influence over economic values than a poor one; elites influence the aesthetic values of the masses. Value is jointly determined by the number of people who desire an object, by the intensity of the desire, and by the social weight of those who hold the value. Anderson also emphasized that value was prior to exchange and in fact existed independently of exchange. Many objects have value even though they are not part of the exchange nexus. This is obviously true of non-economic values, such as truth and beauty, but it is even true for many economic values—he uses the example of the US Capitol building, which is not exchanged but nevertheless has economic value. The priority of value over exchange enabled Anderson to explain price by means of value. Prices are the ratios of two values, the value of the money and the value of the good. A change in the value of one (the value of the other remaining constant) will cause a change in the price of the good. He says (Anderson 1915, 699) “The theory of value is essentially a theory of causation.” This, in brief compass, is Anderson’s theory of value. Dorfman (1949, 420) notes that Anderson’s theory was a “powerful force in broadening the realm of economic inquiry.” Anderson integrated his theory with John Dewey’s pragmatic philosophy and the sociology of Charles Horton Cooley and others. A chief merit of Anderson’s theory is that it connected economics to the social sciences (sociology, in particular) and the humanities (philosophy and law). Anderson was by no means unique among economists in his efforts to integrate economics with the other social sciences. Many economists in America and Europe took a broad view of economics; we need only mention a few of Anderson’s contemporaries—J. B. Clark (1893), John Commons (1934), Edwin Seligman (1904), Thorstein Veblen (1904), and Ludwig von Mises (1922)—to see how widespread this viewpoint was among economists. And it was shared by philosophers and sociologists, who took a keen interest in economics—Croce (1913), Perry (1916), Giddings (1896), Weber (1923), and Cooley (1918), are examples.Footnote 6 An economics integrated with other social sciences and the humanities was overwhelmed by the wave of mechanics that swept through the profession in later years, but it was never entirely lost. Marxism (which never accepted the modern theory of value) and Institutionalism embedded economics within broader social theory, as did the work of prominent Austrian economists such as Schumpeter (1942), Mises (1949)), Hayek (1960), Rothbard (1960) and Kirzner (1960). Lavoie’s contributions to the socialist calculation debate, and to hermeneutical economics, fall squarely within this tradition of economics as a humane discipline.Footnote 7
 Although there was strong approval for the social aspects of Anderson’s value theory (Ellwood 1913, 585–86); Cooley 1918, 297–98), it also drew criticism. The idea that society is a super organism with a mind of its own was condemned. The criticism prompted Anderson to explicitly reject the notion. All he meant by the term “social mind” is that values are formed “inter-mentally”—intersubjectively, as we would say today. Anderson’s rejection of individualism was also criticized. Perry (1916, 470) wrote of Austrian economics “But the essential contention of that school remains, so far as I can see, unaltered; in that these changes work through individuals and have their point of application in a more or less rational comparison of needs made by the individual seller or buyer.” Schumpeter (1909, 215) (who was criticizing Clark and Seligman rather than Anderson) also emphasized, that “Society as such, having no brain or nerves in a physical sense, cannot feel wants and has not, therefore, utility curves like those of individuals.” Individual valuations, not aggregated social value scales, determine prices.Footnote 8
 Anderson was also criticized for setting up a false circle. After a detailed consideration of Austrian value theory and Anderson’s criticisms, Perry (1916, 475) concluded that “The whole process is, therefore, circular. What a man will offer or take for any commodity depends not merely on how badly he needs it, but on what he thinks it to be ‘worth.’ But altho this is circular, it is not vicious because it has a beginning and a direction.” Alvin Johnson thought that Anderson’s criticism ignored the fact that present prices are dependent on the past. He wrote (1912, 322), “the [circular] criticism does not appear to be valid. Given the existing constitution of things, the value of a thing newly created can be explained only with reference to values antecedently existing. The value of a newly found diamond will depend in large part upon the existing distribution of wealth. This means that present values are parts of a structure reaching far into the past. But is not this the truth?” Both Perry and Johnson explicitly recognize that value theory contains an historical element. Anderson’s theory of social value may also be criticized because it requires that social value be cardinally measurable. What makes all values commensurable in Anderson’s theory is the quantum of motivating force embodied in them. This point of view enabled Anderson to express prices as a ratio between the value of money and the value of a good, but he was unable to furnish a ratio between, say, the beauty of a sunset and the birth of a child, or between the establishment of a socialist state and the establishment of a protestant religion. All of these events express values in the sense that humans act to achieve them, i.e., they have a motivating force, but there is no yardstick by which to measure them. Without this quantum measure, Anderson’s theory loses much of its cogency. Without such a measure, we cannot even express price as a ratio between the value of money and the value of a good much less extend it to wider social values. The historical component in money prices is familiar to all economists who have studied Mises’ Theory of Money and Credit (Mises 1953 [1912], 97–124). The marginal utility of money, Mises argued, depends on the price level and the price level depends on the willingness of traders to hold money, i.e., on its marginal utility. Mises (1953 [1912]), 108–110) realized that this logical circle was practically solved by consumers and producers basing their present valuation of money on its exchange value of the recent past. If we accept Mises’ insight as fairly representing how the value of money is established, it implies that there is an historical element that pervades the market system, in the form of money prices. This kind of calculation, where future prices are anticipated using past prices, applies not only to cash balances, but to all production and exchange decisions where money is involved. Within firms, for example, capital budgeting requires estimates of expenses and revenues over time. These estimates rely on an existing price structure. This is obviously true of existing goods, such as automobiles and shoes and baby food; corporate executives estimate revenues and expenses based upon the existing prices for the products and for the factors of production that go into their making, with due allowance for anticipated changes. It is also true of innovate products. When DuPont introduced a spate of new materials following World War II, they used the prices of existing products as a reference values to determine the prices of their new products. (See Nagle and Holden 1995, 107–14). Every innovation does this even if not as consciously as DuPont. Air travel, when new, took account of rail service; word processing equipment used the prices of existing typewriters in arriving at its prices. If entrepreneurs were not aware of the existing monetary value of calculators or typewriters, they would be unable to tell if innovations might be profitable; in fact, it would hardly occur to them to innovate in these areas. Wherever money prices are used, there is “a historically continuous component included in them,” as Mises 1953 [1912], 112) observed. As another example of the historical element in economic theory, consider the usual method of deriving demand curves for consumers’ goods. We build the market demand curves from individual curves, and we build the individual curves by having everyone maximize utility subject to a monetary budget constraint. But his budget constraint depends on the prices of the factors of production, which depend on the demand curves for consumers’ goods. This is a clear case of Anderson’s vicious circle. This problem is solved practically in markets because an existing income distribution enables consumers to formulate their demands for consumers’ goods and an existing pattern of prices enables producers to estimate future prices. If tomorrow’s prices for consumers goods depends on today’s income distribution, then today’s prices for consumers’ goods depend on yesterday’s distribution of income, etc. This is Alvin Johnson’s point in saying that “present values are parts of a structure reaching far into the past.” Because the effects of monetary calculation are so pervasive, the historical element in economic theory extends beyond prices to include institutions. Monetary calculation emerges from the prior development of specialized production, exchange, and money. But once monetary calculation has emerged, it encourages further specialization, further changes in economic organization (in the form of joint stock companies, for example), further developments in money (from specie to bills of exchange to demand deposits), which leads to further advances in monetary calculation, such as accounting for fixed costs and computing dividends for shareholders. The market consists of a co-evolution of money, money prices, monetary calculation, and other economic institutions. Which is to say that prices depend not only on marginal valuations and income distributions, but on organizations and practices that have grown out of past prices and practices. We can explain present prices only by recognizing that they emerge from a pre-existing set of prices and institutions by way of monetary calculation. The necessity of basing economic theory on historical change does not simply mean that the modern economy is the result of historical evolution. Of course it is and no economist would deny it. It means that we cannot explain the most visible and elemental feature of the economy, money prices, without explicitly recognizing that today’s prices depend on yesterday’s prices and practices. Nor does it mean that economists must abandon equilibrium theory. The market order is so complex that, to understand it, we necessarily focus on some parts of it, while ignoring the rest. Typically, equilibrium theory takes for granted the institutions (including money) that make coordination possible, and explains how simple rules of price adjustment lead to market clearing, or how the incidence of tax is distributed, etc., or, in general equilibrium theory, we make special assumptions about functional forms and economic knowledge to prove that an overall equilibrium can exist. These exercises teach us something about the economy: the economic self-interest of buyers and sellers tends to clear markets; profits result from change and complexity; the use of money is inconsistent with general equilibrium. But equilibrium theory misleads us if we take it to be the main corpus of economics. Equilibrium ignores, or is inconsistent with, the practices that enable the economy to function and develop. Only by studying how consumers, entrepreneurs, managers, and workers formulate and execute their plans can we hope to understand markets. The existing distribution of income, prices, business firms, organized exchanges, and channels of information are indispensable to this process. Austrian economists have incorporated the historical element in their price theory from the beginning. The founder of the school, Carl Menger (1976), begins his study with scarcity, marginal valuation, and property under primitive economic conditions. He then explains the advantages to direct exchange, and how, once direct exchange becomes prevalent, indirect exchange and money emerge to ameliorate the difficulties created by direct exchange. Money prices arise concomitantly with the emergence of money and permit profit and loss calculations. This basic theoretical structure implicitly recognizes that price formation is a cumulative process and has been followed, with greater sophistication, in the treatises of Wieser (1967 [1927]), Mises (1949) and Rothbard (1960).Footnote 9 There is no circle in this explanation of market prices, because they are derived from an historical process. Lavoie’s work in the socialist calculation debate and in hermeneutical economics explicitly recognizes the historical element in economic theory. Lavoie’s striking contribution to the socialism debate was to explain that Marx and Mises were discussing a capitalist system based on the inseparable institutions of private property, a complex division of labor, exchange, and money prices. They most emphatically were not discussing models of equilibrium, as later participants in the debate claimed. Casting the debate in the a-historical terms of Walrasian equilibrium theory, argued Lavoie, badly distorted the arguments of Marx and Mises. Market socialists adopted the muddled view that pre-Marxian socialists held, viz., that socialism could pick and choose the market institutions it liked and discard the rest. This muddled view ignores the co-evolution of institutions and prices.Footnote 10
 Hermeneutics does more than recognize the historical element in economic theory; it provides an explanation for it. Interpretation is part and parcel of the historical element in economic theory. In a noteworthy contribution to economic theory, Richard Ebeling (1990, 189) explains the interpretive dimension of price. A price is not just a quantitative ratio of two values, as Anderson would have it; rather prices are “historical artefacts” (the terms of trade of past acts of exchange) that “serve as indicators of future possibilities towards which present actions are to be oriented.” What makes it possible to interpret prices are the institutions, and the specialized structure of knowledge, that grow up alongside market prices. To most of us, an increase in India’s hot rolled steel index, from 6,954 to 6,995 during the week of August 14 to August 21, 2009, means next to nothing. But to Lehigh Specialty Melting, Inc. in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and to the company’s competitors, customers, and suppliers, the movement of hot rolled steel prices means something. They judge the significance of the price index for their future actions. Specialized producers know, or at least can make informed judgments about, how to interpret these price movements and how to adjust their activities, including how much to produce, how much they will ask for their products, and how much they will pay for workers, capital goods, and credit. As Ebeling (1990, 189) puts it “The producer’s informal and tacit generalizations of his accumulated experiences, knowledge and feelings about his corner of the market and those in it are his “ideal typifications.” They are what enable him to use the prices of the market for purposes of interpretation.” The use that Ebeling makes of ideal types, not as tools for the sociologist, but as tools for the interpretation of price by market participants, exemplifies economic theory as a cumulative process.Footnote 11
 Lavoie argued that economics is a doubly hermeneutic science. The economist studies the interpretations of market conditions made by businessmen. But she does not take these interpretations as oracular. She discusses their correctness or incorrectness, looks for their effects beyond the confines of the firm, and passes judgment on the interpretations and the results. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and Andy Grove studied market conditions with the hope of making a buck; their interpretations ushered in a revolution. Charles Keating, Kenneth Lay, and Michael Perry (IndyMac’s CEO in 2008) also interpreted market conditions and brought about the spectacular failures of their firms. Keating and Perry also contributed to massive financial collapses. These are examples of interpretation in the market economy; entrepreneurs appraise market conditions of the recent past and formulate plans and practices for the future. Sometimes they get it right; sometimes they do not. The study of the market order requires that attention be paid to this interpretation, which creates an unfolding sequence of money prices. Studying the market as a system of simultaneous equations misses the action. Mirowski’s emphases on “abduction,” a philosophical term from Pierce, and institutions also elucidates the historical element in economic theory. (Of course, no one has to convince Institutionalists that there is an historical element in theory; the idea has been woven into the fabric of Institutionalism since Veblen.) Abduction, according to Pierce, “is the process of forming an explanatory hypothesis. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea….” (Quoted in Mirowski 1990, 88) Pierce used abduction to account for progress in science, but it is also the method that merchants and manufacturers use to coordinate and innovate, as Lachmann has taught us. Just as scientists form hypotheses based on existing knowledge and data, so do businesses. A businessman formulates a plan (hypothesis) based on his interpretation of the existing situation. Executing that plan then confirms or denies the hypothesis, which alters the existing knowledge and data in his corner of the market. This is what makes markets cumulative processes. Institutions are crucial to this process, because, as Mirowski (1990, 108) explains, they “… provide the actors who participate in them with the means and resources to cope with change and diversity….” Economists from Commons to North have emphasized that institutions act as constraints on individual behavior, which they do, but they also enable us, as members of a ridiculously complex social order, to coordinate and innovate. If we accept that institutions develop to help us solve problems and exploit opportunities, we at once see the importance of explaining the emergence of institutions, a decidedly historical orientation of economic theory.Footnote 12
 We have taken Anderson’s Social Value as a point of departure to discuss price theory. Anderson demonstrated that the modern theory of price contains a vicious circle: The prices of consumers’ goods presupposes a distribution of income, but the distribution of income presupposes the prices of consumers goods. We normally avoid this circle by solving for the prices of consumers goods and producers goods simultaneously, but as Anderson pointed out, and as modern general equilibrium theory makes clear, this is not a method for explaining monetary prices; general equilibrium theory contains no money. Anderson sought a solution for this logical circle by positing social value, a quantum of motivating force possessed by all valuable objects. His theory possesses the virtue of integrating economic with legal, moral, and aesthetic values. But without a measure of value, his theory is untenable; it cannot explain prices, let alone ethical values. Mises clearly recognized the vicious circle in monetary theory and resolved it by means of a temporal regression. He understood that the money prices of the recent past provide a basis on which to estimate their future values, and thus the marginal utility of money. This same kind of mental process pervades market activity and is essential to explaining the emergence and operation of markets. In using the recent past to judge the future, we rely not only existing money prices but also existing institutions—property relations, division of labor, accounting methods, organized exchanges, business firms, and many other common practices. All of these institutions have been influenced by the emergence of money prices, and the institutions in turn influence prices. This co-evolution of money prices and institutions is the result of market participants formulating and executing economic plans based on their interpretations of the immediate past. This is what I have called the historical element in economic theory and it is why price formation is a cumulative process. What lies behind the co-evolution of money prices and market institutions, resulting in the price system, are numerous acts of interpretation by market agents. Lavoie’s interpretative economics is in large part the study of the historical element in economic theory. Consider Anderson’s objections to Mises’ use of historical regression. Anderson argued that “it is illogical to mix a logical analysis with a temporal regressus.” Lavoie (2011), however, pointed out that theory must “interpret intelligibly, that is, it must tell a plausible story about how the results explain some otherwise problematic aspect of reality.” A task of price theory is to explain how society evolved from barter to money prices. This occurs because agents gradually figure out that they can reduce scarcity by specializing, exchanging, and employing exchange media, which eventually develop into money and money prices, which in their turn stimulate further specialization and exchange. A temporal regress is simply looking back from today at a temporal progress set in motion by agents considering their economic situation and figuring out how to improve it. Explaining this process is not illogical; it is an essential task of interpretive theory. Anderson also objected that “the forces which have historically begot a social situation are not necessarily the forces which sustain it.” Again, there is nothing in interpretive theory that requires that the origins and continuation of a practice have the same motivations. An Italian merchant may have begun using profit and loss accounting only because his senior partners required it of him. However, once he learned of its advantages, he insisted on it himself in future partnerships; the motives change but the practice continues. The motives for using profit and loss accounting by corporations issuing shares in America of the nineteenth century are different than the motives of close partnerships fourteenth century Italy, yet the value of accounting remains. This is all perfectly consistent with, and in fact illuminated by, interpretive social theory. A consideration of Anderson’s objections to methodological individualism also reveals the extent to which Lavoie’s interpretive economics takes the historical element in economics seriously. Anderson (1966), 45) praised Austrian analysis for locating value in the human mind, but complained that “it takes only a small part of the human mind for that explanation.” He objected to methodological individualism and his social value is an attempt to situate economic value within the larger orbit of human values, including ethics and aesthetics. Lavoie expressed a similar concern about the Crusoe orientation in economic theory, but his solution was rather different. Lavoie (1991, 46–51) objected to taking the isolated individual as the basic unit for studying human action, and then adding markets as a special case. “The peculiarly cultureless ‘agent’ of Crusoe economics,” wrote Lavoie (1991, 49) “is an odd construction to use as a basis for human action in general. Choice theory is constructed as if it does not matter whether the mind operates with a social language or not. The Crusoes of economics, unlike the character from Defoe’s novel, need know nothing of language. They simply apply means to ends.” Lavoie objected that all individuals conceive of means and ends only through language, which is the primary means of cultural transmission. A cultureless Crusoe ignores, in Mises’ words, the “immense significance language has for thinking…for social relations, and for all activities of life.”Footnote 13 Rather than study markets as an extension of Crusoe economics, Lavoie recommended that we start with pre-market social interaction. “What existed historically before the emergence of markets,” Lavoie (1991, 51) wrote, “was not Robinson Crusoe but processes of cultural evolution in which interacting human beings participated.” Approaching economics this way “makes change intelligible as something that grows out of history; yet, it permits radical, nonmechanistic change.” Two points from these passages are worthy of emphasis. Firstly, embedding market processes in larger cultural processes links economic values to other social values—ethics, the law, aesthetics—a link that Anderson was trying to achieve with his social value. Secondly, it would be hard to find an approach to economics that embraces the historical element in economic theory more fully than Lavoie’s interpretive approach. The historical element is part and parcel of interpretive economics.",2
24.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,07 January 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-010-0138-9,Distinction or dichotomy: Rethinking the line between thymology and praxeology,June 2011,Don Lavoie,Virgil Henry Storr,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Ours is a method of analysis preoccupied with meaning. Man acts, he applies definite means to achieve definite ends, and it is our task qua praxeologists to render that action intelligible. This task, of grasping action intellectually, requires that we pay particular attention to human plans and purposes, as what distinguishes one action from another, what distinguishes tears of joy from tears of pain, a smile from a smirk, theft from exchange, is merely how acting individuals come to view and interpret them. An analytical focus on the ‘meanings’ that purposeful individuals attach to their actions and on the ‘web of meanings’ (Mises 1966: 26) that breathe life into social institutions must, therefore, be at the center of any attempt to study human endeavors. What Ludwig Mises was arguing for was an interpretive social science along the lines of Max Weber’s sociology. Both Weber and Mises saw explaining (erklären) and understanding (verstehen) purposeful action as the human sciences’ chief functions. As such, we must be particularly attuned to both the meaning context and content of human action. And, our methodological procedures as social scientists, if we are to get at meaning, should be refinements of the tools we use in our daily efforts (as human actorss) to understand and interact with each other. Just as understanding the overall meaning of a sentence requires that we pay attention to the individual words that comprise it, for Mises, understanding the meaning of social wholes, for example, the meaning of social institutions, requires that we pay attention to individual plans and purposes that constitute those institutions.Footnote 1
 Similarly, we should remember that words derive their meanings in part from their location in a particular sentence (it matters whether they are subject or object) and in part from the sentence’s overall sentiment (it matters whether the author is being sarcastic or serious). In order to understand the meaning of particular human actions, we must, likewise, focus on the ‘web of meanings’ in which the actor is embedded (the meaning context of action). We are forced to engage in what Mises in his earlier writings (Epistemological Problems and Human Action) called psychology and what in his later efforts (Theory and History and The Ultimate Foundations) he referred to as thymology.Footnote 2 Apparently, Mises felt compelled to employ an unusual term because the more straightforward word he would have used, psychology, had been taken over by experimental psychology, which involves the application of the methods of the natural sciences to the study of human behavior. The more literary kind of psychology Mises had in mind deployed methods that are “radically different” ([1962] 1978: 47) from the methods of the natural sciences. As Mises ([1962] 1978: 47) put it: The primary and central problem of “literary psychology” is meaning, something that is beyond the pale of any natural science and laboratory activities. While experimental psychology is a branch of the natural sciences, “literary psychology” deals with human action, viz., with the ideas, judgments of value, and volitions that determine action. Thymology, for Mises, is a “branch of history” and it “deals with the mental activities of men that determine their actions ([1962] 1978: 47–48). Mises directs us specifically to the verstehen school and contends that verstehen or understanding is a “thymological category.” It is “what everybody learns from intercourse with his fellows” (Mises [1957] 1969: 266). It is an awareness of the cultural factors that influence and affect a man’s behavior and the “matrix of ongoing social relations” in which his actions are implanted. It is “what a man knows about the way in which people value different conditions, about their wishes and desires and their plans to realize these wishes and desires.” As Mises ([1949] 1966: 26) argued, “we cannot approach our subject if we disregard the meaning which acting man attaches to [his] situation, i.e. the given state of affairs and his own behavior with regard to this situation.” And, we cannot get at the meanings acting man attaches to his actions and his environment if we do not consider the thymological factors influencing his behavior. Unfortunately, in our view, Mises’ own explicit methodological position failed to deal adequately with the consequences of a theoretical focus on meaning, a science of human action with the requisite components of both erklären and verstehen. This is, to a significant degree, Mises’ own fault. Although many of his pronouncements on the meaning of praxeology stress verstehen and its implications for our methodological practices, others take a more Euclidean tone, stressing the universality and apodictic certainty of praxeological precepts. In particular, he transforms a legitimate distinction between theoretical and historical questions into a rigid dichotomy between them. At times, Mises seems to be arguing that there is a strict dichotomy between theory and history, that while history deals with the particular and the concrete (it is context-specific), praxeology (theory) is universal, is applicable “irrespective of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of concrete acts” (Mises [1949] 1966: 32). And, that since theory is both “logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts,” history cannot be utilized to either falsify or verify theory. History, he seems to be arguing, can never inform theory. Did Mises really need to draw an indelible line between conception and understanding in this way? Rather than isolating these two cognitive processes completely from each other, he intended them as “two inescapable aspects of what is ultimately one integrated intellectual endeavor” (Lavoie 1986a: 194). The forcefulness of Mises’ claims regarding the distinction between theory and history, his exclusion of thymological concerns from the study of praxeology, and his insinuation that history can never inform theory, we contend, all come from his sense that economics itself was under attack from several distinct sides. Mises’ methodological views need to be appreciated in the context of the intellectual environment of his day and the positions that he was arguing against. While Mises was penning the Epistemological Problems of Economics ([1933] 1981), Human Action ([1949] 1966) and Theory and History ([1957] 1969), the historicists, positivists and various kinds of polylogists were articulating radically alternative approaches to praxeology that rejected, for different reasons, the teachings of economics. Mises, thus, saw himself as the champion of an economics under attack. The enemies of economics have changed, however, so that the chief danger economics faces is no longer that it may disappear into undifferentiated psychological or historical studies where none of its distinctively economic contributions can be preserved. The danger today is an excessive concern for purification, though not the type Mises had in mind. As Boettke (1996) notes, “the philosophical debates of the 1920s and 1930s that so influenced Mises and Hayek in their methodological pronouncements have progressed.” It is our view that the relationship between theory and history and, particularly, the positioning of thymology strictly on the history side of the theory-history divide needs to be revisited and revised. As Boettke (1996) argues, “[the] progression in the argument for a non-positivistic and non-mechanistic social science must be incorporated.” We therefore begin the next section with a review of the intellectual positions that Mises was writing against.Footnote 3 After contextualizing Mises’s methodological arguments in section 3 and 4 challenge the dichotomization of theory and history. We argue that regardless of Mises’ pronouncements to the contrary, a “pure” praxeology, insulated from thymological considerations, is neither desirable nor sustainable. The final section attempts to outline what a thymologically enriched praxeology would look like.",9
24.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,30 March 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-010-0134-0,The role of trust in the 2008 financial crisis,September 2011,Luigi Zingales,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“Virtually every commercial transaction—wrote Kenneth Arrow—several decades ago—has within itself an element of trust”. And if this statement was true then, it is even more true today, when the complexity of transactions is such that no human being can make all daily decisions with the proper degree of information. When we deposit our money in a bank, buy a stock through a broker, purchase a good over the internet or refinance our mortgage, most of us do not read or understand all the intricate details of the contracts we are signing. In bridging the gap between our knowledge and the knowledge that would be required to make the decision in a fully informed way, we use trust. Trust in our counterparties or more broadly trust in the system as a whole. We trust banks to return our deposits, we trust the broker not to abscond with the money, we trust the company we order goods from over the internet to deliver them in “good faith”, and we trust the encryption system of the internet not to leak our credit card information. Trust facilitates transactions because it saves the costs of monitoring and screening; it is an essential lubricant that greases the wheels of the economic system. When millions of dollars are on the line, simple trust is insufficient. Lawyers are paid to review all the possible contingencies and sophisticated contracts are put in place to protect the contracting parties, but in millions of everyday transactions, there is neither time nor resources for any serious due diligence. If there is trust, the transaction takes place; if there is not, it is forgone. Millions of small profitable transactions forgone, however, translate into billions of dollars of welfare loss and opportunities forgone. Trust is of two types. There is the personal trust created through long repeated interaction, typically developed between partners, friends, or close business associates. It is what created the glue of the early mercantile societies, as aptly described by Avner Grief (1994) in his work. But this trust is both a positive and negative. It benefits tremendously the members of the group who has built it, but it might hurt others, who are often excluded and even discriminated against. While it is very beneficial in early development, it might be a hindrance to further economic development, which requires communication and exchange across remote individuals and groups. For modern economies, what is more important is generalized trust. This is the trust people have in a random member of a group or of a society, somebody they do not know and do not necessarily expect to encounter again in their life. This is the trust that allows markets to develop, trade to prosper, advanced civilization to progress. This is the type of trust that seems to be captured by the World Value Survey question: “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with?”. This generalized trust is an essential element for a developed economy to work. In fact, much of economic backwardness—as Arrow (1972) said—is due to lack of trust. But while there is a lot of discussion about trust as a factor driving growth (see, for example, Knack and Keefer 1996), there has been no attention to the role trust (or lack of thereof) might have in major financial crises. The risk in trying to attribute business cycle fluctuations to trust is that we mix the cause with the effect. During a business cycle, investors’ and consumers’ confidence fluctuate for good, objective reasons. After the bursting of the internet bubble in 2000, investors were legitimately concerned about the profitability of further investments in technology. However, attributing the 2000–2001 recession to a drop in trust would be inverting the effect with the cause. Nevertheless, the dramatic drop in gross domestic product (GDP) that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers cannot easily be explained as just a shock to the profitability of certain investments. As president Obama said in his inaugural speech, “our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.” So why did GDP drop by 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and another 5% in the first quarter of 2009? To find a role for trust in the 2008 financial crisis, we first need to find a role for trust in a standard economic model which differs from simply the rational expectation of the equilibrium outcome. We then need to argue (and possibly show) that trust dropped dramatically in the Fall of 2008 and then trace some of the effects of this drop in trust to the financial system. In this paper, I will try to follow these steps. First, I will argue that trust plays a role in affecting people’s priors. These priors are particularly important when we face an unexpected or out of the ordinary event. My prior is not so important when I buy my daily coffee in my usual coffee shop, but it is relevant when I enter a new shop, entertain doing business with a stranger, or start fearing that we are in a new and unprecedented situation, as the 2008 crisis was presented. Then, thanks to the Chicago Booth/Kellogg School Financial Trust Index, I will be able to show that trust in our key financial institutions dropped significantly in the Fall of 2008. The major cause of this drop is the type of government intervention during the crisis. Around 80% of respondents felt less confident about investing in financial markets as a result of the type of government intervention in the last 3 months of 2008. The second cause is the perception of fraud: 15% of the people felt they had been cheated or mislead by their bank/financial advisor in the previous 3 months. Finally, it was the anger provoked by the events: 38% of the respondents felt very angry at the (then) current economic situation. In conclusion, I will show how this drop in trust affected everyday decisions. I will show how it affects the probability of a run on your own bank, the probability of investing in the stock market, even the demand to massively regulate the business, which in turn will affect the business confidence to operate.",10
24.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,03 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-010-0130-4,An experimental study of blind proficiency tests in forensic science,September 2011,Everard James Cowan,Roger Koppl,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"We conducted sender–receiver experiments with human subjects to test the utility of blind proficiency tests as a method of reducing errors in forensic science. A proficiency test measures the proficiency of the person or group being tested. In the context of forensic science, a proficiency test gives an examiner one or more evidence samples whose true properties are known to the tester, but not the examiner. The tester measures the examiner’s proficiency by comparing the examiner’s analysis of the sample to the truth. A proficiency test is blind when the examiner does not know he or she is being tested but imagines the sample to have arisen from casework. A blind proficiency test uses what might be called a “placebo sample.” A medical placebo looks like medicine, but it contains no active ingredients. A placebo sample in forensic science looks like crime scene evidence, but there is no underlying crime because the placebo is constructed to test the lab’s performance. A placebo sample is constructed and the party constructing the sample knows what result the crime lab should report. With blind proficiency tests, a laboratory would know that it would periodically receive a placebo sample but would not know when it was submitted. As explained below, we used random audits with penalties for inaccuracy to mimic blind proficiency testing. As we note below, other experiments have provided evidence on other complementary reforms. The practical problem motivating our inquiry seems to be large and important. Koppl (2010a) estimates, “Forensic science errors and false or misleading forensic science testimony may be contributing to over 20,000 false felony convictions per year in the United States” (p. 223).Footnote 1 The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has released a report challenging to some extent the reliability of forensic science in the USA. The report emphasizes the importance of “errors and fraud” in forensic science (pp. 1-8 to 1-10). “The bottom line is simple: In a number of forensic science disciplines, forensic science professionals have yet to establish either the validity of their approach or the accuracy of their conclusions, and the courts have been utterly ineffective in addressing this problem” (NAS 2009, p. 1–14). Three facts help explain the poor state of forensic science practice relative to our prior expectations. The first fact is that forensic science techniques often rely on the subjective judgment of an examiner (NAS 2009, pp. 5-1 to 5-42). Thompson (2009) shows that even standard DNA testing often involves subjective judgment. The second fact is that crime labs in the USA are typically organized under a law enforcement agency (NAS 2009: S-9). “Forensic scientists who sit administratively in law enforcement agencies or prosecutors’ offices, or who are hired by those units, are subject to a general risk of bias” (NAS 2009: 6–2). The third fact is that each crime lab in the USA has a kind of monopoly in the examination and interpretation of forensic evidence. Once evidence has been sent to a lab, it is unlikely that another lab will examine the same evidence or give an interpretation of it (Koppl 2005a). This lack of redundancy in the system weakens the checks and balances that might otherwise exist. The lack of redundancy in forensic science increases the chance that poor practices, inefficiency, error, and even fraud may go undetected indefinitely. Koppl (2010b) gives evidence that mechanisms to prevent, detect, and correct errors may be cost efficient and even cost reducing for the criminal justice system. In any event, we take it for granted in this paper that forensic-science error rates are in some sense too high. In this paper, we are examining corrective mechanisms rather than the need for them. We conducted a series of sender–receiver experiments to study the consequences of implementing a regime of blind proficiency tests in forensic science to reduce error rates and improve the criminal justice system. Our objective in this and other experiments is to identify measures that can reduce error rates and improve decision making in the criminal justice system. Senders are our surrogate for forensic laboratories and receivers, for the decision maker, the judge or jury. Our experimental surrogate for blind proficiency tests (random audits with a penalty) reduced sender error rates by as much as 46% depending on the level of experimentally induced bias. When penalties improve information quality, receiver error rates fell by as much as 26% depending on the level of the sender bias. We also find that the penalty must be large relative to the payoff to induce the reduction in errors. Our results suggest that a regime of blind proficiency testing has the potential to reduce forensic science errors. Below, we will note some cases in which crime labs or forensic scientists have in some sense misbehaved. We do not wish to give the impression that mechanisms such as blind proficiency tests are appropriate only if such misbehavior is the norm. We do not believe forensic scientists and state crime labs should be vilified. The principle of “analytical egalitarianism” (Peart and Levy 2005) suggests that economists must view themselves as no less subject to human frailty than the agents in their models or the real persons represented by those agents. On the one hand, forensic scientists are not magically immune to human frailty. On the other hand, they are not somehow more human than the rest of the species. The point is to get mechanisms that work well even when individuals are human beings and thus capable of error and vice. The problem is not that bench examiners or lab managers are somehow low or bad. The problem is that the governance mechanisms in forensic science are not robust to limits in human benevolence and omniscience. Boettke and Leeson (2004) call for mechanisms that are robust in this sense, which they label “robust political economy.” They say, “When information is costly, imperfect, and asymmetric, a robust political economy produces rational allocation nonetheless. Likewise, when men are selfish knaves, a robust political economy nevertheless produces socially beneficial outcomes. In short, conditions shy of omniscience and benevolence do not cause the system to falter” (Boettke and Leeson 2004, p. 103). We are seeking robust mechanisms in forensic science. In this sense, we are engaged in an exercise in robust political economy. Section 2 discusses the forensic science context of our experiment. A large body of literature supports the view that reforms are needed. This literature contradicts the common presumption that forensic science errors are rare. Section 3 discusses the science game, treatments, and hypotheses. Section 4 reviews our results. Section 5 discusses the implications of our experiments. The conclusion, Section 6, includes notes on future research.",2
24.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,28 October 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-010-0131-3,"A critique of Powell, Woods, and Murphy on the 1920–1921 depression",September 2011,Daniel Kuehn,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the beginning of the “Great Recession” in 2008 and the renewal of the heated debate over the efficacy of fiscal and monetary stimulus, several articles have argued that the events surrounding the 1920–1921 depression vindicate the Austrian School and decisively invalidate Keynesianism (Powell 2009; Woods 2009; Murphy 2009).Footnote 1 These authors contend that the speedy recovery of the economy in 1921 and 1922 in the absence of fiscal intervention demonstrates that government inaction, or even austerity, is the ideal remedy for a downturn. The apparent success of the rapid liquidation of malinvestments that were made during the inflationary prologue to the depression is furnished as empirical support for the Austrian School’s contentions. There is a genuine prospect that these recent reviews will emerge as the canonical Austrian interpretation of the 1920–1921 depression, because few other Austrian economists have engaged or commented on that downturn. Hayek (1925) and Rothbard (2002) only mention the downturn casually, instead focusing on monetary policy immediately after the 1920–1921 depression as a precursor to the Great Depression. Mises does not appear to cover the American downturn of this period at all. This paper argues that the broad acceptance of the Powell (2009), Woods (2009), and Murphy (2009) interpretation would be problematic for two primary reasons. First, the position of Powell (2009) and Woods (2009) is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the American monetary and fiscal policy response to the postwar inflation and the subsequent deflationary depression. Contrary to the case laid out by Woods (2009), the Federal Reserve played an active role in this period. Powell (2009) and Woods (2009) also overemphasize the relevance of the Harding administration to the recovery. The second misconception shared by all three articles is their framing of traditional Keynesian fiscal policy recommendations, which are not applicable to the post-World War I downturn. Keynes (1936) specifically considers the implications of a downturn at a time of low nominal interest rates and deficient demand, which he argues requires demand augmentation; these conditions did not materialize during the 1920–1921 depression. However, Keynes provides a clear policy prescription for the appropriate fiscal and monetary response to the conditions that were in force for the United States in the early 1920s. These recommendations were largely consistent with the actions taken by the Federal Reserve at the time. Austrian scholars need to address these misconceptions in the recent reviews of the 1920–1921 downturn and provide a more rigorous account of the episode from an Austrian perspective. The depression of 1920–1921 verifies essential elements of the Austrian School’s perspective, and this needs to be highlighted. However, it also offers support to those who advocate an active role for central banks in guaranteeing stability during a crisis. To the extent that advocates of a central bank are buttressed by this episode, free banking theorists should also respond.Footnote 2 Finally, rather than invalidating Keynesian policy prescriptions, the depression of 1920–1921 is unable to provide a verdict on “traditional” Keynesian deficit spending, because the preconditions for fiscal stimulus were not apparent in the United States in the early 1920s. Keynesians and Austrians alike need to acknowledge this when they consider how the 1920–1921 depression informs arbitration between different macroeconomic policies.",6
24.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,18 December 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-010-0136-y,"Law, legislation, and local minima: Solving a problem in Hayek’s theory of common law judging, with historical examples",September 2011,Jason Kuznicki,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In volume I of Law, Legislation, and Liberty, Friedrich Hayek (1973) describes common law judging as the act of identifying, articulating, and applying tacit, often previously unarticulated expectations held in a society that encompasses both the judge and the litigants. Hayekian judging has two purposes. First, by finding and applying these often tacit expectations, the judge settles the dispute at hand, and second, by the same process, the judge attempts to prevent future disputes of a recognizably similar type: The chief concern of a common law judge must be the expectations which the parties in a transaction would reasonably have formed on the basis of the general practices that the ongoing order of actions rests on. In deciding what expectations were reasonable in this sense he can take account only of such practices (customs or rules) as in fact could determine the expectations of the parties and such facts as may be presumed to have been known to them (Hayek 1973: 86). And [The judge’s aim is one of] improving a given order of actions by laying down a rule that would prevent the recurrence of such conflicts as have occurred. In endeavouring to perform this task he will always have to move in a given cosmos of rules which he must accept and will have to fit into this cosmos a piece required by the aim which the system as a whole serves (Hayek 1973: 101). The gradual identification and articulation of these rules permits the growth of an extended social order based on mutually shared expectations, one that gradually encompasses an ever-wider set of possible interpersonal exchanges, in a process of spontaneous order. Hayek frequently characterizes this process as one of gap-filling. Standing expectations are usually honored, and new ones are created in such a way as to preserve the old, consistent with shared social expectations: [The judge] is not concerned with what any authority wants done in a particular instance, but with what private persons have ‘legitimate’ reasons to expect, where ‘legitimate’ refers to the kind of expectations on which generally his actions in that society have been based. The aim of the rules must be to facilitate the matching or tallying of the expectations on which the plans of the individuals depend for their success (Hayek 1973: 98). The rules which [the judge] pronounces will have to fill a definite gap in the body of already recognized rules in a manner that will serve to maintain and improve that order of actions which the already existing rules make possible (Hayek 1973: 100). However, Hayek concedes, this process brings with it a very significant danger, that of local minima.Footnote 1 A judge may misidentify or misarticulate a previously held social expectation. Other judges may then unwittingly build on the error. As a result, the bad ruling will not conduce to further extension of the social order, yet it will become an increasing part of the legal order all the same. Other judges will continue to build on the original judge’s misbegotten precedent until it is deeply embedded in the wall of expectation and thus impossible to remove. Yet this impossible-to-remove legal expectation has all the while been creating undesirable social consequences. Although the law is intended as an expression of the rules necessary for the spontaneous order of society, in this instance the law has become set in a permanent, ever-deepening conflict with that larger order. The negative consequences of a bad rule will grow in proportion to the weight of social expectation placed upon the defective rule. Because judging relies on social expectation to validate its authority, there is no escape; the cycle is vicious: “The judge is not performing his function if he disappoints reasonable expectations created by earlier decisions (Hayek 1973: 88).” And yet, in performing this function, the judge entrenches still further the conflict between law and society. “For a variety of reasons,” Hayek (1973: 88) writes, “the spontaneous process of growth may lead into an impasse from which it cannot extricate itself by its own forces or which it will at least not correct quickly enough. The development of case-law is in some respects a sort of one-way street: when it has already moved a considerable distance in one direction, it often cannot retrace its steps when some implications of earlier decisions are seen to be clearly undesirable.” At this point, Hayek invokes the legislator, who is tasked in the Hayekian legal order with removing the process of judging from the local minima it sometimes encounters. The legislator, Hayek (1973: 100) writes, must occasionally “extricate [the legal process] from the dead ends into which the gradual evolution may lead it.” Bringing in a legislator is a risky move, however. One may well ask, consistent with Hayek’s apt critique of legislation elsewhere, how a legislature might even be able to identify such a local minimum, and how it will be able to distinguish a genuine local minimum from a mere act of self-interest, class interest, or privilege. Are legislators not the archetypes of constructivist rationalism, and are we not opening our entire carefully elaborated spontaneous order to a radical revision at any given moment? Is it not far too easy just to declare the existence of a local minimum and then be off to the races? If so, it may be desirable to reduce or even eliminate this role for the legislator.Footnote 2
 This paper will argue that legislative interventions may not be strictly necessary to remedy local minima and that Hayek may therefore have sold short the powers of the Hayekian judge. Enduring local minima do not exist because social expectations based on judicial findings do not in fact form a one-way street. The Hayekian model of judging is an incomplete model of the rule-finding process as it was really practiced during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. At that time, the Anglo-American legal order was both polycentric and perhaps more true to Hayek’s underlying assumptions than was the model he ultimately produced of it. A new model is presented here, drawing both on Hayek’s undoubted insights, but also on historical examples and a close analysis of the role of exceptions in forming new precedents. Of course, throughout recorded history, legislatures have intervened continually in the process of the elaboration of common law. Because legislatures move so quickly and decisively, finding a “pure” example of the Hayekian rule-finding process extricating itself from a local minimum is probably an impossible task.Footnote 3 Legislatures, it should be added, are also directly responsible for many of the true dead ends we encounter in the law today. It remains an open question whether, in this regard, they help or hurt on balance. Yet the Anglo-American judicial system has recently escaped one particularly egregious example of a local minimum, and much of this escape has been thanks to the judges themselves. That local minimum is coverture. The system of coverture was a network of legal disabilities applied to married women. It was understood to form a conceptual whole, and it had been written about as such since the eighteenth century and even earlier. In its fullest form, coverture declared that a married woman’s legal identity was wholly subsumed by her husband’s. A wife could not own property in her own right. Any income she earned went directly to her husband. Her legal domicile was always that of her husband, even if she had been abandoned by him and even if she had never set foot in the state where her husband resided. A wife could not be named the defendant for many types of lawsuits, as it was assumed that wives always acted at their husbands’ behest. A wife could not even escape the rules of coverture by contract because contracts between husband and wife were presumptively invalid and because a marriage invalidated all contracts that previously existed between the marrying parties. The system of coverture was indeed partially dismantled by legislation. Judges, however, played a significant role as well, and it will be argued that their interventions in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries illustrate how Hayekian legal processes can “tunnel through” apparent local minima to find a more consistently just set of rules, one that more perfectly reflects the understandings necessary for the Great Society considered as a spontaneous order.",

One of the few critics, however, is Caplan (1999), who points out inconsistencies in Rothbard’s price theory, such as his admitting the possibility of a backward-bending individual supply curve of labour and his reference to substitution and income effects. Allowing for the income effect opens the door to Giffen behaviour in consumer theory in the same way that this effect makes the backward-bending labour supply curve possible. In response to this kind of criticism, there seem to be two positions among Austrians. The first is represented by Hülsmann (1999), who implicitly rejects Rothbard’s approach and prefers to follow Mises in not being concerned with the shape of demand curves. What role then the LDMU plays in the theory, if not influencing the shape of the demand curve, is unclear. The second position takes the existence of Giffen behaviour for granted (Garrison 1985; Block 1999). In his response to Caplan, Block (1999) maintains that demand is always non-increasing ceteris paribus, i.e. when the income effect is neglected.Footnote 3 According to him, Rothbard had in mind from the very beginning the compensated demand; indeed, Rothbard (2009, p. 239n) explicitly uses the Marshallian assumption of the constant marginal utility of money, which is, of course, equivalent to saying that the income effect is negligible. However, Rothbard is wrong in saying that relaxing this assumption only reinforces the law of demand, as this is the case only under the assumption that a single good is consumed—only then is the income effect always positive. By introducing more goods, the possibility of a negative income effect (and Giffen behaviour) emerges. The acceptance of this line of reasoning in terms of substitution and income effects immediately raises the question about the difference between Austrian and mainstream demand theories. One obvious difference is that the Austrian analysis professes to make use of the LDMU; nonetheless, to my knowledge, nowhere in the literature is the relevance of LDMU for the shape of the demand curve discussed. In the next section, Rothbard’s interpretation of this law is examined, and it is argued that it cannot possibly have any consequences for demand theory.",4

Carilli,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economics is a way of understanding the world. As economists, our job is to convey this understanding to a variety of constituents. Economists do research, economists write and lecture to the public, and economists teach. Teaching economics is the most important thing that I can do as an economist. A good economics class has the same qualities as an episode of Myth Busters. People not trained in economics tend to believe weird things like energy independence is a good thing, that trade means one person is taking advantage of another, or that profits are turpe lucrum or ill-gotten gains and therefore serve no useful function. Belief in these myths is dangerous because the policies that they tend to support threaten our general prosperity and well-being. As teachers of economics, we can provide the fallacy prophylactic to demonstrate that ideas like energy independence and isolationism are impoverishing, that trade is mutually beneficial, and that profit plays a pivotal role in smooth and peaceful functioning of a society. A Quinnipiac University poll shows that 45% of those surveyed prefer to see spending by the state to stimulate job growth while only 32% want to see the budget deficit reduced, and 17% want lower taxes. When nearly half of the people polled still believe that government spending will create jobs after trillions of dollars of stimulus, we have failed to do our jobs. The importance of Bastiat’s broken window and our ability to convey its simple message is paramount. If we start by understanding that people really believe that robbing Peter to pay Paul makes both Peter and Paul more wealthy or at the very least gives Paul a job at no cost to Dave, Mary, George, Irvin, etc., we can craft our teaching to trace out the effects of how these proposed changes will affect their decisions and how similar policies have fared in our history and throughout the world. Start with the assumption that they understand and that they are passing the buck because they do not ever think that the buck will be returned to them and we can better teach them that the buck will come back around in the form of a reduced wealth for not only Peter but for them and everyone else in the end.",

Hayek and Karl Polanyi,December 2011,Andrea Migone,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"I endeavour to develop a framework comparing the works of F.A. Hayek and Karl Polanyi to show that, while relevant differences certainly exist between the two, their notions of embeddedness can be reconciled and brought together. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, a neoliberal reading of markets became the dominant framework in explaining socioeconomic relations. Market values were used to explain and support not only classically economic transactions (like selling and buying on the open market) but also service delivery from the Public Administration (thanks to the emergence of New Public Management) and international development (through the dominance of free-market tools in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund decisions). In many cases, these claims were not fully matched by the actual application of free-market tools. For example, it is unclear that a true free-market approach had replaced the Keynesian model that was supposed to be suppressed. In many cases, the esoteric, economistic models of neoliberalism still rely on critical state intervention and policy goals are often over specified for many sectors. The results seem to be a reduced relevance of embeddedness, a more arms-length approach by policy-makers to accountability and a rather interventionist economic and industrial policy approach. Neoliberal narratives paid scarce attention to either Austrian or Polanyian models of embeddedness, often focusing on a simple model featuring rather disjointed utility maximizers. The crisis of 2008/2009 and the massive interventions by virtually every major government in propping up failing economic realities has rekindled the discussion on the relations between markets and social rules. Therefore, it is not surprising that concerns regarding the interplay between states, markets and individuals returned to the fore of academic and lay debates. Much of the debate about the contrast between the rationalizing tendencies of the market and the embeddedness of society is rather polarized, choosing either pro-market or anti-market stances. Neither is satisfactory. We should frame markets as socioeconomic systems rather than as simply economic processes and recognize that the dominant status of capitalist relations translates into powerful social pressures. For example, the flexibilization of work influences the structure of the family, free trade changes the way in which we consume and produce, affecting our social space. Whether we applaud or condemn its effects, it cannot be denied that capitalism has a strong influence on the socioeconomic fabric of society. There can be no fair, free community without free individuals, but individuals cannot build a viable community if they act, or are encouraged to act, as either atomized units or as subsumed into organizations. To explore the boundaries of embeddedness and to stress its relevance, I shall try to produce a framework that will allow to address the differences, compatible elements and synergic strengths of two often contrasted perspectives on embeddedness: the Hayekian and the Polanyian ones. The former has F.A. Hayek as its central referent, and the latter is grounded in Karl Polanyi’s work. However, both incorporate other, more recent secondary literature developments and critiques of the original works. I do not present a fine-grained analysis of the two authors or a detailed recounting of the textual variations their production underwent. Instead, they are used to draw inspiration for the theoretical framing of a complex analysis of markets as socioeconomic system, which I argue can best be undertaken by using them together. On the one hand, this pairing is intended as a bit of a provocation to stimulate reflection and discussion on the scope and the values that should be embedded in a modern market society. On the other hand, it is worthwhile linking these perspectives because to both authors markets are social factors rather than just a background for activity and because both rely on notions of embeddedness to ground their theory of economic activity, albeit covering different areas of concern. Finally, they are different but complementary critiques of the simplistic neoliberal image of capitalism. They represent the ends of a continuum of analysis of socioeconomic systems between individual freedoms and the protection of social structures. Both observe the institutional interaction that develops among individuals, states and markets even if they approach it from different points of view, and both rely on an understanding of institutions as ideational frameworks for human action. Friedrich Hayek’s notion of spontaneous order (Hayek 1948a, 1964a, 1973, 1976, 1979) and Karl Polanyi’s notion of economic embeddedness (Polanyi 1947, 1957) have been used independently to analyse socioeconomic activity (Ioannides 2003; Jessop 2001; Vanberg 1986) but are not brought together as an analytical tool. I argue that this is a missed opportunity. The Hayekian and Polanyian approaches represent different strands of a long-standing intellectual tradition that concerned itself with the effects of modernization and economic rationalization on society. Three steps are necessary to operationalize their connection:
 
Individuals must be given a central place as actors, without denying the important role that institutions play in framing their behaviour. I do this by referring to the notion of complex methodological individualism, which is rooted in the Weberian/Austrian tradition and that can be extended to cover Hayek’s approach to action and institutional emergence and to Polanyi’s vision of social organization. I use the notion of complex embeddedness, which looks at the relations of the social, political and economic spheres as interconnected and dynamically correlated rather than hierarchically dependent on one another. We must look at capitalism as a dynamic system of socioeconomic arrangements aiming at the institutionalization of a specific model of economic exchange, production and consumption, which tends to be exclusionary of alternatives and potentially hegemonic in its scope. Both traditions are concerned with socio-institutional responses to the free market. The Hayekian one is focused on the limits that an excessive organizational load would put on individual freedom (Hayek 1948a, 1960; Fehl 1994; Gray 1998). Risk-averse politicians or administrators convinced of the rationality of their tools are most likely to enable organizations designed to direct and regulate, rather than facilitate, markets. These organizations lack the adaptive capacities of the catallaxy, of the spontaneous ordering that emerges from the unhindered interaction of individuals seeking to fulfil their specific goals (Hayek 1964a, b, 1978a), and tend to limit the scope of the market and of individual freedoms. The Polanyian one (Adaman et al. 2003; Munck 2004; Polanyi 1957) asks how societies cope with the incipient economic rationalization that takes centre stage in modern market economies, disembedding economic relations from their social milieu and enfeebling non-economic systems of relations. If Hayek was concerned with the danger posed by organizational reform that hindered the market, Polanyi criticized the emergence of rules that eliminated organizational and institutional buffers between the economic and the social spheres and that eradicated and scattered the very bounds of human life, like family, safety and living within a familiar culture and environment. The Polanyian and Hayekian traditions represent the two poles of the tension inherent in the modern capitalist market: the need to reconcile individual freedom with social stability, to assure capital accumulation and the reproduction of the working class, all within the demanding constraints of liberal democracy and market economies.Footnote 1 The institutionalization of a viable socioeconomic arrangement is implicitly a compromise between capital accumulation and social reproduction. Such socioeconomic compromises are structured around specific interests and seldom, if ever, are devoid of bias in protecting specific classes or groups within society. This is why the notion of embeddedness is so relevant to our analysis: Social bounds, mores, historical patterns and traditions are all crucial in designing viable structures, institutions that will ‘fit’ with the history and nature of a society. The market and its self-adjusting process are also fundamental because they have offered the most flexible and, arguably, the most open economic arrangement with which to provide for social needs. While a more complete analysis of these concepts will be presented below, I shall now introduce some key concepts and establish some critical differences and commonalities between Hayek and Polanyi. Two important concepts generally linked to Karl Polanyi are those of embeddedness and its cognate notion of re-embeddedness, which are separate from the notion of embedded liberalism. The notion of embeddedness is critical in economic sociology and gained most of its momentum since Ruggie’s (1982) famous article that is not quite about what Polanyi (1957) was talking about (Dale 2010, 197). Polanyi (1957, 53) in The Great Transformation notes that: The outstanding discovery of recent historical and anthropological research is that man’s economy, as a rule, is submerged in his social relationships. He does not act so as to safeguard his individual interests in the possession of material goods; he acts as to safeguard his social standing, his social claims, his social assets. He values material goods only in so far as they serve this end. Thus, a society’s socio-institutional framework is critical in shaping its economic side. He saw modern market society as an aberration of the original socially and culturally embedded model that existed in ancient societies. Polanyi speaks to embeddedness in much more detail in The Livelihood of Man (Polanyi 1977) where he outlines how the various types of transactions taking place in any society depend on the specific institutional settings in place there (Hechter 1981).Footnote 2 The free market, however, worked to rupture these sociocultural bounds and, if left unchecked, it would ultimately create a barren landscape for human beings where only the economic side was important. Thus, the notion of re-embeddedness is rooted in the idea that a process of spontaneous protection from the strong pressures of the market would spring up from the pain this generated and would ‘swing the pendulum’ in the opposite direction (Polanyi 1957, 76). On Hayek’s side, we consider three important elements: the idea of spontaneous order, the notion that markets are critically based on knowledge flows and the institutional foundations of markets. Hayek believed that societies required both spontaneous orders and directed social orders but argued that the spheres in which they yield the best results always remains sharply differentiated. That the two kinds of order will regularly coexist in every society of any degree of complexity does not mean, however, that we can combine them in any manner we like. What in fact we find in all free societies is that, although groups of men will join in organizations for the achievement of some particular ends, the co-ordination of the activities of all these separate organizations, as well as of the separate individuals, is brought about by the forces making a spontaneous order (Hayek 1973, 46). For example, the optimal approach towards the large-scale, knowledge-limited operations of the market is the catallaxy (self-organizing) rather than the economy (directed).Footnote 3 What is quite striking in the process of market interaction, Hayek argued, is the interactive activity of a myriad of actors, who individually possess only a tiny fraction of the total stock of knowledge available to society, but who still generate an aggregate level of knowledge superior to that emerging from any centrally devised planning mechanism. The notion of knowledge changed in Hayek’s work, reflecting a methodological transition from ‘an economic theory of knowledge as a theory of how people come to know what to do’ (Böhm 1994, 170) to an epistemic analysis ‘of the use of fragmented, or dispersed, knowledge under different institutional arrangements’ (Böhm 1994, 171), to finally (after the 1950s) dealing with practical, inarticulate knowledge, which is so crucial to economic activity (Böhm 1994, 171), but always remained central to his activity. Finally, Hayek was a supporter of the notion that markets have strong institutional foundations (Shearmur 1996) and that these institutions had an important role to play in the organization and continued survival of socioeconomic realities (Hayek 1960, 1979). Those who see markets as embedded argue that, because of the deep interrelation between social and organizational realities within modern capitalist economies, ‘economic action is irreducibly social action, and economic institutions are social forms’ (Slater and Tonkiss 2001, 93). Polanyian analysis is concerned with the type of extreme market rationalization that artificially reduces the multi-varied structure at the basis of all economic interaction to the overarching rationale of profit accumulation. During the Liberal century, this process elevated an ideal type to the status of common reality; a recipe for disaster. Part of Polanyi’s work is still very contemporary. The metaphor of the double movement is still relevant as a description of the ongoing debate about the nature and ultimate aims of globalization, and his analysis of international rules and their consequences for individual states’ choices is as intriguing today as it was in the 1940s (Block 2001). Neo-Polanyian works like Gray’s (1998) account of American and British capitalism under neoconservative policies, and Scott’s (1996) analysis of the reorganization of British society along free-market premises under neoliberal governments echo this analysis. Polanyi’s warning is that international arrangements that embody the utopian message of unfettered markets are bound to clash with domestic realities and, if taken too far, generate nationalist and/or isolationist drives rather than open, global markets. This was the ultimate result of the policies associated with the Gold Standard when its costs became too steep to bear (O’Rourke and Williamson 1999; Polanyi 1957). In the second section, I explore the possibility of linking the authors in terms of methodological individualism, grounding them in the tradition of German economic sociology, and speak to the agency–structure issues that always emerge when the notion of embeddedness is taken up. In the following one, I go into more detail regarding the Hayekian perspective. After that, I discuss the notion of embeddedness and finally offer some concluding thoughts in Section 5.",13

In contrast to central bankers, we commend free bankers for their work deconstructing the monopoly of money issuance at the whims of a central bank. In this paper, we critically assess the common claim advanced by free bankers that allowing the banking system to expand credit through the issuance of fiduciary media is the optimal path to maintaining monetary equilibrium.Footnote 1
 Free bankers commonly present price stickiness as an important reason why fractional reserves are necessary to prevent business cycles.Footnote 2 Money lacks a central market and its purchasing power is determined only piecemeal through the myriad of individual transactions. A “sluggish” reaction to shocks may consequently occur. If the price level cannot adjust instantaneously, as free bankers suggest, an alteration to the supply of money is advocated to avoid detrimental repercussions. Several salient concerns have been overlooked to date. Redistribution effects from the issuance of fiduciary media will benefit any banking system’s preferred clients at the expense of others. Allowing for a flexible money supply disrupts the cost adjustment process that aligns factor prices with the values attached to their finished goods. Finally, a changing money supply complicates economic calculation as it is no longer sufficient to forecast supply/demand imbalances in only the goods market: now, entrepreneurs will also have to assess the money market. The case for a fractional reserve banking system to mitigate price rigidities is not only unclear, but many of the results of unduly increasing the money supply are detrimental, resulting in economic volatility, frustrated entrepreneurial plans, and negative redistribution effects.",9

Business groups in this paper are understood as a collection of legally independent firms, who may operate in horizontally and/or vertically related stages of the value-added chain and/or in totally unrelated industries, and which are bound together by formal (e.g., equity) and/or informal (e.g., family) ties. This definition excludes a set of firms bound merely by short-term strategic alliances as well as a set of firms legally consolidated into a single entity. It includes explicitly holding company groups, where an apex firm controls via equity ownership other firms, because the constituent firms maintain their legal independence.Footnote 1
 In mainstream economics, the emergence and persistence of business groups in emerging economies usually raises concern with regard to competition. They are seen as a symptom of imperfect competition and market failure (e.g., Khanna 2000: 752; Khanna and Palepu 1999: 275) as well as a source of market power and thus a threat to competition and the welfare optimum of a society (Ghatak and Kali 2000: 28; Khanna and Yafeh 2007: 361f). The theoretical reasons for relating business groups to imperfect competition, market power, and negative welfare effects are based on insights of neoclassical welfare economics with its benchmark model of perfect competition. Austrian economists have been pioneering and trenchant to emphasize that the purposes and the advantages of competition do not lie in it being “perfect”, but being an entrepreneurial driven dynamic market process with the function of a discovery procedure. This view on the nature and purpose of competition must lead to a different assessment of the interplay between business groups and competition. So far there have been no attempts to appraise the relation between business groups and competition from an “Austrian” perspective in general and for transition economies in particular. In fact, while there are Austrian contributions to the topic of firm size and scope, Jeon and Kim (2004) is, as so far known, the only “Austrian” analysis that explicitly deals with business groups (see also Section 3.6). The aim of the paper is to apply the insights of the Austrian School of Economics on the nature and purpose of competition to assess the interplay of business groups and competition in post-Soviet transition economies. It questions the abovementioned hypotheses that enjoy widespread support in mainstream economics that (1) business groups are the result of imperfect competition and (2) that they may reinforce imperfect competition because of considerable market power they are likely to wield. Rather than to provide exhaustive explanations of why business groups emerge, the focus of the paper is to develop and apply an Austrian theoretical framework to determine (1) if their emergence in transition economies is consistent with the Austrian view of competition as an entrepreneurial discovery process and (2) under which conditions business groups can become a danger to competition in the “Austrian” understanding. Transition economies are an interesting case because the institutional change from a centrally planned to a market economy triggered by the unanticipated collapse of the communist system turned out to be a long-winded process due to political resistance and conflicts of formal institutions with slow-changing informal institutions. This is in particular said to be true for the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union (Aslund 2007a: 305; Havrylyshyn 2006: 47ff.). Therefore, it could even be assumed that competition might work “imperfectly” not only in the neoclassical sense but also in its function as a discovery procedure. This raises the following questions that shall be discussed in the paper: (1) What are the crucial requirements to unleash and maintain competition as a discovery procedure in transition economies? (2) To what degree can against this background business groups in transition economies be regarded as the result of competition in the Austrian understanding? (3) What impact can be expected from business groups on competition as transition progresses? Will they foster or impede competition as an entrepreneurial discovery procedure? (4) What are the policy implications? The theoretical framework developed in the following to answer these questions will then be applied in a tentative empirical effort to analyze the interplay between business groups and competition regarding the case study of Russia’s agricultural sector. Russia is the largest transition economy and time and again linked to failed or delayed transition because of a long-lasting output decline and crises like the default of August 1998 (e.g., Stiglitz 2000). It is also associated with oligarchic capitalism where a few businessmen control large parts of the economy, often via holding company business groups, who are alleged to capture the state (e.g., Havrylyshyn 2006: 177ff). According to Avdasheva (2007a: 98ff), by 2004 holding company business groups produced approximately 40% of Russia’s total industrial output and employed 64% of industry’s total work force. Business groups emerged even in the country’s agricultural sector, in Soviet time a constant black hole and during the first 10 years of transition suffering from output decline and soaring farm debts (see also Section 4.1). In the Russian literature, these business groups are commonly called “agroholdings” (e.g., Rylko and Jolly 2005: 116). Since in agriculture of advanced market economies such vertically integrated business groups are in general unknown, their emergence in Russia was quickly linked to imperfect competition and market failure, too (e.g., Khramova 2003: 10; Koester 2005: 111ff.). The paper’s contribution to the literature is thus twofold: First, it enhances the understanding of business groups by focusing on an aspect that according to Khanna and Yafeh (2007: 361) is yet not well examined—the interplay of business groups and competition. Second, it provides insights to the microeconomic responses in post-Soviet transition economies both by applying an alternative, largely ignored theoretical perspective and by presenting a case study of an important sector of the largest post-soviet transition economy. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the mainstream view on the emergence of business groups and their interplay with competition and to what degree it is reflected in public policy. Next, Section 3 develops an Austrian theoretical framework for assessing the relation between business groups and competition in transition countries. It explains the “Austrian” understanding of the nature and purpose of competition and works out the crucial prerequisites to unleash and maintain it in transition economies, the threat business groups can pose to competition and the consequences for the “Austrian” empirical analysis of business groups and their relation to competition. Section 4 applies this theoretical framework to assess the interplay of business groups in Russia’s agro-food sector and competition. The paper ends with concluding remarks on the policy implications (Section 5).",16

Rather than following official State history and viewing the people as primitive prestate barbarians, Scott writes, “Far from being ‘left behind’ by the progress of civilisation in the valleys, they have, over long periods of time, chosen to place themselves out of the reach of the state” (2009: 22). They place themselves beyond the reach of the state because, as Scott puts it, “Living within the state meant, virtually by definition, taxes, conscription, corvee labor, and for most, a condition of servitude” (2009: 7). Rothbard (1973, 1978: 24), although writing about states more generally, did not put it much differently, “The State habitually commits mass murder, which it calls ‘war,’... the State engages in enslavement into its military forces, which it calls ‘conscription’; and it lives and has its being in the practice of forcible theft, which it calls ‘taxation.’” It is no wonder why some people might choose to live beyond the State's grasp. Public Choice and Austrian economists have long been interested in the study of the transition from anarchy to states and the governance of stateless orders.Footnote 1 Scott's book is a valuable contribution to this literature. He illustrates a case where, for hundreds of years, people found it in their interest to avoid states that desired to include them. However, his book raises many questions about Zomia that were left unanswered. Scott notes that “Virtually everything about these people's livelihoods, social organization, ideologies, and (more controversially) even their largely oral cultures, can be read as strategic positioning designed to keep the state at arm's length” (2009: x). Yet, while he does write a little about their social organization, he does little to tell us how their internal governance functioned. He specifically notes that they were not in an anarchy which was synonymous with chaos. When describing their political order Scott writes, I emphasize the term political order to avoid conveying the mistaken impression that outside the realm of the state lay mere disorder. Depending on the location and date, such units might range from nuclear families to segmentary lineages, bilateral kindreds, hamlets, larger villages, towns and their immediate hinterlands, and confederations of such towns (emphasis his, 2009: 36). Yet little to nothing is written about the mechanisms that these social structures used to provide internal governance in Zomia. Other stateless people or groups of people operating within states but in areas outside of state enforcement have used reputation (Ellickson 1991), exclusion (Stringham 2003), trading coalitions (Greif 1989), the costly adoption of customs or gift giving (Leeson 2008), religious homogeneity (Bernstein 1992), and a host of other mechanisms (see Powell and Stringham 2009 for a survey) to enforce contracts and customary legal systems. After reading The Art of Not Being Governed, we are left with two major questions. First, how was governance provided in Zomia absent a State monopoly government? Second, what was the effect of this system of governance on the well-being of the residents of Zomia compared to those who were in nearby lowland states? We follow up these questions with two brief case studies. The first is a study of a banking caste in nearby Southern India that operated without state enforcement of its contracts during nineteenth and early twentieth century. Second, we study modern-day Somalia which shares many characteristics with Zomia including being totally stateless. In Somalia, we describe how governance is provided and the effect becoming stateless has had on the standard of living for the Somali people. Our final section concludes with reflections for future work on Zomia.",

Miles,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Are societies free of states possible? Historical evidence strongly indicates the answer is yes. From ancient Iceland to the American West, numerous orderly societies not governed by states have existed.Footnote 1 Are societies free of states sustainable? That is a more difficult question. Economists such as Cowen and Sutter (2005) or Holcombe (2004, 2005) recognize the existence of stateless orders, but they question whether they are viable in the long term.Footnote 2 To Holcombe (2004, p. 334): “People may not need or want government, but inevitably they will find themselves under government's jurisdiction.” Even many anarchist economists such as Bruce Benson, Bryan Caplan, and Robert Higgs are fairly pessimistic about whether the state can ultimately be eradicated and repelled. Although authors such as Rothbard (1973/1996) and Friedman (1973/1989) provided many very good theoretical reasons why society would be better off without a state, they have spent less time showing how stateless societies could avoid takeover by a state in the long run. Without understanding the mechanisms or having evidence of the long-term viability of statelessness, does it make sense for anarchists to be pessimistic ones who only support the idea in the abstract? In this article, we review evidence from stateless areas of Southeast Asia documented by various researchers and best highlighted by Yale professor of political science and anthropology, James C. Scott. In a very important new work, The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia, Scott documents how people in upland Southeast Asia have successfully lived free from statesFootnote 3 for thousands of years. Scott (2009, p. ix) writes that at present, “Zomia is the largest remaining region of the world whose peoples have not been fully incorporated into nation-states.” According to Scott (2009, p. 14), “Rough calculations would put Zomian minority populations alone at around eighty million to one hundred million.” Many of people of Zomia have been taken over by states, but to this day, many continue to live outside the state's control. Examining successful stateless societies provides evidential details regarding the different mechanisms that can help prevent emergence of, reemergence of, and conquest by states. In this article, we examine three broad categories of mechanisms that statelessFootnote 4 societies in Southeast Asia employed against statecraft.Footnote 5 In particular, the peoples of the vast Southeast Asian region of Zomia were successful in providing incentives against statecraft—that is, they successfully prevented their own appropriation by external states and successfully prevented local state formation—for most of their long history. Scott (2009, p. 178) notes that Zomian populations disincentivized statecraft via “pattern[s] of settlement, agriculture, and social structure.” We describe these interrelated mechanisms—settlement, agriculture, and social structure—more broadly as (1) locational, (2) productional, and (3) cultural mechanisms to repel states. Although certain mechanisms appear to be more effective in certain historical circumstances, we believe that many of them can be used as models of potential mechanisms for repelling states in the future. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the customary law and property norms in select Zomian societies. Section 3 describes some of the key mechanisms that stateless societies in Zomia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia used to prevent, avoid, and repel states. Section 4 concludes.",21
25.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,03 May 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-011-0150-8,"The art of seeing like a state: State building in Afghanistan, the DR Congo, and beyond",March 2012,Christopher J. Coyne,Adam Pellillo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In Seeing Like a State, James Scott (1998) explores what he calls “high modernism,” the “…strong, one might even say muscle-bound, version of the beliefs in scientific and technical progress that were associated with industrialization in Western Europe and in North America from roughly 1830 until World War I” (89). At the basis of high modernism is the “…supreme self-confidence about continued linear progress, the development of scientific and technical knowledge, the expansion of production, the rational design of social order, the growing satisfaction of human needs, and, not least, an increasing control over nature” (89). Scott applies the concept of high modernism to a variety of state-led efforts intended to improve the human condition. In doing so, he identifies three elements that have led to significant human tragedy despite good intentions to make people better off. The first element is the desire to achieve an administrative ordering of nature and society. The second element is the willingness of the modern state to use power to achieve the desired ordering. The final element is the presence of a weak civil society that is unable to resist the use of power by the state. The many failures of central planning in the twentieth century—e.g., Soviet collectivization, China’s Great Leap Forward, compulsory “villagization” in Tanzania, planned “scientific cities,” etc.—Scott argues, are due to an unfortunate confluence of these three elements. In his subsequent book, The Art of Not Being Governed, Scott (2009) focuses on the populations residing in Zomia—a mountainous region in Southeast Asia—which was one of the largest remaining areas that had not been integrated into a formal nation-state. The standard view of the populations living in this mountainous region, commonly referred to as “hill people,” is that they were remnants of the pre-state period and represented an uncivilized form of living. In contrast, those who moved into the lowlands and became part of the state system were viewed as civilized and developed. The novel contribution of Scott’s book is to turn this standard view on its head. In contrast to the view that the populations residing in Zomia were primitive leftovers of the pre-state period, Scott argues that those living in the highlands consciously chose to live outside the reach of the state. Given the possibility of being subjected to predatory behaviors by states—including conscription, slavery, excessive taxes, forced labor, and war—people made the choice to move into the hills as an act of state avoidance. The resistance of Zomians to the state, while evident for hundreds of years prior, was particularly manifest in the post-World War II period, “when Zomia became the site of secessionist movements, indigenous rights struggles, millennial rebellions, regionalist agitation, and armed opposition to lowland states” (Scott 2009: 19). These insights have implications not only for our understanding of the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia but also for how we think about other societies whose states and governance mechanisms differ in form and structure from Western nation-states. Although Scott is focused on Zomia in The Art of Not Being Governed, a number of parallels can be drawn between Zomia and what are commonly categorized as “weak,” “fragile,” “failed,” and “collapsed” states.Footnote 1 These states typically lack a monopoly on the legitimate use of force across their entire territories, much like the lowland states of Southeast Asia in the time period considered by Scott. Further, these states have difficulty raising revenues and providing what are often considered public goods such as security, education, basic infrastructure, etc. Because of their deficiencies on a number of margins, countries with weak, fragile, failed, or collapsed states are typically viewed as requiring institutional reform. State-building processes—e.g. the development of new constitutions, government agencies, and tax administrations, the holding of elections, the expansion and training of military and police forces, etc.—that are assisted by the “international community” are typically oriented around the development and expansion of state institutions across the entire geographic boundaries of a country. Yet, there are a number of factors that must be appreciated when considering state-building efforts, and Scott’s works provide many insights into the myriad challenges in these efforts. First, the state institutions—e.g., constitutions, legal systems, militaries, etc.—that are developed may not sufficiently constrain state political actors from engaging in many of the predatory actions identified by Scott in The Art of Not Being Governed—e.g., excessive taxes, human rights abuses, war, etc. Second, in many countries where the state does not have complete territorial control (particularly in Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and also in countries like Colombia or Somalia), there are sub-national non-state political actors who maintain a considerable amount of power and control over specific regions within the country. Efforts to develop and expand state institutions will be costly because of the need to co-opt or coerce—e.g., through diplomacy, political/financial incentives, legal proceedings, or military/police force—non-state political actors in order to make the state institutions operable. In some cases, even officials of the state may resist the development of state institutions since strong states are associated with strong institutional constraints—e.g., checks and balances. State political actors may reject such constraints in order to maintain their power and discretion.Footnote 2
 Lastly, in The Art of Not Being Governed, Scott shows that there is a complex “art” to avoiding the formal state while acting orderly in a stateless society. Efforts to expand and develop state institutions overlook civil society and customary governance organizations which can help fill the void in the absence of a functional state. While these organizations lack the reach and resources of a larger-scale state, they may play crucial roles in peace-building efforts in these countries, and this capacity for local self-governance has implications for which specific state institutions are developed.Footnote 3 Moreover, despite the potential limits of these local forms of governance, it cannot be assumed that a nation-state is a preferable state of affairs (see Coyne 2006, 2007). Precisely because it has a greater reach and access to more resources, a dysfunctional nation-state can cause significant harms to ordinary people. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of the connections between Scott’s two books in order to address state-building efforts in Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We focus on these two countries because they are currently experiencing transformative state-building efforts with assistance by a variety of actors in the “international community.” Thousands of troops have been deployed to these countries (NATO-ISAF in Afghanistan and MONUC/MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and a significant amount of time, resources, and effort has been invested into state building in both of these countries. Yet, in both cases, state-building processes have suffered from significant problems and setbacks. Some state-building efforts have been entirely contradictory to one another—e.g., attempts at improving and expanding state institutions in Afghanistan while simultaneously supporting local “power brokers” and militias which undermine the state institutions—while many reconstruction projects have been mired by waste, inefficiency, and perverse incentives, not to mention destruction by insurgents and rebels. Afghanistan and the DRC face considerable challenges, especially with regards to improving governance and ensuring security.Footnote 4 Scott’s works highlight two key challenges associated with state-building processes in these countries: (1) the lack of alignment between institutional structures and local preferences, and (2) political incentives and the resistance of state and non-state political actors and citizens to the expansion of state institutions over the entire country. As is well evident, preventing and resolving conflict in “post-conflict” situations “…entails the complex political task of addressing the root causes of the conflict” (del Castillo 2008: 15, emphasis added). Addressing political incentives at the national, regional, and local levels is an incredibly complex task, one that often entails the employment of a range of diplomatic, legal, political, military, and police tools. As we discuss below, it is precisely because of this complexity that these efforts run the risk of suffering from the “high modernism” that Scott warned against. We proceed as follows. The next section draws on concepts from Seeing Like a State and The Art of Not Being Governed to discuss institutions and institutional “stickiness” in the context of state building. Section 3 highlights the “high modernism” of state-building efforts in Afghanistan and the DRC, while Section 4 discusses why these efforts will continue to be costly without a reorientation of state-building processes. Section 5 concludes.",

D’Amico,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Scott’s (2009) latest, The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia describes state-sponsored genocides, during which indigenous people were forced onto hostile geographies. Without traditional government or formal law and order institutions, economic conditions were suppressed for generations. In Scott’s view state power and action were fundamentally responsible for underdevelopment. Scott’s (see also 1999) work, other investigatory cases of stateless communities, along with an appreciative theory of spontaneous social order, stand in contrast to most contemporary models of political economy such as market failure and public goods frameworks, wherein centralized exogenous law enforcement is presumed both necessary and sufficient.Footnote 1
 It would be inappropriate to generalize from Southeast Asia to all social environments. Contemporary policies should not try to mimic tribal social norms, but Scott’s case and others like it pose a serious challenge to these more popular models and their implied policy recommendations. There is a conspicuous inability for standard perspectives to explain or offer effective resolve for the social problems of stateless Southeast Asia; wherein property rights were poorly defined and information asymmetric, yet the state’s effect upon social welfare was unarguably negative. Standard market-failure and public-good logics would not apply. Unlikely would foreign aid, subsidies, regulations, more central-planning, or any standard policy suggestion have promoted economic or social development given the counter-intentions of the state authority. Scott’s case requires a framework of political economy out of step with the causal relationships presumed by mainstream models. Contemporary views presume positive effects to interventionism. Doing so they often fail to recognize when government harms rather than helps social order. Social disorder is regularly misdiagnosed as the consequence of voluntary association and insufficient interventionism; when in fact certain social problems more result from mis-prescribed interventions. Conventional models inaccurately discount the source of social cooperation and economic development - spontaneous order. Lasting levels of peace and cooperation and their associated levels of coordination and economic exchange are neither easily planned nor designed. These are instead often-tenuous processes involving tacit individual and social learning.Footnote 2 Institutional innovations and processes of trial, error and informational feedback are needed to discover solutions for complex social problems. Aristotle is accredited to have said, “[f]or the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing.” Such seems true for both promoting the successful plans of individuals and the development of coordinative institutions at the societal level.Footnote 3 People learn to get along with one another through practice - by actually interacting with one another. Ironically, Scott sees such behavioral patterns amidst the indigenous residents of Southeast Asia - performed to cope against the harms of state predation. Much of Scott’s analysis focuses upon the geography and climate of Southeast Asia. High transaction costs made for few opportunities to exchange. Immobilized physical and human capital limited production. Nonetheless, social institutions, community bonds, and customary norms amongst refugee groups functioned and evolved generationally. Though economically limiting, nomadic practices proved rational in so far as they were effective means to evade state-predation. Scott terms “shatter zones,” those geographic areas populated by emigrants, acting against their pure economic welfare but nonetheless coping-well against state-genocide, thus effectively maximizing their best-understood chances of long-term survival. Scott (2009) concludes such outcomes are the “inevitable by-products of coercive state-making (p.24)”. It is again conspicuous that Scott’s case shares a series of unintended consequences with certain more-contemporary social environments, yet today’s political economy models rarely model the state akin to Scott. This paper is motivated by Scott’s weighting of influence behind state and non-state effects upon social order to perform a comparative institutional analysis across social contexts. Certain contemporary expansions in the scope of government invoke similar “shatter zones”. Criminal prohibitions and military occupations are cases wherein the causal relationships between governments and social order are also arguably negative. In each, enduring undesirable outcomes get prescribed additional interventions - more funding, more planning, more regulation and more enforcement resources. Rather than improving social order, expansions invoke and exaggerate tensions between the formal institutions of law enforcement on the one hand, and the underlying social consciences and informal customary norms of society on the other.Footnote 4 Prohibition, occupation and their associated social maladies endure. Militarized strategies have not effectively deterred prohibited behaviors nor suppressed violent conflicts. Instead, these interventions are often unwelcomed by governed communities, whom react in stride. Behavioral patterns therein are perceived problematic but demonstrate “contextual rationality” (Smith 2007). Informal institutions of trust and reciprocity are imperfect but functional alternatives to formal government; they make the best of uniquely severe constraints imposed by interventionism. Criminal prohibitions and punitive sanctions inspire complex but often cutthroat behaviors in the underground economy. Similarly, armed occupations inspire unconventional but arguably effective military tactics. These results get continually diagnosed as inevitable social problems in need of additional interventions. Why is this process of social diagnosis and government-only policy response, self-fulfilling? One commonly recognized reason is that vested political interests favor the status quo. Bureaucracies are inclined to and tend to expand (Niskanen 1971; Tullock 1965 and von Mises 1944). A less appreciated cause: knowledge problems occur during institutional design and implementation.Footnote 5 Contemporary applications of political economy are most often “market failure” narratives. They presume government a necessary and sufficient resolve for social problems (Cowen 1988 and Cowen and Crampton 2004). More subtle sources to complex social problems are often ignored and non-governmental solutions are unknown and thus un-considered. Planners systematically underestimate the role that individual and social learning play for the creation of effective and adaptive institutions and sustainable economic development (Scott 1999). The development process of contextually functional institutions requires local and tacit knowledge (Ostrom 1990).Footnote 6
 Central-planning cannot fix certain complex social problems because it cannot generate the necessary forms and stocks of knowledge. During processes involving violent conflict such as prohibition and occupation, social learning and its associated knowledge is absent because non-formal conflict resolution is prohibited by assumption. Without the stocks of knowledge and forms of social capital that would have accumulated absent interventions; central-planners, institutional decision-makers, and political economists suffer shear ignorance as to the range and qualities of alternative informal institutions. Such could have possibly better-improved social order. The optimal policies and institutions to promote social order for all times, places and peoples are unknown a priori. Sometimes social problems require genuinely new solutions. Institutional innovations much like technological innovations require trial, error, real discovery and informational feedback to be stable, adaptive and sustainable. The monopoly control of violence is the essential role of government most presumed both necessary and sufficient. By investigating explicitly stateless environments, or social contexts with anarchist and quasi-anarchist institutional conditions; how informal social processes occur to resolve violent conflict when un-intervened come to light.Footnote 7 Coase (1974) explained, “generalizations are not likely to be helpful unless they are derived from studies of how such activities are actually carried out within different institutional frameworks… [they] enable us to discover which factors are important and which are not in determining the outcome… (p. 375).”Footnote 8 Scott’s case and other similar cases allude: within the realm of the state presumed most necessary - the provision of law and order - governments sometimes fail to meet the conditions of necessity and sufficiency. Instead a monopoly control on violence can impose harm to social order that may require new (perhaps more complicated) forms of social learning in order to be resolved. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II analyzes the phenomena of criminal prohibition, foreign military occupation, and the behavioral learning patterns therein. Like in Scott’s case, marginal interventions continually pit the coercive power of the state against the physical forces of non-formal individuals and groups. Section III concludes.",

Young,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The US economy experienced a robust expansion following the 2001 recession and its November trough. This expansion lasted for just a month shy of 7 years according to the official National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) dates. However, it came to an end on the heels of a severe financial markets crisis. What followed was, according to many, the worst US recession since the Great Depression. At least in retrospect, the 2002 through 2007 expansion had many hallmarks of an unsustainable boom. The Austrian theory of the business cycle (ABCT) (Mises 1934; Hayek 1933, 1935) provides an account of how credit inflation on the part of a central bank can push interest rates below their “natural” rates and entice entrepreneurs to (erroneously) pursue more capital intensive, roundabout ventures; generally expanding the economy’s time structure of production. When the demand for these ventures’ production fails to materialize, the economy experiences a bust characterized by liquidation and unemployment. ABCT makes several predictions associated with the time structure of production and the movements of the prices of higher-order goods (associated with earlier stages of production) relative to those of lower-order goods (associated with later stages).
 Production structures become more roundabout on average during a boom. Production structures subsequently contract during the bust. The prices of higher-order goods rise first during the boom, increasing the prices of goods from more roundabout industries. The prices of lower-order goods rise subsequently and less than proportionately. These are predictions that are unique to ABCT. Evidence of them would not only be consistent with ABCT but would also discriminate against alternative business cycle theories. Unfortunately, empirical evaluation of these ABCT predictions has proven difficult for several reasons. First, the stylized facts of business cycles are based on the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) aggregates that are ill-suited to evaluate a theory that is based on a disaggregated view of production structures. Second, the concept of roundaboutness is not a straightforward one to empirically measure. The time structure of production is simply not to found in the NIPAs. Third, ABCT’s basic predictions for macroeconomic aggregates (e.g., investment expenditures will be more volatile than consumption expenditures) are too generic to discriminate against alternative cycle theories.Footnote 1
 This paper attempts to document the time structure of production for the US economy, as well as changes in that structure, from 2002 through 2009. In doing so, US industries are ranked according to their roundaboutness. This ranking facilitates the characterization of the relative price and output movements along the time structure of production. These exercises are based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) input-output accounts and the assumption that an industry’s roundaboutness will be proportional to its ratio of total gross output used from all industries to final output from that industry. ABCT’s predictions turn out to be consistent with the stylized facts of the US time structure of production. I will begin in section 2 with an overview of the 2002 through 2009 business cycle, noting that there are reasons to suspect that it is of the Austrian type. Section 3 will then briefly elaborate on ABCT and its predictions. To pursue an empirical evaluation of those predictions, I argue in section 4 that theory suggests that a more roundabout industry – with more stages of production – will tend to use more gross output from other industries relative to its own output of goods. Based on this, an industry’s total industry output requirement (TIOR) is proposed as a metric for roundaboutness. Section 5 then reports stylized facts associated with the 2002 through 2009 cycle based on a ranking of industries by TIORs. Discussion of those stylized facts in relation to ABCT is the stuff of section 6. Section 7 then concludes.",

While both ‘calculate’ capital and income, their reckonings are sharply divergent. For the entrepreneur, the practical essence of economic calculation can be seen as the action of using market prices denominated in a common monetary unit to form quantitative judgments regarding the most profitable strategic exploitations of future market opportunities (Klein 2001, 9). Accuracy for the entrepreneur is revealed in the ex post profitability of chosen strategies. This view of accuracy defines the accountant’s calculational purpose within the enterprise. For the individual accountant, economic calculation refers to the use of existing or imputed market values of assets to assist the entrepreneur in assessing the success of currently pursued strategies (Taylor 1970, 237). Hence, accounting calculation is more focused on a type of accuracy that necessarily ignores the entrepreneur’s calculational anticipations of future enterprise capital and income. However, the paper also addresses another question: given these distinct calculational roles of the entrepreneur and the accountant, how well are external investors served by this retrospective accounting focus? Can accuracy in the accounting of enterprise capital and income serve the needs of both entrepreneurs and external investors? External investors may well need more than an accurate reckoning of the net market worth of the enterprise at a particular moment of reckoning. The investor may also require accurate information on the entrepreneur’s perspectives on the prospective success of enterprise strategies and the ways in which capital and income may be affected by decisions aimed at future success.Footnote 1 Traditional accounting reports may not fully serve that need. Some analysts have alleged that with respect to reporting, current accounting practices should be more attuned to the future oriented objectives of either entrepreneurs or investors (Coase 1973, 114: Niskanen 2005b, 50). This paper examines the accountant’s quest for documentable accuracy in calculating enterprise capital and income but also explores the extent to which this quest facilitates both the entrepreneur’s ex ante calculation and the needs of investors monitoring or contemplating of investment in the enterprise. Entrepreneurial strategy can be viewed as those coordinated efforts undertaken by an enterprise to ‘outdo’ competitive rivals in the quest for growth in profits (Schumpeter 1959 [1934], 81). These efforts are undertaken by an entrepreneurial enterprise with the intent of establishing profitable differences between itself and competing firms. For the individual enterprise, these undertakings frequently involve a deliberate break from the past and from the status quo within an industry (Schumpeter 1959 [1934], 81: Hayek 1949, 99–101). As such, entrepreneurial strategy may encompass choices of product, demographic-geographic markets, resources employed in production, organizational structure or even internal strategies implemented to more accurately assign overhead costs to more profitably serve differentiated customers.Footnote 2 But regardless of the form taken, the entrepreneur’s actions are always reflective of strategy to win a competitive rivalry for profits (Rumelt, et al. 1994) 9–47). In this inter-firm competition, entrepreneurial action is always experimental (Mathews 2006, 123: Yu 2005, 143). Should accounting more adequately reflect the investment worth of an entrepreneurial strategy? Should it be? Assume that accuracy is defined as a situation in which accounts do in fact reflect the investment worth of the enterprise. The equivalence would mean that the capitalized income-earning worth of the firm would be documented in the accountant’s calculation of what could be termed the enterprise’s ‘book value.’ Book value would be the total the money equivalent of all assets net of liabilities as dedicated at a definite date to the conduct of a definite business unit (Mises 1998 [1949], 500). What conditions must exist for accounting information on capital and income to actually reflect prospective investment worth? In taking this question at face value, some analysts have characterized such a standard of accuracy as being implicitly grounded in stationary-state or equilibrium assumptions (Edwards and Bell 1973 [1961], 6–7). In an equilibrium world, capital and income would tend to emerge largely as objectively measurable magnitudes routinely documentable by accountants. From this perspective, there would be no need to deal with any reconciliation accountant’s ex post measurements entrepreneur’s ex ante calculational judgments of capital and income since the problem would not exist. But should accuracy in accounting be gauged on a reconciliation of ex post and ex ante perspectives? In a changing, uncertain world, accounting information should provide a realistic framework for assessing the ‘success or failure’ of business strategies. From an ex post perspective, contemporary accounting actually serves this need. The ex post information can be critical to the entrepreneur’s ability to make decisions with respect to the direction of the enterprise’s activities (Edwards and Bell 1973 [1961], 66). In making chosen changes, entrepreneurs are necessarily able to gauge the success of previously envisioned profit opportunities in perhaps the planned introduction of new products or perhaps the development of new markets for existing products. Although entrepreneurs necessarily function in a speculative world in which anticipatory judgments are critical, accounting must provide entrepreneurs with the information required to assess the success of currently pursued strategic ventures. If the accountant is to complement to entrepreneur’s strategic aspirations, his calculational techniques must not replicate the entrepreneur’s subjective expectations of enterprise prospects. How well does the ex post focus of accounting procedure address the information needs of future oriented external investors? Business strategies are essentially intangibles, the investment worth of which can also somehow be ‘calculated’ in a manner that is also useful to investors (Litan and Wallison 2000, 27). Critics of accounting procedure contend that accountants should be able to provide investors with information that takes prudent account of enterprise prospects in pursuing certain entrepreneurial strategies.Footnote 3 The paper examines the extent to which the accountant’s calculation of capital and income should be redirected to serve this purpose. How do accounting regulations simultaneously address issues of ex post accuracy and the needs of investors for ex ante information? Part of the answer resides in the fact that the current regulatory environment has made accountants the agents of governmental intervention and control. Governmental regulation is presumably driven by principal-agent concerns focused on the general supposition that entrepreneurial enterprises are inclined to disseminate ‘inaccurate information.’ But does the principal-agent concern really warrant governmental regulation? Can the choice of accounting techniques be privatized in a way that would gives entrepreneurial enterprises more latitude in supplementing capital and income accounts with information on expectational prospects? If firms were able to choose their own accounting techniques, would private institutions provide the analysis necessary for investors to compare performance of competing enterprises? The paper also probes these latter issues.",2

Evans,Steven Horwitz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In their recent article in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, Bagus and Howden (2010) present “quibbles” with fractional-reserve free banking. Specifically, they raise what they call “unaddressed issues” in this system, with a particular emphasis on Selgin (1988). We deem their arguments to be more substantial than “quibbles” and instead as part of a longstanding debate about fundamental aspects of monetary theory. Unfortunately, their focus on Selgin’s book, canonical as it is, leads them to raise concerns that have been addressed in other, uncited by Bagus and Howden, contributions to the free banking literature. If the article was written as a book review, this might be excusable. However, creating the impression of a review of the whole literature and then limiting so much of their discussion to one text (even an admittedly seminal one) as a way to criticise that entire literature is a dereliction of their scholarly responsibilities. There are two aspects of the article that we welcome. We are encouraged that they are “abstaining from a discussion of legal and ethical issues” (p.30), because although these are important, they often distract from an understanding of the economic arguments. As Mises said, “such discussion…must proceed from a concept of money based, not on legal definitions and discriminations, but on the economic nature of things” (1912, p.67). It is also good that their work has been published in an academic journal, given that the quality of commentary on these issues tends to be low (mostly because in the Internet age, the costs of commentary are so low). If there is to be any constructive dialogue with regard to the fractional- vs. full-reserve free banking debate, it is most likely to take place as an academic conversation. With this in mind, we will specify at the outset that our intended audience is Bagus and Howden and those who agree with their conclusions. We do not intend to kick-start another round of debates with no hope for reconciliation and have taken the time to write this article as a genuine attempt to constructively engage. To this end, our reply will be split into four sections. Section 1 will list what we consider to be basic errors made by Bagus and Howden in their reading of the Selgin book and other sources. If our reading of these quotes is correct, we would expect Bagus and Howden to clarify or retract their claims about the authors being quoted. If the authors mean what they say, and our understanding is as we think, there is little chance of agreeing on more complex issues. Therefore, we wish to clarify the simple things first. In Section 2, we will respond to a number of assertions made about the free banking literature. As previously noted, we think that by attempting to limit their discussion to one text, Bagus and Howden give the impression of being reluctant to engage critically with their subject matter. We will not attempt a rebuttal of their claims; however, we will demonstrate that their claims are contested in the free banking literature. Since Bagus and Howden do not provide citations to these other works in the free banking literature, we will assume that they are not familiar with this evidence. Section 3 focuses on definitions and in particular the concepts of “inflation” and “savings”. It is not our aim to convince Bagus and Howden to accept our definitions; we merely attempt to get them to acknowledge that other scholars might be using these terms in ways different from their usage. We feel that their article would have been significantly more charitable had they resisted the temptation to impose their definitions when applying certain terms to the free banking literature. The result is that their arguments are often question begging as they assume away the very points in contention in the literature by not acknowledging alternative definitions. Section 4 responds to two specific examples that Bagus and Howden draw upon. We do not claim our responses will be completely satisfactory, and we hope that they will be able to clarify and expand upon their examples in response to our critique. Our goal is only to claim that as stated, their examples do not achieve their ends.",2

Fortunately in our own case, Selgin (2011) and Evans and Horwitz (2011) have enough differences between them that it is uncertain if they can reach agreement among themselves on the issues at stake even without our intervention. After all, the particular flavor of “free banking” that we found quibbles with should be identified before moving on. Selgin is bewildered that we would consider any literature other than his own; Evans and Horwitz cannot believe that we have not consulted the more fringe free banking material, in an appeal that we should have included everything ever written on the topic (while failing to do so themselves). Evans and Horwitz charge that we “impose” our own definitions to bolster our case, and wish to refrain from engaging debate over what definitions other economists use. They eventually recant, and fall back on the use of definitions (especially those used by others) throughout their paper (see especially their section 3: Agreeing on terms). They also think that our article does not warrant “serious academic attention”, while taking the time to write a response to it for a peer-reviewed academic journal and while knowing that there is already a response forthcoming from George Selgin. While Evans and Horwitz deem everyone to have found common ground (at the least) on what the proper definition of saving is, it is clear that they cannot even find agreement with Selgin on the matter. Selgin quite clearly regards saving as the act of holding cash; Evans and Horwitz claim that saving,Footnote 1 properly understood, implies non-consumption. The definitional difference is slight but essential. For one can consume a larger portion of his real income when he disinvests while simultaneously holding constant or even increasing his cash balance; cash balances do not have to mirror consumption patterns. (Our own definition of saving, incidentally, agrees with that of Evans and Horwitz.) Besides the quibbles that Selgin, Evans and Horwitz have between them that are largely of no concern to us, both papers in question take us to task for some of the things that we say. We address these points in Bagus and Howden (2011). This paper will largely focus on the things that these authors did not say—not said in the sense that they were the points of our original paper that have been avoided or evaded.",13
25.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,13 July 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-011-0160-6,On economists and garbagemen: Reflections on Šťastný (2010),June 2012,Dalibor Roháč,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In his book on the economics of the economic profession, Šťastný (2010) provides a valuable service not only to professional economists, but also to the broader public who ought to be aware of the incentive structure of economic research and therefore cautious of accepting the advice of expert economists. In his book, Šťastný makes two broad claims, or two series of claims. The first revolves around the disconnect that exists between economists’ policy prescriptions and reality. In spite of the consensual views of economists on subjects like trade protectionism, rent controls, or agricultural subsidies, these demonstrably harmful policies remain in place, and sometimes even enjoy popular support. Hence the frustration experienced by many economists who were lured into economics with the ambition of changing, reforming, and improving the world. The second series of claims tries to account for the peculiar interaction between the supply and demand for economic ideas. Šťastný claims that the growing irrelevance of economists in shaping public policy has led them to embark on less and less salient lines of inquiry and to indulge in solving obscure mathematical problems instead of addressing empirically relevant questions and being a significant voice in public debates. Worse yet, professional economists have abandoned their original vocation and, instead of speaking truth to the powerful, they have started to accommodate the politicians’ demand for a ‘scientific’ and ‘scholarly’ justification of their actions. As a result, Šťastný argues, economists have become less socially useful than garbagemen. Our ambition is not to denounce individual economists or economists as a group—and neither is that Šťastný’s ambition. What we wish to subject to critical scrutiny, however, are the incentives which exist within the profession and may lead to undesirable outcomes; perhaps without any particular scholar behaving in an ethically objectionable way.Footnote 1
 Needless to say, I have a lot of sympathy for the arguments made in the book and believe its thrust and its tone to be correct. Economics is broken and in many areas it has failed to advance our knowledge of the functioning of societies and of the economic order. Moreover, economics very often serves to give a scientific guise to ideological claims. In this article, I would like to elaborate on certain themes that strike me as complementary to Šťastný’s own work, and indeed to the earlier discussions of the subject that appear in Boettke (1996, 1997) or Strassmann (1994). First, I would like to discuss how the adoption of specific methodological techniques has affected the subject matter of economics, how it has reduced the transparency of scholarly work in the profession, and increased the opportunities for moral hazard. Second, I would like to suggest that modern economics, in spite of having developed a high-powered statistical apparatus, has not been very successful in discriminating between alternative—and mutually exclusive—hypotheses about human behaviour and economic order. I illustrate this rather strong claim on the example of modern macroeconomics where different, largely incompatible approaches towards explaining the behaviour of macroeconomic aggregates have co-existed side-by-side, without any of them being rejected as unsound. My reading of the book is necessarily informed by my own experience with academic economics. I was attracted by the economic science because it offered a way of understanding the social, political and economic changes that occurred in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of communism. I was curious to understand the failure of central planning, the coordinating capacities of markets, and the drivers of economic development and prosperity. Although I have received, in the course of studies and research, compelling answers to these—and other—questions, I must confess that I have found my life among academic economists rather underwhelming. A large portion of economic professionals spend their time addressing research questions that no one outside of academia cares about. Worse yet, in many cases, those questions bear very little relation to the real world. My decision not to pursue a doctorate in economics was based on my observation that graduate programmes tend to overly reward narrowly focused technical work regardless of its actual content, while discouraging broader, more ambitious attempts to explain some of the more salient social phenomena. There are very few economics departments in the world that would deviate from this emphatic focus on technique, mathematical competence, and rigour. Most departments therefore fail to encourage graduate students and faculty to explore themes not easily amenable to mathematical modelling. Paradoxically, from my perspective, the economists who resisted the creeping formalisation of the discipline were those who made the most interesting and the most compelling contributions towards my understanding of the economic and market order. My excitement about economics as a discipline was triggered by my early reading of Hayek, Mises and Rothbard. Little did I know how unrepresentative their writings were of the economic profession, which led to my later disappointment with the mainstream of the profession, both in terms of its lack of insights into how the economic order emerges and in terms of its focus on tedious, overly technical, and ultimately irrelevant questions. Another factor that has contributed to my slightly disappointing experience with academic economics has been its political and ideological drivers. My impression has been that a large part of applied economics reflects the ideological positions of the academics behind it. Very few people go into economics out of the sheer intellectual curiosity. More often than not, young economists want to grasp economics in order to give a more rigorous and scientific substantiation to their ideas about social order and the desirable political and institutional changes. Of course, those are at the same time the factors that make the economic science exciting and interesting to study. Unfortunately, economics does not encourage transparency in articulating the ethical and normative pre-suppositions that motivate economists. Since my early teenage years, I have identified myself as a libertarian and have been very transparent about my beliefs and the reasoning behind them. This led some to calling me an ideologue—a thing that rarely happens to mainstream economists, with the possible exception of the likes of Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz. Most economists tend to shy away from identifying themselves openly with set of normative or ethical principles. However, that does not mean that they are immune to ideological biases or to the use of implicit normative assumptions in their work. Very often, their analysis is underpinned by a variety of presumptions about the role and abilities of the government and about the role of economists themselves, which are rarely questioned or scrutinised in any meaningful way. The organisation of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the impact that the reliance of mathematical tools has had on the relevance of economics; Section 3 discusses the problems of transparency in econometrics; Section 4 looks at the case of macroeconomics as a discipline in which the use of advanced modelling techniques and statistical tools have not led to a systematic discarding of bad theories. Section 5 concludes.",

Leeson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A hallmark of the Austrian approach to economic science is its emphasis on individuals’ beliefs.Footnote 1 This emphasis derives from the importance the Austrian approach attaches to subjectivism. According to that approach, to understand observed patterns of human decision making and its results, you must understand the “meanings” humans attach to their actions and the problem situations they confront. Those meanings are beliefs.Footnote 2
 All beliefs are subjectively true: they’re true for the persons who hold them. But not all beliefs are the same. Some beliefs are “mere opinions.” They have no objective element to them. For example, I believe cigars are divine. This influences how I see the world, the people in it, and how I behave. But my belief is just my judgment. There’s nothing more to it than that. These beliefs are purely subjective.Footnote 3
 Other beliefs are understandings about the way the world works that have an objective element to them. Like mere opinions, these beliefs are subjectively true. But, objectively, they may be true or false. Science supports them or it does not.Footnote 4 For example, I believe that milk curdles because microorganisms in it convert lactose into lactic acid, “clotting” the milk. Other persons, certainly historically, and perhaps in some places still today, believe milk curdles because a witch has given it the “evil eye.” My belief is objectively true. The witch’s-eye belief is objectively false. Organic chemistry tells us as much. The objectively false beliefs that individuals hold are called superstitions. Superstitions influence how the persons who hold them see the world, the people in it, and how they behave as strongly as mere opinions and objectively true beliefs do. In influencing these things, like other kinds of beliefs, superstitions may also influence institutions.Footnote 5
 To the extent that scholarship in law and economics treats individuals’ beliefs at all, most of this scholarship proceeds as though individuals’ beliefs were either the opinion kind or the objectively true kind. Law and economics has largely ignored superstition. One of this paper’s purposes is to help remedy that. Contrary to what I suspect is most readers’ intuition, my argument is that some objectively false beliefs improve social cooperation and productivity. They make their holders’ societies better off. This isn’t true of all superstitions, of course. But it’s true of many of them, including some of the superstitions that seem the most ridiculous on their surface. Critically for law and economics, many socially productive superstitions produce their desirable effects by influencing or “working through” the legal system—the law and the institutions of its enforcement.Footnote 6
 This paper’s other purpose is to discuss what the components of an “Austrian” law and economics might consist of. Given the importance that the Austrian approach to economic science assigns to individuals’ beliefs, such a law and economics would necessarily assign beliefs a central place in its study. Further, given that many beliefs influence the legal system, such a law and economics would also seek to analyze the endogenous emergence of legal institutions in light of those beliefs, as well as the endogenous emergence of beliefs in light of legal institutions. My argument is that Ronald Coase’s conception of law and economics precludes such analysis. In contrast, Richard Posner’s facilitates it. An Austrian law and economics can’t be built on Coasean foundations. But it can and should be built on Posnerian ones.",21
25.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,29 June 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-011-0159-z,Time for behavioral political economy? An analysis of articles in behavioral economics,September 2012,Niclas Berggren,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recently, and especially since the publication of Nudge (Thaler and Sunstein 2009), a public debate about paternalism has emerged. By “paternalism” is meant conscious attempts to alter the “choice architecture” that people face with the purpose of helping them make better decisions, as judged by themselves or others.Footnote 1 One basis for the discussion is research findings in behavioral economics that make clear that economic decision-makers are often far removed from the rational homo economicus. They are rather characterized by cognitive limitations and biases, and they are affected or afflicted by such things as imperfect self-control, framing effects, loss aversion, endowment effects, choice bracketing, information and choice overload and a poor grasp of probability calculations.Footnote 2 Although this insight is not new—Ashraf et al. (2005) trace it back to Smith (1759), and Simon (1955) stressed the bounded nature of rationality early on—it has now been documented thoroughly through experimental research.Footnote 3
 Here, we ask how paternalism on grounds such as these is treated in the scientific literature. More precisely, we present the results of a systematic analysis of all articles in behavioral economics dealing with limited rationality (in a wide sense) in the ten leading economics journals in the past ten years. The study has two main purposes. The first is to document the prevalence of policy recommendations of a paternalist kind in leading research in behavioral economics. To what extent do researchers draw normative conclusions from the insight that economic actors often behave irrationally?Footnote 4
The second is to investigate to what extent those behavioral economists that do offer policy recommendations analyze policymakers in the same way as they analyze economic decision-makers. Are the former also seen as suffering from cognitive imperfections and irrationality, or is it simply assumed that they are without such problems? To the extent that researchers do not apply assumptions about cognitive limitations and biases to policymakers, or motivate why such assumptions are superfluous, it could be argued that policy recommendations are based on an incomplete analysis. If policymakers are irrational just like others, the chances of success for the paternalist project can be put into question. The main results are that 20.7% of leading articles in behavioral economics contain some kind of paternalist policy recommendation and that 95.5% of these (64 out of 67) do not contain any analysis at all of the potential problems with cognitive limitations and biases of policymakers. This, we suggest, is a finding of a methodological inconsistency that makes the policy recommendations less credible. The present study has been inspired by the way in which public choice scholarship emerged. One important feature of that emergence was a critique of an asymmetry in much economic research at the time with regard to assumptions about the motivation of economic and political actors. Economic actors were assumed to be self-interested, whereas political actors were assumed (usually implicitly) to maximize a social-welfare function rather than their own utility functions. Hence, policy recommendations could proceed on the assumption that whatever welfare-improving advice was given to policymakers, they would want to implement it. Contra this, Buchanan (1949), Buchanan and Tullock (1962) and Brennan and Buchanan (1984, 1985) have played an especially important role in (re-)introducing a political economy approach into economics. Brennan and Buchanan (1985: 50) write: The symmetry argument suggests only that whatever model of behavior is used, that model should be applied across all institutions. The argument insists that it is illegitimate to restrict Homo economicus to the domain of market behavior while employing widely different models of behavior in nonmarket settings, without any coherent explanation of how such a behavioral shift comes about. One effect of the public choice argumentation has been the now widespread recognition that before policy advice is proffered, a comparative institutional analysis, of both market and government failures, needs to be undertaken.Footnote 5 As the present investigation demonstrates, such comparative analysis is largely missing in the realm of behavioral economics when policy recommendations are presented. This may be seen as unsatisfactory. We think, first of all, that policymakers should be explicitly analyzed in studies of this kind; second, that the default approach should be to apply symmetric assumptions about rationality and cognitive ability to economic and political decision-makersFootnote 6; and third, that asymmetric assumptions are fine if they are explicitly motivated. As Buchanan (1984: 13–14) puts it: [T]he burden of proof should rest with those who suggest wholly different models of man apply in the political and economic realms of behavior. Thus, when a coherent explanation for asymmetry can be given, asymmetry is in general not a problem. The argument of this study is not, then, that paternalism is unwarranted—only that a thorough and complete positive analysis, which takes seriously the use of realistic assumptions for both market and government, should precede and inform (and sometimes put to a halt) policy recommendations of a paternalist kind. This argument can be related to the concept of robust political economy, by which is meant that in analyzing systems, institutions or policies, such as paternalism, their functionality and desirability should be investigated by subjecting them to “worst-case” assumptions for the relevant actors with regard to their motivation and cognitive ability (Boettke and Leeson 2004; Leeson and Subrick 2006). In part, this approach is inspired by scholars in the Austrian tradition, who stress the cognitive limitations of man, including policymakers.Footnote 7 One can mention Hayek’s (1937, 1945) analysis of how knowledge can be generated and used successfully, as well the argument by von Mises (1966: 696), on whether welfare-enhancing central planning is possible: In terming the director society (as the Marxians do), state (with a capital S), government, or authority, people tend to forget that the director is always a human being, not an abstract notion or a mythical collective entity. We may admit that the director or the board of directors are people of superior ability, wise and full of good intentions. But it would be nothing short of idiocy to assume that they are omniscient and infallible. The argument does not (unlike the public choice approach) question the motivation of these directors but puts into question whether they possess sufficient knowledge to carry out their task. While the focus of Hayek and von Mises is more on the issue of central planning than on paternalism, Holcombe (2009: 311) sees a clear connection: Austrian economics rests on behavioral foundations that are not inconsistent with these behavioral “anomalies.” One contribution of the Austrians is that they apply their insights about imperfect decision-making also to the political realm. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section offers a brief sketch of the current debate on paternalism. Then, we describe the data and method used in this study in more detail, and the empirical findings are presented. Lastly, concluding remarks are given.",38

Luther,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Great Recession seems to be creating a change in the trend of macroeconomic thinking. Prior to the financial crisis of 2008, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models dominated the macroeconomics literature without any apparent challengers on the horizon. Since then, however, we have seen an increasing interest in macroeconomic models that address the state of confidence (“animal spirits”), complexity, cognition, and radical uncertainty. The most salient example of this new trend may be Akerlof and Shiller’s 2009 book, Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why it Matters for Global Capitalism. The trend seems to be present in the journal and working paper literature too, however, as illustrated by Kirman (2009), Taylor (2009), Caballero (2010), De Grauwe (2010), and Hall (2010). Koppl and Luther (2010) provide a review. The recent change in the trend of macroeconomic thinking is auspicious for Austrian economics. Koppl (2006) argued that the trend of economic thinking has gone in an Austrian direction, providing an opportunity for Austrians to reenter the mainstream. His argument may not have seemed applicable to macroeconomics, which has been mostly unaffected by the trends noted therein. The intellectual fallout from the Great Recession, however, may be bringing those trends to macroeconomics as well. If so, Austrian approaches to macroeconomics along these lines are more likely to resonate with mainstream economists than in years past, at least if Austrian economists are willing to address mainstream economists by engaging their literature in ways readily understandable to the mainstream. Most of the renewed interest in animal spirits, complexity, cognition, and radical uncertainty has come from a more or less “Keynesian” perspective and might alternatively be described as the “return of interventionism.” We note that rejecting the stale theoretical approach of the last few decades could just as well coincide with a greater appreciation of capitalism in general and the market process in particular. Caballero (2010) illustrates the potential to emphasize animal spirits, complexity, cognition, and radical uncertainty from a more “Hayekian” perspective. Indeed, we believe that we may be seeing the revival of old disputes between Keynesian and Hayekian perspectives in macroeconomics. Whether (and to what extent) self-consciously “Austrian” economists will contribute, should these disputes reemerge, may depend on whether they prove themselves able to enter the conversation in a constructive and understandable way.",17

(Blankart and Fasten (2008) discuss some specific examples of this.) That decentralization has increased the extent to which there is competition in the provision of those public services. While much has been written in the economics literature about how interjurisdictional competition may serve as a restraint on the monopoly powers of local Leviathan (e.g., Brennan and Buchanan 1977, 1980) and how it may lead to the production of efficient quantities of local public goods (e.g., Tiebout 1956), other potential virtues of competition in the market for local collective goods have been largely ignored.Footnote 1 In fact, in the political science literature, the predominant view has been that consolidated (and thus monopolistic) local government is the preferred arrangement.Footnote 2 Boettke et al. (2012) provide an excellent summary of this “neoconsolidationist” critique (as well as suggested responses from economists). I argue, to the contrary, that in metropolitan areas with greater levels of interjurisdictional competition, the market for local collective goods should be characterized by: 1) the presence of more efficient methods of production, and 2) the availability of a greater variety of tax/service bundles.Footnote 3
 In addition, the application of the unique insights of Austrian economics show that the underlying theoretical foundations of the Tiebout (1956) model, upon which much of the literature in this area is based, are fundamentally flawed. The problem is that Tiebout relies on the standard neoclassical static equilibrium approach. The dynamic equilibrium approach taken by Austrian economics is a more realistic way to model the process. Section 2 summarizes the empirical literature on the impact of interjurisdictional competition. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the two ignored virtues of competition. Section 5 discusses the superiority of the Austrian view to the neoclassical view. Concluding remarks are contained in Section 6.",3
25.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,20 July 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-011-0162-4,Did Hayek have a monetary theory of business cycles?,September 2012,Gerald Patrick O’Driscoll Jr,Douglas B. Rasmussen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The primary reference for the debate is Hayek (1966a), Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle, a 1933 English translation and enlargement of a 1928 German paper, Geldtheorie und Konjunkturtheorie. It is notably not titled A Monetary Theory of the Trade Cycle. Hayek did not profess to be presenting an explicit theory. Rather he wished to accomplish two main tasks: (1) to establish the necessity of a monetary explanation of economic fluctuations; and (2) to outline the kind of monetary theory needed (Hayek 1966a: 46–48). First, Hayek (1966a: 54) presented the then agreed-upon facts to be explained: “the emergence of a disproportionality among the various productive groups, and in particular the excessive production of capital goods, as the first and main thing to be explained.” Next he identified the main theory-problem to be addressed: why does the economy not adjust smoothly to shocks and why does the economy move away from equilibrium? (Hayek 1966a: 55). Hayek elaborated at length on the problem of disequilibrium. Only a failure in the pricing process can lead to systematic misallocation of resources. Some factor must be identified that disturbs the pricing process (Hayek 1966a: 84–85). Hayek (1966a: 86) sought a discordant factor that can “dissolve the fundamental equilibrium relationships which form the basis of all economic explanation.” He identified that factor as an elastic supply of credit (money), which allows movements leading away from, not toward equilibrium (Hayek 1966a: 86–87). Hayek’s equilibrium concept was that of plan compatibility (Hayek 1948a). His cycle theory focused on how the plans of savers and investors could become incompatible. The elasticity of credit allows investors to plan as if there had been an increased supply of saving. In reality, there has been no increase in savings and their plans will be frustrated. A system of elastic money or credit is a disturbing element in the closed system of general equilibrium theory. “Prices become possible which do not operate according to the self-regulating principles of the economic system described by static theory.” An elastic supply of credit disables the “interest brake” that would forestall the trade cycle as defined above (“the excessive production of capital goods”). Say’s law is vitiated in a money economy. A “money economy” is defined as one with a variable money supply (Hayek 1966a: 94; 101; 128). Hayek does not simply argue that money disturbs the equilibrating forces of the price system, but money is the only factor that can systematically do so. Mistakes are made, but money alone can move an economy away from equilibrium by introducing a source of nominal demand not corresponding to an additional supply of real goods. Changes in the volume of money (MV) break the “rigid reaction mechanism” of the closed system of static theory (Hayek 1966a: 108). Much later, Hayek would describe money as the “loose joint” in an economy (Hayek 1960: 325). It is worth noting that Hayek’s statement of the problem was surprisingly modern. His insistence on equilibrium reasoning resonates in rational expectations theory. And his disequilibrium analysis can be viewed as anticipating multiple equilibrium. (He writes of “a range of indeterminateness”). It is not just, then, that Hayek offered a monetary explanation for cycles. He endeavored to show the impossibility of a non-monetary explanation. Any proffered non-monetary disturbance would set in motion equilibrating forces and establish a new equilibrium. He argued the latter point ad nauseam.
 How could anyone possibly describe Hayek’s theory as non-monetary?",4
25.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,07 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-012-0184-6,Monetary equilibrium and price stickiness reconsidered: A reply to Bagus and Howden,September 2012,William J. Luther,Alexander W. Salter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Bagus and Howden (2011: 384–386) offer a confused account of the role sticky prices play in macroeconomic theory. They suppose sticky prices result in a “sluggish” response to exogenous shocks. They believe others find a potentially beneficial role for altering the supply of money because “the price level cannot adjust instantaneously (emphasis added)”—that is, because the market for “money is hampered from instantaneously clearing (emphasis added).” Their error, we believe, stems from focusing on the speed of adjustment rather than the cost of adjustment. Although the speed of adjustment may affect the cost of adjustment, it is the latter which ultimately provides a potentially beneficial role for altering the supply of money. As a result of misunderstanding this fundamental point, they pay undue attention to sticky prices. Most macroeconomists typically hold that exchange frictions (e.g., Mankiw 1985) or epistemic frictions (e.g., Lucas 1972; Mankiw and Reis 2002) cause some prices to adjust with a significant lag. Sticky prices (or sticky information) give rise to an upward sloping short run aggregate supply curve. As a result, negative (positive) monetary shocks produce short run decreases (increases) in output. In the long run, when prices adjust completely, output is restored to its natural level. Despite their confused account, Bagus and Howden (2011, p. 394) correctly note that changes in output following monetary shocks need not imply a welfare-enhancing role for a flexible money supply. If it is significantly costly to change prices immediately, for example, allowing quantity adjustments in the short run might be the preferred alternative. “Value-free economics,” Bagus and Howden (2011, p. 395) contend, “cannot deem preferred idleness as suboptimal because output falls.” They claim preferred idleness of resources is analogous to a worker who decides to increase his leisure: output falls, but welfare increases. According to Bagus and Howden (2011, pp. 393–395), the observed fluctuation in output is merely the optimal response path to an exogenous shock. “As long as this adjustment lag is not caused by interventions to the pricing process,” Bagus and Howden (2011, p. 395) maintain, “there is no significant issue at stake.” It is worth clarifying that their view does not necessarily imply individuals, on average, are no better or worse (1) following the shock or (2) under an alternative set of institutions.Footnote 2 The response is optimal, given the shock and the institutional framework within which the individuals are operating. Although it is outside of their control, individuals, on average, may prefer that the shock had never occurred. Similarly, acknowledging that individuals respond appropriately within a given institutional framework does not imply that one set of institutions is just as good as another. In what follows, we engage in comparative institutional analysis to consider the conditions that would make a flexible money supply desirable. Consider two regimes that are similar in all respects except one. Under the first regime, prices adjust in response to changes in the demand to hold money. Under the second regime, changes in the demand to hold money are offset by changes in the supply of money. At this point, we do not specify the mechanism by which the supply of money is governed in either regime (e.g., profit maximizing mints under a 100% reserve commodity standard, monetary policy by a central bank, profit maximizing note issuers under free banking, etc.) As should soon be clear, this is not intended to suggest that all regimes of the same type are equally desirable. We do not believe this is the case. Some mechanisms may respond more quickly (or at a lower cost) than others of the same type. We make the general case to facilitate discussion of particular systems later in the text. In order to show that the case for a flexible money supply does not depend on sticky prices and to keep the analysis as simple as possible, we first consider the case where all prices are perfectly flexible. Under the first regime, an exogenous increase in the demand to hold money causes prices to fall from P

1
 to P

2
. As Bagus and Howden (2011, p. 394) acknowledge, there is some cost c

p
 associated with changing prices. Whether these costs arise from physically changing the prices listed on menus, the time spent devising daily specials, or some other source is irrelevant. We need only acknowledge that the adjustment is costly. Under the second regime, an exogenous increase in the demand to hold money is immediately offset by an increase in the supply of money. Hence, prices persist at P

1
. It is worth noting that the increase in the money supply does not remedy the situation by “making the ‘stuck’ prices ‘unstuck,’” as Bagus and Howden (2011, p. 397) erroneously claim.Footnote 3 Rather, it restores aggregate demand to its original state (before the increase in money demand) such that the original constellation of prices continues to reflect relative scarcities.Footnote 4 Of course, we do not assume adjusting the money supply is a costless solution. There is, at a minimum, the cost of printing notes or making entries into electronic accounts. We should also include any costs of deliberation as to the size and timing of the increase in money. We denote the sum of all of these costs as c

m
. Bagus and Howden (2011, p. 386) see no reason to prefer one constellation of prices to another.Footnote 5 While we agree that two price levels (i.e., two arrays of relative prices which differ only in their nominal magnitude) are equally capable of conveying the relative scarcity of goods in the real economy, it does not follow that there is no reason to prefer one price level to another. In the above example, one should prefer maintaining P

 by increasing the money supply whenever c

p
 > c

m
. Similarly, one should prefer allowing the price level to adjust from P

1
 to P

2
 whenever c

m
 > c

p
. In other words, if both price levels are equally desirable in terms of reflecting relative scarcities, one should maintain the original constellation of prices whenever it is less costly than allowing prices to adjust.Footnote 6 Recall that this view in no way depends on the existence of sticky prices. Allowing for short run price stickiness and the corresponding fluctuation in output does little to alter the analysis. Under the first regime, c

p
 increases to c

p′
 when there are sticky prices in order to reflect the (potentially greater) cost of allowing prices to adjust downward and any social losses from idle resources.Footnote 7 We might also amend our original view to account for the lag in monetary supply changes. Accounting for the costs incurred adjusting (and readjusting) flexible prices and any social losses resulting from deviations in output during the process of restoring the original price level increases the cost of monetary expansion from c

m
 to c

m′
.Footnote 8 Although accounting for these complexities may disproportionately change the costs of adjustment under the two regimes and, hence, one’s view on the relative desirability of a particular regime, their inclusion does not change the central question to be answered. Since both price levels are equally capable of conveying the relative scarcity of goods in the real economy, one should prefer the least costly alternative. We will be the first to admit that the above analysis is simplified, as abstract considerations of a problem always are. Nonetheless, we maintain that it provides a useful framework for viewing the particular costs arising under various regimes. Having made a general case that a flexible money supply is potentially desirable, we now turn to specific criticisms the authors raise concerning the costs of flexibility from increases in fiduciary media.",5

They claim that a monetary expansion restores aggregate demand to its original (pre-monetary expansion) level and that the original array of prices continues to reflect relative scarcity. To this we are in half agreement—nominal spending can be supported by an increase in the money supply. The question of whether prices will still reflect relative scarcity deserves further attention. The question on the eve of the bust is not one of all prices being too high, or the general price level being set too low. It is a question of some prices being misaligned with others. Artificially increasing the quantity of money cannot be assured to align these discoordinated prices with those necessary for equilibration. An increase in the economy’s common denominator—money—does not increase all prices equally nor does it necessarily leave intact signals of relative scarcity. This is because, as the authors well note, Cantillon effects prohibit a return to the original price array. These Cantillon effects exist for several reasons. First, the physical process through which spending takes place implies that preferences and scarcities will have changed by the time the money arrives to the disequilibrated prices. Differing demand elasticities will incite distinct quantity responses to the increase in nominal wealth via an increased money supply, even if this money supply is distributed evenly, either in absolute or proportional terms (von Mises 1928: 100–103; 1949: 413, 416, and passim). Second, there are epistemic reasons to doubt that the array of prices will return to its original state (Howden 2010). As new money must enter the economy at some definite point, knowledge of this money’s origin and the sustainability of its results will continually erode as it works its way through the system.Footnote 2
 To use preferred terminology, we can restate Cantillon effects as money’s property of non-neutrality. Yet there are two definitions of non-neutrality, one to which we subscribe (the narrow definition), and the other which Luther and Salter follow (the broad definition). In our account, money is non-neutral if supply-side changes to its purchasing power alter the existing array of prices. Alternatively, one can think of money as non-neutral if increases in its quantity have an effect on real output. This latter view is consistent with the New Keynesian consensus that Luther and Salter provide to the reader. Almost no economist today doubts the latter definition of non-neutrality, and yet there are important reasons to agree with the former. That money is non-neutral in the narrow sense is something that readers of this journal will understand well—it is, after all, one base explanation for the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle. Under the Austrian view, the supply and demand for money has no systematic effect on aggregate growth in an economy—money-side changes affect the structure though not the level of production. If money were neutral in the broad sense, any increase or decrease in its supply could not cause either malinvestment or over-consumption. No discoordination could occur if all prices changed by either: 1) the same proportion, or 2) some differing proportions, but still maintained their signals of relative scarcity.Footnote 3
 If prices were fully flexible, no disequilibration would occur. Increasing the money supply in light of any supposed stickiness incentivizes individuals to not reduce important prices—wages and other input factor prices, for example. The goal of fostering an environment where prices are as flexible as possible negates the need for any changes in the money supply, or an institution to do so.Footnote 4 As a simple equality, no one doubts that any level of nominal spending can be targeted or maintained through changes to the money supply. What we are concerned with are changes to the goods side. What benefit does it serve to target a previous full-employment level of output if the future growth path of real income suffers as a result? Pursuing a policy that sets in motion an Austrian Business Cycle—such as distorting relative prices or altering the loan interest rate by expanding the money supply—will solve one superficial yet immediate problem (a decline in nominal income), yet exacerbate a future problem (either lengthen the recession, or reduce the future growth path of real income).",6

Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ludwig Lachmann (1976) uses kaleidics to connect Ludwig von Mises and George Shackle while arguing that Shackle extended Mises’s insights in three directions: (1) extending subjectivism to expectations, (2) treating choice as an act of imagination as a consequence of treating time substantively and not just notionally, and (3) recognizing that markets, especially asset markets, reflect a divergence and not a commonality of expectations, thereby abandoning any presumption that the market process tends in the limit to some state of general equilibrium. In concluding, Lachmann (p. 61) opined that kaleidics “is thus not the natural habitat of Austrian economics, but the alien soil may prove nourishing.” While I agree about the nourishing quality of the kaleidic soil, I also think that kaleidics is the natural habitat of Austrian economics. Following Wagner (2010), economic theory can be formulated within a kaleidic-Mengerian frame of reference as well as an equilibrium-Walrasian frame of reference. In advancing the claim that kaleidics is the natural habitat of our tradition, I would enlist Sandye Gloria-Palermo’s (1999) examination of the Austrian tradition from Menger to Lachmann in my support in lieu of an extended discussion of our tradition to economize on the limited space I have for this presentation. I should also mention that many notable Austrians regard the Shackle-Lachmann influence as an alien injection into our tradition, one that offers not nourishing soil but corruption of hard-gained truths. These critics of kaleidics do not voice foolish objections. Their objections reflect the belief that the kaleidic vision is contrary to the Austrian effort to uncover and articulate objective claims about reality. Analytical nihilism, where analysts are free to see what they choose to see, would replace the hard-earned Austrian effort to uncover objective truths about a societal reality that we all experience. In this respect, Murray Rothbard (1990) speaks of the “Hermeneutical Invasion of Philosophy and Economics.” And in his treatment of what he regards as Lachmann’s nihilism, Joseph Salerno (2002) reports that Rothbard referred to “Lachmannia” as a disease that has been infecting some Austrian seminar rooms. In a similar vein, Leland Yeager (1997) counsels Austrian theorists not to be scornful of theories of general equilibrium.Footnote 1
 Analytical nihilism and analytical solipsism are certainly contrary to the Austrian tradition, for the participants in that tradition have always sought to uncover features of the societal reality that is common to all of us. Yet that reality is not an object that is directly accessible to an analytical observer. We can observe directly both rainbow trout and the insects that fly near water. Having done that, we can theorize about how the insect’s appearance when it approaches water inspires the trout to bite. In light of that knowledge, we might try to design artificial insects with hooks. However we might go about doing this, our object of theoretical interest is available for our direct examination. The situation is different for much of the material of the social sciences. An economy, for instance, is not directly apprehensible, but is apprehensible only in light of some prior act of theorization. Equilibrium-based theories take a different tack to the construction of those objects of theoretical interest than do kaleidic-based theories, but both sets of theories seek to create knowledge that is independent of the theorist. While Menger rejected Walras’s claim that both of them were working to advance the same conceptual framework, the Walrasian idea of an orderly system of relationships has pervaded the corpus of Austrian theorizing. Ludwig von Mises’s (1966) formulation of an evenly rotating economy gives recognition to this systemic quality. Friedrich Hayek’s (1932) treatment of the business cycle as departing from a position of Walrasian equilibrium is a similar effort. Neither theorist was working with the Walrasian apparatus, but both used that apparatus as a stalking horse to advance their arguments. In doing this, they sought to use their theoretical formulations to illuminate features of reality that they recognized as existing independently of their theoretical efforts. Kaleidics apparently seems to the critics to eliminate the prospect of advancing claims about an objective reality, and to replace those claims with statements that are the private property of the observer. In the presence of kaleidics and its replacement of knowledge with unknowledge, the objective quality of reality would seem to vanish into that fog of unknowledge. The future becomes akin to one of those ink-blot patterns that psychologists use to elicit responses from subjects. In this setting, there is no right or wrong answer about what the ink-blot represents, for the examiner simply wants to know what comes to the subject’s mind upon seeing the ink-blot. Theorizing within a kaleidic framework, however, is not to deny the objective quality of reality; it is rather an effort to explain significant aspects of that realty. The analyzing subject is not offering reactions to ink-blots but is uncovering something real about those ink-blots. In undertaking this uncovering, Viennese kaleidics offers a path to penetrate more deeply into that reality.Footnote 2
 To achieve that penetration, however, requires a theoretical framework suitable for the task. The Walrasian framework reduces society to a snapshot and asks the theorist to give an account of the picture, and with comparative statics used to account for changes observed over a sequence of pictures. The evenly rotating economy replaces the snapshot with a film that continually repeats itself. Viennese kaleidics likewise employs the image of the film, only that film shows a continuing parade of novelty along with the continuation of a good deal of familiarity. It is this conjunction of familiarity and novelty that comprises the objective reality that Viennese kaleidics seeks to penetrate. For this penetration to be achieved, however, some shift in the variables of analytical interest is necessary. For Walrasian-based formulations of societal equilibrium, the variables of interest must be resource allocations, for there isn’t anything else that can be of interest when time is eliminated as a substantive feature of the analytical effort, as O’Driscoll and Rizzo (1985) explain. For Viennese kaleidics, however, time is treated substantively, which means in turn that experimentation and novelty continually enter society. Kaleidic turbulence is a feature of society, though so also is a good deal of familiarity, as Koppl (2001) explains in his effort to inject both novelty and typicality into choice. A kaleidic society generates debris due to the collision among plans that has no place in the Walrasian framework. Hence, Viennese kaleidics opens into questions concerning how people deal with that debris, which brings to the foreground questions concerning the governance of human relationships and interactions, pushing into the analytical background questions concerning the allocation of resources because allocations emerge out of patterns of governance. Related to this reversal of foreground and background is recognition that the subject matter of economics is more suitable for plausible than for demonstrative reasoning, with this distinction being articulated mathematically by Polya (1954) and economically by Clower (1994, 1995). By its very nature in treating time substantively, kaleidics cannot be pursued to demonstrate societal equilibrium. Likewise, any demonstration of societal equilibrium must neuter the passing of time that is central to the Austrian orientation. Viennese kaleidics operates within the framework of plausible reasoning, which is an open and not a closed system of thought; therefore, it cannot lead to statements that must be accepted of demonstrable necessity within the context of the framing axioms. With respect to plausibility, we can see from observation that societies are both orderly and turbulent, and with the mix between orderliness and turbulence varying through time. It is a reasonable theoretical aim to seek to explain historical variability in the mix of orderliness and turbulence, provided, however, that the theoretical framework is able to give space to both. An equilibrium framework cannot do that. Rather, a kaleidic framework is required, but not just any kaleidic framework.",49

After reading the title of this article, one can probably guess the answer is Murray Rothbard but given that his views were so far outside the mainstream it is difficult not to be taken aback by his publication record. Murray Rothbard rejected many beliefs held by the vast majority of economists. Murray Rothbard was also an anarchist whose political beliefs put him way outside the mainstream. Nevertheless, he published numerous articles on economic theory, economic history, and political economy in mainstream outlets while never shying away from producing work with radical normative implications. Analyzing Rothbard is an interesting case study to see how someone with such non-mainstream views can have influence in and outside of the economics profession. Rothbard (1993, p. 208) wrote, “Civilization and human existence are at stake, and to preserve and expand it, high theory and scholarship, though important, are not enough…Especially in an age of galloping statism, the classical liberal, the advocate of the free market, has an obligation to carry the struggle to all levels of society.” Rothbard’s writings for professional journals in the 1950s are some of the most radically and explicitly Austrian that those journals probably ever published. The sum of economics books is weighty and none shied away from bold claims. And his political philosophy advances the most non-mainstream claim of them all: there is no economic justification for government. Regardless of whether one agrees with him, one cannot deny how much he was active in the popular press, how he undertook major scholarly research projects that became books, and how he published in mainstream professional journals without abandoning or watering down his views. The remainder of this article documents how Rothbard was able to get mainstream attention for his radical ideas.",3

A classical liberal is confronted by a major puzzle: If freedom is always and everywhere welfare improving, both as a possible argument in the utility functions (after wealth) and through its positive influence on prosperity and economic well-being, why has its adoption come so late and only in a minority of countries? Late indeed in world history since, as noted by Tullock (1987, p.175), “In current usage ‘democracy’ is normally confined to systems where all adults are permitted to vote. Historically, this situation was almost unknown before the 20th century” and by Wintrobe (1998, p. 6), “most of the world for most of human history has lived under dictatorship.” Among the small number of nations that adopted a democratic constitution in the modern era (starting with the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century), a general regression of freedom began well before 1914, accelerated during the 1920s and 1930s and recovered only slightly during the forties, fifties and sixties. A low level of freedom thus lasted until the last quarter of the 20th century.Footnote 2 What are the determinants of these general waves of freedom, then of ‘unfreedom’, and then of freedom again? Figure 1, which is based on data from FreedomHouse.org, provides insights into the contemporary expansion of freedom around the world. The Contemporary Freedom Wave. In the past, determinants of democracy and determinants of economic freedoms have been analyzed separately, but this distinction runs contrary to the trend toward a unification of economic analysis and other fields in the social sciences: In the Public Choice tradition (The Calculus of Consent, Buchanan and Tullock 1962) as well as in the Chicago school of political economy (Stigler, Becker’s “Competition and Democracy” (1958), and then in his 1983 paper), there is only one model of man.Footnote 3 The “homo economicus” maximizes his utility whether in economic and/or in political pursuits, and this view has gained acceptance, beyond the traditional field of economics, especially in political science. Hence it is rather strange that the two strands of literature, the one that explains democracy and political freedoms, and the one that explains economic freedoms, are quite separate and often refer to different determinants. Finally, none of these theories has been built on the basis of the economic theory of rights, pioneered by Demsetz (1967), despite the fact that these various forms of freedom are basically individual rights (see below Section 3). Our solution to these problems is to focus our analysis on general trends of various types of freedom in the modern (post 1750) era, when freedoms first became a significant phenomenon in western societies, whereas other scholars have been concentrating on specific factors explaining inter-country differences. Our theory relies on a general definition of freedoms as rights, whether economic or political (since they are rather highly correlatedFootnote 4). Thus the problem is best understood as one pertaining to the economics of rights. We start with a basic definition of freedoms as rights, and proceed with the use of the economic theory of rights first developed as a theory of property rights. We go on investigating the conditions leading to the decentralization of production. Coase (1937) provided the basic framework by modelling the choice between production through market exchanges and that by (hierarchical) firms, or in other terms, the choice between production through the decentralized price system and production by the internal command system. Accordingly, we argue that political and economic freedoms are derived from, because complementary to, the downsizing of many hierarchical organizations, “economic” (corporations) as well as “political” (public administrations and States). Our approach has the major advantage of not basing the evolution of freedoms on the weak foundation of unstable individual preferences that are supposed to evolve as a result of persuasion, imitation, ideology, and the battle of normative ideas. As in economics generally, we explain individual and collective choices and their evolution by the conditions of the environment, notably prices and costs, rather than by changes in preferences. We present a model explaining not only the simultaneous evolution of various kinds of freedoms but also the new diffusion of freedoms at the end of the twentieth century, contrasting this diffusion with the relative absence of freedoms during the period spanning 1875 to 1975. The fact that, during recent times, this movement has been both broadly based and simultaneous throughout the world confirms our belief that there may be an underlying common factor at work, since the probability of having several independent factors all moving in the same direction during the same time period across most of the countries of the world is remote. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces and evaluates the various explanations for democracy, civil liberties and economic freedom. Section 3 discusses our analysis of freedom as rights, based on the role of information and organization, and its relation to country-specific effects of the analyses surveyed in section 2. Section 4 summarizes our findings.",

Thus Posnerian foundations “might be problematic for an Austrian approach to law and economics” (Marciano 2012). In this reply I argue that the differences between Posner and Austrians that Marciano uses as the basis for his contention are normative.

Harper,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Upon its release, The Economics of Time and Ignorance by Jerry O’ Driscoll and Mario Rizzo (1985, 1996) elicited both brickbats and bouquets. Israel Kirzner ([1985]1994) described it as a “courageous, and in many respects brilliant attempt” to re-examine the foundations of Austrian economics (p. 38) which nevertheless suffered from “serious weaknesses” (p. 39) because it failed to appreciate fully “the subtlety and power of the conventional Austrian position” (p. 44).Footnote 1 Reactions outside the Austrian camp were also sometimes quite hostile—the authors’ attempts to reach out and find common ground with Post Keynesians were flatly rebuffed by a leading proponent of that approach (Davidson 1989).Footnote 2 On the other hand, Bruce Caldwell (1986) and Kenneth Boulding (1987) both praised the book, the former recommending it as “the sort of book that every economist should read” and the latter believing that the questions it asks are “relevant for all the social sciences”. In a similar vein, Lachmann ([1985]1994) saw it as encouraging proof that the “renewal” of Austrian economics begun 10 years earlier was beginning to bear fruit. “Our authors have broken new ground”, he said. “How far this ground will give rise to nourishing crops nobody can say now. That remains to be seen” (p. 45). Now, more than a quarter of a century after the book’s original publication, the time is ripe for a retrospective assessment of its contribution to Austrian economics. In my opinion, O’Driscoll and Rizzo’s The Economics of Time and Ignorance is a very important book, a major milestone in modern Austrian economics, whose key message has not diminished in value or relevance. I agree with Karen Vaughn’s (1994: 134) assessment that the book was a “watershed event” in the revival of the Austrian tradition that redefined what Austrian economics was about. It is also a book that is underappreciated by young Austrian scholars. I first learnt about the book in mid-1987 while I was conducting a research project on entrepreneurship and innovation at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I read its chapters with gusto, especially the first half of the volume that lays out the analytical framework as it relates to subjectivity, knowledge, time, uncertainty and the competitive market process. I did not agree with all its contents and some parts of it were difficult for me to grasp. But the book really got me thinking. I could not say it was the only ingredient that played a catalyzing function in my thought processes at the time—the works of Karl Popper, Brian Loasby and the research environment at the TUM loomed large—but exposure to the book gave me further encouragement to ask different kinds of questions and to pursue new ways of doing economics. I was impressed by its ambitious scope and its willingness to tackle foundational themes of economic analysis. It provided yet another demonstration that economists can benefit from looking at social phenomena, not through a microscope, but through a wide-angle lens that draws upon other schools of economic thought as well as other disciplines, such as sociology, philosophy of science and law. In addition to this generalized liberating impetus, the book stimulated my thinking on how best to characterize the fundamental features of the entrepreneur’s problem situation. I was particularly taken by the book’s emphasis upon the endogeneity of uncertainty and change in socio-economic systems, the impossibility of predicting future knowledge, and its treatment of how agents learn from their market experiences. The Economics of Time and Ignorance has been a book that I have returned to on numerous occasions over the years in my work on market processes and the institutions that engender them (e.g. Harper 1997, 2003, 2011). The author’s avowed purpose in writing the book was both to “restate” the basic principles of Austrian economics and to advance and update them in light of theoretical developments outside the school (O’Driscoll and Rizzo 1985:p.1,231). The intellectual influences of Menger, Hayek and Lachmann are everywhere palpable. Following Menger, the authors frame the central task of economics in terms of explaining the emergence of spontaneous institutions and patterns of social interaction. Accordingly, Menger’s microanalytic theory of the origin of money is held up as an exemplar of subjectivist economics. Following Hayek, they investigate the social division of knowledge and the specific characteristics of knowledge that are central to analyzing market competition as a discovery process. From Lachmann, to whom the book is dedicated, they derive their emphasis upon time as a dimension of economic change, their focus upon endogenous change in markets and their attention to the potentially discoordinating effects of entrepreneurship. How best to characterize the book is not an easy exercise. If I can be permitted to appropriate bidding terminology from the game of bridge, I would say that this book is invitational rather than “sign-off” or “forcing”. It is not a decisive sign-off because it is not meant to be a conversation-stopper or the final word on Austrian economics. As the authors themselves say—they are trying to open up a research program, not complete one (p. 232). The book invites us to look at economic phenomena in a new way and to ask new questions about them—it tries to broaden our outlook beyond the rigidly deterministic confines of neoclassical economics. It is a prospectus rather than a definitive statement. Indeed, some of their ideas (e.g. the concept of pattern coordination) are even quite skeletal requiring further development and concrete examples. The second half of the book provides illustrative applications of the theory to specific economic topics, and the last chapter identifies and outlines possible areas of future research where other scholars could put subjectivist insights to work. Furthermore, the book is not “forcing” in that the authors only give us suggestions and guidance but they do not tell us how we must proceed. They do not furnish a dogmatic set of instructions for doing Austrian economics. Nor do they try to convince us that the Austrian approach is the best or only path of inquiry. It may help to say a word or two about the background to the book, its genesis and the nature of the environment in which it was conceived. The book appeared just over a decade after the Austrian revival began in the United States in 1974 at the South Royalton conference in Vermont. The book itself is an outgrowth of a substantial discussion paper, “What is Austrian Economics?”, that O’Driscoll and Rizzo (1980) presented at the Ninety-Third Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association in Denver, Colorado in 1980. The founding editor of the Journal of Economic Literature, Mark Perlman, was the commentator and none other than Lord Robbins himself was in attendance at that session. Perlman’s feedback was encouraging. (Roger Garrison, who contributed a chapter on capital theory to The Economics of Time and Ignorance, also presented a paper on intertemporal coordination and macroeconomic stability at the same panel.) O’Driscoll and Rizzo were both alumni of the South Royalton conference and they were then both young faculty members in the Department of Economics at New York University. A reading of that paper shows it to be quite different in character from the book it evolved into. In some respects, the paper is an elaboration of Lachmann’s (1978) “Austrian stocktaking” chapter, geared to a wider professional audience, in that it provides an authoritative overview of Austrian economics by pinpointing core analytical themes that distinguish it from neoclassical economics: subjectivism (subjectivity of costs, dispersion of knowledge), time and causality, uncertainty, disequilibrium, the static nature of welfare economics, profits and process, expectations, money and prices. The authors discuss economics in the wider context of praxeology and social theorizing. The focus of the paper is upon showing how Austrian economics is not a set of disjointed ideas but a coherent system of analysis that seeks to make social phenomena intelligible in terms of human action. The 1980 discussion paper contains no references to the work of Henri Bergson and Alfred Schutz, whose ideas figure so prominently in the final book. Most significantly, the paper is devoid of radical innovations that push beyond standard Austrian theory—their original contributions to a dynamic form of subjectivism had yet to take shape. Consequently, the paper does not elaborate a Bergsonian conception of real time. Nor does it offer a critique of the static Newtonian conception of time (employed in neoclassical economics), which analogizes time to space. In addition, there is no analysis of Schutz’s notion of typification—the mental process of extracting stable features from the flow of events—a notion which the authors subsequently applied in their development of the pattern coordination construct. It is important to note that the book was written at a time when its authors found the intellectual climate of Austrian economics to be resistant to new ideas. In a blog posted a couple of years ago, Rizzo (2009) commented that “we need to understand the stultifying ‘atmosphere’ that the then-younger generation (younger than Kirzner and Rothbard) inhabited in the mid-70s to mid-80s and somewhat beyond”. In his response, Roger Koppl concurred, recalling “what a huge life-giving breakthrough the book was for those of us who valued the [Austrian] tradition but felt stultified by its exaggerated conservatism back then. It was tangible and undeniable for those of us who were there in the discussions and events of the day.”",

O’Driscoll, Jr. and Mario J. Rizzo (henceforth: “the authors”) and on the extent to which the investment be considered the foundation of our fortune, let me briefly recapture the intellectual atmosphere prevailing in economics in the 1970s and early 1980s when the book was conceived. Then, as now, the economics profession went through one of its periodic cycles of soul-searching; luminaries such as Nicholas Kaldor, Wassily Leontief, and Joan Robinson proclaimed a “crisis in economics.”Footnote 1 Dissenting fringe groups announced themselves: neo-Marxian radicalism, Post Keynesianism, new institutionalism and, of course, Austrian economics. At the same time segments of the profession immersed themselves in renewed and intense methodological reflection; the methodology of economics as a new subdiscipline was born. One of the most thoughtful and vehement critics of economics at the time was Peter Bauer (Lord Bauer, as he was to become). In particular, Bauer complained about an utter “disregard of reality” in his own specialty, development economics, citing inter alia the hypothesis of the vicious circle of poverty.Footnote 2 Intellectual retrogression stemming from disregard of reality, Bauer lamented, was further in evidence when mathematical methods exclusively focus on variables tractable to formal analysis—to the detriment of influences which, even when highly pertinent, are not amenable to such treatment. Similarly, Bauer continued, mathematical economics encouraged confusion between the significant and the—often only spuriously—quantifiable, reinforcing neglect of pertinent background conditions and historical processes (Bauer 1987: 19). The customary, inappropriate procedure to reason from mathematics, rather than to mathematics, in many cases served merely as a protective screen, Bauer alleged, and what we see is an inversion of the familiar Hans Christian Andersen story of the Emperor’s New Clothes (Bauer 1987: 21; emphasis added): Here there are new clothes, and at times they are haute couture. But all too often there is no emperor within. This, in a nutshell, is one prominent take on the economics scenery in the 1980s. Closer to home, what unites Bauer’s strictures with our authors is his insistence on antecedents and historical processes as critical for the study of social phenomena and his bemoaning of the debilitating lack of the time dimension in the social sciences in general and in economics in particular—he keeps referring to a phrase coined by the Austrian art historian Sir Ernst Gombrich: “the amputation of the time dimension” from our culture.",2
26.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,23 February 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-012-0176-6,Is the economics of time and ignorance a “classic”?,March 2013,Anthony M. Endres,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"I begin with a remarkable conclusion drawn by Robert Leonard in his recent book: Von Neumann, Morgenstern and the Creation of Game Theory: from Chess to Social Science 1900–1960 (2010). Leonard recounts a meeting in 1947, indeed the very last meeting, between Oskar Morgenstern and his old teacher, Hans Mayer. As we know, Mayer had advanced Austrian economic thought particularly on the subject of the genetic causal method, yet he had also collaborated with the Nazis. Morgenstern came away from this meeting deeply disappointed in his old teacher, prompting Leonard to conclude that genetic causal theorizing was thereafter “buried forever beneath the events of mid-century” (Leonard 2010 : 307). There is no evidence whatsoever in Morgenstern’s diary record of this meeting that this was Morgenstern’s precise thought when he bid farewell to Mayer (Endres 2011). It was Leonard’s (perhaps wishful) thought, and it was also factually incorrect. 
ETI is an exemplar of the genetic causal style of economic theorizing, a style and method that Menger had introduced to economists in the 1870s. And it definitely was not “buried forever” post-1947. Ludwig Lachmann’s Capital and its Structure (1956) expressly employs that approach. Many others have used the genetic causal method of reasoning since the 1940s—as Robin Cowan and Mario Rizzo (1996) point out in their comprehensive survey article on the subject. There is a case for revisiting Morgenstern because there is an important link between ETI and two of Morgenstern’s articles in the 1930s: “The Time Moment in Value Theory” (1933) “Perfect Foresight and Economic Equilibrium” (1935) Both articles deal with time and ignorance issues and ask certain questions that are also posed in ETI. I will mention just one of Morgenstern’s points which ETI addresses: The implication of time is valid for any kind of foresight; thus even for imperfect [foresight]. So it is of signal importance to economics because it follows that even for the most elementary theses of the theory of equilibrium, recognition must be taken of what is the period to be considered, what periods of production are given, and over what points of time do the individuals look out for themselves and their descendants. It follows from this that in the theory of equilibrium, the time factor has to be clarified, and the element of time must be included in it in an unobjectionably specified manner (1935:172). Morgenstern seemed to take for granted that the equilibrium metaphor could be retained in economics without significant modification to account for real-time human activity.Footnote 1 Morgenstern’s articles in the 1930s left this matter up in the air. It was a long 50 year period before a satisfactory answer was provided. The idea of “pattern coordination” in ETI (p. 86–7) embodies the element of time in what Morgenstern would have called an “unobjectionably specified manner”. Indeed, ETI demonstrates that it is possible to consider the economy as “an open system” to use Morgenstern’s (1972a: 709 and cited ETI, p.23) phrase and still employ the term “equilibrium” for some analytical purposes. In all this, ETI traversed a delicate path between the earlier works of Hayek, Mises, Lachmann and Shackle, among others. Like Menger had done in 1871, it is a book that offers an economics in time more than an economics of time (Hicks 1976: 139). Finally, how would we characterize the kind of economic “theory” that is produced in this book? Broadly consistent with Hayek, the “theory” in ETI encompassed explanation of economic phenomena in terms of patterns and (potentially counterbalancing) tendencies rather than law-like explanation.",1

It was praised by some as a significant advance in the understanding and development of Austrian economic methodology. Caldwell (1986: 1185), for instance, described it as “clearly within the Austrian tradition, but at the same time [reaching] far beyond it.” Similarly, Boulding (1987: 1028) described its integration of Austrian and other heterodox methodologies as a “considerable success.” Perhaps more indicative of the importance of Time & Ignorance upon its release was the immediate and loud reaction of its critics. Baird (1987), for example, wrote a scathing eighteen-page review of the book in the Review of Austrian Economics dedicated to critiquing the areas of methodology original to the authors. “It is sadly ironic,” Baird (ibid.: 206) concludes, “that the authors, who have done so much to foster the Austrian revival, may have, in this atypical book, set it back. Austrians can take comfort in the knowledge that the damage is not irreparable.” Davidson (1989: 483) was also extremely critical of Time & Ignorance, describing the authors’ views as “seriously flawed – despite their utilization of such code words as uncertainty, real time, and money.”Footnote 1
 Beyond the initial reviews, Time & Ignorance has continued to receive the kind of attention befitting a book that, at the time, presented a novel and distinct contribution to an established methodological tradition. For instance, Vaughn (1994: 134) has argued that, after its release, “it would be impossible to think of Austrian economics as anything but the economics of time and ignorance.” On the other side, Gordon's (1997) review of the 1997 edition presents some of the same skepticism about Time & Ignorance’s original methodological approaches that are present in Baird (1987). Similarly, Klein (2008) has argued that Time & Ignorance is excessively meta-theoretic. These varied responses demonstrate that since its release Time & Ignorance has been recognized as a seminal and influential work within Austrian economics that deserves either praise or serious criticism. Although the authors hoped that the book would be considered a methodological advance within Austrian economics, in presenting the Austrian school as being capable of becoming a living, active research program, they also hoped that the book would inspire Austrian scholars to push the boundaries of the Austrian school. On this margin, there is evidence that this book was a considerable success. Rizzo (1997: xiii), for instance, acknowledged in his introduction to the re-issue of Time & Ignorance that Austrian economics had moved in the direction that he and O’ Driscoll had hoped since the publication of their book. “Austrian economics,” Rizzo stated, “has changed in the past ten years and that change has been positive. Austrians have now become among the most creative, innovative and least doctrinaire of economists.” Similarly, Boettke and Prychito (2011) have noted that Time & Ignorance was one of the key elements that made 1985 “a watershed year” for Austrian economics. And, described their excitement at its publication because, in their view, its content opened up new avenues for Austrian scholarship as well as because it was published by a major trade press, unlike many of the key texts that were being published by Austrians prior to that time (ibid.). As Boettke and Prychitko (ibid.: 131) explain, Time & Ignorance “was met with mixed reaction—the old guard (except for Lachmann) considered the book a detour from the correct path of development for the Austrian school of economics, while those in graduate school at the time viewed the book as a fresh look at the Austrian school, and were excited about the new directions the ideas in the book pointed for young scholars to pursue.” Despite this recognition and the immediate impact it had on the generation of Austrians entering the academic landscape at the time it was published, Time & Ignorance seems to have made little headway among the younger, “third generation” of Austrian scholars.Footnote 2 Amongst that group, the book has been largely ignored, seldom cited and even more rarely seriously engaged. The Handbook on Contemporary Austrian Economics, which was meant as a restatement of the key themes within Austrian economics by “third generation” Austrians, provides an excellent example of the disappearance of the work. Although covering much of the same aspects of Austrian theory and methodology that are dealt with in Time & Ignorance, there are no citations to Time & Ignorance in this volume by its “third generation” contributors. Its absence is all the more striking in chapters like Coyne’s (2010) on “Economics as the study of coordination and exchange” and Storr (2010b) on “The facts of the social sciences are what people believe and think” which pick up on core themes within Time & Ignorance, namely equilibrium and subjectivism, and cite and attempt to seriously engage many of the same texts by Mises, Hayek, Lachmann, Schutz and others that O’Driscoll and Rizzo engaged. In other areas as well, these “third generation” Austrians seem neither to cite the book in their own work.Footnote 3 Moreover, they do not assign the book to their students. For example, none of the publicly available syllabi of a subset of these scholars (including the graduate “Theory of the Market Process” class at George Mason University taught during the Fall 2011 semester) includes any readings from Time & Ignorance.Footnote 4
 This is something of a puzzle. How is it possible that a work that Time & Ignorance, a work that is seen as a key text in contemporary Austrian economics, has had so little impact on an entire cohort of Austrian economists? This paper attempts to provide an explanation. At least three competing explanations present themselves. First, these younger scholars could have rejected the ideas contained in the Time & Ignorance. They could be ignoring the book because they disagree with its substantive claims. Second, it is possible that the advances in Time & Ignorance have been so fully absorbed into contemporary Austrian theory that “third generation” Austrians have no reason to cite the book.Footnote 5 Finally, the directions this new generation embarked upon in their scholarship could be such that the specific issues considered in Time & Ignorance are simply not a primary concern for their work. The “third generation” may, simply, not be concerned with the debates that concerned O’ Driscoll and Rizzo. We explore and reject the first two possible explanations and endorse the third. The scholarship of the “third generation,” we suggest, has taken a decidedly applied turn. Unlike previous generations, most of their writings are applications of Austrian theory to real world phenomena rather than simply explorations of Austrian theory and methodology. Their (less frequent) methodological explorations are typically not about teasing out the uniqueness of the Austrian school nor are they about trying to reconcile or differentiate the Austrian school from other schools of thought. Instead, when they do write on methodology they are concerned with carving out space for the kind of empirical work that they find appropriate.",3

Rizzo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Before, however, proceeding with these themes the reader needs some background. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Jerry O’Driscoll and I were working quite deeply in the Austrian tradition. We had studied Austrian economics at least since our college days at Fordham University in the mid-late 1960s. We were by no means new to the field. But we sensed two main and related problems. The first problem was that there were many misconceptions about the nature and content of Austrian economics among the many in the economics profession we hoped to influence. Many then, as still today, did not see the difference between Austrian economics and libertarian political theory. Many thought that Austrian subjectivism meant some kind of irrefutable solipsism. Many thought that Austrians didn’t “believe” in data. Many thought Austrians acted as if they could learn nothing from any other school of economics. In fact, one non-Austrian NYU faculty member said that we were a “mystery cult.” We claimed, or so it seemed to him, that we had the key—mysterious to all others—to all economic knowledge. Finally (only because I find making this list depressing), many thought that all we could do is quote the classic Austrian economists—Mises, Hayek and so on. We had nothing new to say. The second problem is that some of these things were true. Austrians were insular and very absorbed with their own tradition as well as highly critical of standard neoclassical economics, even in its Chicago variant. And yet there were good reasons for this. The Austrian school had been in decline. Very few economists really understood what it was. Its central concerns and principles had to be learned. Even some in Austrian circles of the 1970s were badly misinformed and needed to clarify for themselves and others the basic ideas. Most importantly, Austrians had to apply and, in many cases, contrast their approach to contemporary economic issues—both theoretical and policy—to that of other schools of economic thought. We had to show that we had a distinct intellectual product. This is where the Molière-Popper principles come in. Our task seemed to be both to restate the fundamental ideas of Austrian economics and to do it in a way that opened the door to further ideas—advances in the system of thought. This was not and is not an easy task. Restatements tend to be backward-looking and stimulation of new research is forward-looking. A book about how great Menger, Boehm-Bawerk, Mises and Hayek were would not accomplish our goals. On the other hand, a book simply setting out a new agenda would not be easily understandable or appreciated if people didn’t comprehend the basic principles of the research framework.",5

The book itself was subject to acclaim (Hazlitt 1944) and criticism (Thomas 1945)Footnote 1 in Britain, Ireland (O’Brien 1944) and America (Hayek 2007b:18–19). On the 17th December, 1945 Hayek delivered the Twelfth Finlay Memorial Lecture at University College Dublin, titled ‘Individualism: True and False’. Hayek included his Finlay Memorial lecture as a chapter in his 1948 ‘Individualism and Economic Order’ (Hayek 1980[1948]:1–32) notwithstanding that his 1945 Dublin lecture was originally intended to be the introduction section of his never to be completed ‘Abuse of Reason’ project (Caldwell 2004: 262). His 1945 Dublin lecture could also be considered a prelude to one of Hayek’s greatest works, his 1960 ‘The Constitution of Liberty’ (Hayek 2011). In a 1939 letter to Fritz Machlup, Hayek had envisioned that his book “should form the basis of a systemic intellectual historical investigation of the fundamental principles of the social development of the last hundred years (from Saint-Simon to Hitler)” (Hayek 2010: 1, fn. 2).Footnote 2
 In an early outline synopsis of his proposed book, titled ‘The Abuse and Decline of Reason: The Reflections of an Economist on the Self-Destructive Tendencies of our Scientific Civilization’, the intended title for the two volume book’s introduction section was to be “The Humility of Individualism” (Hayek 2010: 5). The Finlay Memorial annual lecture series was in honour of the Rev. Thomas A. Finlay S. J., the first Professor of Political Economy at University College Dublin, a university originally founded by the Jesuit order (McRedmond 1991: 234–236). Fr. Finlay was instrumental in the formation of the Irish agricultural co-operative movement and its umbrella organisation, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, together with Sir Horace Plunkett (O’Brien 1940). John Maynard Keynes had delivered the inaugural Finlay Memorial Lecture in 1933 (Keynes 1933) followed by other distinguished economists such as Bertil Ohlin (Ohlin 1934), Josiah Stamp (Stamp 1938) Redcliffe N. Salaman (Salaman 1943), John Jewkes (Jewkes 1952) and George Shackle in 1967.Footnote 3
 A month before Hayek’s December 1945 visit to Dublin, The Irish Times reported that there had never been a more keenly awaited Finlay Lecture than that which Dr. Hayek was expected to deliver. The correspondent reported that it was believed Hayek “intends to reply in the lecture to criticisms of his book, ‘The Road to Serfdom’.Footnote 4 Four days before his lecture, The Irish Times further reported that provision was been made to re-broadcast the lecture within Earlsfort Terrace due to the space restrictions of the building’s Physics Lecture Theatre, such was the demand for admission to Hayek’s Finlay Memorial lecture “which will be the finest of the series.”Footnote 5
 Amongst the University College Dublin audience were the Irish Free State’s Minister for Finance, Frank Aiken, and the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Sean MacEntee. From the opposition benches were the Irish Free State’s first Taoiseach,Footnote 6 W. T. Cosgrave and his son and future Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, with Gen. R. Mulcahy, former GHQ chief-of-staff during the 1919–1921 Irish War of Independence and commander-in-chief during the subsequent 1922–1923 civil war.Footnote 7
 The embryonic Irish Free State had remained neutral during World War Two, and the Irish government was to eventually break the last formal link with Great Britain, following the 1921 Anglo-Irish Peace Treaty by declaring a Republic in 1948 (Lee 2006: 299–301). Between the world wars, the Irish Free State as a Dominion of the British Empire had “enjoyed all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of a republic” (May 1995: 302). Professor George O’Brien, Hayek’s host for his 1945 Dublin visit and lecture, had succeeded Rev. Finlay S. J. as Professor of Political Economy at University College Dublin. O’Brien abandoned his career as a lawyer following a catastrophic legal case in 1916 and wrote his first major work, ‘The Economic History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century’ (O’Brien 1918).Footnote 8
 Between 1923 and 1947 O’Brien wrote twenty-six articles for the Irish quarterly journal, Studies including a review of Hayek’s ‘Road to Serfdom’ (O’Brien 1944). Concluding his 1944 review, O’Brien claimed that Hayek’s book was for all lovers of human liberty, a restatement of fundamental Christian truths that were been denied or forgotten and importantly that “man is master of his own fate, that he must shoulder the moral responsibility for all his deeds and misdeeds, and that the State exists for man, not man for the State” (O’Brien 1944: 218). Like Hayek, O’Brien was a strong admirer of Hilaire Belloc’s seminal 1912 book ‘The Servile State’, which Hayek had praised for linking socialism with slavery quoting a phrase from the preface of Belloc’s 1913 second edition that “the effect of Socialist doctrine on Capitalist society is to produce a third thing different from either of its two begetters-to wit, the Servile State” (Hayek 2007a [1944]: 67, fn. 4). In his conclusion, O’Brien considered that Hayek’s argument in ‘The Road to Serfdom’ was “capable of being condensed into a single sentence of Hilaire Belloc’s” (O’Brien 1944: 218) treatise that Hayek had quoted in ‘The Road to Serfdom’. Another Studies article by O’Brien was his incisive and insightful obituary following the death of J. M. Keynes in 1946 (O’Brien 1946). O’Brien was also the Dublin correspondent for The Economist at the time of Hayek’s Dublin 1945 visit (Meenan 1980: 172). O’Brien had initially got to know Hayek in 1943 following O’Brien’s discovery of a box full of two sets of letters; one set containing correspondence between John Stuart Mill and Irish economist John Elliot Cairnes the other set between David Ricardo and Mill’s father, James.",2
26.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,22 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-012-0182-8,Nineteenth century London water supply: Processes of innovation and improvement,March 2013,Nicola Tynan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"At the turn of the nineteenth century, those London households with piped water supply received their water untreated, intermittently and at low-pressure. By 1901, the majority of London’s households had piped supply, with 95 % receiving water continuously, at high-pressure, and filtered if coming from the rivers Thames or Lea. London water supply was transformed during the century by processes of experimentation and innovation undertaken by London’s water companies during a time of significant uncertainty in the water and sanitation sectors. Government intervention also increased, with at least some negative consequences. London’s water companies have received little credit for the investment in innovations that not only improved water supply for Londoners but were exported to other cities in England and abroad. The general perception of the water companies is one of failure to invest to improve public health and meet the demands of customers. In trade literature on water filtration, there is little recognition of the role played by London’s water companies in technological innovation.Footnote 1
 Most of the negative perception of London’s water companies can be traced back either to Edwin Chadwick, whose views were conveyed to economists via John Stuart Mill (1851, 1871) and to historians via S.E. Finer (1951) and R.A. Lewis (1952), or to the London County Council and other advocates of municipal ownership.Footnote 2 The most frequently stated charge against the companies was an insufficient quantity of water, with the connection to public health emphasized. Then, as now, public health played a major role in policy debates regarding the ownership of water works; in many British and U.S. cities this debate resulted in a switch from private to municipal ownership and control.Footnote 3 A perception of public health improvements in cities switching from private to public ownership provided evidence of prior market failure. When looking at London’s water supply at any given moment, critics have been quick to point out the imperfections in private supply with any government action indicating the superiority of government control.Footnote 4
 London's waterworks were privately owned throughout the nineteenth century. Private companies had first offered pipe delivery of water in 1582 and continued to do so until 1904, after Parliament’s 1902 approval of a switch to public ownership (Tynan 2002). During this time period, private companies invested heavily in service improvements, though investment came in waves and with some companies proving more entrepreneurial than others. Investment was particularly heavy during the 1800s, as the demand for piped water increased. Companies moved to supplying filtered water, increased the volume of water delivered, introduced high-pressure and continuous supply, and extended their networks to the majority of homes in the metropolis. Public health improved: London experienced its last Asiatic cholera epidemic (England's major health scare during the nineteenth century) in 1866, long before government purchase of the waterworks and earlier than many European and American cities that suffered high mortality rates during the 1892 cholera outbreak. In this paper, I assess the economic history of water supply in nineteenth century London, using a process approach rather than one of static efficiency at any given moment in time. Following von Mises (1966) and Kirzner (1997), the paper emphasizes entrepreneurship, focusing on the companies that provided leadership in R&D and quality improvements, while identifying the particular challenges of operating in a time of uncertainty due to competing theories of the connections between water, sanitation and disease, and changing government regulation.Footnote 5 During the early to mid-1800s, London's water companies experienced brief periods of rivalrous competition (Graham-Leigh 2000; Tynan 2002: 354-355). Over the longer-term, competition for consumers encouraged companies to offer a better commodity: improving water quality by moving intakes and investing in filtration, and improving service by upgrading pipes, installing more powerful pumps, and expanding reservoir capacity. In Parliamentary and other public debates on water supply, reformers argued that private water companies failed to provide a sufficient quantity or quality of water to prevent the spread of cholera. Following both entrepreneurial and Parliamentary response through time shows that parties on both sides were trying to improve conditions in the face of epidemiological and technological uncertainty. Footnote 6 A comparison of company investment and government intervention shows that companies responded to water quality concerns and to evidence suggesting cholera was water-borne at least as fast as public authorities, with at least one company investing in filtration or moving its intake prior to regulation. Government regulation generally imposed on all companies the innovations already undertaken by the most entrepreneurial. Larger volumes of water and network expansion offered health benefits, but only when combined with an appropriate wastewater and sewerage technology. Non-network sewage removal was dominant in London until the second half of the nineteenth century, and urban households without a sewer connection periodically paid collectors to empty their cesspool (Fletcher 1844:156; Halliday 1999:34). By embracing an erroneous miasma theory of cholera transmission, government officials such as Edwin Chadwick and John Simon were responsible for the deterioration in water quality. The public health effect of the move from cesspools to sewers was initially negative as household sewage polluted the rivers Thames and Lea that were the source of most companies' water. Towards the end of the century, there is evidence that regulations requiring Parliamentary approval for additional investment slowed improvements in water infrastructure providing possible illustration of Kirzner’s claim that regulation “may discourage, hamper and even completely stifle the discovery process” (1985: 141). This paper adds to the literature challenging the negative impression of private water provision, particularly regarding public health, that justified government appropriation of water works. Troesken (1999) shows that during the progressive era private water companies in US cities invested in filtration at a faster rate than public utilities; a switch from private to public provision played little role in reducing typhoid rates. For English cities during the nineteenth century, Hassan (1985) provides evidence that public ownership of waterworks generated external benefits in the form of reduced fire costs and more abundant supply for industrial users, but finds little evidence of an improvement in public health. This paper focuses on nineteenth century London as a particularly rich case study given its long and contentious history of private provision.",5
26.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,24 January 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0202-3,What kind of state in our future? Fact and Conjecture in Vito Tanzi’s Government versus Markets,March 2013,Richard E. Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Tanzi tells a story in this book, and it has the form of a coming-of-age tale. He opens by asserting that “there is no more fundamental question in economics than the economic role that the state . . . ought to play in a democratic country with a market economy (p. 3),” having previously asserted that it is the “goal of economists . . . to determine the right balance between state and market (p. ix).” From this point of departure, Tanzi tells a story that starts with governments with small budgets late in the 19th century, and with budgets expanding until late in the 20th century. This story is told as a tale of maturation, and with the elements of that maturation including such things as increasing population, lengthening life spans, and a continually shrinking world due to technological developments in communication and transportation. Where small states were fine as the 19th century ended, maturation throughout the 20th century required extensive growth in the states in the OECD nations with which Tanzi is principally concerned. Table 1.1 (p. 9), for instance, presents data for the 17 OECD nations on which data are available back to the late 19th century. For those nations, governments on average accounted for 11 % of GDP around 1870. By 1920 that average had risen to 20 %, and had risen further to 24 % by 1937. In 1960 that average stood at 29 %, at which point what had been a pattern of creeping growth turned into a gallop as the state reached maturity in Tanzi’s tale: the average of 28 % in 1960 reached 42 % in 1980, and stood at 45 % in 1996. Starting in the 1990s, the pattern of uniform relative growth among nations began to change. For 12 of those 17 nations, the relative size of government was less in 2007 than it was in 1990. The exceptions were Austria, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Among these five nations, moreover, only in the UK and the US did the growth of government march steadily upward, though at a diminishing rate. If states were adolescents late in the 19th century, they had matured by the end of the 20th century. According to Tanzi, with that maturity comes cessation in the continual growth of government as measured by budgetary data. In Tanzi’s judgment, the relative quantitative growth in government is over, and the qualitative growth either has started or will soon do so. For Tanzi, this is a welcome development. While Tanzi recognizes the negative effects of high rates of tax and the subsidization of non-productive activity, he views these as mostly things of the past as accompaniments of the growth from adolescence to maturity. Now that maturity has been reached, the state will go forward in a new style suitable for its mature character. That character will include some reduction in tax burdens accompanied by continually growing regulation that Tanzi sees as an unavoidable and even welcome feature of the new world into which we are entering. In Tanzi’s view, governments in the 21st century will devote increasing effort to improving markets through expanded regulation, with taxation possibly even falling to some extent. Adolph Wagner (1883) has often been misinterpreted as claiming that growing wealth will be bring an ever increasing relative size of government, as summarized by claims that the income elasticity of demand for governmental services exceeds unity. Borcherding et al. (2004) show the falsity of this common claim. Even more, Wagner’s claim of an “increasing extension of state activity” was more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as Backhaus and Wagner (2005a, b) note. This qualitative change, moreover, fits with Tanzi’s theme. Among the OECD nations, recent data show numerous instances of decline in the share of government in GDP, though no decline that would qualify as dramatic. Table 4.1 (p. 95) shows that for all of the 22 OECD nations for which data goes back to 1960, total taxes as a percentage of GDP were lower in 2008 than they had been at some earlier peak. It should, however, be noted that public debt is excluded from measures of tax revenue, even though government borrowing is just taxation by another name. Tanzi is a significant and interesting thinker, of this there can be no doubt. He writes as an insider who participates in the conduct of fiscal and regulatory affairs, and to do this effectively brings certain presuppositions in its train. Among these is Tanzi’s treatment of government as a coherent entity that acts on some distinct object that is commonly denoted as “the economy.” If the economy is an engine that produces goods, the state is the mechanic who keeps the engine running. Tanzi writes as a practice-oriented economist whose arena of practice is statecraft, or as an engineer and not as a scientist (Mankiw (2006). From this orientation, state practices are helpful and virtuous along most margins of action, even if not all margins. The existence of these negative margins, however, does not deny the dominance of helpfulness and virtue but rather is simply an unavoidable feature of the transition from adolescence to maturity. After all, the transition from adolescence to maturity requires time for making difficult adjustments during which state activity may appear to be other than helpful and virtuous. Tanzi’s organization, however, doesn’t fit his narrative, and therein lays a significant problem with this book despite its many fine qualities. While I have asserted that this book reflects measurement without theory, I should note that Tanzi presents both measurement and theory in the book. He does so, however, in disjoint fashion. After an introductory chapter, Tanzi provides five chapters on measurements of government growth in the OECD nations. These chapters are followed by four chapters on various theoretical ideas. The chapters on theory, however, are independent of the chapters on history. Theory does not instruct the assembly of relevant data, nor do data present problems for theoretical articulation. For Tanzi, the relationship between theory and history is additive and separable and not interactive. In particular, Tanzi’s data are of macro or global magnitudes, and yet those data emerge from micro-level interaction. In the rest of this review, I shall indicate briefly some of the conceptual problems that accompany Tanzi’s narrative and which provide opportunities for alternative scholarly articulation.",

26.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,28 March 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0220-1,How German is German neo-liberalism?,June 2013,Joachim Zweynert,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the literature on the history of German neo-liberalism two lines of argument can be distinguished: Some authors try to define the place of Walter Eucken and the Freiburg school, the liberal-conservatives Wilhelm Röpke and Alexander Rüstow, and the inventor of the concept of social market economy, Alfred Müller-Armack, in international, mainly Anglo-Saxon liberal economics (see e.g. Grossekettler 1997; Sally 1998a; Vanberg 2004). Basic questions then are: How do the concepts of the German neo-liberals relate to classical liberalism? And how do they relate to modern institutional economics and constitutional political economy in particular? Other authors, more interested in understanding the German neo-liberals within the context of their own place and time (see e.g. Rieter and Schmolz 1993; Goldschmidt 2002), emphasise how deeply they were influenced by specifically German economic ideas and by the younger Historical School in particular (Peukert 2000; Schefold 2003). The title of this paper already suggests that it belongs to this second rather than to the first mentioned current. However, concentrating on the issue of the socio-philosophical roots of German neo-liberalism, I will try to contribute to a better understanding of how it relates both to classical Anglo-Saxon liberalism and to specifically German traditions of thought. In order to avoid repeating what other authors have written, and to bring a so far somewhat neglected dimension into play, I will concentrate on two closely related issues playing an important role both in Adam Smith and in the German social science tradition: the problem of the functional differentiation of society and that of the main source(s) of social cohesion. Today, these two questions are usually treated as sociological, not as economic ones. However, they are central to the concepts of Adam Smith as well as those of German economists up to the 1950s, when they returned to the international mainstream which tended to draw a clear boundary between economics and sociology.Footnote 1 An important common element in the teachings of Smith and the German historicists and neo-liberals is that they had a broad social science agenda. As they were always occupied with philosophical, sociological and economic questions, reducing them to pure economics does not do justice to their intention. Therefore, including these dimensions will hopefully provide new insights into parallels and differences between classical Anglo-Saxon and German neo-liberalism, as well as shedding some light on differences within the German neo-liberal camp. The paper is organised as follows: In the next section I will give a short introduction into Smith’s views on social differentiation and social cohesion. In section three I will outline the German debates around this subject. As the younger Historical School is often seen as an important source of inspiration for the German neo-liberals, I will in some detail elaborate upon Schmoller’s ideas on social differentiation and social cohesion. In the fourth and main section, I will compare the respective views of Eucken (4.1), Röpke and Rüstow (4.2) and Müller-Armack (4.3). In the fifth section some rather preliminary conclusions will be drawn.",23

III). This designation is absolutely correct, though German neoliberalism refers to more than simply a (global) liberalism that was adapted by German economists. Rather, it is more of an independent school of thought that can only be understood in the context of the German history of economic thought and history of ideas. This becomes particularly obvious when discussing the relation between the ordoliberals and the German Historical School. Notwithstanding the debate—mainly initiated by Pearson (1999)—as to whether there ever was a homogeneous German Historical School (cf. Caldwell 2001 for arguments countering Pearson in this regard) and whether the attribute “untheoretical” applies at all to Schmoller’s Historical School (e.g. Hodgson 2001), the fact that the ordoliberals viewed themselves mainly as a counter movement to the younger Historical School is undisputable. Walter Eucken’s articles “Die Überwindung des Historismus” (Overcoming historicism) (1938) und “Wissenschaft im Stile Schmollers” (Science in Schmoller’s style) (1940) clearly illustrate this. Even though the ordoliberals viewed themselves as opponents to historicism, these efforts to distance themselves from the Historical School can no longer be considered the differentia specifica of ordoliberalism. Contrary to what is generally stated in textbooks on the history of economic thought, the Freiburg School did not put an end to the predominance of the Historical School in Germany. Instead, Eucken and his disciples find themselves at the end of an almost twenty year long debate about Schmoller’s legacy that began after his death in 1917. These interwar years, which have received little attention up to now (Janssen 2000 being the exception) were marked by breaks with the legacy of the Historical School, though, using a different perspective, these controversies can also be interpreted as a continuation on the path of already existing developments (Schefold 1996; for an example with regard to social policy cf. Blümle and Goldschmidt 2006b). The most famous examples of this new direction founded on the Historical School are Werner Sombart and Arthur Spiethoff. As has already been shown (Goldschmidt 2002: chap. 5), Walter Eucken, in a sense, also perpetuated the teachings of his professors, who had already themselves carried forward Schmoller’s legacy: for instance, the considerations about the classification of economic systems and the inclusion of elements of the classical tradition into the predominant methodology are already to be found in Heinrich Dietzel, who influenced Eucken during his early study years at the Bonn University. Walter Eucken’s academic teacher, Hermann Schumacher, renowned economist at the time, who succeeded Adolph Wagner in his university chair and who, for some time, was co-editor alongside Arthur Spiethoff of “Schmollers Jahrbuch,” was himself striving to overcome historicism and was already propagating a line of thought based on different economic orders (Goldschmidt 2005b). In addition to these continuities and discontinuities in the tradition of the Historical School, which I can only hint at here, economic theory in the 1920s and 1930s was confronted with the problem of economic instability in an unprecedented way. It is precisely the issue of business cycle fluctuation that encouraged (especially young) theorists of that time to base their considerations about economic stability upon a comprehensive theory of social order, as found in ordoliberalism, but also, for instance in Friedrich A. Hayek and Adolph Lowe (Blümle and Goldschmidt 2006a). Yet, focusing on the debates surrounding economic thought and economic policy is not sufficient to fully understand German neoliberalism. Walter Eucken’s approach and that of ‘his’ Freiburg School cannot be understood without reference to the specific philosophical and historical connections (see also Goldschmidt and Wohlgemuth 2008; Klump and Wörsdörfer 2011). These connections will be uncovered in what follows. This will be achieved by pursuing three aspects: the influence of Max Weber and of his ideal typical approach (Section 2), the role played by Walter Eucken’s father, the philosopher Rudolf Eucken (Section 3) and the significance of the Freiburg phenomenologist Edmund Husserl for the concept of ordoliberalism (Section 4). It will be shown that Eucken’s method was first and foremost set against all relativist currents and sustained by the hope of discovering the “realm of truth” (Edmund Husserl) in economics as well. On this basis, we shall, in closing (Section 5), portray Eucken’s oeuvre using the characteristics of order, freedom and truthfulness.",24

A special section of the museum is devoted to the “Freiburg School” of law and economics. Here one can read: “Walter Eucken and the other members of the Freiburg School (Franz Böhm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, Friedrich August von Hayek, Leonhard Miksch) are known as the spiritual founding fathers of the social market economy” (Speck 2007: 99). Was Hayek a “member” of the “Freiburg School”? Certainly not, if seen in a strict historical sense. He hardly even took notice of the existence of such a school which was formed around 1936. Would Hayek feel honoured to be named a spiritual founding father of Germany’s “social market economy”? Certainly not, if seen in a strict political sense. He rejected already the term “social market economy”, calling it “most confusing and harmful” (Hayek 1965/67: 83) or even “a real danger” and “camouflage for aspirations that certainly have nothing to do with the common interest” (Hayek 1957/67, 238f). Although Hayek’s ideas and those of the Freiburg School have some basic elements in common (see, e.g. Vanberg 2003), I would here like to stress some differences. My main points will be: In terms of explicit, published references, the relationship between Hayek and the early Freiburg School seems to have been one of mutually benign neglect. It took several decades before the “Hayekian challenge” was fully understood in Freiburg; in a way one could even argue that the challenge arrived in Freiburg only with Hayek himself in 1962. This delay or reluctance can mostly be explained by different foci of attention. Hayek’s evolutionary economics and his classical-liberal social philosophy centers around the problem of private, dispersed knowledge. The (early) Freiburg School’s economics and its ordo-liberal social philosophy centers around the problem of private, concentrated power. This difference of perspective has consequences and can partly be explained by the different intellectual sources the proponents were drawing upon, and the different political struggles they were engaged in. I will try to develop this argument by showing in part 2 that German and Austrian economics seemed to have missed each other at their most defining moments. When Austrian “neo-classical” economics was developed (after 1871), the German Historical School was fighting it. When the Freiburg School came to define its own difference to the Historical School (around 1936), Hayek came to discover and define his difference to (what became of) neoclassical economics. It took some time even for Austrian economists to see the full meaning of this (post-calculation-debate) rift with the neoclassical mainstream. It took German economists much longer to see Hayek’s challenge. In part 3, I want to show in which areas there was, if not a rift, a different perspective between Hayek and the (early) Freiburg School. Based on their different ontological focus (private power or private knowledge) I shortly discuss three major areas of divergence: (1) theory of competition and policy of anti-trust, (2) emergence of a beneficial order of rules and (3) relevance of the “social question”. In the final part 4 I try to provide a sketchy overview of (the relationship between) the Freiburg School and Austrian Economics today.",18

The policy framework that Kyoto put in place relies mainly on taxation, including carbon taxes, and emissions trading. Both of these policy instruments require precise and reliable information about the costs and benefits of climate change mitigation or abatement if they are to operate effectively and efficiently. Yet there are serious doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the version of climate science that the IPCC presents. Moreover, the Kyoto policies are informed by a theoretical perspective that is incompatible with the central concept of Austrian welfare economics, dynamic efficiency. The central claim made in this paper is only an Austrian policy framework can defend to the greatest possible degree the liberties both of fossil fuel users and people whose property rights will be violated if carbon emissions cause climate change. That policy framework combines insights from two branches of Austrian thought: positive economics (Sections 3 and 4) and the normative sub-discipline of welfare economics (Section 5). The successful application of Neoclassical and ‘Post-Austrian’ perspectives to climate change presupposes knowledge of the monetary value of the social costs of climate change and hence of the benefits of mitigation policies. The first step in securing this knowledge is to calculate the effect of CO2 emissions on atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and hence on global mean surface temperature. The next step is to predict the effect of increases in global mean surface temperature on physical phenomena such as sea level and the extent of deserts. Finally, a monetary value must be assigned to the impact of these physical changes on economic activity. Each step is subject to great uncertainty. The neoclassical and ‘Post-Austrian’ perspectives lack a secure foundation in scientific knowledge and are therefore unworkable. The dominant neoclassical paradigm is also deficient on theoretical grounds. Neoclassical welfare economics is grounded in the defence of the rights of the individual against the state but its application to environmental issues in general and to climate change in particular subordinates individual rights to aggregate or social welfare, measured by the monetary value of the benefits and costs of policy. The standard approach to the economics of climate change is therefore incompatible with the classical liberal defence of individual rights and freedom. The ‘Post-Austrian’ policy framework resembles the neoclassical approach in several ways. The ‘Post-Austrian’ advocacy of emissions trading assigns a central role to government intervention, based on the goal of aggregate welfare and the presumed availability to the government of superior knowledge of the future development of resources. However, the ‘Post-Austrian’ argument for ‘collective effort’ is found to be unsound. The Austrian perspective on environmental policy is founded on the argument in Mises (1949) that externalities are a pseudo-problem, arising not from market failure but from an inadequate allocation or defence of private property of rights. This approach to environmental policy is presented here as a contribution to the normative sub-discipline of Austrian welfare economics, the defining concept of which is dynamic or catallactic efficiency. The ethical foundation of dynamic efficiency is the principle that ‘each person has the right to appropriate the results of his entrepreneurial activity’ (Huerta de Soto 2009, p. 20). However, entrepreneurial activity involves the exploitation of resources which others may also wish or be entitled to use. Conflicts over the use of resources and the infringement of property rights should be seen as legal disputes and resolved in the context of tort law. Environmental problems arise because one economic agent, such as a polluter, acts in a way that is inconsistent with other agents’ being able to carry out their plans and exercise their rights. If A’s use of fossil fuels causes B’s land to be destroyed through inundation or desertification, this is evidently a tort. The policy implication is that government has no cause to intervene in market exchange where property rights have been allocated and legislative procedures exist that that make it possible for the victim to take legal action against the tort feasor, who must be shown to be causally responsible for a specific invasion of the victim’s rights. The relation of this authentic Austrian environmental economics to scientific knowledge of climate change is entirely different from that of neoclassical and ‘Post-Austrian’ economics. The application of Austrian economics to climate change does not depend upon foundations in scientific knowledge. It would be up to the courts to decide, beyond reasonable doubt, whether the use of fossil fuels has infringed, or risks infringing, people’s rights, relying on expert evidence that reflects the views of the research community rather than the IPCC. Moreover, the application of Austrian economics to climate change would lead to court cases where the cross-examination of expert witnesses would promote the public understanding and the advancement of climate science.",5

Krasnozhon,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The third wave of democratization that is the most recent topic in the field of comparative political economy has produced controversial results (Acemoglu et al. 2008; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Boettke et al. 2005). Democracy has consolidated in some post-communist countries such as Poland and Lithuania. But democratization has failed in other post-communist countries such as Belarus and Turkmenistan. Hayek (1944) and Friedman (1962) argued that the relationship between institutions determined political outcomes. Then what determines democratic consolidation in post-communist countries? There are two main approaches to studying causes of democratic consolidation in the field of comparative political economy. The structural explanation of democratization focuses on a set of factors that may or may not cause transition to democracy and its consolidation. These causal factors include structure of economy, quality of political institutions, effectiveness of civil society, modernization, and globalization (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Przeworski et al. 2000; Huntington 2006, 1991; Barro 1999; Lipset 1994, 1959). The structural approach, however, ignores a role of social arrangements in political development because democratic consolidation is also a complex social phenomenon. “Conventional thinking with regard to economic and political reforms in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union”, Boettke (2001) argues, “was trapped in a mindset which did not allow innovative ideas for social arrangements to be seriously considered”. Several recent and important studies have focused on the role of culture in the political development of post-communist countries (Boettke et al. 2008; Pejovich 2003; Boettke 2001). This strand of research focuses on how political culture determines individual and group behavior (Beaulier et al. 2012; Fukuyama 2011; Boettke and Fink 2011). In this tradition of research scholars examine how a political culture can be measured and factored in political development. This paper contributes to this developing strand of research. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses determinants of democratic consolidation. Section 3 presents comparative analysis of democratic consolidation in post-communist countries. Section 4 contains the concluding remarks and directions for future research.",9

Langlois,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the years, I have many times inflicted the following writing assignment on both an undergraduate Honors Seminar and my graduate course in the Economics of Organization. One of the central concerns of economics is the nature and functioning of both markets and non-market institutions like business firms or governments in allocating resources. In an important and influential article, the Nobel Laureate F. A. Hayek (1945) painted the virtues of the market as a mechanism of coordination in a vivid way. Writing in the context of a long-running debate about the efficacy of socialism, he argued that the market is superior to central economic planning because of the way it economizes on information and takes advantage of the localized knowledge of market participants. In an equally important article, another Nobel Laureate, Ronald Coase (1937), considered a related question: in a market economy, why are there non-market institutions like business firms? Why aren’t all aspects of production carried out through market exchanges among independent workers? In constructing his argument, Coase asserts (a) that the firm consists in the supersession of the price mechanism by administrative control and (b) that such supersession is often efficient because “there is a cost to using the price system.” Your assignment is to summarize the argument of the Hayek and Coase papers, and to consider the following question. Is there a conflict or contradiction between Hayek’s argument and Coase’s argument? If you think there is a contradiction, explain what it is. If you think there is no contradiction, explain how the two arguments can be reconciled. Most students choose the easy way to reconcile the two articles: Hayek and Coase are operating at two different levels. Hayek is talking about the differences between a market order and political central planning, whereas Coase is looking at the details of how a market order works. From Hayek’s point of view, Coase’s firms are one kind of “individual” that makes use of the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. Needless to say, however, this is a bit too facile, for a number of reasons. In important respects, Coase and Hayek really are addressing the same problem: what are the limits of the market and of the firm? At first glance, and as a significant number of students have insisted, Coase has the better story. Whereas Hayek abstracts away from costs of using markets in order to make his case against central planning, Coase seems to have a unified theory of both firm and market. The number of transactions internalized—the size of the firm—is determined at the margin between the costs of using the price system and the costs of internal management. On closer inspection, however, Coase’s account is arguably as one-sided as Hayek’s. Coase has a well-developed (and, I would add, often misunderstood and generally underappreciated) theory of the costs of using the price system. (More on which presently.) But his “theory” of the costs of internal administration amounts to little more than a claim that there are inevitably decreasing returns to the managerial function (for reasons largely unspecified) and perhaps to other factors of production as well. By contrast, Hayek has a subtle theory of the costs of centralized administration; and, although he doesn’t apply it to the cost side of markets or to coordination within firms, his approach via the knowledge problem is actually quite relevant to those Coasean issues. Let’s begin with Coase. What did he see as the source of those “costs of using the price system”? At first, they seem to be simple search costs. The “most obvious cost of ‘organizing’ production through the price mechanism,” he says, “is that of discovering what the relevant prices are” (Coase 1937, p. 390). A second type of cost is that of executing separate contracts for each of the multifold market transactions that would be necessary to coordinate some complex production activity. Notice, however, that costs of these two sorts really exist only under circumstances of novelty and change. If nothing changes in my pattern of transacting, I won’t need to keep searching, and I can continue to trade with the same partners over time. Moreover, if I’m sure nothing unexpected will happen, I can further reduce the frictional costs of contact-writing by arranging a single long-term contract with each partner. “It may be desired to make a long-term contract for the supply of some article or service,” Coase writes. Now, owing to the difficulty of forecasting, the longer the period of the contract is for the supply of the commodity or service, the less possible, and indeed, the less desirable it is for the person purchasing to specify what the other contracting party is expected to do. It may well be a matter of indifference to the person supplying the service or commodity which of several courses of action is taken, but not to the purchaser of that commodity or service. But the purchaser will not know which of these several courses he will want the supplier to take. Therefore, the service which is being provided is expressed in general terms, the exact details being left until a later date. … The details of what the supplier is expected to do is not stated in the contract but is decided later by the purchaser. When the direction of resources (within the limits of the contract) becomes dependent on the buyer in this way, that relationship which I term a “firm” may be obtained. (Coase 1937, pp. 391–392.) The essence of the firm, and its source of advantage over product markets, lies in its flexibility in circumstances of change and uncertainty. Why is a firm more flexible? By substituting an employment contract for a spot contract in output, “the buyer” can manage economic activity in real time. As Herbert Simon (1951) explains, under an employment relation, “the buyer” pays a wage for the right to choose which action x ∈ Ω the worker will perform, where Ω is the “job description” or set of allowable actions for which the worker contracts. The worker thus agrees ahead of time to the abstract contours of what he or she may be asked to do; the worker also agrees that, within those limits, the wage-payer has authority—the right to dictate a decision in any circumstances not spelled out explicitly in the original contract (Tirole 1988, p. 464). To Coase, the firm really is an instance of (some kind of) central planning. Note also for future reference that the kind of uncertainty that gives rise to the Coasean firm does not stray far from the neoclassical understanding of that concept: the uncertainty is about which task will be needed at a particular moment, not about the set of possible tasks or the precise nature of those tasks.Footnote 1
 Coase’s article helped inspire the revival of interest in the economics of organization beginning in the 1970s with the work of Alchian and Demsetz (1972), Williamson (1975) and others.Footnote 2 Much of that revival, including the early Williamson, also stressed coordination advantages as a reason for the existence of firms. But much of it began to focus on quite different “costs of using the price system”: moral hazard, principal-agent problems, information (not knowledge) asymmetry, and what Williamson took to calling “opportunism.” Within the mainstream economics literature, this concern with incentives quickly came to dominate and largely crowd out explanations from coordinationFootnote 3 (Langlois and Foss 1999). Needless to say, one cannot ignore issues of incentives and information asymmetry. From an Austrian point of view, however, the rise to near-exclusive prominence of these issues was a development to be lamented. The point of my student assignment is to get people to move in the opposite direction—to think about how to enrich Coase’s Marshallian story with a thicker account of coordination in the face of uncertainty and to extend that knowledge-and-coordination approach symmetrically from the price system into the internal structure of the firm. The other side of the coin, of course, is that this lacuna in mainstream theorizing also constitutes an intellectual opportunity to bring Austrian ideas to bear on the Coasean question. In their 1985 synthesis of the Austrian program, O’Driscoll and Rizzo famously noted that “there is no subjectivist or Austrian theory of the firm” (O’Driscoll and Rizzo 1985, p. 123). By the time O’Driscoll and Rizzo penned these words, however, an Austrian answer to the Coasean question was already beginning to emergeFootnote 4 (Langlois 1984, 1988; Silver 1984); and by the 1990s, this once empty ground had become a lively bazaar of Austrian theories of the firm (Dulbecco and Garrouste 1999; Foss 1994; Langlois 1992; Lewin and Phelan 2000; Sautet 2000; Yu 1999). At the same time, ideas were emerging from other fringes of the economics profession (Nelson and Winter 1982; Teece 1980) and from business schools (Wernerfelt 1984) that would arguably dovetail with some of these Austrian approaches. Indeed, at this point the ground is so overrun with footprints that forensics would be a rather tedious and perhaps fruitless exercise; so in what follows I will stick largely to my own ideas without too much worry about differences with other contributions.",20
26.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,13 August 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-011-0165-1,Firms as knowledge repositories,September 2013,Randall G. Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The theory of the firm is based on the assumption that firms act to maximize profit, so it is worth considering this assumption first when looking into rationales for the existence of firms. In the neoclassical theory of the firm competitive firms have to maximize profit just earn a “normal profit” and stay in business, so neoclassical competitors that do not maximize profit disappear from the economy. Monopolies in the neoclassical framework earn above-normal profit, so there is some room for slack in the static neoclassical monopoly. However, in a dynamic economy conditions are always changing, and firms with monopoly power at one point in time can lose it if competitors are able to enter their markets, or if competitors develop new products that erode the demand for the monopolist’s output. Competing firms can, over time, acquire some of a firm’s tacit knowledge through imitation, research, and reverse engineering, and more significantly, competing firms can develop new knowledge, new products, and new production processes that render the products and processes of existing firms obsolete. The activities of those who run firms can be divided into two general categories: management and entrepreneurship (Penrose 1959: ch. 3; Boudreaux and Holcombe 1989). The managerial activities of the firm are along the lines of the neoclassical theory of the firm, where firms maximize profits by choosing the optimal quantities of inputs and by monitoring their use so that they are not used inefficiently, following Alchian and Demsetz (1972). This characterization of the firm’s activities works well within an equilibrium framework, but in the more dynamic economy described by Schumpeter (1934) it fails to describe the more important entrepreneurial activities of those who run firms. As Langlois (2007) notes, a key role of the firm is to enable entrepreneurs to solve coordination problems that arise because of change and uncertainty. In the neoclassical framework competitive firms are assumed to produce homogeneous products and work within given production functions to combine inputs into output. But the homogeneous output in neoclassical competitive markets is an assumption of the model, not a conclusion logically derived from it. In the real-world competitive economy, one of the most effective competitive strategies is to differentiate one’s product by making it better than those sold by other firms, as Holcombe (2009) explains. Better, in this context, means producing more value for consumers, and profit is a signal that consumers value the innovation more than the cost of bringing it to market. Despite the neoclassical assumption of homogeneous products in competitive markets, in the real world product differentiation is a common competitive strategy. Not only is product differentiation consistent with competitive behavior, it is an essential element of competition that is necessary for a firm’s survival over time. In contrast with the neoclassical model of competition, when entrepreneurs look at their production functions, they realize that they can alter product characteristics to improve their products. They realize they can redesign their production processes to alter their production processes. They realize that they can use different inputs. Labor and capital are not homogeneous, so they can hire workers who have more human capital. Sometimes, a better strategy is to change the nature of their capital so that they can use workers with less human capital, and therefore who command a lower wage. For a trivial example, cash registers that can scan product bar codes, and that automatically calculate the change due, have replaced cash registers from decades ago that required cashiers to key in prices and to calculate the change due themselves, lowering the human capital that is required to be a cashier. Similarly, high-level programming languages lower the human capital required to code computer programs. An entrepreneur recognizes that every parameter of the production function can be altered, as noted by Boudreaux and Holcombe (1989). Taking an entrepreneurial view of the competitive firm, profit maximization does not mean settling for a normal profit, it means looking for better production methods and looking for ways of improving a product’s characteristics to be able to make more desirable products at a lower cost. As Holcombe (2009) explains, product differentiation is the engine of economic progress. Firms do not differentiate their products just to make them different. To do so incurs a cost, but gives the firm no competitive advantage over its rivals. Rather, firms differentiate their products to make them better than those of their rivals, so that consumers will prefer their products to those produced by other firms. Over time, products become better and production methods become more efficient. This entrepreneurial strategy of continually looking for ways to improve a firm’s products, and continually looking for ways to lower a firm’s costs, is the profit-maximizing competitive strategy, not looking for the optimal combination of inputs to produce a product like everyone else’s. Even within a narrow neoclassical framework, if neoclassical competitive firms cannot earn above a normal profit but firms with monopoly power can, the profit-maximizing strategy is to look for ways to gain some market power. Entrepreneurial firms will always be looking for this type of competitive advantage, which means that all firms must be entrepreneurial, or they will be left behind by those that are. If some firms are acting entrepreneurially while others are only following the neoclassical formula of minimizing costs, those firms run by neoclassical managers will fall further and further behind entrepreneurial firms, until eventually their normal profits will turn into losses and they will be driven out of business. The fact that some firms in a competitive environment are entrepreneurial means that all firms must be, if they are to survive in an environment of inevitable economic progress. As long as the entrepreneurial innovations firms bring to market remain with the innovating firm alone, the firm can earn profits from the innovation. If other firms are able to see and imitate the innovation, the profit from it will be competed away. If the knowledge underlying the innovation is not tacit, other firms can copy it, but if the innovation results from tacit knowledge—a manufacturing innovation that must be observed to be understood, and that is not apparent from looking at the final product, for example—then the firm can maintain control over the knowledge and continue to profit from the innovation. The entrepreneur has an incentive to have knowledge shared within the boundaries of the firm to make the firm more profitable, but has an incentive to keep knowledge from escaping the firm’s boundaries to prevent the advantage the knowledge brings from being competed away.",15

Walton Lillihei was performing life-saving surgery on children with blue baby syndrome. That surgery often left the children needing to be temporarily attached to a pacemaker. The pacemakers at the time were large devices that required their own carts and relied on wall current for power. As a result of a power blackout on October 31, 1957, one of Dr. Lillihei’s young patients died. Dr. Lillihei had worked with Bakken before, and asked him the next day if he could solve the problem. Bakken found a circuit diagram for a metronome in Popular Electronics, and a few weeks later, Bakken delivered a battery-powered transistorized pacemaker about the size of a few decks of cards to Dr. Lillihei. The Food and Drug Administration did not start regulating medical devices until 1976, so much to Bakken’s astonishment, when he came in the next day, he found the pacemaker already in use on a patient. Over the next several years, Bakken and [the company he founded] Medtronic went on to work with other doctors to develop fully implantable pacemakers, but they also veered toward bankruptcy. Borrowed money kept Medtronic going. Source: Wikipedia; corroborated in personal conversation with Earl Bakken. The Post-it note was invented in 1968 by Dr Spencer Silver, a 3 M scientist who stumbled upon a glue that was not sticky enough. In 1974, a colleague of his, Arthur Fry, was singing in a church choir and frustrated that his bookmarks kept falling out of his hymnal. He applied some of Silver’s glue to his markers. 3 M launched the product in 1977 but it failed as consumers had not tried the product. A year later 3 M swamped Boise, Idaho with samples. 90% of people who tried them said that they would buy the product. By 1980 the product was sold nationwide and a year later they were launched in Canada and Europe. Source: Wikipedia.",41

Evans,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Despite the significance and impact of corporate culture upon organisational performance (Peters and Waterman 1982; Denison 1984; Kotter and Heskett 1992), rigorous ethnographic techniques are relatively absent in the management literature. This won’t do—culture is too important to be left undefined and unrefined, and analysts need a deeper awareness of the anthropological and sociological frameworks that can clarify cultural analysis. There are many cultural factors that would appear to influence the functioning of a corporation, such as having common goals, employee loyalty and commitment, clearly defined roles, strong leadership, individual and joint accountability, innovation, effective incentive mechanisms, or tolerance toward alternative cultures. This article intends to outline the grid-group framework (which has subsequently become known as “Cultural Theory”) from the perspective of corporations, to demonstrate not only why culture matters, but also how it can be analysed. It will demonstrate the relationship between the cultural factors listed, to show how they complement and conflict with each other. Grid-group is a typology of social environments created by anthropologist Mary Douglas in the 1970s (Douglas 1996), and has been adapted, modified and applied over the subsequent years to develop into a subject of it’s own.Footnote 1 The basic premise is that cultural relativism can be transcended through the application of a universally applicable framework. Competing moral systems, worldviews and ideologies are brought into the realm of comparative analysis by imposing a typology of social environments. According to Douglas, “The book was an attempt to develop Durkheim’s programme for a comparative sociology of religion so that it could apply as well to Australian totemism as to modern industrial society” (Douglas 1996). Although the framework has born much fruit when applied to modern industrial society, it has given less attention to the study of modern industry, and therefore remains a relatively unknown principle amongst organisational and management scholars. According to Maesschalck (2004) it has been mostly applied to public administration and public policy debates, “and much less for in-depth case studies of real-life organizations” (p.377). This article focuses on the theoretical and methodological foundations of Grid-Group so that it is more conducive to a contemporary, empirical agenda. It is fair to say that the grid-group framework has evolved over the last 30 years. This evolution has been a consequence of Mary Douglas’ own restatements of the typology, as well as the interpretations made by others.Footnote 2 Although this evolution is a good sign, it poses a challenge to those who wish to use it, for it is simply untenable to “apply” grid-group with neutrality—since any utilisation must now choose between alternative (and conflicting) interpretations. One is forced into either adopting a specific version of grid-group (and rejecting the alternatives), or to generate a distinct and fresh position. In this article I intend to apply grid-group to a particular form of social life—the commercial organisation—and take a methodological position—from the Austrian school of economics—that differs from all other uses of the framework. I will refer to this new account of grid-group, as “Corporate Cultural Theory”. It builds directly upon Douglas (1996) and utilises subsequent advances (especially Thompson et al. 1990), but ultimately stands on its own terms.Footnote 3
 The paper will progress with three sections. Firstly, I will clarify the foundations of the way in which I propose to use Cultural Theory, and outline four key propositions: that the given social environment is diverse, that social wholes should be analysed with recourse to the interaction of individuals; that the boundary of the organisation is ambiguous; and that scarcity applies to cultural phenomena (and therefore trade offs have to be made). In section 3 I look at each of the two axes that underpin Cultural Theory: grid (the extent of imposed regulation) and group (the extent of shared constraints). I re-label them as conformity and allegiance, and demonstrate how the former demonstrates a balance between novelty vs. procedures; whilst the latter involves a balance between accountability vs. solidarity. Finally, section 4 looks at the methodological issues raised by this framework, showing that the study of corporate culture requires interpretation, and I conclude with the position that high performance should be pursued through constitutional efforts to create harmony between competing cultures.",3

Mulligan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Should probability be considered objective or subjective? Is it an objective property of the external world, or the consequence of our limited knowledge of a causal-deterministic universe? This paper will argue that probability is a subjective phenomenon, but one which is frequently given a mistaken ""objectivist"" interpretation. Part of the reason for this surely derives from the formalism of the relative frequency mathematical definition of probability. It will be argued that the relative frequency approach, though objectively valid as mathematics, is misapplied as a description of the reality of subjective experience. In this realm, purportedly objective interpretations of probability are no more valid or applicable than the theorems of Euclidean geometry. The neo-indeterminist school of physics cites the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as the basis for setting aside deterministic causality in the sub-atomic realm. This interpretation will also be criticized below, however, even if it is admitted, it will be argued that it has no real implications for the macroscopic physical world, and even less impact on the subject matter of the social sciences. Section 2 below, ""Subjective Probability,"" presents a discussion of various arguments that probability should be viewed as objective or subjective; Section 3, ""The Objective Interpretation of Probability in the Natural Sciences,"" discusses the Heisenberg uncertainty principle; Section 4, ""Probability in the Social Sciences,"" develops the alternative, though perhaps surprisingly complementary, views of John Maynard Keynes, Ludwig von Mises, and Trygve Haavelmo; Section 5 concludes.",2

Similarly, less than half of self-employed persons remain self-employed past the 6 years mark, with a long term success rate of about 40% (Shane 2008: p. 99). Nonetheless, one in four entrepreneurs who close their business try again another venture (Schutjens and Stam 2006). Given this rather high rate of closures and perseverance in what, at least at first glance, seems like error, we are lead to ask: Are people starting new businesses overconfident and deluding themselves about their chances of success (Wu and Knott 2006)? In other words, does the entrepreneurial engine of our economy depend in some fundamental way on the irrational urge of some people? There are three theoretical positions with respect to this question, three ways in which one can attempt to contest the apparent irrationality of entrepreneurship, either placing it in a probabilistic framework or by denying that probability theory can legitimately be applied to the issue of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship can be addressed probabilistically either by using a rational expectations (objective probabilities) approach or a Bayesian (subjective probabilities) approach. By contrast, following Knight’s distinction between risk and uncertainty, entrepreneurship remains in the realm of the unmeasurable. These three approaches lead to very different strategies of trying to assess the rationality of entrepreneurship. The present paper explores mainly the Bayesian approach, focusing on the differences in background assumptions that entrepreneurs make, and shows how the Austrian theory of entrepreneurship (usually following Knight) can be enriched. The paper proceeds in the following manner. Section 2 highlights the main differences between the three perspectives on entrepreneurial rationality. Section 3 briefly explains why the Knightian approach is outdated (and has been so for a long time) and restates the risk-uncertainty distinction from the Bayesian perspective. Section 4 distinguishes neoclassical surprise from Austrian (“radical”) surprise and shows how to use the existing “Bayesian theory of surprise” Itti and Baldi’s (2005, 2006) to measure both of them. It is thus shown that, contrary to critics who have claimed that Austrian surprise is a hopelessly vague concept (Caplan 1999, 2001), it is in fact in no way more mysterious or hard to measure than the more familiar neoclassical surprise (low probability events happening). The ability to measure radical surprise leads to an improvement in the Bertrand competition model. Section 5 shows that the unlistability problem emphasized by Kirzner (1997) or O’Driscoll and Rizzo (1985), as an objection to the use of Bayesian theory, is actually far less serious or untractable. Section 6 explores one of the most important consequences of the present theory: Bayesian theory is not only able to model epistemic heterogeneity, but it also makes clear why the emergence of common knowledge is not automatic, happening merely as an inherent consequence of “rationality”, but requires instead the working of a social process of the type proposed by Boettke and Coyne (2009).",9

He knows, for example, that the way to get ahead in Italy is to “carry the bag” (“fare il portaborse”) for powerful people. He also knows that crony capitalism has grievously undermined Italian social capital, leaving the population distrustful of markets, of the government, and of one another. When he came to the U.S. in the late 1980s to study economics at MIT, Zingales found that his adopted nation was fabulously rich in social capital. His first American hurricane showed him that Americans (or at least Bostonians) faithfully take the advice of local authorities to “stay at home, tape the windows, and so on.” If an Italian mayor had told him to tape his windows, he says, “I would assume that his brother sold tape” (172). Like his National Affairs piece, some of the best passages of A Capitalism explore the messy relationship between culture, markets, and government. “In order to survive in a democratic country,” he avers, “a free-market meritocracy must offer large, widespread benefits to citizens and possess a welcoming culture” (20). But “when voters lose confidence in the economic system because they perceive it as corrupt, then the sanctity of private property becomes threatened as well. And when property rights are not protected, the survival of the free-market system itself is in doubt” (xxii). The problem can become self-reinforcing. As the public turns against markets and property rights, companies—aware that at any moment the mob might turn on them—demand more privileges from the state (xxii).Footnote 2

Allen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As mentioned in the preface to my book, my early venture into the quirky institutions of the pre-modern world was quite modest. I was only interested in finding out why an untrained civilian would pay a large sum of money to be an officer in the King’s army. At the time, almost 20 years ago, I knew nothing of ‘old corruption,’ nor of the condemnation so many had passed over it. Eventually, however, I came to realize that there was a deep institutional shift that took place, mostly throughout the nineteenth century, after which emerged the institutional world with which we are so familiar. This ‘revolution’ in mostly civil institutions has been largely ignored by economists–including those with a historical affection. And so my simple goal in writing The Institutional Revolution was to present a cogent and testable argument that could fit all of the pieces together. As stated in the preface: If there is merit in what I have done, others will elaborate, formalize, correct my faux pas, and formally test the theory. [p. xiii, 2012] This symposium has allowed others to both praise and critique my work. By the praises of such distinguished scholars, I am most humbled; for the criticisms, I am most grateful. Grateful because they allow me the opportunity to defend my idea, to elaborate on some of the more subtle points, and to pontificate on my views of institutions and efficiency. There are both common and specific issues raised in the papers by McCloskey, Espin and Mokyr, and Langlois. All three spend considerable time articulating their own distinct theories, all three suggest (some with more force than others) that the idea of measurement is too weak to support such massive institutional change, and all three challenge some of my interpretations of history. With respect, most of these issues result from an under-appreciation of the full meaning and power of the transaction cost framework first laid out by Coase (1960) and then developed by others. For this reason, I begin my defence with a restatement of the Coasean approach, which I will draw on throughout. I then turn to the specific claims made by each author.",2

Duncan,Christopher J. Coyne,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 2010, the United States government spent more on national defense ($738.8 billion) than it did at the height of the Cold War spending in 1986 ($572 billion), when the U.S. was competing in an arms race against the then superpower U.S.S.R.Footnote 1 Rather than facing the threat of a large, consolidated enemy such as the Soviet Union, the U.S. is currently focused on two foreign wars against smaller, decentralized enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the seemingly endless transnational War on Terror. Of course, it is not only the public sector that has increased spending for defense purposes. Mueller and Stewart (2011: 4) indicate that private sector spending for homeland security has increased by $110 billion between 2001 and 2011. The business of ending terrorism is a thriving one, and Eisenhower’s military-industrial complex thrives along with it. Yet what is the true cost of this thriving complex, where the government and the private sectors intersect? The central argument of this paper is that the costs of that intersection have so far been understated, as they do not take into account the full forgone opportunities of the resources drawn into the war economy. The opportunity costs are far more extensive than those counted simply in defense spending budgets. Indeed, once the United States entered into the state of permanent war, starting with World War II, a new equilibrium was established whereby resources are continuously drawn from the non-military sector to support and advance military-related activities in what has become a “permanent war economy.” The permanent war economy leads to a reshaping of the private economy through a process that can be summarized as follows. A state of permanent war leads, inevitably, to a larger military and more military expenditures. The redirected resources dedicated to the military sets in motion a process whereby private market activity is distorted as private actors respond to the opportunities presented by a state of permanent war and adjust their behaviors to take advantage of new profit opportunities. As the state of permanent war persists, the private economy becomes increasingly intertwined with the state. The result is a bloated corporate state and a less dynamic private economy, the vibrancy of which is at the heart of increased standards of living. Therefore, in undermining the private economy, the permanent war economy ultimately stifles the process of wealth creation harming the well being of citizens. The purpose of this paper is to flesh out how this distortive process operates. In doing so, we highlight a cost of the permanent war economy that is typically overlooked when discussing the costs of the U.S. military. The concern over the military-industrial complex is not a new one. As the opening quote indicates, in 1961 President Dwight Eisenhower warned of the need to maintain vigilance against what he termed the “military-industrial complex.” Indeed, he explicitly recognized the rise of a permanent war economy when he noted that: [W]e have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. Eisenhower’s warning came as a response to the shift in the way the nation’s defense had been undertaken since World War II. By the end of the war, the idea of defense had become one of constant preparation for future wars and foreign interventions rather than an exercise in response to one-off threats. The military and private industry combined their efforts in an attempt to keep the U.S. forever in a state of military readiness. As per Eisenhower’s speech this paper analyzes some of the “grave implications” of the military-industrial complex for the structure of the private economy. The economics profession has not let Eisenhower’s words go entirely unheeded. Raymond (1964) argues that free enterprise becomes less free as it becomes more associated with the defense industry. In the name of national security, businesses dealing in defense come under the direct scrutiny of the Pentagon and its industrial security officer, increasing the red tape and overall costs of doing business. Melman (1971) explores the role of Robert McNamara in centralizing the military-industrial complex beneath the Department of Defense and explains how political clout becomes the currency of the complex. The later work of Melman (1985) builds upon his earlier piece, giving an in-depth description of how the permanent war economy furthers the politicization of those involved in the complex. Higgs (1987), 2004, 2005, 2006, 2012) describes how the state derives its power from historical crises, especially wars, growing in size to deal with each one and never quite giving up as much power as it gained once the crisis passes. This pattern gives rise to what he refers to as the “ratchet effect,” with incremental growth in state size and authority over time. Finally, Rockoff (2012) analyzes a century of American foreign policy to understand how these efforts were financed in order to understand how war has influenced the U.S. economy. Neither has the idea of opportunity cost gone entirely unrecognized in the economics literature on national defense. Economists as early as Adam Smith recognized that war is a costly endeavor, and an empire that grows too large will find itself difficult to protect. In writing on the costs of protecting and enforcing British imperialism he notes, “The interest of this [military] debt alone is not only greater than the whole extraordinary profit which it ever could be pretended was made by the monopoly of the colony trade…” (Smith 1776: 180). The efforts to both protect and intimidate the satellites of the British Empire were bankrupting the Empire itself. In more modern economics, Oi (1967), and later Henderson (2005), acknowledge the understated costs of the military draft that was kept in effect in the United States until 1973. Milton Friedman (1976), along with the aforementioned writings of Oi and Henderson, argue that the budgetary cost for military personnel during those draft years was understated due to its failure to take into account the opportunity cost in terms of the voluntary private employment forgone by the draftees. There are also attempts to calculate the forgone opportunities of resources used in the military-industrial complex. Russet (1971) uses Gross National Product (GNP) calculations to estimate first the losses to productivity in the private sector and then the losses to investment in other areas of the public sector. Higgs (2006) constructs similar calculations of GNP to make the distinction between “butter-sacrificing” during military buildup and “butter-enhancing” during a demobilization period. He shows empirically that “[c]hanges in the [Government Military] and [Private] shares [of Gross National Product] were almost exactly offsetting. A trade-off equation fitted to the annual changes during 1948–89 has a tight fit (R2 = 0.814) and shows that the implicit cost of a one-percentage-point increase in the military share was a reduction of one percentage point in the private share” (Higgs 2006: 132). Yet even these previous works do not tell the full story. While mobilizations and demobilizations will have tradeoff effects, it does not speak to the full costs of a permanent war economy. The permanency of the war economy means that the distortions last far longer, and extend far deeper into the private economy, than those suffered in the emergency of actual war. An accounting measure of the economy cannot fully realize the foregone alternatives in entrepreneurial activity. The advent of the permanent structure of the military-industrial complex introduces a situation that creates “pure profit opportunities that would otherwise have been absent” which “simultaneously reduce or possibly eliminate other opportunities for pure profit that might otherwise have existed” (Kirzner 1985: 144). The new equilibrium establishes incentives to further invest in military-related activities, creating further divergence from what would have been and thus greater costs in terms of forgone opportunities. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some indicators of the magnitude of the permanent war economy with the purpose of highlighting the resources that are redirected from the non-military to the military sectors. Section 3 explores the changing equilibrium in terms of Kirzner’s (1985) un-simulated, stifled and superfluous discovery processes, then analyzes the encroachment of the permanent war economy upon the non-military economy in terms of the dynamics of interventionism (see Mises [1920] 1990, [1929] 1996, [1949] 2007; Ikeda 1997, 2005). Section 4 concludes with the implications of our analysis.",29

Lester,Jonathan S. Wolff,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The distinctive feature of Austrian macroeconomics is its serious treatment of the economy’s structure of production. In contrast to other schools of economic thought, macroeconomists in the Austrian tradition see the economic process as inherently sequential and focus on the responses of relative prices and quantities at various stages in the production structure to exogenous economic events. Despite the theoretical importance of changes in the structure of production, little empirical evidence, with exceptions discussed below, has been documented establishing the validity of its predictions. We take steps towards filling this void. The exogenous economic event studied in this paper is an expansion of credit by the central bank. In other words, we investigate the claims made by Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT).Footnote 1 Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce two publicly available data sets that explicitly distinguish industries and commodities by their distance from consumable output. This partitioning of industries and commodities is very close to what Austrians have in mind with “early stages”, those far away from final consumable output, and “late stage”, those close to final consumable output. Second, we carefully define what an “exogenous monetary policy shock” actually is and use established empirical methods to identify these shocks in the data.Footnote 2 Finally, we use structural vector autoregressions (VARs) to trace out the dynamic responses of relative prices and quantities of different stages of production in response to a monetary policy shock. ABCT predicts that a central bank expansion leads to a misalignment of the natural and the market rate of interest with the latter decreasing relative to the former. Entrepreneurs mistakenly believe that consumers have shifted demand in favor of future consumption relative to current consumption and, consequently, move factors of production into earlier stages of production. While more resources are allocated to stages early in the production process, consumers simultaneously raise their demand for current goods due to the decrease in the market rate of interest. Mises (1912) referred to these phenomena as malinvestment and overconsumption and ascribed this behavior to the boom phase of a business cycle. Since the new entrepreneurial time pattern of production is inconsistent with consumer preferences, this structure of production is unsustainable and eventually must be corrected. Entrepreneurs facing increasingly binding resource constraints liquidate projects and leave structures incomplete. The bust phase is characterized by declining income paid to factors, including labor, as well as a contraction in investment and consumption. Although the framework of analysis and predictions of ABCT are for the most part unique, they share some common elements with more recent theories of the business cycle.Footnote 3 Neoclassical macroeconomics, as illustrated in Lucas (1972), Kydland and Prescott (1982), or Barro and Gordon (1983), emphasizes the dynamic nature of economic decision making, the informational content embodied in prices, and, in Kydland and Prescott’s case, the fact that a capital stock takes time to build. Additionally, New Keynesians such as Woodford (2003) draw a distinction between the market and Wicksellian rates of interest and show that the economy operates at a constrained first best when the market rate is equal to the Wicksellian rate. These elements are all embodied in ABCT. However, ABCT emphasizes the sequential nature of production and resource allocation between various stages of production. As ABCT holds many of the same features of modern macroeconomics, we believe that establishing the empirical relevance of features distinct to ABCT deserve to be fleshed out. One problem facing empirical macroeconomists in the Austrian tradition is a shortage of data that corresponds to their theory. Business cycle accounting, as in Prescott (1986), focuses on the model’s ability to match second moments of aggregate statistics like output, consumption, and investment. These statistics are readily available, reported at quarterly frequencies by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In contrast, while ABCT makes predictions about what will happen to these aggregate statistics during the expansion and contraction, its distinctive features lie in what is happening to the relative prices and outputs of goods at various stages of production. For this, traditional aggregate statistics are entirely inadequate. Fortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates separate producer price indexes for goods differentiated by their stage-of-process.Footnote 4In addition, stage-of-process industrial production data is available from the Federal Reserve Board. Critical to note is that both these measures distinguish how far away goods are from their final use, which precisely captures the idea of a sequential structure of production. Moreover, these series have the added benefit of being available at a monthly frequency, thus making them amenable to studying the effects of monetary policy. We have five variables we use to proxy for monetary policy: the federal funds rate (FFR), the monetary base, M1, M2, and a series of exogenous monetary policy changes constructed by Romer and Romer (2004). All of these measures are discussed in detail in the empirical portion of the paper. Using a structural VAR, we estimate a system of equations and use the estimated coefficients to trace out the impulse response functions of each stage-of-process variable to an exogenous monetary policy shock. Additionally, we trace out the effects of aggregate variables such as industrial production, unemployment, capacity utilization, and labor force participation. Our results are sumarized as follows. First, an unexpected decline in the FFR leads to an increase in industrial production, capacity utilization, labor force participation and a decrease in unemployment. These results confirm the prediction of ABCT: previously unused and underutilized resources are drawn into production following credit expansion. The results for the relative prices and quantities are more ambiguous. Whether or not the late stage and early stage quantities and prices expand relative to their intermediate counterparts depends on the specific variable used to proxy for monetary policy, the time period under consideration, and what variables are included in the VAR. In many of the exercises, the response of variables on impact is opposite of what is predicted by the theory. However, across all specifications, the effects on relative prices and quantities are small. A 100 basis point decline in the FFR leads to no greater than a 0.5 % increase in any price or quantity index relative to another and the responses are estimated imprecisely. In contrast, aggregate industrial production expands by 2 % and has a tighter confidence interval. We conclude that evidence in favor of ABCT is, at best, mixed. Despite the difficulty in taking theory to the data, several authors have evaluated ABCT quantitatively. Keeler (2001) and Mulligan (2002, 2006) document evidence consistent with ABCT. Young (2005), using job flow data at the industry level, shows that labor demand is sensitive to the interest rate, but notes that the magnitudes are not economically significant. Additionally, Young (2012), using the Total Industry to Industry Requirements data from the BEA, constructs a measure of “roundaboutness” for each industry and also for the economy as a whole. He shows that as the FFR fell below the interest rate recommended by the Taylor rule starting in 2002, the industries furthest back from final consumption experienced the biggest increase in prices and value added growth and subsequent to the bust in 2008 experienced the biggest decrease in prices and quantities. Finally, Carilli and Dempster (2008), after proxying for the natural rate of interest, show that deviations of the market rate from the natural rate Granger cause deviations in output. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no one has evaluated ABCT using the Federal Reserve Board and BLS stage-of-process data. Understanding how monetary policy affects relative prices and the structure of production, however, is vital to the Austrian theory and, consequently, our analysis fills a void in the literature. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 elaborates on the Mises-Hayek theory and makes clear the main empirical implications of the model. Section 3 describes the data set and its advantages over previously explored data. The baseline empirical method is presented in Section 4, and the results in Section 5. Section 6 then presents several robustness checks, and finally, Section 7 concludes.",24

26.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,24 March 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0218-8,An entrepreneurial critique of Georgism,December 2013,Zachary Gochenour,Bryan Caplan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As no man made the land, so no man can claim a right of ownership in the land. – Henry George The public finance theory of Henry George has gotten intermittent attention over the years, with many eminent names in economics making at least a passing comment,Footnote 6 but it has seen comparably little action in the policy debate arena and has been largely ignored by the modern era of academic economics. As Georgist economist Fred Foldvary writes, “Debates on tax reform, for example, focus on tapping streams of income or output, ignoring the possibility and advantage of using rents unrelated to human effort, thus eliminating disincentives, tax wedges, and excess burdens” (1996, p. 169). This paper investigates whether such rents “unrelated to human effort” can truly exist. To be clear, when referring to “ground rent” in this paper we mean the net present value of the land devoid of physical improvements such as buildings. Henry George’s writing comes on the heels of the American Civil War and the end of slavery, an era of exploration and spreading population and infrastructure. The construction of railroads was followed quickly by the annexation and purchase of new land, and the country was rapidly industrializing. The single tax George proposed was presented as a panacea for all of society’s ills: he writes in Progress and Poverty, “What I therefore propose, as the simple yet sovereign remedy, which will raise wages, increase the earnings of capital, extirpate pauperism, abolish poverty, give remunerative employment to whoever wishes it, afford free scope to human powers, lessen crime, elevate morals, and taste, and intelligence, purify government and carry civilization to yet nobler heights, is—to appropriate rent by taxation.” (p. 108). His plan was never carried to fruition; while the idea of a single tax had considerable influence in many small urban areas along the U.S. east coast, no locality fully dedicated itself to Georgism, making it impossible to evaluate his plan empirically. The aspect of George’s plan that has received the most attention from economists is the claim that the tax is completely non-distortionary. This boils down to an assertion that land is fixed in supply, that it has qualities unrelated to human effort that simply accrue to whoever can obtain the rights. A further claim in George’s philosophyFootnote 7 is that local public goods serve to increase the ground rent in an amount equal to the value they provide, so a tax on the ground rent must be sufficient to fund a government that provides local public goods.Footnote 8
 The distinction between “land rent” and returns on other factors of production was the subject of several critiques by Frank Knight (1921; 1924; 1933; 1953). Knight criticized the idea of “pure land value,” claiming there was no meaningful distinction between rent and interest (suggested before by Irving Fisher in 1907). Knight claimed that a tax on land is subject to all the same inefficiencies as a tax on capital because land, like capital, needs to be produced. Knight broke from the classical interpretation of land as a non-produced factor by appealing to the differences between stocks and flows: production, Knight said, is the transformation of inputs into outputs (flow) rather than physical creation. Knight was keen to point out that discovery of new land and the competition to secure exclusive access were part of the production of land. In rejecting the idea of rent entirely, he said that the entire value of land was the value of its improvements, and this value is always paid for, including by the original homesteaders of the unused land. In his 1953
Freeman article, Knight comments, “[the purchaser of land] will, of course, have to pay a price which includes any expected future increase in the capitalized yield.” This critique builds directly on Knight’s concept of land as production. Knight’s Georgist detractors focused on the fixed nature of land as proof that land was inherently unique: its fixed mobility, its inability to be discovered. Even if they accepted Knight’s definition of land as something to be produced, it still exists in fixed supply and provides rental income for the owner, and this income could be tapped without distorting economic behavior. We argue against these claims about land, and propose a mechanism by which land production consists of search with the economic profit as incentive to produce more of the resource. For context, the current amount spent by the world’s five largest oil firms represents about 8 % of their total operating costs, with spending on exploration increasing steadily since 2005—the largest oil company, ExxonMobil, spent $5.6 billion on exploration and capital projects. Exploration among the next 20 largest private held oil and natural gas providers has been steadily increasing since 1998 (Jaffe and Soligo 2007). And that’s just oil—mineral exploration costs have been rising rapidly over the past decade and are were nearly $18 billion in 2011.Footnote 9

Lea,Adam G. Martin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The connections between the modern Austrian school of economics and the Virginia school of political economy are extensive and thick. To those with but a cursory familiarity with the two schools of thought, their common ground may seem to be primarily ideological. The chief thinkers of the two schools evince an unmistakably classical liberal orientation. But there are deeper, foundational links—biographical, organizational, and intellectual—between the two schools. The organizational and biographical connections are too numerous to recount in detail here. Gordon Tullock credits his discovery of Human Action in a Yale University bookstore as precipitating his interest in applying the economic way of thinking to the bureaucracy he encountered in the State Department. Hayek was one of the first visitors to Buchanan and Nutter’s Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy at the University of Virginia. Leland Yeager, also at UVA, introduced a great many students to Austrian ideas. Organizational ties between the two schools of thought run through the William Volker Fund, Mont Pelerin Society, Institute for Humane Studies, and frequent meetings between Austrians and Virginians through Liberty Fund colloquia. In more recent years, both Buchanan and Tullock’s Public Choice Center and the only formal American graduate program in Austrian economics have been located at George Mason University (see Wagner 2004). These connections in time and place illuminate the trajectory of both schools of thought but they are not our focus here. The remainder of this essay categorizes the core intellectual connections, what we call the “three pillars” of a shared Austro-Virginian research paradigm: exchange, rules, and social cooperation. Each pillar is a core concept foundational to theoretical inquiry, empirical investigation, and even normative analysis. These three pillars are not the most obvious choices for foundational concepts in modern economics; concepts like scarcity, opportunity cost, and incentives are more likely candidates. But those latter concepts are common to all rational choice schools of thought, including both the Austrian and Virginia schools, whereas the three pillars of exchange, rules, and social cooperation denote the distinctive overlap between Vienna and Virginia. Likewise, we would not go so far as to suggest that the three pillars exhaust the distinctiveness of either school. As mutually reinforcing concepts, though, they create a shared space for a unique and fruitful research paradigm. The essays collected here aptly testify to that fertility. This symposium collects articles questioning, examining, and building on the theoretical common ground between the Austrian and Virginia schools. These articles grew out of the “From Vienna to Virginia” conference held at the Foundation for Economic Education’s Irvington headquarters in September, 2008. The conference brought together young scholars—graduate students and untenured faculty—with senior scholars whose work represents a mix of both schools. Some of the papers in this symposium were presented at the conference, while others are included because they are located in the Vienna-Virginia intersection.",1

Evans,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the introduction to a special edition of The Review of Austrian Economics devoted to this association, Boettke and Lopez (2002) claim that “market process scholars should feel at home using public choice analysis to study politics, and public choice scholars should feel at home using market process analysis to study the economy” (p.111). There are certainly similarities between the approaches. In contrast to prevailing treatments of democratic decision-making, in the seminal Public Choice text, The Calculus of Consent Buchanan and Tullock put the individual at the fore (Buchanan and Tullock 1962, p.11–15).Footnote 2 Boettke and Lopez (2002) also show that they use Austrian terms such as “praxeiological” and cite Mises favourably.Footnote 3 But despite Buchanan and Tullock’s obvious admiration for Austrian school economists such as Mises, these similarities seem at best trivial—one could point to similar statements about non-Austrian economists. In the more substantive part of Boettke and Lopez’s analysis, they point out that naïve views of political economy often attribute omniscience and benevolence on the part of policy makers. They go on to say, “Public Choice economics as developed in the 1950s and 1960s…adopted a hard-headed economics which challenged the benevolence assumption, but left the omniscience assumption alone” (Boettke and Lopez 2002, 112). This offers the promise of a “complete” approach to political economy, “in simplest terms, a combined Austrian-public choice approach to political economy would relax both assumptions” (Boettke and Lopez 2002, 112). In the same journal, Ikeda (2003) takes a different approach, making a distinction between the intentions and outcomes of policymakers. The Austrian approach attempts to retain its value-freedom by assuming good motives, but maintaining that politics fails from the perspective of politicians themselves. This creates a dichotomy, “[the starting points] for Public Choice is the divergence between announced and actual intentions… for Austrian political economy is the divergence between intended and actual outcomes” (Ikeda 2003, 65). This appears to be a crucial distinction and hinges on whether democracy produces deceptive opportunism or simply honest error.Footnote 4
 Both treatments of the issue imply that Austrian economics and Public Choice theory are two sides of the same coin, and both articles advocate a “complete” theory that unites the two.Footnote 5 However it is worth considering whether they might be overstating the similarities, and two reasons suggest that this is the case. Firstly, the fact that Public Choice theory is predominantly neoclassical means that it is ontologically, methodologically and epistemically incompatible with Austrian school economics. Secondly, omniscience and benevolence assumptions are not two sides of the same coin since the former are more fundamental problems than the latter. We shall look at each of these in turn. Austrian attention to issues such as the relationship between individual action and institutional structures, the subjectivism of knowledge and expectations, the prevalence of Knightian uncertainty—are all far from the core of Public Choice analysis. To overcome this chasm some have distinguished between the neoclassical approach and a “Virginian” branch, which is claimed to be methodologically compatible with the Austrian paradigm. Whilst the neoclassical/Chicago pathway that unites the likes of Stigler (1982), Becker (1983), and Wittman (1995) appears uncontroversial, the Virginian label requires some attention. According to this view “as the constitutional political economy project associated with the Virginia school emerged in the 1960–1980 period, the economic approach to politics also developed in alternative directions in the hands of Chicago economists such as George Stigler and Gary Becker, and Rochester political scientists, such as William Riker” (Boettke et al. 2007, 129). Boettke et al. (2007) argue that “Virginian” political economy emerged out of the constitutional political economy project from the University of Virginia. However Persson and Tabellini (2004) is a simple refutation that the field of constitutional political economy is synonymous with a “Virginian” school that is grounded in an Austrian paradigm. Indeed in the first issue of the journal Constitutional Political Economy Buchanan himself defines rational choice as being “the hard core of the research program” of constitutional economics (Buchanan 1990, 1). The existence of an Austrian-friendly “Virginian” school rests on the claim that since its founding Public Choice theory went down two separate tracks, “Standard public choice analysis followed the path of mainstream economics. The Virginia school, however, did not follow completely in line with the mainstream but certainly the Chicago School of public choice analysis did—with the result that many of the institutional inefficiencies of government action are often not recognized because the equilibrium analytics do not permit their examination” (Boettke1995, 19) One shouldn’t overlook that from the inception a certain tension existed between the intellectual perspectives of the founding fathers—Buchanan and Tullock. According to Buchanan, “My own emphasis was on modeling politics-as-exchange, under the acknowledged major influence of Knut Wicksell’s great work on public finance. By comparison… Gordon Tullock’s emphasis was on modeling public choosers (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) in strict self-interest terms. There was a tension present as we worked through the analysis of that book [The Calculus of Consent]” (Buchanan 1986, 26). In addition to this, what we understand as the “Chicago” or neoclassical style has evolved since the 1950s and 60s. Buchanan and Tullock were both trained in the Chicago manner, but as Gordon Tullock mentions in his preface to The Simons’ Syllabus, “one aspect of the modern Chicago School, the emphasis on empirical testing, is essentially post-Simons” (Simons 1983, iv). In other words after the founding of Public Choice the Chicago school became progressively more formal and quantitative. One might conclude that “Virginian” political economy is simply staying true to the roots of the Public Choice movement, siding with Buchanan versus Tullock. Buchanan goes against the neoclassical tenets of stable preferences, maximizing agents, equilibrium analysis. Indeed he has made significant contributions to subjectivist political economy (Buchanan 1989, Buchanan and Vanberg 2002) not to mention a telling contribution to subjectivist economic theory (Buchanan 1969). According to Buchanan neoclassical economics is a closed system, “there is no creation of new value potential in the model. The idealized competitive market works so as to “squeeze out” all of the value potential that is ultimately defined by the coexistence of preferences, endowments and technology…the participants in the economy, in their varying roles, choose reactively to exogenously generated changes in one or more of the parameters of the system” (Buchanan & Vanberg 2002, 122) By contrast creative choice occurs when those parameters are disrupted by an act of imagination, and is inevitable so long as action takes place over time. Two articles by Buchanan, co-authored with Victor Vanberg, provide excellent examples of how Buchanan skirts with (but doesn’t actually adopt) an epistemically-driven theory of political economy. In Vanberg and Buchanan (1989) the authors make a distinction between (complementary) “interest” and “theory” explanations. They acknowledge that Buchanan’s own work, like that of Rawls fits under the “interest” label, and provide examples such as veils of ignorance as means to cope with conflicting interests.Footnote 6 Indeed this is the contractarian approach that Buchanan was so instrumental in pioneering, but notice how the assumptions employed, such as agents being “perfectly knowledgeable about working properties of alternative rules” do not satisfy those giving serious attention to genuine ignorance. To the extent that they criticize the rent-seeking literature (p.171) they are criticizing typical public choice, and attempting to forge a new path. But this new path—the “theories” approach—is based on dialogue, and the likes of Habermas and Akerman.Footnote 7 In this case agreement derives from a discovery process rather than compromise, but note that a discovery process must be engaged in prior to a battle of interests. In Vanberg and Buchanan (1991), they again draw upon a distinction between interest-problems and knowledge-problems (p.129) and the resulting contractarian and discourse perspectives. But note that when they talk about “incentives for investment in constitutional knowledge” (p.134) they are relying on a neoclassical conception of information accumulation (see Evans and Friedman 2011). In short, they posit that those who are incentivized to invest in constitutional knowledge will accumulate it.Footnote 8
 Whilst Buchanan’s subjectivist style of political economy is indeed compatible with the Austrian school, it is not an exhaustive summary of his work. So although Virginian political economy “has been influenced by Austrian economics’ process view of the market economy” (Sutter 2002, 20) and “… has always been grounded in the exchange paradigm rather than the maximization approach” (Boettke et al. 2007, 135), it is hard to label it as being “Austrian”. The main problem with this classification is the lack of detailed evidence to support the claim that there is a distinct “Virginian” school of thought in the first place (for example a list of citations). To be sure intellectual histories of the unique environment at Virginia exist (Boettke 1987, Wagner 2004) but there is a difference between an epistemic community and a school of thought. Indeed the existing literature has not sufficiently made the following case (i) that the Virginian label has been applied to existing works in political economy that is methodologically compatible with Austrian economics (Wagner 1989 is an often touted example but even the likes of Vincent Ostrom and Douglass North would fall outside the limits of what most Austrian economists would be happy to label as ontologically, methodologically and epistemologically “Austrian”); (ii) why other Public Choice theorists who have held faculty positions in Virginia (e.g. Gordon Tullock, Robert Tollison, Roger Congleton, Thomas Strattman) are not “Virginia” school; (iii) or, if they are, then how can this be labeled “Austrian” given that such scholars have more in common with traditional Public Choice theory than the Austrian school. Ultimately there may be a plausible argument that Virginia is some sort of frontier between the two approaches, but it is hardly a locus.Footnote 9
 Consider the fact that when Wohlgemuth (1995) makes a “distinction between a Chicago school and a Virginia school of public choice” (p.74), he explains in a footnote, “the first can be characterized as a plain translation of conventional neoclassical equilibrium theory. The second does indeed imply a partial turn away from mainstream neoclassical economics, stressing unequal distributions of power and some institutional settings” (p.89). It is unclear whether or not a distinction along these lines is compatible with the distinctions drawn elsewhere (in which case whom should we follow?), but they certainly fail to mention any distinctly “Austrian” characteristics.Footnote 10
 Arguably the biggest similarity between Austrian economics and Virginian political economy is that unlike the Chicago branch Virginians retain a theory of government failure. But despite the same policy implications, there is insufficient similarities in the methods of scientific enquiry to conclude that they are one and the same, “it does not regularly analyze political markets from the perspective of disequilibrium, nor does it employ the radical subjectivism of the Austrian school in its analysis of Public Choice” (Rowley 1994, 288). These policy implications should not seduce economists to downplay the ontological, methodological and epistemological differences—an “Austrian” approach can’t simply be grafted on to the existing conclusions of even Virginian-style political economy.Footnote 11
 If the Boettke and Lopez (2002) plea to “marry” Public Choice and Austrian theory overreaches, even focusing solely on the Virginian style of Public Choice is too optimistic. Boettke et al. (2007) serves well as a rallying cry (or possibly as a statement of intent), but it is too much of a revisionist history of thought. Indeed even a prime example of an “Austrian”-infused Public Choice scholar—Vincent Ostrom—acknowledges the lack of epistemic content even in early Public Choice theory, “the place of common knowledge and communities of shared understanding in decision situations was neglected [in early Public Choice]” (Ostrom 1997, 102). The second reason why Austrian economics and Public Choice theory are not sufficiently compatible to survive an intellectual graft is what might be referred to as “the Epistemic Primacy Thesis”). In Boettke and Lopez’s (2002) terms the prospective union is based on attention to both imperfect knowledge and imperfect motives. For Ikeda (2003) the union is based on adherence to both unintended consequences and deceptive opportunism. However not only does Austrian economics already provide both of these issues, it demonstrates that they are not of equivalent analytical importance. Public ignorance, interest groups and other “Public Choice” ideas are contained in the works of the early Austrians (Boettke et al. 2004), and they did not ignore assumptions about benevolence. We might take Keynes to embody the “naïve” view of public officialdom, “moderate planning will be safe if those carrying it out are rightly oriented in their own minds and hearts to the model issues” (Keynes 1980).Footnote 12 Of course at the time Mises and Hayek were making a strategic decision to assume good intentions on policy makers so that they could demonstrate that rational calculation is impossible in a socialist commonwealth—although they did relax this on occasions. For example Hayek talk about planners sometimes being “bad” “the main merit of the individualism which he [Adam Smith] and his contemporaries advocated is that it is a system under which bad men can do least harm. It is a social system which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it, or on all men becoming better than they now are, but which makes use of men in all their given variety and complexity, sometimes good and sometimes bad, sometimes intelligent and more often stupid” (Hayek 1948, 11–12) And Mises and Hayek both acknowledged that statesmen would ignore long run problems to secure public support: “The whole system is the acme of the short-run principle. The statesmen of 1940 solve their problems by shifting them to the statesmen of 1970. On that date the statesmen of 1940 will be either dead or elder statesmen glorying in their wonderful achievement, social security.” (Mises 1998, 847) “But what politicians can possibly care about long run effects if in the short run he buys support?” (Hayek 1977) But at some fundamental level the richness of the Austrian analysis is to show how institutional factors make talk about motives erroneous. In other words, the reason Austrian scholars have concentrated on relaxing the omniscience assumption rather than benevolence is because epistemic factors take primacy over motivational ones. The original Public Choice claim for innovation was to assume behavioral symmetry between public and private agents. But the Austrian response is to deem behavioral assumptions (i) redundant (behavioral assumptions are self-evident postulates rather than part of the analysis); and (ii) irrelevant (people can only act in accordance with the information at their disposal, and this is governed by the institutional structure). The epistemic primacy thesis asserts that issues relating to benevolence, incentives and interests are corollaries (and not counterparts) to omniscience, knowledge and ideas. According to Don Lavoie the “problem of knowledge” articulated by Mises is not simply the other side of the coin to James Buchanan’s “problem of motivation”, but is more fundamental (Lavoie 1985)—as Israel Kirzner expands, “unless one could imagine that Mises’ calculation problem has somehow been solved, questions of motivation… cannot even be asked” (Kirzner 2006, 30). This view is based on the idea that without market institutions such as prices and profit and loss accounting there is no “meaningful sphere of economic coordination” (Kirzner 2006, 38)—i.e. no “economy”—that even has a motivation problem to solve. It may seem plausible that the reverse of the “epistemic primacy thesis” is true—that if policymakers are malevolent then it makes no difference whether they possess sufficient knowledge. But consider whether the reverse of Kirzner’s claim holds: “unless one could imagine that Buchanan’s motivation problem has somehow been solved, questions of knowledge… cannot even be asked”. The epistemic primacy thesis posits that this doesn’t hold, and the discipline of Constitutional Political Economy in large part explains why; it provides institutional mechanisms with which to constrain malevolence and “allow bad men to do least harm” (Mueller 1996).Footnote 13 Typical measures involve competing jurisdictions (Tiebout 1956, Sinn 1992), whilst James Buchanan (together with Victor Vanberg) also emphases the use of “veils”: “a principle remedy for the interest-based obstacle to constitutional agreement involves the introduction of some means of insuring persons’ inability reliably to foresee their future particularized interests” (Vanberg and Buchanan 1991, p. 128)Footnote 14
 The genesis of Western political thought rests on the notion of a social contract, and the strategic dance between a citizenry and their rulers. Devising constraints to bind the hands of power permeates modern attention to constitutional design. By stark contrast the scientific enterprise of solving the problems caused by radical ignorance is less emphasised. If “the knowledge problem” extends to institutional mechanisms that allow knowledge not given to any mind to be acted upon, we see how it precedes issues of incentives. Whereas politics that is saturated with self-interest does not necessarily lead to bad outcomes, when saturated by ignorance it will. The Austrian/subjectivist approach to political economy is to jettison “choice, responsive to incentives” (Caplan 2007, 123) in favour of “cognition, responsive to perceptions” (Bennett and Friedman 2008, 243).Footnote 15
 The important thing is that the epistemic primacy thesis—and resulting attention to the endogeneity of ideas and influence of institutions—is subjectivist. As Lachmann states, subjectivism is “a research programme of the social sciences which aims at elucidating social phenomena in terms of their inherent meaning, i.e. in terms of their meaning to actors” (Lachmann 1990, 243). The bottom line is that scholars must take care not to attribute the wrong motivations and meanings on the part of the people under study, and subjectivity takes motivations as revealed through action. Rather than cast aspersions as to the character and personality of policy makers, attention is drawn to the cognitive limitations they face as a consequence of their institutional environment. A classic (and sophisticated) example of Austrian economic thought applied to political economy is The Road to Serfdom, in which Hayek claims that totalitarianism is “a logical consequence of the institutional incentives of the attempts to centrally plan an economy… the arbitrary employment of power is a consequence, not a cause, of the desire to plan the economy scientifically” (Boettke 1995, 912). Even if policy makers are wholly benevolent they can only ever act on their immediate interests, and this is a result of epistemic choice, “the choice of conceptualizations, assertions, and information to be used and acted upon in problem-solving modes” (Ostrom 1997, 91). In contrast to neoclassical Public Choice, a comparative institutional approach supports the notion of government failure by showing how epistemic choice is severely curtailed in political settings. According to Boettke, “unlike the market process…democratic politics does not engender the incentives and information for its own error detection and correction…rather than spontaneous direction, politics requires conscious adaptation, and there are epistemological limits to this procedure” (Boettke 1995, 21). And this epistemological limitation provides perverse incentives to political actors, “knowledge generated in the political context may enable individuals to survive in the competitive environment of politics, but it does not lead them to exploit the opportunities for gains from economically beneficial trades and eradicate economic inefficiencies” (Boettke et al. 2007, 131)—a point that has also been developed by Holcombe (2002), Lopez (2002) and Mackenzie (2008). A preeminent example of a work of political economy that adheres to the epistemic primacy thesis is After War (Coyne 2007), which shows that with the best will in the world planners cannot export democracy through military intervention. Whether US corporations use such a conflict to further their private interests is completely secondary to the knowledge problem generated by central planning.Footnote 16 And indeed whether US military officials were surprised by the difference between their intended and actual outcomes, or whether they merely hid their intended outcomes, are two alternative (and perhaps contradictory) hypotheses. Also, whereas neoclassical public choice is institutionally hollow, Austrians are concerned with the causal role of ideas on shaping incentive structures, “where Hayek differs from the extreme public choice interpretation of the incentives within politics is how ideas (by changing the social infrastructure) can change the incentives that officials face in policy decisions” (Boettke 1995, 911). Introducing an epistemic element to the accumulation of political knowledge entails attention to epistemic communities and other institutions that generate common knowledge and shared understanding. This can only take place if preference formation is to some degree endogenous, “rather than taking ideological preferences to be exogenous, which is the assumption of standard economics and political economy” (Ikeda 2003, 71). This is in direct contrast to the Chicago approach, as Wittman assumes that “advertising, political speeches, and so on do not affect voters’ preferences” (Wittman 1995, 3 fn.2). The epistemic primacy thesis can also be extended to the distinction between ideas and interests. A thoroughgoing subjectivism doesn’t create an either/or between ideas and interests; it provides a meta-level of analysis, since “ideas provide the social infrastructure within which individuals pursue their own interest” (Boettke 1995, 9), or “ideas tell a man what his interests are” (Mises 1956, 138). Mancur Olson understood that interest-explanations might be supplemented by attention to epistemic factors, “so it appears that a balance of power or stalemate among the organized interests can leave an opening for new ideas. When the different organized powers or interests more or less offset one another, ideas may make a big difference” (Olson 1989, 46). Austrian school economists have a history of not only stressing the important causal process of ideas on policy, but that the economic ideas held by the general public tend to be erroneous. Caplan and Stringham (2005) is a noteworthy account of Mises’ understanding that the general public are hopelessly ignorance about economic understanding, and this has been corroborated empirically (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). Indeed Caplan (2003) fleshes out the importance of ideas on economic policy with his notion of the “Idea Trap”. The trouble with his approach is that the possibility of reform is left as an exogenous or accidental event, since “better policies… are endogenously unlikely to be tried” (Caplan 2003, 183). Evans (2009) utilizes the concept of “constitutional moments” to suggest how ideas can break through to generate economic reforms, but again acknowledges the preconditions of extreme events (or crisis). Aligica and Evans (2009) provide a more rigorous epistemic grounding for the study of transition processes, documenting the spread of neoliberalism in Eastern Europe and the way in which ideas influenced policy changes. To some extent the real “idea trap” is that which binds the political economist to think in neoclassical terms, and a more subjectivist approach provides the framework to transcend this constraint and understand how ideas matter.",2

Theories relying on the doctrines of private property, fairness, ethics or market efficiency have led to conflicting empirical results. The sources of support or opposition for insider trading legislation remain hotly contested. Two factors best explain these apparent ambiguities. The first is the use of the redistribution of monetary rents as the focal point of analysis instead of an approach grounded in the more fundamental issue of the redistribution of information. Second, current cost-benefit analyses are based on an analysis of the different users of inside information: insiders versus outsiders. The continuum of agents that we can consider “insiders” creates a significant grey area, with little objective criteria to distinguish certain groups. Herein, we provide a more apt distinction based on the role that agents play in the knowledge creation process. Specific issues within the broader scope of insider trading can be analyzed through a trichotomy of agents: information creators, distributors, and users. Despite conflicts and ambiguities in the research to date, one empirical fact remains clear: insider trading laws do not result in any clearly defined winners or losers. While certain conditions point to a redistribution of traditional “insider” profits to “outsiders”, the results are difficult to replicate. The ambiguity between insiders and outsiders creates difficulties when trying to discern not only which group benefits from such legislation, but also what agents belong to each group. Lacking a clearly defined group to support insider trading legislation, the existence and continued support of insider trading laws in their varied forms creates a paradox. We rectify this paradox of this support by shifting the cost-benefit analysis away from the distinction between company insiders and outsiders, to focus on the roles of creators, distributors and users of the information in question.",2

In 1882, a Swiss federal banknote law was implemented. Until then it was left to the cantons to overview note issue activities and it was not until 1907 that a nationwide monopoly of note issue by a central bank was implemented.Footnote 2 Two competing evaluations of the 19th century Swiss banking experience have been advanced. On the one hand the episode is considered, ultimately, as a failed experiment in free banking and regarded as evidence for the inherent instability of free banking systems (Neldner 1992, 1996a, 1996b, 1998, 2003). On the other hand, it is argued that the Swiss free banking experiment was a success and provides evidence for the feasibility of free banking systems (Ritzmann 1996; Weber 1988, 1992). Nonetheless, proponents of free banking (Ritzmann 1996; Weber 1992) and central bank advocates (Bordo and James 2007: 32; Neldner 1998) alike agree that the period from 1826 to the early 1880s can be considered as a successful experiment in free banking.Footnote 3 Although a proponent of central banking, Neldner regards the free banking exercise as “reasonably successful” and states that “over 80 years of competitively supplied banknotes, there had been no suspension of specie payments, only two bank failures, and no losses for note holders, while the country as a whole had benefited from a prolonged economic upswing” (1998: 289–290).Footnote 4 However, in contrast to proponents of free banking such as Ritzmann (1996) and Weber (1992), Neldner (1998) argues that as the economy became more advanced during the 1880s, the free banking system became unstable. According to Neldner low discount rates due to the competition from non-issuing banks and the absence of an effective inter-bank clearing mechanism contributed to the instability of the free banking system and led to the overissue of banknotes, giving rise to a notorious depreciation of the Swiss Franc relative to the French Franc from 1885 onwards (Neldner 1996a: 182; Neldner 1998: 290). Selgin and White (1987) argue that during its evolution a free banking system can be expected to reach certain stages of development. I make use of this evolutionary approach to free banking to provide an alternative assessment of the development of the Swiss banking system before and after the introduction of the federal banknote law in 1882. Selgin and White (1987: 444) identify three stages, which are themselves each characterized by a chain of developments, through which a banking system free of government interference evolves after commodity money has been created. First, money-transfer services that make the physical transportation of commodity money unnecessary develop. Second, easily transferable bank demand liabilities (inside money) come into existence. Third, clearing arrangements among competing banks that allow for routine exchanges of inside monies develop. My discussion of the Swiss banking system starts after the banking system reached the second stage outlined by Selgin and White (1987) when banks created inside money by issuing the first redeemable bearer banknotes and gives rise to three major claims. First, I argue that the evolution of the Swiss banking system closely maps onto the stylized evolutionary steps of a free banking system in its later stages as suggested by Selgin and White (1987). Second, and in contrast to Neldner (1996a, 1998, 2003), I maintain that after the implementation of the federal banknote law in 1882, the Swiss banking system was no longer one of free banking. Although competitive note issue continued, the imposed regulations ended the period of genuine free banking. Third, I argue that the evolutionary approach provided by Selgin and White (1987) opens the door to a better understanding of the inter-bank note exchange difficulties from which the Swiss banking system suffered during the 30 years preceding the establishment of the central bank in 1907 than alternative approaches. Failed attempts by Swiss bankers to establish well-functioning arrangements for inter-bank note exchanges during the last three decades before the introduction of the central bank in 1906 do not suggest that systems of free banking are inherently unstable. Instead, even after the introduction of the federal banknote law in 1882 such drawbacks can be considered as natural in the sense that they are the outcome of the interactions of competing banks. The next section provides background information on the 19th century Swiss banking system and compares its development with the stylized path of development described in Selgin and White (1987). Section 3 discusses the 1881 federal banknote law and its consequences. Section 4 investigates complications of the Swiss banking system over the three decades preceding the establishment of the central bank in 1907. Section 5 contains concluding remarks.",9

Holian,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In Parchment, Guns and Constitutional Order—a compact and insightful political economy essay—Richard Wagner (1993) reminds us that the so-called problem of governance boils down to the skillful administration of two fundamental elements: incentives and knowledge. Because self-interest cannot be eliminated completely from human nature, the purpose of a well-functioning governance structure is basically to steer self-interest in the right direction. But in order to do so such structure cannot focus just on governing either incentives or knowledge: in order to steer self-interest in the right direction, such structure must focus on governing both elements simultaneously. In essence, Wagner proposes that a well-functioning governance structure is one where the knowledge relevant to a task and the incentives to act on that same knowledge are aligned. Wagner’s important proposition therefore defines the governance problem, the main concern of this paper. Wagner’s proposition is made with particular attention to the governance of the public sphere. It generalizes the notion that it is not sufficient to have rules on parchment—i.e., the constitution—for democracy. What we need is also competition among different private interests—guns—to minimize the abuse or capture of parchment. Checks-and-balances are not limited to the familiar rules of democracy through the constitution. The checks-and-balances of genuine democracy are also those promoting the natural rivalry of the market process that spontaneously guides self-interest in the right direction. Hence, the general notion is that we need both knowledge (parchment) and incentives (guns) to attain and maintain well-functioning governance through time. The premise of Wagner’s proposition is that most of the literature on public governance has focused mainly on issues of incentive-alignment to the detriment of the study of how productive knowledge is employed and can be channeled to complement the workings of a society founded on classical liberal principles. In this sense, incentives are not just about minimizing deadweight losses, but also about stimulating the discovery of previously unknown opportunities, especially novel value-creating knowledge. Accordingly, incentives and knowledge are inherently inseparable. The motivation of Wagner’s essay is thus basically to correct an imbalance in the study of public governance. Here, we have the same motivation, but we take up the perspective of private governance. By re-directing attention to the knowledge aspects of the theory of the firm, we hope to sketch the contours of the problem of governance in more general terms. More specifically, we want to move a first conceptual step beyond Coase’s (1937) spectrum between firm and market by introducing a framework emphasizing the importance of knowledge as well as incentives. Coase’s familiar spectrum sees the firm on one side and the market on the other compared according to the minimization of transaction costs. By taking into account incentives and knowledge, this work instead proposes a framework to make comparisons among a greater variety of governance structures. Our proposed framework accommodates comparisons not just of kind like Coase (firm or market), but also of degree (e.g., among different types of internal organization). Moreover, although our suggested distinction derives from considerations about private governance, it equally accommodates public and private settings. To achieve our objective, we will ultimately walk a familiar trail: we will rely—and expand upon—von Hayek’s (1948
passim) insights about knowledge. At the same time, a less familiar interpretation of Coase (1937) will also come in handy. But before making our case it is useful to quickly relate knowledge and incentives to the theory of the firm literature.",1
27.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,06 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0231-y,Where are the big bills? Escaping the endogenizer’s dilemma,March 2014,Adam G. Martin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Modern economics has progressively endogenized different spheres of social life. One sort of behavior after another has been brought under the rubric of rational choice, from marriage and the family to crime and addiction. The most significant arena baptized into the church of constrained optimization—at least for the development of political economy—is the political itself. Under the heading of public choice (originally) or political economy (more recently), the economic way of thinking has successfully illuminated a wide array of political phenomena from the behavior of interest groups to the longevity of bureaucracies. But to the extent that these explanations work, they cordon off what was once the economists’ own practical territory of proffering policy advice. Reder notes perceptively: Successfully to endogenize a new variable is to enhance the explanatory power of economics, and there is much interest in such achievements. However, it must be noted that where variables are made “endogenous,” they can no longer serve as objects of social choice… Many Chicago economists, therefore… have moved toward becoming disengaged analysts of the political-economic-social process rather than defenders of laissez-faire. (Reder 1982, p. 35) Once economists admit of an economic theory of politics, policies that might affect economic outcomes are themselves economic outcomes. Critiquing a particular policy in terms of economic efficiency then makes as much sense as critiquing the price and quantity of a good that emerge on the market. There is exactly as much scope for one as the other. Endogenization can thus render nonsensical the economists’ standard normative approach to policy evaluation. To explain a social phenomenon in terms of rational choice is to render it as the outcome of cost-minimizing decisions. To say otherwise is to say that there are “big bills laying on the sidewalk,” and thus to violate the fundamental presumption of rational choice theory. But once this assumption is granted, it becomes difficult to find potential sources of inefficiency. This argument, which I dub the endogenizer’s dilemma, is taken up in detail in section 2. But more is at stake here than policy advocacy. The existence of inefficiency is important for positive economics as well. To maintain otherwise would require either denying that there often exist unexploited gains from trade or maintaining that they are unimportant in explaining empirical phenomena. I take it as given that both of these positions are false. The endogenizer’s dilemma also confronts the positive economist attempting to explain divergences in economic development. Olson (1996) argues that the stylized facts of economic development belie the possibility of universal efficiency. Factor movements and growth trends are plainly inconsistent with a theory that posits that all nations are on their production possibilities frontiers. Olson’s argument is also important in that it highlights the centrality of institutions in allowing for the exploitation of the gains from trade. The purpose of this essay is to explicate and resolve the endogenizer’s dilemma in light of the explosion of interest in institutional analysis since Reder introduced the problem. Resolution entails finding a source of inefficiency consistent with explaining social phenomena in terms of rational choice. I argue that comparative institutional analysis (c.f. Demsetz 1969) is the primary sphere in which efficiency comparisons are readily possible and fruitful. This bears directly on the relevance of uncovering inefficiency for understanding economic development. A broad consensus in development economics has emerged that “institutions rule” (Rodrik 2004). Different institutional mixes engender different patterns of exchange and distribution, accounting for the sharp differences in economic activity across national borders. Big bills may not lie on the sidewalk within an institutional regime, but rather across institutions. But the specter of endogenization haunts the institutions hypothesis as well. Institutions, like politics and markets, are fundamentally social. They arise from individual action, and as such can be analyzed with the tools of economics. Is a country”s institutional mix itself not also the result of constrained optimization (e.g., Djankov et al. 2003)? Any supposed gains to be had by institutional transition must then be balanced by costs in the institutional generation game in which politics and markets are nested. It is also obvious that to explain the origins of institutions in terms of the constraints imposed by some “deeper” social phenomenon, such as culture, will only meet the same end. The economic imperialist will thus have to conjure up a yet deeper social structure or appeal to exogenous (non-economic) forces, but these are essentially constraints, not sources of inefficiency. This argument is taken up in section 3. What is the economist to do? Should he give in, uninstall STATA, hang up his blue blazer and Adam Smith tie, and leave the world to Jared Diamond? I argue not. My success depends entirely on locating a satisfactory source of economic inefficiency. Section 4 argues that the existence of inefficiency requires moving beyond the logic of choice to the logic of action, which includes both choice and knowledge problems. This approach is characteristic of both the Austrian approach to economics and the Virginia School of political economy. Section 5 explores the relationship between knowledge problems and the radical subjectivism that is characteristic of both schools, mapping out an intellectual space so that they can be compared to other rational choice approaches in terms of explaining inefficiency. I argue that Austro-Virginian style subjectivism is a necessary complement to knowledge problems in accounting for inefficiency. Section 6 sums up and clarifies the limits of the preceding argument.",1
27.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,06 September 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0239-3,"Political economy and the science of association: A suggested reconstruction of public choice through the alliance of the Vienna, Virginia, and Bloomington schools of political economy",March 2014,Peter J. Boettke,Nicholas A. Snow,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is already a natural alliance between Virginia and Vienna. The historical links and intellectual sociology of the two schools illustrates the natural fit between the two very similar schools of thought. The Austrian school not only influenced Buchanan in his work from early in his career but also is closer to Buchanan’s approach than that of the contemporary Chicago approach to economic analysis.Footnote 4 Further, the very survival of the modern Austrian tradition is closely linked to the development of the Virginia tradition. The Viennese program in economics as represented in Carl Menger and Eugen Bohm-Bawerk received further refinement by Mises and Hayek in the first half of the 20th century. The mature Austrian research program was laid out in treatise form by Ludwig von Mises in Human Action (1949) and in the more contemporary journal article form by F. A. Hayek and collected in Individualism and Economic Order (1948). For all practical purposes, work since that time in methodology, method, and application has been a restatement of the basic positions developed in those works. Circa 1950–1980 the Austrian school was so at odds with the contemporary economics profession in method and ideological sentiments, and it is a miracle that the school of thought has a modern presence in the academy at all. Kirzner especially worked quietly not only as a researcher but also as a teacher and organizer of student and scholarly conferences at New York University. In this role Kirzner continually recruited fresh new minds to the research program and teaching agenda. Ludwig Lachmann and Murray Rothbard also played a large role in keeping the Austrian tradition alive during this period. The Austrian resurgence, however, would also not have been possible without two figures outside of the Austrian camp: Robert Nozick and James Buchanan. Nozick’s Anarchy, State and Utopia (1974) legitimated the limited government libertarian political philosophy within intellectual discourse in a way that it hadn’t been since prior to the WWII. Moreover, Nozick’s invisible-hand explanation methodology laid out in the beginning of his book pointed directly to the analytical contributions of the Austrian school on issues such as the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism, the Austrian theory of the trade cycle, and the theory of spontaneous order. Winning the National Book of the Year award is never bad publicity for an author and the set of ideas he is promoting. James Buchanan in works such as Cost and Choice (1969), LSE Essays on Cost (1981), and What Should Economists Do? (1979) accomplished this same legitimating function for the methodological program of the Austrians as what Nozick had done for the ideological position. The importance of having someone within the upper echelons of the economics profession such as Buchanan defend methodological individualism, methodological subjectivism, and process analysis cannot be overlooked in the sociology of academic life. In addition, the practical importance of having a major professor in the economics profession willingly accept and encourage students to study with him and pursue doctoral research on these topics cannot be forgotten. Buchanan was the mentor and colleague not only of a new generation of public choice scholars, but also a new generation of political economists who would blend public choice and Austrian economics: Richard Wagner, Richard McKenzie, Randall Holcombe, Thomas DiLorenzo, and Viktor Vanberg to name a few. In addition to directly working with those interested in various aspects of the Austrian tradition, Buchanan during the 1970s and 1980s would single out Kirzner’s work on the entrepreneurial market process to highlight to readers in his articles, and he would promote the work of such younger Austrians as Karen Vaughn, Mario Rizzo, and Don Lavoie. Outside of Buchanan's endorsement only the UCLA economists Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz (price theorists) and Axel Leijonhufvud and Robert Clower (macroeconomists) had anything positive to say about the contributions that Mises and Hayek had made to economic science (and most of the praise was limited to Hayek) during this time period. This had a very practical implication circa the early 1970s when the Austrian revival was orchestrated by organizations such as the Institute of Humane Studies (IHS) for those contemplating careers as economists. Students discouraged by the failed economics policies of the ‘Great Society’ and military policies of the Vietnam War, found hope in the promise of a libertarian society. Within those ranks several of them were intellectually excited enough to study further the science of economics in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the underlying forces in economic life that explained the failure of the Keynesian system and the operations of a free market economy. This was important because IHS, in promoting the Austrian school, kept the research program and methodology of both Vienna and Virginia alive for young students at a time where most university economics departments departed heavily from such questions and approaches in economic research. But where would they go to study? Chicago was the most obvious option, but the ability to study further refinements of subjectivism and market process theory were very limited there (Mario Rizzo was the lone graduate to do so, though at that time he did focus on law and economics). NYU with Israel Kirzner was an obvious choice, and many talented young scholars flocked to do so in the 1970s and 1980s; but Kirzner was isolated in the department and the rest of the program was not just indifferent but grew overtime increasingly hostile to the Austrian approach. Still Kirzner was able to attract Lachmann as a visiting professor, and he eventually secured faculty appointments for Gerald O’Driscoll, Mario Rizzo, Lawrence White, and finally Peter Boettke. However, only Rizzo was able to secure a permanent faculty post with tenure. Post doc fellows were also an important part of the NYU program under Kirzner and included individuals such as Richard Langlois, Roger Garrison, and Bruce Caldwell, and foreign scholars such as Uskali Makii, Stefan Boehm, and David Harper. The PhD products of the NYU Austrian program include Don Lavoie, Richard Fink, George Selgin, Stanford Ikeda, Daniel Klein, and Glen Wittman. The NYU program is still in operation, but with Kirzner’s retirement, only Rizzo remains as a permanent faculty though David Harper has an administrative/faculty post as the director of the Masters Program and clinical professorship. William Easterly has also recently joined the NYU faculty, and while intellectually supportive of the market-orientation of Hayek, he does not work within the Austrian program. NYU is, and has been for close to 20 years, an extremely formalistic program in economics with a strong emphasis on mathematical theory and econometric theory—two areas far removed from the methodology and the methods of the Austrian school of economics. More hospitable environments for graduate students with a strong interest in Austrian economics were provided at VPI (and then GMU) and UCLA. UCLA products include Gerald O’Driscoll, Larry White, and Jack High—all of whom worked closely with Leijonhufvud. But there can be little doubt that the programs at VPI and then GMU (both owed their existence to Buchanan’s intellectual leadership) were the most open to the idea of Austrian economics as a progressive research program in contemporary economics and political economy. Since the mid-1980s, for example, the number of PhD theses accepted at GMU that addressed the idea of the Austrian school has exceeded the number of dissertations on the same topic written at all other universities since Carl Menger first assumed his chaired professorship at the University of Vienna. In the 1970s, Richard Wagner used Mises’s Human Action as a text in the core microeconomic theory course at VPI. Besides pushing for the exchange versus allocation paradigm in economics and political economy, Buchanan also openly embraced the radical subjectivist ideas of G.L.S. Shackle and in particular Shackle’s Epistemic and Economics, which challenged the core behavioral model of neoclassical economics. The Robbinsian model of the economic problem of society was challenged by Buchanan both for its exclusive focus on the seemingly technical question of society’s allocation of scarce resources among competing ends as opposed to the exchange relationships and the institutional framework within which these exchanges take place, and for its conception of the individual choice problem as closed as opposed to open-ended. Despite the critical exchange between Buchanan and Kirzner over Buchanan’s “What Should Economists Do?” (1964) article that was published in the Southern Economic Journal, Buchanan and Kirzner were natural allies in the 1960s–1970s fight for an alternative rendering of the neoclassical project in economics and political economy that was not only radically anti-Keynesian (in its focus on microeconomics), but also radically anti-mechanistic (with the focus on subjectivity and creativity in the analysis of individual choice, and the exchange process as opposed to equilibrium states in the analysis of markets). Buchanan’s students such as Randall Holcombe were present at South Royalton; Buchanan’s student and future colleague Richard Wagner organized conferences examining the contributions of Carl Menger and wrote articles and books extolling the virtues of the Austrian research program; and Buchanan himself headlined several conferences as a keynote speaker representing the Austrian program and its importance for contemporary research in economics and political economy. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock explicitly acknowledged their intellectual debt to Mises and Hayek in their works. So as a matter of historical intellectual sociology, the road from Vienna to Virginia was driven by James Buchanan and his efforts (originally with G. Warren Nutter) to “save the books” of classical liberal political economy starting at the Thomas Jefferson Center for Political Economy at UVA in the 1950s–1960s and continuing with the establishment of the Center for the Study of Public Choice at VPI in the 1970s and then GMU in the 1980s to today. As a result the modern Austrian tradition is steeped in research programs that directly attempt to answer Buchanan type questions. The younger generation of Austrian economists coming out of GMU continue to work on issues Buchanan put particular importance on such as the rules of the game (see for example, Coyne 2007), and the ability of individuals to self-govern (see for example, Stringham 2003 and Leeson 2007). Both of which are needed in further research to answer Buchanan’s puzzle.",3

Kirzner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"James Buchanan was an extraordinary scholar. Not only was he a uniquely profound thinker and brilliant expositor of subtle ideas and insights into complex economic and political relationships. In addition to all this he was distinguished by his open-mindedness and generosity of academic spirit. He was at all times ready to recognize elements of merit in the work of writers with whom he was otherwise in sharp disagreement. He was always on the look-out, in his amazingly wide reading, for insights which he could incorporate into his own system of thought. One fascinating aspect of his open-minded scholarship has to do with his contacts with Austrian Economics, especially as the Austrian tradition was resurging and evolving during the second half of the last century. As is well known, Buchanan had a deep respect for the work of Friedrich Hayek. (And he contributed an essay to a festschrift in Hayek’s honor) (Buchanan 1969). Buchanan also appreciated, at least to a significant degree, the profundity of Ludwig Mises’ subjectivism economics. Although there were certain elements, in the way in which Mises (and his economics) was treated by his admirers, which Buchanan gently deploredFootnote 1, Buchanan did not permit this to obscure the important insights which he recognized in Mises’ work. [Buchanan participated in a conference which celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of Mises’ birth, and he contributed and important paper to the volume which emerged from that conference (1982)]. And this writer recalls with gratitude Buchanan’s encouragement of the writer’s attempts to clarify and extend Mises’ ideas. The following pages will explore certain aspects of Buchanan’s struggles, over a period of years, to come to grips with Austrian subjectivism in economic theory. We shall, in the course of this exploration, find it useful to encapsulate some of Buchanan’s struggles and ambiguities, in this regard, in terms of his references (in two separate papers) to two “bridges”, one of which he was willing, perhaps even eager to cross the second of which he passionately believed that economists may not cross. At this point, however, we begin by reviewing some of Buchanan’s pronouncements concerning subjectivist economics. [We will, deliberately, keep our review at a simple (even, superficial) level. It is not necessary (and might be confusing) for our purposes, to examine all the subtleties and nuances of Buchanan’s discussion concerning subjectivism.]",1

O’Driscoll Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Buchanan finished Cost and Choice while on his visit to UCLA. The short book (just over 100 pages) reconstructed cost theory by building on a London School of Economics tradition, which he felt was not generally recognized. He argued that, while the LSE tradition was influenced by the Austrians, “uniquely characteristic features were added and that the whole reconstruction reached operational viability only in London” (Buchanan 1969: ix). The book’s argument is summarized in the short Preface and, indeed in its essentials in the first paragraph: You face a choice. You must now decide whether to read this Preface, to read something else, to think silent thoughts, or perhaps to write a bit for yourself. The value that you place on the most attractive of these several alternatives is the cost that you must pay if you chose to read this Preface now. This value must remain wholly speculative; it represents what you think the other opportunity might offer. Once you have chosen to read this Preface, any chance of realizing the alternative and, hence, measuring its value, has vanished forever. Only at the moment or instance of choice is cost able to modify behavior (Buchanan 1969: vii). Much of the book involves a reconstruction and restatement of the overlooked LSE tradition. The later Austrians played an important role in its development, but Buchanan argued that “much of what seems to me to be orthodox cost theory can be traced to its Austrian sources”(Buchanan 1969: ix). The early Austrians whose work formed the basis of orthodox cost theory were Menger, Bohm-Bawerk and Wieser. Buchanan had high praise for Mises’ treatment of cost in Human Action, where he advanced “a theory of opportunity cost that is, indeed, almost equivalent to the full-blown LSE conception” (Buchanan 1969: 21). Hayek is credited with introducing subjectivist economics to LSE, most especially in his 1937 paper “Economics and Knowledge.” There Hayek distinguished between the postulates of the Pure Logic of Choice (or “purely economic” behavior in Buchanan’s terminology), and action under uncertainty. In the later situation, “genuine choice takes place” and subjectively perceived costs impinge on that choice (Buchanan 1969: 25). Buchanan drew a picture then of a pre-exisiting LSE tradition, begun by Wicksteed, which dissented from orthodoxy. That orthodoxy was itself the product of early Austrian thinking. Meanwhile, Mises is independently working out an alternative, subjectivist view of cost beginning in the socialist calculation debate. Next, Hayek brings subjectivism to LSE, which helps revitalize and advance the LSE conception of cost. That notion of cost is then advanced and applied at LSE by, among others, Lionel Robbins, Ronald Coase and perhaps most importantly, G. F. Thirlby. Buchanan informed modern-day Austrians of the origins of their own thinking on costs, and the importance of the LSE tradition. Buchanan’s restatement of the “choice-bound conception of cost” is one of the clearest statements of a subjectivist conception of cost. He drew six implications from that conception (Buchanan 1969: 43): Most importantly, cost must be borne exclusively by the decision-maker; it is not possible for cost to be shifted or imposed on others. Cost is subjective; it exists in the mind of the decision-maker and nowhere else. Cost is based on anticipations; it is necessarily a forward looking or ex ante concept. Cost can never be realized because of the fact of choice itself; that which is given up cannot be enjoyed. Cost cannot be measured by someone other than the decision-maker because there is no way that subjective experience can be directly observed. Finally, cost can be dated at the moment of decision or choice. These six propositions are the core of subjectivist cost theory. In my opinion, Cost and Choice contains the best short statement of that theory.",

Rizzo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The great economist James M. Buchanan died on January 9th, 2013 at the age of 93. Buchanan won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986. But even this does not capture his greatness. There have been many Nobel prizes in economics since 1969, the year they were initiated.Footnote 1 Many of these prize winners will be long forgotten and even viewed with puzzlement by future generations, but this prize will stand out. As an Austrian economist, I appreciate Buchanan for the enormous esteem in which he held F.A. Hayek and the Austrian tradition in general. As a college student, I recall the joy that I experienced when Buchanan’s Cost and Choice was first published in 1969 (Buchanan 1999). It seemed to me that, at last, an economist of international fame was led to an appreciation of the subjectivist tradition, which had so long been derided by the mainstream profession. Almost 30 years later, in 1998, he joined the board of advisors of the Austrian Economics Program at New York University. In a letter to Israel Kirzner and me, Buchanan said that over the years he had been “impressed by the continuity of the program and by its increasing academic and scholarly stature.” He added that he “looked forward to further association.”Footnote 2
 Buchanan did not think that philosophy in economics was the refuge of the incompetent. He famously believed that the discipline of economics had its natural place between predictive science and moral philosophy (Buchanan 1987). He was interested in figuring out what we should be doing as economists and in understanding better, through the thicket of conceptual confusions, what economists were in fact doing. Buchanan was, in many ways, our main link with Frank H. Knight, another of the most important and most self-reflective economists in the history of our discipline. Not only was Buchanan a student of Knight, he was also Knight’s intellectual heir. It is true that Buchanan and Knight did have important disagreements, but they each knew how question the sacred cows of economics. They were each more than just economists. They knew of the importance of philosophy in economics. They were not deluded by the pretentions of formalism. Most important of all, they were each self-critical. They could learn; they could go beyond what they had previously written. They were not afraid to express minority views within the profession. Neither did they suffer fools gladly. They could, in their own way, be “arrogant.” But it was really the intolerance of John Stuart Mill who said that the true liberal is intolerant of only intolerance itself, as well as their contempt for sloppy thinking. Similar to Knight, Buchanan had a restless mind. When Buchanan was among Austrians he saw the problems with Austrian economics; when he was among standard neoclassical economists he saw their problems, blind spots and errors. For this reason alone it would be difficult to be a follower of Buchanan. He mind never stood still and so to follow Buchanan would involve following his changes and even his intellectual moods. But, most of all, it would involve being critical of all simplistic approaches to problems of economic theory and of economic policy.Footnote 3
 Buchanan’s basic positive contributions in the area of public choice economics and constitutional political economy will be summarized and analyzed by others. These contributions have indeed widened the scope of economics in ways that are really significant: politics without romance, the importance of rules of the game, the ethical implications of public finance and so forth. In this appreciation of James Buchanan I endeavor to be a student of Buchanan in the same way Buchanan was a student of Knight. I take a basic idea in economics—choice—and analyze it radically. I do this by following some important insights of Buchanan himself as expressed in his short note, “Order Defined in the Process of its Emergence” (1982) and in his article “Natural and Artifactual Man” (1979). Buchanan’s thesis is that choosing, as it occurs in the course of time, is not a simple matter of constrained maximization. It is a process of invention and self-creation. As a consequence, the normative case for freedom of choice must go beyond the satisfaction of given, stable preferences for, in reality, they are neither given nor stable. They are the agent’s creative invention. This article will be devoted to explaining the context and implications of Buchanan’s thesis.",6

Vaughn,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In order to understand just what the coming of the Public Choice Center meant to George Mason University, it is necessary to describe what the department and the school itself was like circa 1981. George Mason was small, poor and spectacularly undistinguished. A relatively new creation of the Virginia system, it had little going for it except for location and a president, George Johnson, with high aspirations—aspirations that often caused him to run afoul of a State Board of Higher Education that was heavily weighted in favor of the more famous down-state schools, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech. The economics department, then somewhere around 18 faculty, was mostly very young and not highly represented in academic journals We had been strongly encouraged by the administration to institute a Ph.D. program that was to begin in 1982 despite the fact that only two people on our faculty at the time, James Bennett and William Snavely, had ever even served on a Ph.D. dissertation committee. From my perspective, we had exactly one claim to distinction: a newly organized program on Austrian economics that we called the Center for the Study of Market Processes.Footnote 4 Apparently, Jim Buchanan shared my view of the Center because it’s existence was an important factor contributing to his decision to move to GMU. I’ve told the story about how that move came about many times. Perhaps it is time to immortalize it in print. It was at the Public Choice cocktail party at the AEA meetings in December of 1981 that Jim told me how difficult things were getting for his program at Virginia Tech. He was concerned that the economics department was getting too conventional and hiring too many people trained in mathematics but with little appreciation of economic reasoning. Jim’s advice to academics was always “Dare to be different,” and Virginia Tech was falling short in his opinion. Worse, it had an administration that backed up the department chairman in his striving to make the economics department more conventional. In the course of our conversation, Jim said to me, “If things keep going the way they are now, we might have to just move in with you in Fairfax!” I wish I could say I immediately jumped at the suggestion and eagerly started to outline the benefits of such a move. The truth is that I just didn’t think he could be serious. I laughed, said something like “yeah, sure” or something else equally inane and moved on to other topics. It was only a week or two later when discussing Buchanan’s comment with Jim Bennett that I started to think it was worth pursuing. The next week I flew to Blacksburg where I began selling the potential virtues of GMU to a very skeptical Public Choice Center faculty. My argument was basically this: GMU is young, the economics department will have a brand new Ph.D. program and no entrenched interest groups to oppose the Public Choice agenda, the Center would be a very big fish in a very little pond, and they could pretty much run the place if they so chose. Those arguments seemed to resonate with Jim, because he took my visit very seriously: he later said he was impressed by how quickly I tried to recruit him after a casual comment at a cocktail party! The next step was to consult the administration to see if bringing Buchanan to GMU was even feasible. To George Johnson’s everlasting credit, he immediately saw opportunity instead of obstacles. Jim came to Fairfax to discuss possibilities with the administration, then each of the seven members of the center came to check us out. After a series of tough negotiations and a presentation to the Board of Visitors which had to approve the move, in, I think, May of 1982, the Memorandum of Understanding between the James Buchanan as Director of the Center for Study of Public Choice and George Johnston, President of GMU, was signed. The Memorandum listed who would come, at what rank, what teaching responsibilities, location of the Center, how external funds would be handled, and a host of other details that in honor bound both parties to the deal before any official hiring could take place. The move was phased over 2 years with Mark Crain coming up in the Fall of 1982 to serve as graduate coordinator for the department and the rest of the Center arriving in the summer of 1983. Largely because of my role in brokering the deal, I was asked to serve as department chairman primarily to smooth the transition. Unfortunately, at Jim’s behest, I kept that position until 1989 when I finally decided I had had enough of administration to last a lifetime, as it seemed to me it already had.",1

Yeager,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"James Buchanan began influencing me before I even met him. With Clark Lee Allen and Marshall R. Colberg (1954) he wrote a concise and excellent Principles text that I used for a one-semester course at the University of Maryland. It helped me face the two challenges of distinguishing between essential ideas and fringe refinements and of teaching those essentials in a single semester. Economists should know, as Buchanan did, that what does the worst damage is ignorance of the basics, not of technicalities amenable to easily gradable test questions or to parades of mathematics. In 1956–1957 Buchanan and Warren Nutter, who had been fellow graduate students at the University of Chicago, moved from Florida State and Yale to the University of Virginia. Its economics department needed restaffing after several losses. As the new chairman, Buchanan brought me to Virginia from Maryland in 1957. Buchanan recalled, years later: “In 1957, the implicit socialists were in the ascendancy in the academies of the land. By implicit socialists, I refer to those who were driven by an ideological commitment to the benevolent leadership of the national state on all matters economic” (1988, p. 119). That was true of most of the Maryland economists, nice enough though they were personally. The Buchanan of his earliest days as a Chicago graduate student would have fitted in well with them. He remembered having a social philosophy like that of most of his fellow graduate students, “almost all of whom were socialists of one or another stripe” (1992, p. 5). He counted himself among the “libertarian socialists” (1992, p. 72). Frank Knight and others at Chicago soon enlightened him. At a cocktail party in Charlottesville after my job seminar in the spring of 1957, when asked what I would like to drink, I said “Bourbon and water”. Jim told me afterwards that that was the correct answer. Jim assured me that at U.Va. I would receive promotion and tenure on a prompt schedule. Strange as it may seem nowadays, when such uncertainties cause so much anguish, I hardly gave the matter any further thought; and Jim’s assurances did come true. Buchanan’s methods of teaching graduate courses were idiosyncratic but effective, and many of his and his colleagues’ students have become widely respected in their own specializations. He required much writing and much criticism of the results among the students and himself; they learned that diagnosing errors is central to progress in an academic discipline. He preached “Don’t get it right, get it written”, meaning that writing and rewriting is an important part of thinking. To postpone writing until one has completed one’s research and gotten the theory quite right is a backwards approach. Buchanan and Nutter appreciated the founding values of the United States. Encouraged by University President Colgate Darden and A&S Dean William Duren, they established the Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy. The Center brought distinguished economists to lecture at the University, some of them residing in Charlottesville for several weeks or even months. One of the early visitors was Frank Knight; others included Maurice Allais, T.W. Hutchinson, Duncan Black, Michael Polanyi, Overton H. Taylor, and, at least for short periods, F.A. Hayek, Peter Bauer, Bruno Leoni, F.A. Hayek, and Gottfried Haberler. Gordon Tullock joined the Department as a postdoctoral fellow and after a few years at the University of South Carolina, returned as a faculty member. A lecture series published as In Search of a Monetary Constitution (1962) exemplifies Buchanan’s long-standing interest in constitutional economics (about which more later). Besides Buchanan himself, speakers included Milton Friedman, Jacob Viner, Murray Rothbard, Clark Warburton, Willford I. King, and other eminent economists. Buchanan has my gratitude for his patience during my blue mood starting around 1959 or 1960. Before and especially after a beneficial change of scene as visiting professor at Southern Methodist University in 1962, I enjoyed the monthly dinner meetings of the Political Club of Virginia. Economists and faculty members from other parts of the University organized it. (As treasurer, I had the job of buying wine in Washington for the club’s dinners.) Meetings in 1959 featured talks by Rutledge Vining on his vision of political economy and notably by Ronald Coase, who published his paper the following year as “The Problem of Social Cost”. After falling apart because of an unfortunate misunderstanding and after Buchanan and Tullock had moved to VPI, the club was reorganized under a new name. Its meetings in Charlottesville and Blacksburg perhaps slowed the demise of the Virginia School of political economy at its original home, but it fell apart again during the gasoline shortage of 1974.",2

Smith,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Leading up to the violent crusades, Christians, Jews, and Muslims living in close proximity in Medieval Spain experienced an unprecedented period of relative peace, prosperity, and cultural exchange, referred to as La Convivencia, or the coexistence (Lourie 1990, 44; Menocal 2002; Netanyahu 1995, 55; Wolf 2009, 72).Footnote 1 Catlos (2004, 119) records that “…a new multi-ethnic society emerged, composed of Christians (including Mozarabs, Catholic Christians, and ‘foreigners’), Muslims (including Berbers) and (Arabized and Latinate) Jews…” and that “…Muslims and Christians found themselves living together, as neighbors (vincini) and business associates, as landlords and tenants, slaves and owners, as fellow subjects (vassalli) and citizens (cives).” Despite their divergent ethnicities, religious beliefs, and customs, there was nearly a “…complete absence of sectarian violence…” in Medieval Spain (Catlos 2004, 119). This anomalistic period stands in such stark contrast to the religious animosity and ethnic conflict typical throughout the medieval world that it presents a puzzle to many period historians (Ashtor 1972, 118-154; Glick 1992). Traditional historical accounts of La Convivencia explain it as a fortuitous period of cultural enlightenment (Glick 1992), or as a serendipitous period of genuine religious tolerance (Ashtor 1972, 118-154). Meyerson (2004) argues that it was the frequent interaction of the Christians, Jews, and Muslims, both in personal and business affairs, which led to this period of toleration. However, these explanations cannot explain why such periods of peace did not (and do not) emerge in other times and places among heterogeneous groups, and thus fail to provide satisfactory explanations for La Convivencia. This paper argues that, rather than La Convivenvia being a period of anomalous and inexplicable transformations in human nature, that La Convivencia is an exemplification of the Doux-Commerce Thesis first articulated by the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers. In addition to the economic gains from specialization and innovation brought about by commercial exchange, Adam Smith and David Hume also advanced the argument that the act of engaging in commerce itself plays a civilizing role in society (Boettke and Smith 2013). Through exchange, self-interest is channeled towards the establishment of cooperative relations, conflict resolution, and even the diminution of social distance (Leeson 2008). As quoted in Hirschman (1982, 1465), Samuel Ricard explains, Through commerce, man learns to deliberate, to be honest, to acquire manners, to be prudent and reserved in both talk and action. Sensing the necessity to be wise and honest in order to succeed, he flees vice, or at least his demeanor exhibits decency and seriousness so as not to arouse any adverse judgment on the part of present and future acquaintances; he would not dare make a spectacle of himself for fear of damaging his credit standing which it might otherwise have to deplore As Montesquieu argued, “[c]ommerce cures destructive prejudices, and it is an almost general rule that everywhere there are gentle mores, there is commerce and that everywhere there is commerce, there are gentle mores” (1748[2009], 338). Commercial relations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Medieval Spain were established through the use of safe-conducts, a promise of protection that was sold to foreign merchants by kings, lords, barons, and even wealthy merchants. Safe-conducts not only provided protection to traveling merchants, they also played the important economic role of serving as a way for foreign merchants to credibly display their commitment to honest exchange. Safe-conducts were able to operate as a signal of honesty because only merchants engaging in honest exchange would stand to recoup the upfront cost of the safe-conduct. Additionally, any merchant engaging in dishonest exchange would stand to lose the protections of the safe-conduct, providing a further incentive for foreign merchants to engage in honest exchange. This paper argues that the exchange facilitated by safe-conducts played an important role in promoting the commercial exchange that fostered the period of relative peace and prosperity in Medieval Spain known as La Convivencia. Section 2 provides a brief history of Medieval Spain during the Convivencia period, from approximately 711 to 1492. Section 3 details the anomalistic period of relative peace, prosperity, and cultural exchange among Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Medieval Spain. Section 4 explains how safe-conducts operated to facilitate trade among Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Medieval Spain, providing an explanation for the Convivencia period. Section 5 concludes and provides brief suggestions for how these insights are relevant for the growing development literature on violence and ethnic conflict.",7
27.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,03 January 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0250-8,An Austrian view of expectations and business cycles,June 2014,Paul D. Mueller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the pioneering work of Muth (1961), expectations have been an integral part of macroeconomic theory. The rational expectations revolution, premised on the fact that economists do not know more about future economic performance than the actors in their models do, has remained dominant to this day. Of course it has not gone unchallenged (Garrison 2001; Shiller 2006; Akerlof and Shiller 2010; Frydman and Phelps 2013) and may be waning. But what theory of expectations should replace it? Austrian business cycle theory, originally called the monetary theory of the trade cycle, was primarily developed by Mises (2009 [1912], 1949) and Hayek (1933, 1935); though many economists before and after them have written about it. Garrison (2001) has made some important didactic contributions by graphically connecting the loanable funds market, the production possibilities frontier, and the capital structure of production. Austrians have made several important contributions to understanding how and why business cycles occur—including ideas about heterogeneous capital, non-neutrality of money, inter-temporal coordination, malinvestment, and the capital structure of production. According to the Austrian theory, artificial credit expansion causes business cycles by distorting interest rates, which then increase unsustainable investment and consumption decisions. Artificially lower interest rates, including accommodation when interest rates should naturally rise, reduce the cost of borrowing and increase the net present value of longer-term investments. They also encourage greater consumption. Some Austrians argue that lower interest rates cause people to consume more because they reduce the incentive to save (Garrison 2001; Horwitz and Boettke 2009). Other Austrians argue that low interest rates reduce the return on bonds leading to more investment in substitutes like equities and real estate. The corresponding rise in asset values causes people to feel wealthier which leads them to increase their consumption (Mises 1949; Salerno 2012). Either way, artificially low interest rates distort investment and consumption decisions. According to the reasoning above, there would be no business cycle without government artificially expanding credit. Although it may be true that distorted signals were created through government involvement, the critics say, to pin everything on government intervention implies a type of perfect markets theory where there are never any bubbles or systemically inaccurate expectations. But what about the hundreds of bubbles across countries and throughout history (Kindleberger and Aliber 2011)? Surely government intervention did not cause all of them. And if some bubbles occur without government intervention, why not all of them? These critics claim that business cycles are driven by market excesses, not by government intervention (Keynes 2006 [1936], Krugman 2000; Shiller 2006; Minsky and Kaufman 2008; Akerlof and Shiller 2010; Kindleberger and Aliber 2011). Incorporating endogenous expectations into ABCT answers these critics. By recognizing why people engage in speculation, make seemingly foolish, unrealizable plans, and how markets usually restrain this behavior, Austrian theorists can better explain exactly how government policies contribute to naturally occurring asset bubbles. Understanding how people form expectations highlights how governments often replace limited self-correcting asset bubbles with large bubbles by distorting entrepreneurs’ and consumers’ expectations. We need to understand how people interpret relative price changes, particularly with respect to their expectations of future prices. Unfortunately the mechanisms for how and why expectations change are largely ignored. This paper sketches a theory, in the tradition of Menger, Mises, and Hayek, that expectations are endogenous to market processes and institutions. Endogenous expectations present a compelling alternative to exogenous theories of expectations, particularly rational expectations. It also forms the basis for an Austrian response to the “irrational exuberance” and “animal spirits” theories advanced by Shiller (2006) and Akerlof and Shiller (2010). Although many Austrians understand the importance of expectations (Mises 2009 [1912], 1949; Lachmann 1943; Wagner 1999; Garrison 2001; Carilli and Dempster 2001; Evans and Baxendale 2008), an analytical theory of expectations remains largely absent from their theorizing. Surveying recent Austrian treatments of the 2008 financial crisis reveals little interest or awareness of the role played by individuals’ interpretive frameworks or expectations. David Prychitko’s (2010) discussion of Minsky’s theory of financial instability often refers to the expectations of entrepreneurs and businesses. He does not, however, offer commentary on how those expectations form or what they are based upon other than “relative prices” and market trends. This is not unusual. Most Austrians focus on false price signals—especially artificially low interest rates—rather than on the costs and benefits associated with improving one’s expectations. In this minimalist treatment, entrepreneurs observe distorted prices and make “foolish” unsustainable investment decisions. But current observable price changes are not enough to explain individual behavior in a non ceteris paribus world of uncertainty and ignorance (Mueller 2013). Even theorizing about “heterogeneous” or “marginal” entrepreneurs fails to fully address the problem (Evans and Baxendale 2008; Engelhardt 2012). Thomas Woods (2009) provides another example of minimizing expectations when he argues that Greenspan’s prevention of a market correction after the internet bubble made it: the only recession on record in which housing starts did not decline. Not coincidentally, that was the moment at which people began to buy into the bromides of the housing bubble: housing prices never fall, a house is the best investment one can make, house-flipping is a safe and easy way to make a living, and all the other delusions. (2009:81) People formed unrealistic expectations, “bromides” and “delusions,” about housing prices because Greenspan stifled natural market signals: declining housing starts and falling house prices. During times of artificially cheap credit there is a clear tendency towards “excessive optimism” and “willingness to take on risk” (Woods 2009:27). Woods writes that psychological explanations of irrational beliefs and behavior “may play a role in determining exactly which path the business cycle will take and which specific assets will be overvalued, but they cannot by themselves explain the bubble economy” (2009:85 original emphasis). Expectations may be important for explaining where the bubble ultimately forms but not why it forms. Joseph Salerno (2012) argues that before the 2008 financial crisis people’s expectations were based upon money illusion. He uses the terms “inflationary expectations” or “optimistic expectations” to describe the flawed expectations that people form after an artificial credit expansion. During the housing bubble “expectations lost contact with fundamentals” (2012:26). Salerno also explains that “volatile fluctuations of entrepreneurial confidence and expectations over the business cycle are not purely exogenous psychological phenomena that economic theory must take as given. Rather, they are a rational response” to incorrect signals—for Salerno, to inflated views of wealth (2012:37). Although his account of expectations sheds some light on the behavior of entrepreneurs and consumers, it is primarily descriptive rather than analytical. ABCT has taken individual’s responses to changes in the nominal interest rate too much for granted. In section 2, I argue that people’s responses to market changes depend upon their interpretive frameworks, their perception of the costs and benefits of knowledge, and the heterogeneity of goals, backgrounds, and objects of people’s expectations (Wagner 1999). Endogenous expectations provide an important supplement to ABCT by addressing why “foolishness” and the “marginal entrepreneur” exist and why they increase during artificial credit expansion (Evans and Baxendale 2008; Engelhardt 2012). Section 3 uses the boom before the 2008 financial crisis to illustrate the theory of endogenous expectations. Section 4 concludes with remarks about the role of expectations in Austrian business cycle theory.",1

Kirzner and the two levels of analysis in spontaneous order studies",September 2014,Peter J. Boettke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“Economics,” Ludwig von Mises (1966, 252) famously wrote that, “in speaking of entrepreneurs, has in view not men, but a definite function.” The entrepreneurial function is to be the driving force of the market economy. The entrepreneur acts on the basis of changing circumstances in market conditions to produce the accommodating adjustments in exchange and production. The ceaseless quest for profits by those eager entrepreneurs drive the market system toward realizing the gains from trade and the gains from innovation. The relentless pursuit of profit is in this Misesian analysis of the market process the critical factor in how markets work. Profits and losses are ever-present features of a functioning market economy only because of changing circumstances that result in discrepancies that require adjustments. Israel Kirzner was exposed to this Misesian vision of the market process as a graduate student and the articulation, elaboration, and refinement of this Misesian vision became his central professional task. It is for his outstanding contributions to economic science that emerged in this scholarly quest that we justly celebrate Kirzner today. He more than any of Mises’s other students in Austria, Switzerland, and the US, pursued persistently and consistently the implications for the analysis of the price system and the market economy of the Misesian theory of the entrepreneur. Central to our understanding of the operation of the market economy is the concept of spontaneous order. The idea that individuals striving to achieve their own purposes and plans can through the guiding signals and incentives of the price system result in a socially desirable allocation and distribution of resources was the great scientific discovery of the 18th century Scottish moral philosophers. As Kirzner has stated it: To a considerable extent, the relevant lessons from economics revolve around the concept of spontaneous order. Whereas the untutored view of society is likely to assume that absence of central control must inevitably generate hopeless discoordination and frustration, economics shows how the opposite of this view is in fact the truth. Economics shows how, from the independent decisions of many market participants, there emerges a systematic process of learning and coordination. The outcome of this process is the spontaneous order of the market economy. It is upon this spontaneous order that the unprecedented prosperity of market economies rests. (1987, 45) But critical to Kirzner’s research in economics is that this coordination of economic activities takes places against a backdrop of a fixed and given framework. In short, in his praxeological analysis of spontaneous order, Kirzner insisted that we strictly adhere to two-levels of analysis that are analogous to the pre- and post-constitutional levels of analysis that James Buchanan (e.g., 1987) insisted political economists adhere to when discussing the ‘constitution of economic policy.’ The first level of analysis in Kirzner’s approach is one where the framework is fixed and given and not subject to economic analysis.Footnote 1 The economist first assumes the moral norms, ethical rules, and the legal institutions that define and enforce private property and ensure the freedom of contract are in place; he then examines the processes of exchange and production that emerge within the market economy that exhibit the strong tendency to realize all the gains from trade and technological innovation. The theoretical derivation of the efficiency of the market economy emerges from analysis of economic processes within a specified institutional framework. Absent that framework, Kirzner insists, the efficiency properties are neither well understood nor guaranteed. Thus, the second level of analysis is over the framework itself, and Kirzner doubts that existing economic tools of reasoning can provide a useful analytical guide in that task. In this paper, section 2 will first provide a restatement of the Mises-Kirzner position with respect to the universal nature of the entrepreneurial element in human action. Section 3 will elaborate on Kirzner’s presentation of the entrepreneurial market process against the background of a framework of private property rights and freedom of contract protected by the rule of law. Section 4 will discuss the Kirzner challenge to spontaneous order studies. And, section 5 will conclude.",34

Klein,Per L. Bylund,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Israel M. Kirzner’s contributions are central to the development of modern Austrian economics. His Economic Point of View (1960) ably described how economics was transformed, over two centuries, from a science of wealth to a science of action. His Essay on Capital (1966) provided not only a restatement, but a critical extension, of Austrian capital theory, showing how the attributes of heterogeneous capital assets are best understood in terms of the subjective production plans of individual decision-makers (Foss et al. 2007). Kirzner has also made key contributions to the economic theory of advertising (Kirzner 1974; Ekelund and Saurman 1988), welfare economics (Kirzner 1976, 1988, 1989), and several areas of doctrinal history. But Kirzner’s most important contribution is his distinct understanding of the market as a competitive process of discovery and mutual learning, at the forefront of which stands the alert entrepreneur. Kirzner’s landmark book, Competition and Entrepreneurship (1973), was recognized right away as a major contribution to the Austrian understanding of firms, markets, and production. “[B]y applying his ‘Austrian’ concepts and analysis very thoroughly and patiently to the immense body of literature on price theory that has appeared in England and America over the last generation,” wrote Henry Hazlitt (1974, p. 756), Kirzner “has not only succeeded in exposing its central fallacies but has arrived at penetrating insights and advances in market theory.” Murray Rothbard (1974, p. 902) described Competition and Entrepreneurship as “an outstanding contribution to the Mises–Hayek analysis of microeconomics,” coming “at a time of increasing dissatisfaction with the positivist and behaviorist methodology and alleged ‘value freedom’ of orthodox microeconomics, as well as with its almost exclusive emphasis on the unrealistic model of static equilibrium.” 
Competition and Entrepreneurship appeared amidst a growing dissatisfaction among professional economists with the orthodox emphasis on Walrasian equilibrium and the structure-conduct-performance approach to competition, efficiency, and welfare. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed not only the Austrian revival (Dolan 1976; Vaughn 1994; Salerno 2002) but also the emergence of the UCLA/Chicago property rights tradition, the “new learning” in industrial organization, the transaction cost approach to contracting and organizational structure, the economics of asymmetric information, and public-choice approaches to politics. (The rational expectations revolution in macroeconomics would soon follow.) These new developments seemed to signal a move away from the overreliance on formal, mathematical models of static equilibrium under idealized conditions of perfect information and well-functioning institutions to a richer and broader set of theories, models, and assumptions embracing causality, time and uncertainty, real market phenomena and institutions, competitive processes of experimentation and learning, and a central role for the entrepreneur. However, the promise of these new developments has not been fulfilled. The economics of information, contracting, and property rights evolved into formal, equilibrium models of agency and mechanism design, while competitive interaction became the domain of noncooperative game theory. The transaction cost tradition remains strong in business administration but has been largely supplanted in economics by formal models of incomplete contracting. Macroeconomic analysis is dominated by a particular technique, the analysis of dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium models. There still appears to be little room in mainstream economics for time, uncertainty, capital heterogeneity, process, or entrepreneurship. One possible explanation is that Austrians and other “heterodox” economists have simply not been persuasive—mainstream economists have given these critiques a fair hearing and found them wanting. Other explanations build on institutional and public-choice insights about the university system and the professionalization of the economics discipline, which has tended to emphasize conformity (Bernstein 2004). One might argue that Austrian economics, while not “mainstream,” fits into the “mainline” of economic thought (Boettke 2012). In any case, the Austrian school—despite its growing presence as an alternative tradition with a strong theoretical and empirical core and a vibrant set of supporting institutions including degree programs, research and educational organizations, significant funding, conferences, and journals—remains outside the mainstream of the economics profession. However, if one looks to allied academic disciplines, programs, and literatures, such as political science, history, law, sociology, and business administration, the picture is different. In the fields of business strategy and entrepreneurship, for example, Austrian and Schumpeterian approaches to competition, the works of Mises and Hayek on calculation and knowledge, and Austrian writings of entrepreneurship are central to theories about firms, firm strategies, competitive interaction, innovation, industry evolution, and more. Austrian economics is widely regarded in these fields as a serious and important, if not necessarily dominant, approach to economics. In the academic field of entrepreneurship, Kirzner is a dominant figure, second only to Schumpeter in influence. Specifically, Kirzner’s concept of entrepreneurship as “discovery” or “alertness” to profit opportunities underlies the opportunity-discovery or opportunity-recognition branch of the entrepreneurship literature (Shane and Venkataraman 2000; Gaglio and Katz 2001; Shane 2003), one of the dominant strands in contemporary entrepreneurship research. The remainder of this paper reviews the place of Austrian economics in entrepreneurship research, focusing in particular on Kirzner’s concept of entrepreneurial discovery. We document the influence of Kirzner’s approach, including recent challenges from a variety of theoretical perspectives. We also show that Kirzner’s approach has been frequently misunderstood, even by its most enthusiastic adherents within the entrepreneurship literature. We begin by documenting Kirzner’s influence in the contemporary management and entrepreneurship literature using citation data. Next we describe how Kirzner’s framework has been applied, paying particular attention to the theoretical and empirical literature on opportunity identification. We then review briefly the main critiques of this approach, followed by a discussion of some alternatives to the opportunity discovery view, including the “judgment-based approach” described in Foss and Klein (2012). We conclude with reflections on what Kirzner’s influence in the mainstream entrepreneurship literature means for the development and dissemination of Austrian economics more generally.",40

Some scholars suggest that macroeconomics in general, and RBC models in particular, fall short in understanding the recent financial crisis; “macroeconomics is on the wrong track,” has been argued (Caballero 2010; Ohanian 2010; White 2009). In addition, the 2008 Financial Crisis also presents features of international transmissions of business cycles. One of the important features in an international context is the role played by the foreign exchange rates. As described by Calvo and Mishkin (2003), different exchange rates can absorb different shocks. For instance, a fixed exchange rate is preferable in the presence of a monetary shock and a floating exchange rate in the case of a real shock. Empirical studies try to identify if business cycle behaves differently across countries with different exchange rate regime with inconclusive evidence (Canova 2005; Ehrmann and Fratzscher 2009; di Giovanni and Shambaugh 2008). To explain what went wrong in the 2008 Financial Crisis some authors argue that the problem is to be found in a monetary policy that kept interest rates too low for too long (Diamond and Rajan 2009a; Dowd 2009; McKinnon 2010; Meltzer 2009; O’Driscoll 2011; Schwartz 2009; J. B. Taylor 2009).Footnote 1 Other authors have gone further and more specifically sustain that the 2008 Financial Crisis is consistent with an Austrian interpretation (Borio and Disyatat 2011; Diamond and Rajan 2009b; Garrison 2009; Lal 2010; Leijonhufvud 2009a; O’Driscoll 2009; White 2008; Young 2011). The Mises-Hayek business cycle theory can contribute to explain what went wrong with the 2008 Financial Crisis. This theory, however, assumes, as was relevant at the time of its development, a classic gold standard. Hayek (1931, pp. 109-112) argues that his analysis holds in either a closed or open economies. However, Hayek states that in his exposition changes in the quantity of money are meant to happen in one or several countries that “form part of a larger economic unit.”Footnote 2 Hummel (1979, p. 50) maintains that “Austrian economists have for the most part developed their business cycle theory within the context of a closed economy and have rarely applied it to an international setting.” Wagner (1999, p. 68) sustains that an updated presentation of the Mises-Hayek business cycle theory should account for the presence of fiat currencies. To account for fiat money rather than gold standard moves the theory from a context of a closed economy to that of open economies with foreign exchange rates. As such, links between so called “Austrian” and “mainstream” business cycle theories can be built. Only recently, Cowen (1997, chapter 3), Hoffmann (2010), Hoffmann and Schnabl (2011a, 2011b) and Ritchie (2005), consider the case of Mises-Hayek theory in open economies. However, further work is needed for this theory to communicate and contribute with other business cycle theories. For instance, in areas related to (1) international monetary policy, (2) the behavior of economic variables across countries with different exchange rates and (3) changes in the relative prices between nontradable and tradable goods which and the literature on the purchasing power parity (Burstein et al. 2006; Engel 1999; Rogoff 2009). The attention the Mises-Hayek theory pays to the effects of monetary policy on the capital structure can help to understand why on some occasions business cycles across countries with different exchange rates look alike and also to expect particular movements in the relative prices of nontradable to tradable goods. The Section 1 of this essay deals with central banks interaction and the problem of domestic versus international monetary policy. The Section 2 deals with the effects in the small open economies when a big economy follows an expansionary monetary policy. Both, the interest rate and the foreign exchange rate play a role in transmitting distortions to the capital structure of small open economies. The Section 3 reconsiders the position by Cowen (1997) and Ritchie (2005) that business cycles of the Mises-Hayek type become less severe in the context of open economies with respect to a closed economy.",23

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Changes in market conditions, or innovative activities of firms, can result in firms earning above-normal profits for a period of time. Those profits provide an incentive for other firms to enter that market, or for existing firms to expand their activities in the profitable market to try to capture some of that economic profit. The resulting entry into that profitable market competes those above-normal profits away. Those temporary above-normal profits that are competed away by entry are transitional profits. They are a common pool because, like fish in the ocean or grass in a common grazing ground, the existence of those transitional profits entices firms to enter that industry to share in those profits, and the result of that entry is that the profits are “used up” as they are competed away. The entry into a market that has the transitional profits causes them to disappear, just as overgrazing common grazing ground causes grass to disappear or overfishing common fishing areas causes fish to disappear, so they will no longer be available to any of the firms trying to exploit them. The conventional wisdom on common pool resources is that because there are no clear property rights to the resource, the resource is inefficiently over-exploited as people rush to claim a share before others. Transitional profits fit at least part of this characterization, because there are no clear property rights over transitional profits, causing firms to rush to claim a share before the transitional profits are competed away and available to nobody. Is this inefficient? There are two views on this question. To frame the issue, consider which of the following two statements is true: (1) Economic profits are evidence that resources are being allocated inefficiently, or (2) Economic profits are necessary for the efficient allocation of economic resources. The first statement follows from the neoclassical framework in which the optimal allocation of resources is produced by a competitive equilibrium in which all firms are earning normal profits. In that framework, profit is a sign that either markets are not in equilibrium, or firms are exercising monopoly power, either of which results in an inefficiency. The second statement follows from a dynamic framework in which the efficient allocation of resources generates continual economic progress, and profit gives entrepreneurs the incentive to introduce innovations into the market. In the first view, profits create inefficiency, and entrepreneurs act to eliminate the inefficiency and move the economy toward a Pareto optimal competitive equilibrium. In the second view, profits are the result of innovative activity and an indicator that resources are being allocated more efficiently than before.",6
27.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,09 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0242-8,Evenly rotating economy: A new modeling technique for an old equilibrium construct,December 2014,William J. Luther,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The evenly rotating economy is an equilibrium construct within which there is no change in data. Technology and preferences are given and fixed. Agents face a certain future, void of resource supply shocks, technology shocks, preference shocks, and other disturbing forces. Seeing the world as it is—and as it will always be—each agent has settled on producing certain good(s) in certain quantities during each period with the available state of technology. They have also chosen how much to save and consume in each period, with each agent earning utility from consumption as specified by his or her preferences. Although Austrians commonly refer to plan coordination, Garrison’s (1991, p. 95) description of the evenly rotating economy as “complete coordination of all economic activities” is, perhaps, more accurate. As Selgin (1988, p. 43–4) explains, “coordination is complete in the sense that there is equilibrium, but it is obviously not coordination in the sense of compatibility of plans, for the evenly rotating economy presupposes the absence of true plans aimed at the elimination of felt uneasiness. It involves, in place of changing plans, the cyclical mechanical motions of lifeless automatons.” It is an equilibrium; and, despite its dynamic nature, it is void of genuine human action. Mises is not entirely clear about the exchange environment of the ERE. In context, it is unlikely he has in mind a central common market comparable to the Walrasian system. Mises almost certainly envisions agents meeting in decentralized exchange: a butcher contracts with a farmer to procure chicken, beef, or pork, and those interested in purchasing meat for dinner visit the butcher’s store or contact the butcher in advance for meat to be delivered. Since Mises does not formalize his system, one can only speculate; but it seems reasonable that a bilateral exchange environment more or less captures the world of the ERE. Agents operating within the ERE are essentially (if not actually) infinitely-lived and many in number. “It is not necessary to people the imaginary world of the evenly rotating economy with immortal, non-aging and nonproliferating men,” Mises (1949, p. 247) comments. “We are free to assume that infants are born, grow old, and finally die, provided that total population figures and the number of people in every age group remain equal.” Hence, agents might be viewed as either (1) infinitely-lived or (2) comprising an infinite sequence of overlapping generations where population and demographic characteristics are held constant. In equilibrium—when the economy is rotating evenly—agents are certain as to the future. They are hyperrational in the sense of having (1) unbiased beliefs and (2) the cognitive capacity to derive their optimal behavior contingent on these beliefs. As Mises (1949, p. 248) makes clear, the ERE is not populated by “living men making choices and liable to error,” but rather by “soulless unthinking automatons.”Footnote 2
 Whether there is time in the world of the ERE depends crucially on how one defines the concept. Mises (1949, p. 247) writes that “the elimination of the lapse of time and of the perpetual change in the market phenomena” is the “essence” of the ERE. However, definitive periods or sequences remain. For example, there are distinct stages of production, where the output of one stage comprises the input of the next. Similarly, the consumption decision made by each individual is essentially a question of whether to consume now or later. It is perhaps fair to say that, while processes take place over time in the ERE, decisions are made at a particular point in time.Footnote 3
 To understand how individual agents behave in the ERE, it is helpful to think of that moment when the underlying variables—technology, preferences, etc.—stop changing; or, if one prefers to think of a world in which change has never occurred, that moment when the initial conditions are revealed. It is at this point when agents select strategies to be repeated endlessly.Footnote 4 In the frictionless world of the ERE, there are no missing markets and agents can contract without cost. Common knowledge allows each agent to compute the optimal strategies for all others, and thereby assure that all strategies actually employed are consistent. Furthermore, the result is optimal in the sense that “all uneasiness has been removed or because any further removal of felt uneasiness is out of the question” (Mises 1949, p 244). Previously existing profit opportunities have been thoroughly exploited. In the Austrian literature, much attention has been given to questions of equilibration—or, perhaps more accurately, whether and to what extent such a process takes place—and the usefulness of equilibrium constructs like the ERE once equilibration has been taken into account (e.g., Cowen and Fink 1985; Rizzo 1992; Leeson and Boettke 2006). The consensus, if one exists, is that equilibration occurs for small departures from equilibrium.Footnote 5 How small is small and what results from departures beyond this critical threshold remain contested issues. These concerns surely deserve the attention they have received. However, the purpose here is merely to show that the equilibrium construct employed by Mises is similar to modern search-theoretic models. Hence, to whatever extent one accepts the use of an equilibrium construct, I maintain that the search-theoretic models reviewed below are on equal footing with the ERE.Footnote 6

On the theoretical side our understanding of entrepreneurship (Kirzner 1973; Holcombe 2007) and its relations to institutions (Baumol 1990; Boettke and Coyne 2003) has been greatly improved. On the empirical side, the development of the economic freedom database (Gwartney and Lawson 2003) and the empirical investigations based on it (e.g., Chauffour 2011; Faria and Montesinos 2009)Footnote 2 has reaffirmed this view. In addition, it has also been affirmed that entrepreneurship is the channel through which economic freedom turns into development (Bjørnskov and Foss 2008; Kreft and Sobel 2005; Nyström 2008; Sobel 2008; Sobel et al. 2007). In sum, it turns out, that the facts of economic development are in line with the theory of economic freedom and entrepreneurship. To understand economic growth, however, it may not be enough to look at long-run averages of growth rates and their explanatory factors. As the ambitious and fast-growing literature on “accelerations” and “decelerations” shows,Footnote 3 it would pay off to examine the ups and downs of the growth process instead of examining long-run cross sections. The facts uncovered by this literature pose a question for those looking at development through the lenses of entrepreneurship and economic freedom: Do these concepts help us understand accelerations and decelerations, too, just as they have helped us understand the long waves of development? This paper can be seen as a first step in answering this question as much as it concentrates on slowdowns in economic growth. The main hypothesis of this paper is that Austrian economics does have a theory of slowdowns. My proposition is that the Austrian theory of interventionism and non-productive entrepreneurship (Coyne et al. 2010) combined result in a theory of slowdowns in which economic freedom, political institutions, ideology and culture can be seen as elements of the same process. Based on this theory I propose that the interventionist process can be seen as a distinct cause of the slowdowns in economic growth. I will argue in four steps. After reviewing the literature on accelerations and decelerations in Section 2, I will present the theory of interventionism combined with the theory of stagnation (Coyne et al. 2010) as a theory of slowdowns in Section 3. This makes it possible to derive different hypotheses concerning the effects of institutional factors. Section 4 is an empirical evaluation of the propositions derived. Section 5 concludes.",2
27.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,18 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-013-0243-7,Reply to the Caplan and Gochenour critique of Georgism,December 2014,Fred Foldvary,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper refutes the proposition by Caplan and Gochenour (2012 and 2013) that there is no such thing as natural resources. Caplan and Gochenour use that proposition to argue against the reform proposal of Henry George (1879) and his followers, to replace all taxes with a single tax on land value. They dispute the Georgist proposition that a land value tax does not negatively alter economic activity. Caplan and Gochenour argue that land is a produced good, and therefore public revenue from land rent imposes a deadweight loss by inhibiting the production and improvement of land. The Caplan and Gochenour critique builds on that of Frank Knight, who claimed that land is not a natural resource, but is produced by its discovery and by the exertion of obtaining exclusive use, including that of expelling or eradicating the previous occupants. Caplan and Gochenour go beyond Knight in analyzing the “production” of land from a search for profit. For example, their claim is that entrepreneurs spend resources to discover oil, and so the oil is not a natural resource, but is produced from discovery and extraction. Knight’s assertions on land and Georgist concepts were rebutted by Tideman and Plassmann (2004) and Emmett (2008). The relevance of Knight here is that Caplan and Gochenour (2012, p. 4) state that their critique “builds directly on Knight’s concept of land as production,” which implies an endorsement, but they do not confront the rebuttals that have been made to Knight. The rebuttal to Caplan and Gochenour made by this paper is that the discovery of a resource does not constitute its production. The refutation here acknowledges the need for profit to reward entrepreneurship, but argues that entrepreneurship and investment create human capital and capital goods, not natural resources. Discovery is not the same as invention. The discovery of a new planet does not create that planet. To claim that all property is produced implies the absurd proposition that nothing existed prior to its discovery by human beings. The critique by Caplan and Gochenour applies also to private communities that finance their public goods from the rental value of their collective goods, where the ownership of the ground or the common elements is separate from the ownership of the improvements or of a unit in the community. If a tax on land value destroys entrepreneurship, so too does the tapping of ground rent to pay for the collective goods provided by a land trust, a condominium association, a mobile home park, a shopping center, or a seasteading community in the ocean. Hence the Caplan and Gochenour argument implies that there is market failure wherever land and buildings have separate owners, or when a voluntary contractual community finances its collective goods from the site rentals. Finally, the arguments of Caplan and Gochenour imply an approval of governmental subsidies, because the public goods provided by government generate higher land rentals and are capitalized into higher prices for real estate. If the landowners do not pay for these public goods, then in effect they become subsidized. Thus, given the fact that today much of public goods are provided by government, an opposition to taxing the generated rentals implies that one favors this implicit subsidy of land value and thus also the forced redistribution of income from worker tenants to landowners. And if the public goods are provided by the private sector, then the denial by Caplan and Gochenour that there is economic rent implies that the collection of payments from ground “quasi rents” destroys the entrepreneurship of the tenants. As an alternative to using ground rent for public revenue, Caplan and Gochenour propose Pigovian taxes on negative externalities. But pollution levies constitute a type of land tax, as a payment for the use of land as a dump. Moreover, if land is a produced good, then emissions could constitute the entrepreneurial exertion of creating a new production for property such as a river, and the expulsion of a previous use, and by the arguments of Caplan and Gochenour, following Knight, there may be no rationale for taxing such entrepreneurship.",1

Storr argues that the habit of the economics discipline to abstract away from culture has left it incapable of saying much that is relevant about the ways in which human beings navigate and drive the market process. A subtheme of Storr’s argument, and the theme I wish to take up here, is Storr’s emphasis on the animating spirits of capitalism we find in different eras and places. In particular, I wish to take the role of “place” in the development and perpetuation of an animating capitalist spirit seriously. As Storr points out, Weber recognizes that “different economic spirits animated the different forms of capitalism which existed in different places and in different eras. As such we should expect the spirit of capitalism in one place and time to differ in important respects from the spirit of capitalism in another place and time” (Storr 2012: 58). According to Storr, Weber’s principal thesis in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism was not that Protestantism caused modern capitalism. Rather, the primary claim is that “the particular ethos of modern capitalism and the attitudes toward work that emerge from Protestantism (particularly Puritanism) are (in many respects) identical” (ibid.: 59). From Storr we understand that Weber’s primary project in The Protestant Ethic was to demonstrate how a Puritan asceticism and modern capitalism fit comfortably together and reinforced one another. Similarly, in his studies of China and India, Weber (1951, 1958) argues that cultural affinities found in these contexts favored and fit within a traditionalist form of capitalism (ibid.: 61). Storr makes it clear that Weber’s original Protestant ethic thesis, when situated within his larger body of work, is more about the diverse forms an animating capitalist spirit can take across time and place. Thus, in Weber’s hands, “place” is best seen as a sort of caldron, in which a particular animating capitalist spirit stew is cooked up. Different people in different times and places will throw different ingredients into the pot, developing different varieties along the way. While place serves as a sort of vessel for the cultivation of a particular capitalist ethic, when considered through the Weberian lens, place is not one of the ingredients. In other words, place does not play an active role in defining the particular flavor of the local capitalist ethic. Similarly, in UCM Storr seems to treat place as a correlating factor in the variation of animating capitalist spirits, but not as a causal force behind this variation. The focus of my remarks here is to explore the possibilities and implications of place serving as an active ingredient in the development, reinforcement, and perhaps active cultivation of an animating capitalist spirit. By focusing on place as an active force, I am in one sense offering a friendly challenge to Storr. For nowhere in UCM does Storr mention the word “place” as a source of variation. When physical place is mentioned, it is in keeping with Weber, always caldron-like, not ingredient-like. Yet in another way, the direction I am taking here aligns perfectly with Storr’s project, which is to ground economic theory and empirical analysis in a context of social interactions among individuals whose perceptions, decisions, actions, and learning are informed and guided by a web of cultural meanings. All that needs to be articulated is that the physical place in which market interactions unfold may be a part of that web. Place is part of how we distinguish between markets as disembodied forces and markets as part of the social fabric that governs human interaction in all its particular forms. Further, in Storr’s discussions of the market as a social space and our collaborative work on the role of place in motivating post disaster recovery, Storr (2008) and Chamlee-Wright and Storr (2009a, 2009b, 2011) focus directly on the power of place to exert an active force in shaping purposeful human action. But what is missing, and what I believe will move Storr’s project forward, is a discussion of how place connects to the development and perpetuation of varied animating capitalist spirits.",1

Understanding the Culture of Markets is a well-argued and careful defense of a more serious investigation of the interaction of culture and economics. This position is made all the more difficult to present because of the need to proceed along two argumentative fronts, each of which requires an entire chapter to address individually: that culture should enter into economic analysis at all, and then, given that economists are going to make some investigation into culture, arguing for methods of (as the title suggests) understanding the cultural elements of economic action, rather than condensing culture into more familiar economic categories. Contra the first group of arguments that defend the absence of culture from economic activity addressed in chapter 2 of Understanding the Culture of Markets, Storr argues that, rather than a science of positive prediction, economics instead is, and ought to be, a science of meaning. While Storr traces his understanding of what a science of meaning is to Schutz (and ultimately, Weber), his defense that we ought to be concerned with meaning is drawn directly from Hayek.Footnote 1 Culture as an element of an economic science of meaning is more than the natural-resource or capital good that it commonly viewed as in the economic literature that does purport to examine the interaction of culture and markets. But, if culture is not a natural-resource or capital, not merely “a set of cultural tools” (Storr 2013: 39) that are picked up by economic actors when needed and set aside, what is it? This paper attempts to consider in more detail one speculative answer Storr gives, that culture is better understood as a constitution than as capital or a resource. I also consider the particular method he argues ought to be used to develop an understanding of the relationship of culture and market, that of identification of the ‘spirit’ of that culture’s economic activity.",

I am also extremely grateful to the commentators—Deirdre McCloskey, Emily Chamlee-Wright, Rob Garnett and Solomon Stein—who participated in the symposium. It is clear that they read the book carefully and critically. That they said many favorable things about the book is gratifying. That they offered critical comments about the effort and/or offered advice on how the arguments I made in the book might be advanced or improved is enlivening. After all, the purpose of doing scholarship is to participate in and extend a conversation that you are interested in not to bring that conversation to a close. I am thrilled with where this conversation about whether and how economists should include considerations of culture in their analysis appears to be going. Although the comments by each of the contributors highlight different themes, there is something quite similar with each of the critiques. They all have something of the following flavor: “I know Storr and he holds, or ought to hold, a set of positions that are way more radical than those he expresses in Understanding the Culture of Markets.” For instance, McCloskey points out that “from beginning to end Storr treats the neo-institutionalists such as Douglass North and Avner Greif gently. He should be a lot harder on them.” She also worries that I am too soft on Max Weber, whose approach to cultural economics I endorse in the book. Similarly, Chamlee-Wright argues that “Storr seems to treat place as a correlating factor in the variation of animating capitalist spirits” but does not “explore the possibilities and implications of place serving as an active ingredient in the development, reinforcement, and perhaps active cultivation of an animating capitalist spirit.” This is particularly worrisome, Chamlee-Wright concludes, because my own work (especially on post-disaster recovery and Bahamian history) suggests that place ought to have a prominent role in any discussion of how culture colors economic activity. Likewise, Garnett suggests that there is “a nascent radical thrust” to the project but that the book “provides few analytic details about the structure or consequences of his alternative approach to human action and market process.” Specifically, according to Garnett, I stop short of boldly stating that “the cultural turn means the end of disembedded, deterministic, closed-system economics—period.” Finally, Stein challenges whether my recommendation that economists stop treating culture as capital and instead treat it like a constitution goes far enough in distinguishing my approach. Moreover, he recommends that I go further than I do in the book to clarify exactly how the “economic spirits” that I tell economists to look for should be incorporated into economic analysis. As it turns out, I am not entirely unsympathetic to any these critiques. This should not be surprising since all the contributors do in fact “know Storr.” This, however, does leave me with only a few possible responses, all of them unpalatable or unsatisfactory.",4

Entrepreneurial opportunities are essentially arbitrage opportunities that exist because of the undervaluation of resources in the market. The entrepreneur “sees” a way to combine these resources in order to produce a product whose market value will exceed the market value of this combination and hence earn a profit. In this way, entrepreneurship provides a systemic coordinating function in facilitating the deployment of resources to their most highly-valued uses. Kirzner’s life-long exploration of this theme has provoked much appreciative and critical discussion within the economics profession and, especially, within Austrian economics. Recently, interest in his work has emerged and rapidly expanded in the field of management studies, and, particularly, in the growing sub-field of entrepreneurship studies. It is hard to find an article in this field which does not address the question of entrepreneurial opportunities and how they are perceived and exploited. A veritable industry of research into the nature, causes and effects of entrepreneurial opportunities has arisen in a very short time (some references are provided below). It is clear, however, that the concept “entrepreneurship” as conceived by Kirzner and as researched in this field of entrepreneurial studies are very different. There is a clear disconnect that is the result of different projects. Kirzner’s work is motivated by interest in the functioning of market systems as a whole and the role of entrepreneurship therein. Management scholars, by contrast, are interested in what accounts for entrepreneurial success and failure, that is, in the details of the entrepreneurial mind and the nature of entrepreneurial abilities. This literature thus involves investigations from cognitive psychology, sociology, network theory, strategic management, political theory, organizational theory as well as economics. The imagination of these researchers has been fired by Kirzner’s work which provided an unintended opportunity for entrepreneurial research to branch out into unexplored territory, the territory of opportunity-discovery in all of its manifold aspects. The differences between these two visions of entrepreneurship is related to well-known issues with Kirzner’s theory. For Kirzner entrepreneurship is a function and is not coextensive with any person or his actions. For Kirzner, the entrepreneurial act is constituted by, and only by, the momentary perception of the arbitrage opportunity; it is a revelation, an epiphany. The entrepreneur “sees” the value-differentials that constitute a profit opportunity. The execution of the opportunity is another (more mundane) matter. Once the opportunity is revealed it remains for the manager (who might be the same person) to act out its (obvious?) implications. Critics have pointed to logical problems with this (discussed below). The most significant perhaps is the connection between opportunity discovery and incentives. Kirzner posits that alert entrepreneurs discover opportunities and that alertness responds to incentives to be alert. Kirzner wants to draw policy conclusions. So he needs to tie entrepreneurial opportunity discovery to policies that produce the right incentives. The inability to convincingly do this has been a problem for the theory. For the management research that his work has spawned however, the focus is different. These researchers are interested in explaining entrepreneurship for its own sake, and in much more detail. Their research looks at real world entrepreneurs. In the examination of opportunities they have moved away from, beyond, Kirzner’s opportunity as momentary revelation. My primary purpose in this paper is to subject the Kirznerian entrepreneurial opportunity to a more thorough examination and to suggest a shortcoming that has not yet surfaced. In short, I maintain that the kind of bare-bones perception of an arbitrage opportunity won’t fly. It cannot square with what we know about how human’s think and how they experience time. When we unpack the various essential (undeniable) components of real entrepreneurial opportunities (of which there are three categories) we find an inescapable link to the work of the management scholars. When opportunities are seen as real-world contextual phenomena in which a perceived opportunity to create value contingent upon certain concrete actions and understandings, Kirzner’s arbitrage approach emerges more defensible and useful. The list of works analyzing the content and meaning of the concept of entrepreneurial opportunity is large (for a review see Short et al. 2009). The one offered here is suggested for its clarity, simplicity, ease of applicability and originality. The next section briefly summarizes the main elements of Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurship. The section following rehearses briefly the criticisms that have been leveled against it. I then turn to the core contribution of this paper—an examination of the “insides” of any entrepreneurial opportunity. We find that all entrepreneurial opportunities have three categories of ingredients—evaluations, actions and understandings and that when this is clearly spelled out, a reexamination of the criticisms (undertaken in the next section following) yields a different perspective. Entrepreneurial opportunities refer in this paper to market opportunities. Entrepreneurs exist in other settings as well. The penultimate section briefly discusses entrepreneurship in highly regulated environments and the role of political entrepreneurs in transforming such environments. We end with some concluding remarks.",14

This paper makes the analytic structure of this framework clearer and more explicit. Due to the emphasis on market process, rather than on the assumption of equilibrium, and on entrepreneurship as the driving force behind this process, the Austrian framework is better suited to account for the importance of ideas. I illustrate the theory by discussing both the political economy of advanced democracies and of developing countries. In my restatement, the Austrian framework of social-political change can be understood as the following set of propositions: (1) Culture-invariant economics exists (what Austrians call “praxeology”), and economic theory is useful for filtering out explanations of social phenomena that are not compatible with it. A corollary of this is that purely ideological explanations are always incomplete. (2) Culture is a set of ideas about the expected and desired function of various social arrangements (i.e. a prevailing “pattern of meanings”), and about how to achieve those functions, and it cannot be fully reduced to either notions of capital or to informal rules. (3) Because society is simply too complex for political decision-makers to be able to predict the specific effects of institutional changes, and because in a wide variety of situations people are shielded from the effects of their beliefs (e.g. as in the case of voting), incentive-invariant culture exists: (a) ideas with important social consequences, which people have limited personal ability or incentive to test for validity, exist; (b) people with different social statuses and interests often hold the same beliefs. (4) Because it is incentive-invariant, culture does not evolve by rational profit maximization; it evolves by group selection. (5) Culture and institutions co-evolve: Culture constraints the possible paths of institutional change, thus influencing which institutions are more likely to “stick” in a given cultural context; and existing institutions create differential costs and benefits for holding various ideas, thus influencing which ideas are more likely to spread in a given institutional context.",11

This more recent Methodenstreit is centered on the issue of quantifying uncertainty.Footnote 1 Neoclassical economics treats all uncertainty as quantifiable, while a fairly large fraction of modern Austrians support the Misesian position against quantifiable probability (Caplan 1999).Footnote 2 Mises’s apriorism rejects the quantifiable prediction of unique events – including most human actions – because quantifiable probability is meaningless in a world of structural uncertainty (Mises, 1996; Rothbard, 1993). Is it even logical to make a probabilistic statement about a unique future event? How would one be able to verify that probabilistic statement was correct? Is it even possible to reconcile the core of the Austrian methodology with such probabilistic statements? In this paper, we argue that prediction markets – which are traditional markets for forward-looking information – offer such reconciliation.Footnote 3
 A central tenet of the Austrian School is that economic analysis is subject to the subjective knowledge and values of the market participants (Boettke 2010). Similarly, the Bayesian approach holds that a probability value is not a property of an event itself but arises in the subjective evaluation of an event by a person. To a frequentist statistician, the frequency of an event’s occurrence determines its objective probability. Thus, a non-repeatable event must have no numerical probability value (Mises, 1996; Rothbard, 1993; Mises, 1957). People, however, eagerly assign subjective probability to unique events such as the presidential election or the space shuttle crash. This probability is derived from understanding rather than from experience. We argue that a prediction market offers a valuable tool of praxeological forecasting. Prediction markets allow market participants to express unique events numerically. Austrian economics poses an important problem of forecasting non-repeatable events in a world of uncertainty and radical ignorance (Boettke 1994; Vaughn 1994).Footnote 4 Hayek (1945: 519–20) wrote that the peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is… the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality. According to Lewin (2001: 245), “Hayek’s challenge has stimulated much effort within neoclassical economics about how to design mechanisms to deal with the implications of information that is personal, incomplete and dispersed.” Prediction markets offer a valuable method of taking up Hayek’s challenge. Mises’ methodological position on forecasting allows for pattern prediction of future events. We argue that prediction markets offer an effective method of forecasting that supports Mises’s methodological position. Thus, Austrian economists should embrace prediction markets as powerful method of forecasting rooted in human action (see Lewin 2012; Boettke 2010; 1994; Boettke and Prychitko 1994; Vaughn 1994).",1
28.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,22 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-012-0190-8,Monetary equilibrium,March 2015,Joshua R. Hendrickson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The concept of monetary equilibrium is one that permeates a broad spectrum of monetary theory.Footnote 1 Put succinctly, monetary equilibrium describes the condition under which actual money balances are equal to desired money balances. According to the theory of monetary equilibrium, deviations between actual and desired money balances have adverse consequences on market welfare. For Monetarists, the deviations result in a decline in nominal spending and real output. For Austrians and coordination Keynesians, such deviations result in a divergence between the market and natural rate of interest that, in the Austrian case, leads to a misallocation of capital. A common conclusion that follows from this concept is that the money supply should vary with money demand so as to maintain the stability of nominal income and the equilibrium interest rate. In a recent paper, Bagus and Howden (2011) challenge the idea consistent with monetary equilibrium theory that the money supply should vary with money demand. The authors argue that such a conclusion is based on what they perceive as the fundamental foundation of monetary equilibrium theory, namely price stickiness.Footnote 2 Subsequently, they argue that price stickiness is a weak reed upon which to rest this normative conclusion. Rather than address the issue of price stickiness directly, the purpose of this paper is to provide an explicit account of the concept of monetary equilibrium and to consider how a central bank or a free banking system should operate within that framework. The central foundation of monetary equilibrium theory is the role of money as medium of exchange, not price stickiness. Money’s unique role as medium of exchange means that changes in the demand for money will reverberate throughout all markets. As a result, increases in the demand for money will cause reductions in spending across markets. Further, it is the position of monetary equilibrium theory that these reductions in spending are welfare-reducing and that corresponding changes in the money supply, whether by a central bank or through competitive note issuance, can improve welfare. While it is true that a number of previous proponents of monetary equilibrium have relied on the assumption of sticky prices to generate this conclusion, it will be shown below that sticky prices are not a necessary condition for the conclusion. The assumption of sticky prices is necessary only to the extent that one relies on the assumption of Walrasian markets. In what follows, a monetary search model is employed to examine the role of monetary equilibrium. The use of this framework is important because it provides an essential role for money in the exchange process, a definition for the determination of observed economic aggregates such as velocity and nominal income, and an explicit measure of market welfare. The model is therefore capable of considering the effects of aggregate money demand shocks on nominal spending and market welfare. Given the basic structure and implications of model, the role of central banks and competitive note issuance is considered. In the case of the central bank, a nominal income target in which the money supply is adjusted based on changes in money demand is considered to be an optimal policy. In addition, it is shown that under free banking with competitive note issuance, banks will vary the money supply with the demand for money. Throughout the model, prices are flexible. Thus, price stickiness is not a necessary condition for advocating a free banking system in which the notes in circulation vary with the demand for money nor a monetary policy that varies the money supply in response to fluctuations in money demand. Rather, it is the existence of decentralized trade, or non-Walrasian markets, that generates these results.",9

The mainstream view believes in well-meaning policymakers who operate for the common good, whatever this term means. Although distortions and abuse are acknowledged, it is also believed that these can be reined in and that government action eventually succeeds in obtaining wealth-enhancing compromises among conflicting interests. Public choice economists put forward a different picture. In their view, policymakers are essentially rent-seekers: politicians and bureaucrats are seen as taking advantage of their discretionary power and porous accountability for the express purpose of promoting their own self-interest. These pages side with the public choice camp. We believe that the mechanisms characterizing modern democracies are designed to select representatives who are neither particularly altruistic, nor overly concerned with the moral perimeter of their power. Given this, we are convinced that they are rarely able to resist the temptation to legislate, regulate and increase expenditure; that they are inclined to conceal the weight of taxation (possibly through public indebtedness),Footnote 1 rather than limit its burden; and that most of their actions focus on managing redistribution and privileges, rather than producing eventual public goods. Because politicians are eager to manage large public budgets, they need significant revenues.Footnote 2 Economists and policymakers have investigated how such revenues can be maximized and their work is often known as “the economics of the Laffer curve”. This paper aims to extend this literature in a new direction. In particular, after recalling the main insights provided by the Laffer curve (section 2), in section 3 we argue that this instrument fails to take into account important determinants of policymakers’ behaviour. We develop a new graphical analysis that fills the gap by introducing elements thus far neglected by the traditional approach: the quality of public expenditure, populism, and the politicians’ time horizon. This new analytical instrument is then applied to examine relatively recent phenomena: tax competition (section 4) and tax harmonization (section 5). Section 6 summarizes the main results and concludes.",1

Policies and politics in areas of limited statehood meets positive political economy of anarchy: A review essay,March 2015,Alexander Fink,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The contributors to Governance Without a State? (Risse 2011) examine governance in areas where states are absent, too weak, or unwilling to provide “governance by government” (p. 9).Footnote 1 Governance as understood by the editor of the volume, Thomas Risse, stands for “institutionalized modes of social coordination to produce and implement collectively binding rules, or to provide collective goods” (p. 9). Following the introduction by the editor, nine chapters explore various aspects of governance in situations where social cooperation does not take place in the shadow of a modern western democratic nation-state. As Risse highlights (p. 2), today and historically the modern nation-state of the western democratic variety has been the exception rather than the rule. To date, the vast majority of humans have not lived their lives in western-style democratic states. The present volume is highly relevant for social scientists who are interested in understanding social phenomena under such alternative institutional circumstances. My goal for this essay is to provide an overview of Governance Without a State? by relating its contributions to works in the economics literature. The contributors to Governance Without a State? take the existence of areas of limited statehood as a starting point (p. 9) and analyze forms of governance observable under these circumstances. Contributions to a parallel research program, which Boettke (2005, 2011) identifies as “Positive Political Economy of Anarchism” or “Analytical Anarchism”, also study phenomena in the absence of an entity that holds a geographic monopoly over the provision of law and order (Boettke 2011, 128). Since the 1970s economists have added to the stock of theoretical analyses of anarchy. Akin in spirit to the contributions of Governance without a State?, since the 1980s economists have increasingly turned to providing empirical explorations of mechanisms that facilitate social interactions outside the area of a state’s influence.Footnote 2
 The articles collected in Governance Without a State? and the works on analytical anarchism share in common the insight that social cooperation does not vanish when a functioning state is absent. In such situations alternative modes of governance foster social cooperation under the division of labor. Governance without a State? is a collection of works by scholars from such diverse disciplines as political science, international affairs, history, and law who participate in the Collaborative Research Center ‘Governance in Areas of Limited Statehood’ funded by the German Research Foundation. “Limited statehood” is defined as the inability of a central authority to implement and enforce its decisions in part of its territory, with respect to certain policy areas, with regard to certain members of society, or for a period of time (pp. 4–5). The editor stresses that “limited statehood does not mean anarchy in a Hobbesian sense” (p. 9). Contributors to the research program identified by Boettke (2005, 2011) as Positive Political Economy of Anarchism also do not assume that a Hobbesian fight of all against all persists when a central authority with a monopoly over the use of force is absent. The term “anarchy” is used here to indicate the absence of a state holding a monopoly over the use of force and has therefore a similar meaning as the term “limited statehood” used by the contributors to Governance without a State?
 The essay proceeds as follows. Section 2 relates relevant contributions from Governance without a State? to findings in the economics literature on governance in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups absent the support of a centralized government. Section 3 discusses select contributions of Governance without a State? in light of insights from the economics literature on the problems of improving the lives of people in developing countries by changing the governance conditions from the outside. Chapter 4 contains concluding remarks.",

The Austrian economists von Mises (1947[1920]) and later Hayek (1948) famously critiqued central planning on the basis of the unique knowledge generating properties of the market order. Since all knowledge exists in dispersed form, within the minds of the individuals that comprise society, no single planning entity can have access to it in its totality. Instead, only by relying on the free interplay of market prices can the dispersed and fragmented bits of knowledge become coordinated. That is, the rise and fall of prices communicate relevant knowledge to individuals, who, driven by their self-interest, will expand their purchases, curtail them, use substitutes, pursue a discovery process toward alternate technologies and so forth. Even though the logic of this argument is widely regarded as an important contribution to economics (see Arrow et al. 2011), and appreciated by some contemporary proponents of socialist thought (Burzcak 2006; Cumbers and McMaster 2010; Wainwright 1994) it suffered from a Cassandra-like existence until well into the 1980s. As Levy and Peart (2011) have shown, economic textbooks proclaimed the superiority of central planning due to its higher forced savings rates, and therefore investment generating properties without considering knowledge problem arguments. Many proponents of the postwar left (Marcuse 1964; Fromm 1965; Pollock 1978) advocated partial or full nationalization of the economy without showing any understanding of the previous debate. Marcuse (1964) wrote “If the productive apparatus could be organized and directed toward the satisfaction of vital need, its control might well be centralized; such control would not prevent individual autonomy, but render it possible” (Marcuse 1964, p.2) and he mentions the “greater rationality of industrialization” in the Soviet Union, in which it can “proceed [..] without the restrictions on productivity imposed by the interests of private profit” (Marcuse 1964, p.39). Similarly, Fromm wrote “the irrational and planless character of society must be replaced by planned economy that represents the planned and concerted effort of society as such” (Fromm 1965, p.270). It must be noted that these early Frankfurt School writers cannot be categorized neatly into one coherent school of thought. Their ideas were sometimes conflicting. Fromm, for example, stands out because of his emphasis on democratic forms of planning. Pollock, on the other hand, must be regarded as an outlier as he was the only fairly uncritical proponent of Soviet style planning. This paper focuses on the common ideas instead, most importantly the danger of the instrumental rationality bred in markets and the support for some form of comprehensive central planning. The second blow to socialism came in the form of an empirical realization. Rising living standards in western Europe and North America represented a more immediate critique than the slowly unfolding Austrian argument. It directly undermined the Marxian prediction of material misery (but not the alienation one) and demanded theoretical reflection. Despite the Second World War, the 1950s saw a return to a surpassing of previous levels of prosperity in most countries. Although many conventional macroeconomic aggregates such as GDP per capita did not indicate the widening gap between the largely market-oriented economies of the West and the Soviet-style economies, one look at the actual consumption possibilities of the average person in each system made the difference clear (Schroeder 1991). North Americans and Western Europeans had more and better material goods, as well as a cleaner environment and healthier lives (see Brainerd 2010; Medvedev 1990), than did their nominally socialist counterparts. Thirdly, as more and more details of Soviet reality became known, the popular support for central planning in its original form collapsed. Even if these countries had generated the economic growth they appeared to at first glance, the political repression that accompanied that growth was becoming increasingly intolerable. Soviet industrialization came at the price of an unprecedented human tragedy, which shocked many Marxists in the West. Finally, the discovery of the Paris Manuscripts from 1844 greatly changed the interpretation of Marx. The documents revealed more philosophical and emotional, rather than economic avenues of reasoning (See Tucker 1961). As the ideas of Mises and Hayek became more prevalent in academia, and as increasing living standards and the knowledge of Soviet brutality put at least the material prediction of Marxism in question, two separate intellectual branches appeared. First, most social scientists abandoned the socialist project and entered the discussion of market failure and state intervention, an ongoing debate that is exemplified by environmental problems, macroeconomic interventions, redistribution policies and others. Distinct from these ongoing social science debates, a smaller intellectual current developed, loosely known as the New Left, and featured most prominently by the shared ideas of the Frankfurt School. As its existence is founded upon philosophical and psychological ideas and not economics, it remained untouched by the Socialist Calculation Debate, but not by the more immediate empirical realization of increasing material wealth in market economies. Since the increase in per capita wealth had to be incorporated into a theoretical Socialist construction, the New Left re-examined the more complex and difficult concepts, such as alienation and the nature of rationality in Marx, in order to justify their rejection of capitalism. What is fascinating about the Frankfurt School is that, on an analytical level, they had a number of things in common with modern classical liberals such as F.A. Hayek and, to a lesser extent, James Buchanan. Both groups describe the uneasiness felt by individuals in a modern society despite increasing prosperity. In addition, both of them show concern over the rationalism commonly associated with the Enlightenment, yet they arrive at vastly different conclusions to its implications. We argue that the modern version of socialism suffers from a number of problems and is ultimately less satisfying than the liberal defense of markets. Despite their attempt to distance themselves from orthodox Soviet Marxism their ideas lead back to totalitarianism and poverty.",

Wagner,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Any analytical framework both reveals and conceals phenomena of potential interest. While a framework allows us to see more clearly where it shines its light, it also necessarily takes our attention away from what an alternative framework might have revealed (Lachmann, 1978 [1973], p. 3). This situation pertains to claims about changes in the quantity of money. It goes almost without saying that the quantity theory of money is one of the indispensable theorems of economics because it spells out the link between money aggregates and the price level. The quantity theory is, however, combined with the presumption that our observations pertain to states of equilibrium, where neutrality of money is a condition of long-run equilibrium. While the presumption of long-run neutrality is effective in revealing the relationship between money and the price level, it also conceals the processes that a change in the money supply sets in motion. The concealment is not a historical fact, as Lastrapes (2006) illustrates by showing a causal link between monetary policy and persistent change in relative prices. It is rather an analytical artifact of equilibrium reasoning. To allow theoretical space for monetary processes to exert persistent effects requires use of an alternative analytical framework with bottom-up orientation toward macro phenomena, as illustrated by De Grauwe (2010). In this alternative non-equilibrium framework, monetary changes influence patterns of real activity even if some observed macro aggregates may suggest invariance. The constraints of equilibrium frameworks in accounting for long-term effects are closely related to Shackle’s (1972, 1974) recognition that the presumption of equilibrium neuters any analytical work that might accompany the passing of time. Equilibrium is outside of time because wants, knowledge, and expectations are just data in equilibrium theorizing. If the data remain the same between two equilibriums, it is reasonable to conclude that time has been frozen and those equilibriums pertain to the same historical instant. Equilibrium is, however, but an analytical convention as Lucas notes in an interview with Snowdon and Vane (1998, p. 127). Non-equilibrium modes of analysis are also possible, as illustrated by Katzner (1998) and Shackle (1972, 1974). Once we allow action to occur through time, people acting in this world acquire knowledge, which in turn exerts real economic effects. The introduction of time and change into economic theory has deeper consequences than turning the spotlight towards endogenous change in certain variables. The awareness of time and change also illuminates the causal factors of change as Cowan and Rizzo (1996) point out. With the idea of causality in mind, it suddenly matters how changes are brought about, who is the initiator of change, how change progresses through the society, and how different people react to the progressing chain of changes (Lachmann, 1986, p. 4). In consequence of treating time substantively, we set forth an analytical framework whereby monetary processes can in the long run exert real economic effects. This alternative framework drops the presumption that observations pertain to equilibrium states that can be compared by using the method of comparative statics. It postulates instead a non-equilibrium process of continual activity through time, as illustrated by Wagner’s (2010, pp. 137–59, 2012a) treatment of a macro ecology of plans where macro-level variables supervene on micro-level relationships and interactions. We start by exploring how monetary processes can influence experimentation, learning, and expectations within an ecology of plans. Following the insight of Cantillon (2010 [1755]), we recognize that by redistributing resources, monetary processes influence the mix of entrepreneurial experiments that are injected into society. Our non-equilibrium framework allows us to point out that the redistributions are not inconsequential blips of history. Redistributive monetary processes lead to experiments that change historical paths. Besides being a medium of exchange, money is also a medium of change. The ability of monetary processes to produce lasting effects on the real economy makes it easy to understand why monetary institutions are so highly contested within societies, as illustrated by D’Arista’s (2009) examination of evolution in the international monetary order. Such contestation would seem baffling if monetary processes had no persistent real effects. To the contrary, money is a locus of societal turbulence, a commanding height where control of that height is being continually contested. Our framework of non-neutral monetary processes is not, however, antagonistic with the enduring truth of the classical proposition that the real economy is independent of its nominal indicators. There is no inconsistency in embracing both propositions because they are non-commensurable: long-run non-neutrality is a feature of movement through time—it is a historical fact; long-run neutrality is a necessary condition for systemic equilibrium outside of time—it is an analytical artifact.",17

According to the Austrian theory, a monetary policy that expands the credit supply and lowers interest rates below the equilibrium rate results in a cluster of errors that eventually transform a boom into a bust. The rational expectations critique holds that it is unwarranted to base a theory on systematic errors on the part of otherwise reasonably smart entrepreneurs. In answering this objection, the debate has not paid sufficient attention to the problem that monetary policy distorts the market structure through marginal entrepreneurs and not through a representative economic agent. An exception is Evans and Baxendale (2008), who mention but do not develop this issue. This problem deserves further scrutiny. The question of expectations is important. The debate regarding the disagreement between the ABCT and the rational expectations critique not only contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of the theory but also relates directly to the concept and use of expectations in economic theory. Rational expectations are not only part of business cycle theories but also a cornerstone of general economic theory. This article contributes to the recent literature on the ABCT in three ways. First, the role of expectations in the ABCT literature is addressed by focusing on how the marginal entrepreneur affects the market share of resource allocations. To this end, I extend the works of Callahan and Horwitz (2010), Carilli and Dempster (2008) and Evans and Baxendale (2008) to demonstrate how expectations affect the market share of unsustainable investments in the presence of a loose monetary policy. It is difficult to assert that the market share of resource allocation has never been mentioned in this debate. However, this topic has not received the attention that it deserves. To the best of my knowledge, no study on this subject focuses on the market share of resources among different types of economic activity. Second, this paper offers a modern representation of ABCT insights using the economic value added (EVA®) literature, which is a largely unexamined connection.Footnote 1 J. C. Cachanosky (1999) is the only attempt I am aware of that tries to embed Austrian theory in the EVA® framework. The present paper demonstrates how the capital theory insights of the ABCT have a straightforward financial interpretation. The EVA® presentation aids the understanding of the business cycle problem in general and the role of expectations in particular. Contrary to economic models that assume that entrepreneurs act as if they were in the world described by the model, to frame the ABCT in the EVA® literature demonstrates how economic agents actually make decisions. Third, this paper adds to the literature that updates the ABCT with respect to modern economic institutions. N. Cachanosky (2012, 2014), Hoffmann (2010, 2012), Kollar (2008) and White and Selgin (2010) study the ABCT under fiat currencies rather than the gold standard and in an international context. Cowen (1997) and Young (2012) focus on the role of risk in the ABCT. Wagner (1999) argues that one requirement in modernizing the ABCT is to study divergent expectations. The present paper updates the expectations assumed to be in place in the ABCT in the manner suggested by Wagner. The article is structured as follows. The first section reviews the rational expectations critique of the ABCT literature. The second section develops in further detail the role of expectations in the ABCT. The third section discusses why this problem does not occur in the absence of an expansive monetary policy.",21

In this regard, one of the most renowned approaches is that of Acemoglu and Robinson (2000, 2001, 2006, 2012). To Acemoglu and Robinson, representative democracy is a regime characterized by political equality because elections ensure that selected policies reflect the will of the majority as opposed to the will of the political elites: In a democracy, the majority of the population is allowed to vote and express their preferences about policies, and the government is supposed to represent the preferences of the whole population—or, using a common description, “democracy is the government by the people for the people.” (…) Nevertheless, these nondemocratic regimes share one common element: instead of representing the wishes of the population at large, they represent the wishes of a subgroup of the population: the “elite.”(…) From this, it is clear that democracies generally approximate a situation of political equality relative to nondemocracies that, in turn, represent the preferences of a much smaller subset of society and thus correspond more to a situation of political inequality. (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006) A similar perspective on the role of elections in converting the will of the people into policies can be found in the literature on political competition (i.e. Lindbeck and Weibull 1987; Osborne and Slivinski 1996; Stigler 1972). In their comprehensive survey, Persson and Tabellini group models of representative democracy into two major categories: models of pre-election politics and models of post-election politics, also known as models of legislative bargaining (Persson and Tabellini 2002). In the models of pre-election politics the competing candidates are portrayed as committing to specific policies before the elections. This commitment renders a voter’s choice of a candidate equivalent with the voter’s policy preferences. As a result, elections become a mechanism of aggregating voters’ policy preferences. In the most restrictive form of the model, competition for votes, funding, and offices is capable of generating political outcomes that are equally efficient to those of the market process (Wittman 1997). In contrast, in the models of legislative bargaining, there is no mechanism of credible commitment to specific policies so voters do not select among policies but rather among agents who will later engage in policy formation. As a consequence, the role of elections is reduced from that of aggregating voters’ preferences to monitoring and policing representatives’ behavior. Though unable to select specific policies, voters use reelection to reward those who pursued their interests and force the exit of those who failed. While Persson and Tabellini view the models of pre-election and post-election competition as radically different, the underlying commonality is undeniable: in both cases elections induce competition and drive the political process.",2
28.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,16 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-014-0264-x,Some statistical aspects of precautionary reserves in banking,June 2015,Ben O’Neill,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The standard model form in this field (e.g., those set out in Olivera 1971) takes net demands to be determined from some exogenous source without reference to existing deposits. This kind of model form specifies demands as coming from some statistical distribution based on specification of the mean and standard deviation of net demand. Distributions are generally such as to allow asymptotic convergence to the normal distribution as the volume increases, based on appeal to the central limit theorem. Here we adopt an entirely different model form. We will instead begin with a specification of the structure of deposits from some arbitrary number of depositors and consider individual withdrawal demands made by those depositors during some particular time period. For simplicity we will ignore the prospect of additional deposits in this time, and focus only on the withdrawals. To this end, we let X
1, X
2, …, X

n
 be some positive amounts deposited by n > 1 depositors and θ
1, θ
2, …, θ

n
 be the individual proportions of the deposits that the depositors require for withdrawal during the time period of interest. (Since these are proportions they are always values between zero and one.) This model form allows us to deal with the general case where we can specify any particular structure to the deposits, including the number of depositors, their share of the overall pool of deposits, and the distributions of their individual withdrawal proportions. To deal with the latter we will denote the standard deviations of the withdrawal proportions by σ
1, σ
2, …, σ

n
 respectively and use these to measure volatility. This is justified by the fact that the reserves required for precautionary purposes will generally be proportional to the standard deviation of the reserve losses (see e.g., Baltensperger 1980, p. 9; Laidler 1991, p. 186). To analyse the requirements for precautionary reserves we let θ
* be the overall proportion required for withdrawal out of the total stock of deposits (we will refer to this as the “overall withdrawal proportion”) and we let σ
* be its standard deviation. The standard deviation is the quantity of interest in determining the reserve requirement for the bank. We have:
 To facilitate our analysis we also define the quantity:
 This latter quantity is a weighted sum of the standard deviations of the individual withdrawal proportions. It corresponds to the weighted sum used to determine the overall withdrawal proportion. This is a quantity that will arise frequently in our analysis, since it aggregates the volatility of each of the individual withdrawal demands. Our interest here is in the distribution of the overall withdrawal proportion θ
* based on the underlying joint distribution of the individual withdrawal proportions. We want to be able to deal with correlation between the withdrawal demands, so that we are not restricted to the case where these are assumed to be independent. In this analysis we take the initial deposit amounts to be fixed quantities, so that the random variables in our analysis are the various withdrawal proportions. Without loss of generality we denote the correlation between θ

i
 and θ

j
 by ρ

i,j
 so that their covariance can be written as:
 Now, taking the variance of the overall withdrawal proportion we clearly have:
 (Rules for variances of linear functions can be found in any textbook on probability theory; see e.g., Bartoszyński and Niewiadomska-Bugaj 1996.) This gives us a general formula for the volatility of the overall withdrawal proportion, in terms of the underlying volatilities of the individual withdrawal proportions, the correlations between these quantities, and the relevant deposit amounts. This is a very general expression, and it is probably too general to be of much use in understanding the dynamics of precautionary reserves. However, it is possible even at this stage to establish a basic result about the volatility of the overall withdrawal proportion, which justifies the aggregation of deposits. If θ
1, θ
2, …, θ

n
 are all perfectly positively correlated then we have σ
* = σ
(1). Otherwise we have σ
* < σ
(1). Suppose that θ
1, θ
2, …, θ

n
 have equal volatility σ ≡ σ
1 = … = σ

n
. If they are all perfectly positively correlated then we have σ
* = σ. Otherwise we have σ
* < σ. From (3) we know that the variance of the overall withdrawal proportion is:
 If the individual withdrawal proportions θ
1, θ
2, …, θ

n
 are all perfectly positively correlated we have ρ

i,j
 = 1 for all i, j so that:
 If the withdrawal proportions are not all perfectly positively correlated then at least one of the summation terms in the numerator for the variance is reduced. (This follows from the fact that each of the deposit amounts X
1, X
2, …, X

n
 and standard deviation values σ
1, σ
2, …, σ

n
 are strictly positive quantities.) This implies that σ

2*
 < σ

2(1)
. The result then follows from taking the square root of the variance values to obtain standard deviations. Theorem 1 shows that the overall proportion of withdrawals from the total stock of deposits is less volatile than the weighted volatilities of the individual withdrawal proportions, so long as the individual withdrawal proportions are not perfectly correlated. This shows us that there is a reduction in volatility by virtue of aggregating withdrawals that are not perfectly positively correlated. The corollary shows the case where all the withdrawal proportions are equally volatile, in which case we get a nice simple volatility result. Note that the theorem does not rely on any asymptotic results in statistical theory, such as the law of large numbers or the central limit theorem. Moreover, it explicitly allows for dependence between the individual withdrawal proportions. Theorem 1 is a useful start in our analysis. The main reason to include this result is to head off the common misconception that volatility is only reduced when the individual withdrawal demands are independent (or at least uncorrelated). We can see here that this is not the case—even strong positive correlation, short of perfect correlation, leads to a reduction in volatility compared to the individual case. This justifies the view that there is a possibility of properly functioning fractional-reserve banking even in cases where withdrawal demands are correlated with one another, so long as the correlation is not too strong.",

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the nineteenth century, as the Industrial Revolution was in its first century, the conventional wisdom in political economy was that capital works against the interests of the working class, and there was strong – if casual – evidence to support the conventional wisdom. Factory workers worked physically demanding and dangerous jobs and received wages that were barely sufficient to enable them to survive. It was not difficult to characterize capital as the foe of labor. The welfare of the working class improved markedly moving into the twentieth century, largely due to the increase in capital. As capital/labor ratios increased, the marginal product of labor rose, and with it, wages rose to the point where the working class enjoyed a very comfortable standard of living. The twenty-first century has seen renewed concern that the capitalist system puts working-class people at a disadvantage when compared to the owners of capital, resulting in greater inequality. Piketty (2014) is a recent and prominent contributor to this line of reasoning. After a brief overview of the role of capital and its effect on labor, Piketty’s framework will be used as a starting point for the analysis of the relationship between capital and labor, and the effect of capital on overall welfare. Using the capital theory developed by Hayek and extended by contemporary economists in the Austrian school, an analysis of Piketty’s framework indicates that he has oversimplified both the role of capital in an economy and its effects on the working class. Piketty’s major policy recommendations do not hold up when taking a more nuanced approach to capital. A market process analysis shows the interests of capital and labor to be congruent, but another literature looks at the political process and concludes that the economic elite is able to capture the political process to enact policies that benefit them at the expense of the general public. When the political process is incorporated into the analysis, the conclusion that the interests of capital and labor are not in conflict does not hold up as well as when the analysis is confined to an examination of market forces alone.",4

Kirzner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The birth of the Austrian School is typically identified as occurring with the 1871 publication of Menger’s Grundsätze. The 143-year history of this school is usually seen as beginning with a sixty-year steady growth in its importance and in its professional reputation, followed (in the 1930s) by a precipitous decline. That decline led to a thirty-year period (from about 1940 to about 1970) generally seen as the low point in its history. From the point of view of the mainstream of economic thought, during those decades the Austrian School had virtually disappeared. The debates of the ‘thirties, it was generally believed, had decisively defeated the Austrians (represented, in most accounts, by Ludwig Mises and Friedrich Hayek) in regard to macroeconomic issues (in which Keynes and Keynesians were seen as having overwhelmed Hayek), in regard to the socialist calculation debate (in which, Lange, Lerner, and others were seen to have thoroughly discredited Mises’ bold, politically-charged challenges to the profession), and in regard to the more abstract issues in capital theory (in which Frank Knight was seen to have conclusively bested Hayek’s attempts to reaffirm the classic “Austrian” Bohm-Bawerkian positions, long-ago challenged by John Bates Clark.) Moreover, the Austrians were seen as having been hopelessly unable to keep up with modern methodological developments in the profession. Austrians were out-of-date in regard to the exciting advances in mathematical economics and in econometric research. Mises’ insistence on the purely logical, a priori, character of economic theory was seen as thoroughly out-of-step with a twentieth century philosophy of science rooted in the empirical. To boot, the political unrest of the 1930s, which physically scattered the group of Austrian scholars who had surrounded Mises in Vienna, meant that the Austrian “School” existed, for economists between 1940 and 1970, strictly as a bygone episode in the history of economic thought. This perception on the part of the wider economics profession, that the Austrian School had, by the end of World War II, disappeared was, curiously enough, reinforced by a sense somehow developed among key members of the Vienna group, that a separate identity for an Austrian School was no longer needed. (Perhaps Gottfried Haberler and Fritz Machlup can be mentioned in this regard.) It appears that these eminent Austrians, and others, honestly believed that what was importantly new in the Austrian economics developed between 1871 and 1930 had, by the end of World War II, in fact been successfully absorbed into the mainstream body of economic thought. To insist on a uniquely “Austrian” label was, from this point of view, professionally counter-productive and, in the worst sense of the term, backward-looking. The wider profession had fully embraced the once-novel Austrian ideas on opportunity cost, on marginalist thinking, on the subjectivism needed for the analysis of the demand side of the market. To insist on a separate label, seemed, to these “former” Austrians, to insist on an unfruitful intellectual isolationism. A final nail in the coffin of the Austrian School was, in the view of mainstream economists, driven by what was seen as the utter unfashionability of its ideological implications (as understood by the mainstream). In a post-war era in which socialist ideals were widely seen as shining pointers to a progressive future, in which the role of massive government planning and control was not to be questioned, Mises’ and Hayek’s defense of free markets and classical liberalism, was seen simply as ante-deluvian. To identify oneself as an Austrian was almost to place oneself outside the perimeter of modern, civilized, social discourse. With the Austrian School seen, in this “orthodox” view, as having simply died, by mid-century, the resurgence of interest in the School which began in the 1970s can be seen as an intriguing, mystifying history-of-thought puzzle. What was responsible for this mysterious resurrection of an intellectual tradition long though to be completely dead? We will interpret the theme assigned for this keynote lecture as being to explore the possibility of dispelling this mystery by reference to the important 1974 award of the Nobel Prize in Economics, to Friedrich Hayek. What role, if any, did the award of this prize play in the remarkable resurgence of Austrian Economics during the past four decades?",2

Maskin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Mechanism design is the engineering part of economic theory. Usually, in economics, we take economic institutions as given and try to predict the economic or social outcomes that these institutions generate. But in mechanism design, we reverse the direction. We begin by identifying the outcomes that we want. Then, we try to figure out whether some mechanism – some institution – can be constructed to deliver those outcomes. If the answer is yes, we then explore the form that such a mechanism might take. Sometimes the solution is a “standard” or “natural” mechanism - - e.g. the “market mechanism.” Sometimes it is novel or artificial. For example, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (Vickrey 1961; Clarke 1971; Groves 1973) mechanism can be used for obtaining an efficient allocation of public goods - - which will typically be underprovided in a standard market setting (see Samuelson 1954). Friedrich von Hayek’s work was an important precursor to the modern theory of mechanism design. Indeed, Leonid Hurwicz – the father of the subject – was directly inspired by the Planning Controversy between Hayek and Ludwig von Mises on the one hand and Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner on the other to develop the theory (see Arrow 2007). In the Planning Controversy, Lange and Lerner asserted that central planning can in principle replicate the workings of the free market. Indeed by correcting market failures, central planning, they claimed, can even improve on market performance (see, for example, Lange 1942 and Lerner 1944). By contrast, Hayek and Mises denied that a centralized system – or, for that matter, any other non-market mechanism – could ever approach the success of the free market (see, for example, Mises 1933). Hayek gave at least two reasons why the free market cannot be improved upon. First, he asserted that other Pareto optimal mechanisms – mechanisms leading to Pareto optimal allocations of resources – require more information than the market does. That is, a consumer or producer has to report more information about himself (e.g., his preferences or technology), and he needs to know more about other consumers and producers (e.g., about their demands and supplies). Second, Hayek claimed other Pareto optimal mechanisms, unlike the market, are in conflict with consumers’ and producers’ own interests, i.e., they are not incentive compatible. I will suggest in this paper that the mechanism design literature has provided precise treatments of these two claims. Specifically, it has established that Hayek’s first assertion is, in fact, correct in settings in which there are no significant externalities (so that, in particular, there are no public goods). Moreover, the literature has also verified his second claim, given the additional assumption there are large numbers of consumers and producers (so that none of them has market power). Section 2 looks at the informational assertion, and Section 3 at the incentives claim. I offer a few additional remarks in Section 4. In keeping with Hayek’s informality, I will express the main results nonmathematically (but will offer technical formulations in square-bracketed remarks).",13

Hayek visited Chile twice, once in November 1977, and again in April 1981, both visits taking place while General Augusto Pinochet was President. On the first trip, in addition to receiving an honorary degree, giving talks and interviews, attending dinners and the like, Hayek had about a twenty minute audience with Pinochet. Over the course of the next year Hayek wrote about his visit to Chile, once in a journal called Politische Studien, then in letters published in The Times of London, decrying the treatment of Chile by the western press. On the second trip he was hosted by a newly formed organization, Centro de Estudios Públicos (CEP), for which he agreed to serve as the Honorary President. While on the trip he met with the executive committee of CEP, saw his friends, gave the usual talks and interviews,Footnote 1 and also met with two former Chilean Presidents. The second trip was prior to a regional meeting of the Mont Pèlerin Society that took place in the coastal city of Viña del Mar, Chile in November 1981, a meeting that Hayek himself did not attend. In January 1982 he had another letter to the Editor published, this one in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), in which he criticized the editors for printing a cartoon that likened Pinochet to the Polish Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski. Though the reaction to Hayek’s trips, interviews and letters are insignificant compared to the outcry that Milton Friedman’s 1975 visit provoked,Footnote 2 they continue to be mentioned and criticized, both by opponents of his ideas, but also by those who otherwise count themselves as among his supporters. We have two goals in adding our voices to the discussion. The first is simply to clarify the record of what happened. We draw on archival materials, existing research, related articles and interviews published by Chilean newspapers (El Mercurio, La Tercera and La Segunda) and Chilean magazines (Que Pasa and Ercilla), and on interviews with principals who are still alive.Footnote 3 In addition to providing an account of his visits, we will identify some obvious mistakes or misleading statements that may be found in other accounts.Footnote 4 In other cases, where we simply disagree with certain claims that have been made, we will provide evidence in support of our views. Thus, in our opinion,Footnote 5 there is no available evidence for the assertion, made by Klein (2007, p. 103), Grandin (2006a; 2006b, p. 172), and Robin (2011, p. 74) that Hayek was involved in the decision to hold the 1981 regional meeting of the Mont Pèlerin Society in Viña del Mar. And contra Fischer (2009), we see little evidence that Hayek or his ideas had an impact on the writing or content of the new Chilean constitution that was enacted in 1980 and went into effect in 1981. Second, Hayek’s decision to go to Chile, the public statements he made during and after his trips, and perhaps most damningly, his failure to speak out against the human rights abuses that occurred under Pinochet’s seventeen year rule, also require explanation. For those who see Hayek as an intellectual godfather of neoliberalism, and who associate that doctrine not simply with the promotion of globalization but with more sinister activities (e.g., using state power to force the spreading of market regimes), there is little to explain: they naturally assume that Hayek would be a supporter of the Pinochet regime.Footnote 6 One sees this attitude expressed in passing comments in the blogosphere or press – for example, the claim that Hayek took Pinochet to be “an avatar of freedom” (Grandin 2006a), or references to Hayek’s “sunny view of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet” (Schuessler 2010).Footnote 7 Others try to establish links between Austrian thought and fascism.Footnote 8
 We find such speculations to be singularly unconvincing when it comes to explaining Hayek’s visits to Chile. But we are equally unconvinced by explanations by those putative supporters who argue that, by the time that Hayek went to Chile, he was an old man who was either losing his intellectual powers or growing cranky with age.Footnote 9 Certainly Hayek did dramatically increase the number of interviews he gave following the award of the Nobel Prize in 1974, so there were more opportunities for misstatements. But he also did important work through the early 1980s (e.g., he completed Law, Legislation and Liberty (1973–79) and wrote The Denationalization of Money [1978] 1999), so the charge that this was all due to mental deterioration seems to us if not false, at least problematical. Instead, we will offer an alternative to the arguments that Hayek was either a closet admirer of the Pinochet regime or was losing his mental faculties at the time of his visit. Regarding his public statements, we will show that many of the themes to be found during both trips drew on ideas that Hayek had developed over the course of his career. Regarding his decisions to visit Chile and to remain silent about the human rights abuses that occurred under Pinochet, though it is always difficult to establish a person’s motives, we think that these decisions had multiple causes. In the course of the paper we will show that Hayek’s first trip was set into motion by Manuel Ayau, a longtime Mont Pèlerin member and friend who had recently hosted Hayek in Guatemala; that Hayek was suspicious about the objectivity of news reports in the western press and was probably curious about what conditions in Chile were really like; that he was surprised about the level of economic development that he encountered on both of his visits (which deepened his suspicions about the press); that he was reacting not just to Chile but to the multiple pressures and concerns brought on by both the cold war and to what he perceived as the mistaken direction of the economics profession in the 1970s; and that he was hoping that there might be a transition back to a limited democracy, not just in Chile, but in other countries which combined an authoritarian and military political regime with a liberal economic system. The next section will give a necessary background account of the political and economic situation in Chile prior to his visits. Section 3 will offer a reconstruction of Hayek’s mindset prior to his first trip to Chile. After setting the context, section 4 will discuss the details of the November 1977 visit, the trip on which he met with Pinochet. In section 5, we deal with his initial forays in the western press, and in section 6 with claims about Hayek organizing the Viña del Mar meeting of the Mont Pèlerin Society and his influence on the Chilean constitution. Hayek’s April 1981 visit to Chile as Honorary President of Centro de Estudios Públicos (CEP) will be covered in section 7, and section 8 will analyze the two controversial and important interviews Hayek gave to El Mercurio in 1981. Section 9 will recapitulate the multiple reasons behind Hayek’s visits, and section 10 will conclude.",52

Coyne,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"What is the appropriate theory of the state when considering issues of government finance and expenditure? In exploring the answer to this question, James Buchanan (1949) distinguished between two potential foundations for the theory of public finance. He termed these the “organismic view” and the “individualistic view” of public finance. The organismic view, according to Buchannan, treats the state as a single entity which acts as a “fiscal brain” to select the values of key variables to maximize social welfare. From this perspective public finance is a purely allocative exercise, as the fiscal brain effortlessly allots resources to maximize the value of each variable in the social welfare function. The individualistic view, in contrast, focuses on the individual chooser as the unit of interest and analyzes how individuals interact given the incentives and constraints generated in various political contexts. From this perspective public finance outcomes are emergent and cannot be assumed to maximize some notion of social welfare, since the state has no ends outside of those held by its constituent members. Buchanan’s overarching point was that in order to have a theory of public finance, one first had to have a theory of the state. My core argument is that this insight is relevant today to economic treatments of defense where it is often assumed that a benevolent “defense brain” provides the optimal quantity and quality of defense to maximize a nation’s welfare. Defense economics emerged as a distinct field of study in the 1960s and has evolved over time to reflect changing global issues (see Sandler and Hartley 1995: 1–16, Hartley and Sandler 1995: 1–11, Hartley 2007a; Coyne and Mathers 2011 for an overview of the field). Early work focused on economic models of: defense and national security (Hitch and McKean 1960), arms races (Richardson 1960; Schelling 1966), conflict (Boulding 1962), alliances (Olson and Zeckhauser 1966), military contracting and procurement (Peck and Scherer 1962), military personnel (Hansen and Weisbrod 1967; Oi 1967), and revolutions (Tullock 1971). Since then the topics falling under the purview of defense economics have expanded greatly and now include not only the aforementioned subjects, but also disarmament (Hartley et al. 1993; Fontanel 1995), the arms trade (Anderton 1995; Brauer 2007; Hartley 2007b; Kinsella 2011; Brauer and Dunne 2011; Coyne and Hall 2014a), arms proliferation (Brito and Intriligator 1995), military expenditures and growth (Ram 1995), the defense industrial base (Dunne 1995; Duncan and Coyne 2013a, b), sanctions (Kaempfer and Lowenberg 2007; Cortright and Lopez 2011), terrorism (Enders and Sandler 1995; Anderton and Carter 2005; Sandler and Arce 2007; Shughart 2011), civil war (Collier and Hoeffler 2007; Balttman and Miguel 2010; Fiala and Skaperdas 2011), insurrections (Grossman 1995), and a variety of other types of conflict (see Brauer and Gissy 1997; Hartley and Sandler 2003). To date, what Buchanan termed the organismic view has dominated the analysis of expenditures on, and provision of, state-provided defense. For example, in his overview of the economics of military expenditures, Smith (1995: 71) writes that “[t]he standard neo-classical model of the demand for military expenditures assumes that there is a national state that maximizes welfare…” which includes, among other variables, security. Dunne (1995: 409) notes that “the neoclassical approach to military expenditure…is based on the notion of a state with a well defined social welfare function, reflecting some form of social democratic consensus, recognizing some well defined national interest, and threatened by some real or apparent potential enemy.” Finally, in a stocktaking of the economics of defense, Fisher and Brauer (2003: 225) indicate that “…researchers model military expenditure as a variable that enters a security function which, in turn, enters a social welfare function.” In contrast, the individualistic view has been more prevalent in the treatment of such topics as revolution, terrorism, coups, and non-state actors. Unlike the expenditure and provision side of defense, these topics are typically modeled and analyzed in terms of individual choice subject to a variety of context-specific constraints. The dominance of the organismic framework has resulted in the modeling of defense as a pure public good provided by a benevolent and all-knowing defense brain in optimal quantities and qualities. This assumption is conducive to modeling the state provision of defense. It is also utterly delusional when one looks at how the actual world operates. By assuming that a benevolent and omniscient state will provide the optimal quantity and quality of defense, the organismic view downplays, or altogether neglects, the possibility that scarce resources can be wasted, manipulated by special interests for their own narrow benefit, and used to impose real harms (or “bads”) on innocent people both domestically and internationally. Given these delusions, I argue that the defense brain needs a lobotomy. A lobotomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which the nerve fibers in the frontal lobe of the brain are severed to “form new patterns and rid a patient of delusions, obsessions, nervous tensions and the like” (Kaempffert 1941: 18). Lobotomizing the defense brain provides the opportunity to recast the economics of defense from the perspective of the individualistic view which focuses on key decision makers and the context-specific rules under which they choose. Specifically, emphasis is placed on comparative institutional analysis to understand how different contexts influence the epistemic and incentive aspects of defense-related decision making.Footnote 1 My core point should be elementary and uncontroversial to economists: as teachers and researchers economists should apply the analytical apparatus of their discipline to the actual institutions and settings in which defense expenditures and provision take place. However, this seemingly elementary point needs constant repeating because, as Brennan and Buchanan (1985) note, many economists are “locked into the presumption that political authority is vested in a group of moral superpersons, whose behavior might be described by an appropriately constrained social welfare function” (xviii). This is the case with economic treatments of defense. In what follows, I critically consider five assumptions associated with the organismic view: (1) the assumption that defense and security is a pure public good that must be provided by a national government (Section 2), (2) the assumption that that state-provided defense is always a “good” and never a “bad” (Section 3), (3) the assumption that the state can provide defense in the optimal quantity and quality (Section 4), (4) the assumption that state expenditures on defense are neutral with respect to private economic activity (Section 5), and (5) the assumption that state-provided defense activities are neutral with respect to domestic political institutions (Section 6). Throughout I emphasize that the individualistic view provides a superior, alternative framework for understanding these issues and, hence, reality.",34

Luther,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ludwig von Mises employed a unique equilibrium construct known as the evenly rotating economy. In contrast to Walrasian formulations, exchange in the evenly rotating economy is decentralized. Although Mises is not entirely clear about the exchange environment, bilateral matching and turnpike-style trading seem plausible.Footnote 4 Technology and preferences are given and fixed in the evenly rotating economy; there is no change in data. As such, the future is certain and agents need not worry about resource supply shocks, technology shocks, preference shocks, or other disturbing forces. In this environment, and with all information, agents select equilibrium strategies that indicate how much they will produce, save, and consume each period. The result is an equilibrium path of economic interactions through time. Mises explicitly addresses the prospect of monetary exchange in the evenly rotating economy. “[T]he very notion of money,” Mises (1949, p. 417) concludes, “vanishes into an unsubstantial calculation process, self-contradictory and devoid of any meaning.” His logic is straightforward. If agents are operating in a continuous loop, repeating the same transactions again and again, each agent knows with whom along the equilibrium path they will trade goods for money and with whom they will trade money for goods. Carrying goods along the equilibrium path is desirable since agents along that path want to consume those goods. But no one consumes money; it is passed back and forth between agents with no obvious benefit. One could just as easily load and unload goods where equilibrium dictates without bothering to carry cash. Mises (1949, p. 249) claims bookkeeping would suffice. Indeed, one could take the argument a step further. With unlimited cognitive capacity, as Mises implicitly assumes, agents can mentally note their transactions. As a result, physical bookkeeping is no longer necessary and the exchange equilibrium comes to rely exclusively on gift exchange. Except in the case of extraordinarily high discount rates, where individuals might be inclined to cheat, the threat of trigger strategies sustains the equilibrium. The evenly rotating economy is effectively reduced to a pure barter equilibrium by the prospect of gifting goods to one another along the equilibrium path. Mises believed the inessentiality of money in equilibrium to be a tenuous result. The driving assumptions—namely, that fundamental values are known and constant—would almost certainly never be obtained. The hypothetical world of the evenly rotating economy merely allows one to elucidate, a contrario, the effects of change in a world of uncertainty. “In reality,” Mises (1949, p. 247) writes, “there is never such a thing as an evenly rotating economic system.” The underlying data are constantly in flux. Hence, money continues to serve a purpose in real world economies. Although Mises correctly recognizes a valuable role for money if one lives in a world of change and uncertainty, he incorrectly claims the inversion of the proposition is true. “It is impossible to assign any function to indirect exchange, media of exchange, and money,” Mises (1949, p. 417) argues, “within an imaginary construction the characteristic mark of which is unchangeability and rigidity of conditions.” Even if Mises is right in noting that uncertainty and change provide a role for money, it does not follow that, absent uncertainty and change, their can be no role for money. In contrast, the modern literature suggests a meaningful role for money might remain if certain frictions are introduced.",13
29.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,03 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-015-0315-y,The robust political economy of central banking and free banking,March 2016,Pablo Paniagua,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economists have been highly concerned with the role of central banks in generating disturbances to relative prices, the general price level, and nominal income. But most, despite being concerned with cyclical fluctuations, have dismissed the necessity of evaluating our existing arrangements’ robustness. Hence a broader, post-crisis reassessment of our monetary framework has been lacking. I am concerned with understanding how different monetary frameworks can sidestep incentives problems and epistemic limitations and allow us to avoid monetary mischief. To that end, this paper contributes to developing a broader framework of institutional comparison, drawing elements both from monetary theory as well as political economy. Such a framework could be used to evaluate alternative monetary regimes such as NGDP targeting (Sumner 2012; Salter 2014b). This would enrich our understanding about which monetary rules might dominate others and allow us promote sound reforms accordingly. Although economists have been interested in how to minimize systematic discoordination from policies, they do not address institutional alternatives, but rather seek technical optimality policies that take the existent framework as given (Mishkin 2011; Taylor 2009, 2012; Woodford 2003). Institutional concerns have arisen recently (Calomiris 2013; Calomiris and Haber, 2014; Salter 2014b) among those who recognize that central banks have contributed to the Great Recession and the meager recovery thereafter (Beckworth 2012; Hetzel 2012; Sumner 2012; Taylor 2012; White 2012). Despite the literature that acknowledges the role of central banks in the financial crisis, most economists have dismissed the necessity of evaluating existing arrangements’ robustness (Boettke and Smith 2012; Buchanan 2010). Moreover, economists not only have been supporters of the current, hypothetically optimal monetary framework as it is but have argued for further enhancements on central bankers’ discretionary powers (Caruana 2011; Goodhart 2010; Blanchard et al. 2010). These economists have been more concerned in analyzing the technical role that monetary policy played during and after the crisis (Bernanke 2010; Blanchard et al. 2010; Mishkin 2011) than on reassessing the institutional resilience of central banking. On the other hand, economists such as Buchanan, Friedman and Hayek have recognized the possible inherent fragilities of existent monetary frameworks. They have addressed the technicalities of monetary policy with broader political economy concerns (Boettke and Smith 2012). These three Nobel Prize winners were pioneers in promoting different institutional solutions to deal with the problem of the “right supply of money.” They saw monetary problems not in specific technical plans of action, like the Taylor rule (Taylor 2009). Their proposals were instead in the more general framework of institutional and constitutional reforms of the rules of the ‘monetary policy game’ (Boettke and Smith 2012; Brennan and Buchanan 2000 [1985]; Buchanan 1983a, 2010; Salter 2014b). Friedman, for one, looked for monetary rules-based constraints on central banks’ discretion, particularly through limiting the growth of the monetary base (Friedman 1994). Buchanan thought an explicit constitutional limitation over the Fed’s power and capacity of issuing money was more robust (Buchanan 1999 [1962], 2010). And, by the end of his academic career, Hayek had proposed the denationalization of issuing money (Hayek 1990 [1976c]). Driven by these economists’ insights, recent contributions have captured the essence of the political economy research program applied to institutional considerations of money and banking. Salter (2013) applies the framework of robust political economy (Leeson and Subrick 2006; Pennington 2011) to study which lender of last resort arrangement might dominate others in a world in which realistic incentives and information imperfections are present. Similarly, Salter (2014b) evaluates monetary policy rule’s degrees of robustness linked to their enforceability. Bédard (2014) studies large US financial institutions’ insolvency procedures to see whether liquidation systems or bailouts of large financial institutions are more robust to deal with asymmetries of information, moral hazard and misalignment of incentives. This paper aims to enrich this emerging literature by providing a useful framework for thinking about monetary policy provided through alternative institutions. In addition, modern political economy literature exists outside the Robust Political Economy framework. This literature addresses the institutional and political dynamics of economic crises and monetary and banking instabilities. Calomiris and Stephen (2014)Footnote 1 suggest that crises are recurrent on banking frameworks characterized with fragile monetary and banking rules. Those fragilities emerge from the complex political bargains among politicians and interest groups (Calomiris and Stephen 2014, chapters 1 and 2). Robust banking frameworks, they argue, possess checks and balances on how policy makers and regulators are influenced by coalitions and interest groups that might degrade the rules of the banking-and-credit game. Despite these research programs, a broader post-crisis reassessment of existent monetary frameworks has been absent. This should come as a surprise to anyone who knows monetary history and historical monetary reforms (Rockoff 2015). In Section 2 we review the robust political economy framework and how it could be a tool for institutional analysis to evaluate alternative monetary frameworks. Section 3 proposes the ideal benchmark of monetary equilibrium on which comparative monetary institutional analysis could be based. Section 4 analyzes the incentives problems concerning political pressure and incentive compatibility that might affect central banking and free banking. Section 5 reevaluates the assumptions concerning decision makers’ epistemic resources within these institutional settings and how their limitations could be circumvented. Section 6 concludes.",12
29.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,30 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-014-0281-9,Money without a State: Currencies of the Orthodox Christians in the Balkan Provinces of the Ottoman Empire (17th –19th centuries),March 2016,Nikolay Nenovsky,Pencho Penchev,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The paper presents a historical and theoretical analysis of issue of local currency uncontrolled by the central power (coins and paper money), undertaken in various forms by the Orthodox Christians in the Balkan Provinces of the Ottoman Empire.Footnote 1
 The paper has two main goals. The first is to enrich the discussion on the diversity and complexity of monetary practices in historical perspective by including experience of the Ottoman Empire. The second is to contribute to a better understanding and rethinking of the economic and social processes in the Ottoman Empire which helped its centuries-long resilience and vitality. In fact, the monetary architecture of the Ottoman Empire was relatively complex. Despite the tension between its different monetary areas and layers, on the whole it managed to ensure flexibility, sustainability, and efficiency in the long-run. The currencies of the Orthodox Christians definitely were not the most significant part of the Ottoman monetary system, and for that reason they should not be overestimated. However, on a micro level they were important for the social and economic life of certain small communities and for that reason they should not be missed in the analysis of the monetary architecture of the Ottoman Empire. A study of the monetary and financial practices of the Orthodox population within the Ottoman Empire goes beyond the purely historical aspect. It gives valuable ideas about the development of monetary theory itself, of the genesis and functions of money, their social, ethnical, religious, and cultural dimension. The topicality of such studies can again be sought in two directions. First, nowadays, with the growing role of the civil society and the mass spread of advanced information technologies, money creation and monetary practices are becoming ever more decentralized. The monetary architecture became increasingly complex. Second, the crisis of the euro area, of Europe’s common monetary project, raises the pressing issue of looking for new EU monetary strategies and monetary organisation, which are beyond the unification and strict centralization (see for example Theret and Kalinowski 2012 among many others). The authors of these projects could definitely draw valuable experience from the monetary history of the Ottoman Empire which, due to its multinational and varied institutional nature, to a certain degree is reminiscent of today’s Europe.Footnote 2
 A logical consequence of the above two goals are the two groups of publications which our analysis builds on. The first group of studies is linked to the publications on monetary diversity, local, communal and complementary currencies in a historical perspective (mostly on Italy, France, Japan and China; see Fantacci 2005a, b; Blanc 2009; Kuroda 2005, 2009) or in a direction to theoretical rationalisation of this diversity (see Fantacci 2005a; Blanc 2006, 2009, 2011; Kuroda 2008; Greco 2009). The second group of studies, supportive of our own research, relates to literature on the monetary and economic history of the Ottoman Empire, in particular Sevket Pamuk’s publications (Pamuk 2000, 2004). Within his institutional and evolutionary approach, Pamuk has come to a conclusion that the existing “pragmatism, flexibility, and negotiation enabled the central bureaucracy to cо-opt and incorporate into state the social groups that rebelled against it” and that “the Ottomans were flexible and pragmatic from the start” (Pamuk 2004, 228). And more specifically: “Examples from Ottoman monetary practices confirm the Ottoman tendency to rely on markets and local practices in most economic matters” (Pamuk 2004, 238). Such observations about the diversity of monetary networks and practices, the incorrect impression of existing monetary chaos, as well as the pragmatism of the Ottoman power, particularly after the adoption of the bi-metal standard in 1844, are given in Ali Tunçer’s study (Tunçer 2013).Footnote 3 Within a wider sociological context, the Bulgarian historian Nikolay Genchev, too, shares the belief that regardless of the tension between centre and provinces, the Ottoman Empire set a good example of pragmatism and flexibility in establishing its administrative and economic institutions (Genchev 2010 [1986], Genchev 2011 [1988]). The currencies of the Orthodox Balkan Christians were “money without a state” and hence the information about their history is not available in the official archives and documents. However, the paper is based on all the available primary and secondary sources. Among the primary sources the most important are: coins and notes preserved in the regional historical museums of Gabrovo, Shumen, Razgrad etc., the church board chronicle of Turgoviste, the memoirs and recollections of contemporaries like Illiya Bluskov, Dimitar Marinov, Toma Nikolov. The local church histories and histories of certain regions and towns which were written at the end of 19th and the beginning of 20th century to some extent could be treated as primary sources, because they are based on the recollections of eyewitnesses. Among the secondary sources the most important are the papers of Bulgarian numismatists and archaeologists like Hristo Haritonov, Mitko Lachev, Vassil Haralanov etc. All these sources are a good point of departure in order to present and analyse certain characteristics of the “invisible” history of the civil society on the Balkans. Contributions in this paper can be sought in the following directions. First, we expand the scope of historical experience in presenting monetary practices of the Orthodox Christians within the Ottoman Empire. Second, building on these historical facts, we propose different theoretical reflexions about the social meaning of money, complexity and hierarchy of monetary order, functions of money, etc. Despite a number of common points with the model of free banking when banks issue money, the money supply in our case is socially and culturally driven, it is the fruit of civil and religious societies, the manifestation of their organizational and monetary independence from the state. The paper is organised as follows: the first part gives a brief chronology of the historically known and recorded currency issue attempts by the Orthodox Christians within the Balkan Provinces (mostly Bulgarian) of the Ottoman Empire the 17th century to the end of 19th century. The second part includes a theoretical interpretation of the currency issue mechanisms and a number of directions for a possible theoretical interpretation of the above mentioned monetary practices.",5

Examples of the evolutionary process at work are generally exclusive to circumstances of extreme duress (Radford 1945) and/or state failure (Selgin 2008). The increase in popularity over the last 15 years in online communities and games provides a fruitful, if simplified, environment for observing in real time what forces drive the emergence of money. We discuss the online community in the game Diablo IIFootnote 1 and argue it provides an excellent example of the money emergence process. Our analysis speaks to the debate within monetary economics as to the relative importance of exchange and epistemic frictions (discussed further below) in determining whether a commodity can and will emerge as money. The transition towards increasing use and sophistication of monetary units is documented here by the interactions between members of a website forum dedicated to facilitating trades within Diablo II during the period 2004–2008. The environment which we examine is admittedly a simplification of reality, but the agents operating in this environment are purposeful human actors; as such, we believe the insights gained from examining this virtual economy illustrate the operation of universal economic phenomena. The environment combines the knowledge of underlying parameters typically achievable only in laboratory experiment with the possibility of observing complex interaction of induced parameters typically achievable only by examining historical case studies. In addition, the case we present offers a rare opportunity to capture the emergent process almost in its entirety. In the real world, the Mengerian process can take thousands of years, depending on exactly where and when one decides money has “fully” emerged. In our account, economizing action on the part of goal-oriented individuals leads to a mature commodity-money system in just a few years. This offers an exciting opportunity for the examination of anthropologic-economic phenomena as yet unexplored. We are not the first to examine economic phenomena using online games. Castronova (2006) explores the use of other large-scale multiplayer game communities as tests of macro-level coordination effects. In the formation of currency, we see Diablo’s online community as a similar natural experiment of this particular large-scale coordination problem. The size of the video game industry and the increasing prevalence of virtual goods commanding real moneyFootnote 2 have led to those aspects of virtual worlds to have increasing relevance among economists.Footnote 3 In our opinion, this emphasis has left the value of understanding the economics internal to these game environments has been somewhat overlooked, serving as a useful complement to our understanding of how these games interact with the “real world” economy. We will proceed as follows: Section 2 presents the existing literature on currency formation. Section 3 presents an overview of Diablo II’s exchange environment. Section 4 documents the available records on currency formation using the archives of an online message board dedicated to facilitating in-game exchange. Section 5 concludes.",5

Giménez Roche,Jason Lermyte,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The 2008 subprime crisis revealed the role of the securitization technique in the bank system. It was a tool for both the Basel capital-adequacy rules arbitrage and the monetizing of the government-sponsored safety net provided to commercial banks. Securitization would incite banks to assume riskier and larger positions than they would otherwise do in its absence (Ambrose, et al. 2005; Caprio, et al. 2010; Jablecki and Machaj 2009). Banks create credit out of demand deposits. These demand deposits are thus unbacked by liquidity reserves and are the counterparty to fiduciary credit (Mises 1980, p. 133). This implies a growing divergence between real credit, backed by voluntary savings, and fiduciary credit. This divergence misleads producers, who fall into the illusion of financial capital abundance (Giménez Roche 2015). They undertake more projects than is actually possible with the real availability of saved resources. Malinvestments accumulate until the boom busts into crisis and recession. The question here is whether securitization amplifies business cycles or not. Securitization should be understood here as the transfer of a bank’s credit assets to a subsidiary legal entity. This entity then uses those assets as collateral for the issuance of new securities, which are then sold to the public—hence “originate-to-distribute.” Banks originate loans in order to securitize and distribute them into derivative instruments. The public invest in those instruments by converting their deposits into savings. This results in a liquidity transfer to banks, thus allowing for further fiduciary credit expansion. Nevertheless, central bank liquidities being given, liquidity gains by one bank imply liquidity drains by other banks. All in all, the bank sector cannot expand more than what has been securitized. Notwithstanding this, empirical studies (Acharya, et al. 2013; Dell'Ariccia, et al. 2012; Friedman and Kraus 2011) clearly show that the boom preceding the 2008 crisis was characterized by the use of securitization in regulatory arbitrage. This enabled banks to increase the volume of risky assets (on- or off-balance sheet) and substitute low-risk assets for high-risk ones. In fact, regulatory arbitrage, via securitization, enabled the creation of more fiduciary credit than what had been previously securitized by banks. This apparent accounting illusion is what leads Gertchev (2009) to conclude that securitization per se results in cyclical amplification. Nevertheless, this is a hasty conclusion. Securitization amplifies the cycle if coupled with regulatory arbitrage. This occurs because regulatory arbitrage is the exploitation of loopholes and “the manipulation of the structure of a deal to take advantage of a gap between the economic substance of a transaction and its regulatory treatment” (Fleischer 2010, p. 230). Regulatory arbitrage exploits the fact that credit derivatives have a better regulatory treatment than the securitized credit underlying them. This incites banks to originate loans but to retain—instead of distributing—them in a new form, that is, they “originate-and-pretend-to-distribute” (Goodhart 2008, p. 356). The main contribution of this paper is to shed light on the mechanism of securitization and regulatory arbitrage, and how it can be better understood in the ABCT framework. Its main point is that securitization can amplify business cycles considerably only under the specific circumstances of regulatory arbitrage. We proceed to demonstrate this in two parts. In the first part, securitization in its “originate-to-distribute” form is analyzed through two subsequent stages. In stage 1, securitization sterilizes previously created fiduciary credit. Indeed, by channeling savings into securitized bank credit, it transforms fiduciary into real credit. This process liberates financial resources for banks. In stage 2, those resources are used to recreate the previous level of fiduciary credit. In the second part, regulatory arbitrage changes the nature of securitization from an “originate-to-distribute” to an “originate-and-pretend-to-distribute” form. In this case, an amplification effect emerges because securitization liberates more equity capital than in the previous situation.",1
29.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,31 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-015-0300-5,Hayek’s monetary theory and policy: A note on alleged inconsistency,March 2016,Martin Komrska,Marek Hudík,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The dominant interpretation of Hayek’s monetary policy views was most comprehensively formulated in an influential article by White (1999). According to White, Hayek “abandoned constancy of the money streamFootnote 2 as a norm, and embraced consumer price-level stabilization as the most desirable monetary norm.” (White 1999:116, 118). Denoting the earlier Hayek of the 1920s and 1930s as “Hayek I” and the later Hayek of the 1970s as “Hayek II”,Footnote 3 we split White’s views into the following three claims: According to Hayek I, the money stream should be kept constant.Footnote 4
 According to Hayek I, price level stabilization is not desirable.Footnote 5
 According to Hayek II, the price level should be kept stable. First of all, observe that, contrary to what seems to be White’s view,Footnote 6 none of the claims (1a)–(1c) per se imply a repudiation of ABCT. The reason is that the validity of ABCT is a matter of positive analysis, whereas statements (1a)–(1c) concern issues partly or completely outside the scope of positive inquiry: they are either normative or policy statements. Even if claims (1a)–(1c) were correct representations of Hayek’s views (in our view, they are not), it would be possible that Hayek II continued to stick to ABCT: If he changed his views about what policy goals were desirable, or, alternatively, if he took these goals as exogenous and only provided instruments for their achievement – as these goals changed, Hayek would have changed his recommendations while remaining faithful to ABCT. We argue that the latter is indeed the case. Our claims are as follows: According to Hayek I, elimination of the business cycle requires that the money stream be kept constant. He does not see the elimination of the business cycle as necessarily desirable because, as he acknowledges, it also involves costs. According to Hayek I, price level stabilization does not lead to the elimination of the business cycle, but it is not necessarily undesirable, since it also involves benefits. According to Hayek II, a stable price level is a possible goal of monetary policy (even though it could cause the creation of a business cycle). Trade-offs faced by monetary authorities should be resolved by the market rather than by these authorities. In the next section we provide support for our claims and argue that Hayek did not significantly modified his monetary views but rather focused on different issues in different periods of his career. While Hayek I was concerned with abstract conditions leading to “neutral” monetary policy regime, Hayek II aimed at much more practical issue, namely how to cut inflation. In addition, we argue that Hayek thought about the above mentioned goals as exogenous and he largely refrained from imposing his own value judgments about what goals people should strive for.",4

The theme is fascinating: why is a tradition of economics which originates in the Habsburg Empire among a group of upper class intellectuals - most of them noblemen, many of them government officials – of such inspiration to economists working in the America of the 1980’s. And how does it come to inspire a libertarianism which is frequently associated with Austrian economics? A question that is largely neglected in Vaughn’s book is how the gap between the widely different contexts is bridged, and to what extent this has meant the transformation of that very tradition. This latter question has recently been the subject of quite some controversy, with a variety of authors seeking to discredit the Austrians by emphasizing the cultural distance between us and them. For is it not dangerous to inherit a tradition which emerged in a widely different context? In his recent plea for social-democracy ‘Ill Fares the Land’ distinguished historian Tony Judt argues that: We are the involuntary heirs to a debate with which most people are altogether unfamiliar. If we ask who exercised the greatest influence over contemporary Anglophone economic thought, we shall find that the greatest influence was exercised by a handful of foreigners, all of them immigrants from central Europe: Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Joseph Schumpeter, Karl Popper, and Peter Drucker. (Judt 2010: 97–8) Judt here uses the term “economic thought” but it becomes clear that he sees that influence as much broader from philosophy of science, to political philosophy and from economics to management studies. Judt believes that “the Austrian experience has been elevated to the status of economic theory [and has] come to inform not just the Chicago school of economics but all significant public conversation over policy choices in the contemporary United States” (Homans 2012). He feels that the influence of this Austrian tradition has unjustly reduced debates about social policy to a dichotomy between individual freedom and central state planning. This dichotomy, he argues, has over time killed all serious attempts at a social-democratic or ‘third-way’ alternative in the United States. But what is especially interesting in his argument is the distance he attempts to create between the ‘Austrian experience’ and us here and now. We are ‘involuntary heirs’ of the ideas of a ‘handful of foreigners’ and ‘immigrants’, whose particular ‘Austrian experience’ has been elevated to a kind of universal lesson - needless to say wrongfully so. In another instance Corey Robin argues that Hayek and other contributors to the Austrian tradition were children of Nietzsche, and at least suggest that this should make us think twice about our adoption of their ideas. Although he never goes quite as far as claiming a direct influence of Nietzsche on the Austrian traditionFootnote 1 he does argue that they share a subjective view of value and a strong elitism (Robin 2013a). What is even more interesting for the purposes of this paper is that Robin claims to be directly inspired by Schorske (1980), arguably the best piece of cultural history written about Vienna. Thus it seems that the context of Austrian economics is not just of ‘antiquarian interest’, but that it has consequences for our current understanding of their legacy, and their relevance (or lack thereof) to contemporary debates. It indeed pays off to study the context in which Austrian economics has emerged: to study the intellectual currents in Vienna, to understand the type of debates the Austrians were engaged in and to analyze the social and political context of fin-de-siècle and interwar Vienna. We are, as Robin points out, at a great advantage because a great many studies of this time and place exist: the aforementioned study by Schorske, detailed studies by Johnston (1972), Janik and Toulmin (1973) as well as the more recent two volume biography of Karl Kraus which doubles as cultural history of the time (Timms 1986; 2005). In this paper we will explore this context and its relevance for understanding the tradition of Austrian economists. In the course of the analysis we will discover that Judt’s emphasis on the uniqueness of the Austrian experience and Robin’s emphasis on the affinities with Nietzsche are only parts of the context, and not the most relevant parts. The paper will first give a short overview of the political and social context of Vienna and the Habsburg Empire and later Austria and its culture of conversations, which especially thrived in the interwar period. In sections two and three I will explore how the Austrian economists dealt with the theme of decline in their work (the sense of decline and the appropriate response to it was perhaps the central intellectual problem in the first decades of twentieth century Vienna). In section four I will then show how this has had consequences for how the Austrian economists conceptualized markets and freedom which they began to consider great cultural acquirements in need of protection.",10

Ceteris paribus, democratic constitutions tend to produce better environmental policies than non-democratic ones (Midlarsky, 1998). This finding is consistent with the research showing that inclusive political systems outperform autocracies and other non-inclusive systems by a wide variety of metrics (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012; Easterly, 2014). Although the differences are less pronounced, centralized democratic regimes generate different environmental policies than federal democracies (Waelti 2004; Fredriksson and Wollscheid, 2007). This research has helped to frame my research into fisheries policy in the years surrounding the creation of the Canadian federal constitution in 1867.Footnote 1
 This paper will focus on the ambitious plan for regulation embodied in the Dominion Fisheries Act of 1868, a law passed by the Canadian federal parliament in its very first year of existence. In contrast to the United States, where fisheries regulation then occurred primarily at the state level, section 91 of the Canadian constitution of 1867 gave the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over all “sea coast and inland fisheries.”Footnote 2 The 1868 law was intended to bring the nation’s fisheries firmly under the control of officials employed by the new federal government. The thesis of this paper is that the 1868 law was a product of the hubris identified by Hayek as “the fatal conceit.” The law entrusted the regulation of fisheries across the northern half of the North American continent to a bureaucracy controlled by a Minister and Deputy Minister sitting in offices in Ottawa. The population living in the territories subject to this bureaucracy numbered in the millions. Moreover, the territories that comprised the Canadian federation were culturally and ecologically diverse. The 1868 law was intended to address what today would be called a Tragedy of the Commons (Hardin, 1968). The centralized and bureaucratic approach to governing fisheries represented by the 1868 Fisheries Act and equivalent laws in other countries is only one of several ways of managing access to common-pool resources (CPRs). The other available mechanisms include: a system of absolutely pure laissez-faire in which the coercive power of the sovereign is never used to deal with conflicts between resource-users (Banzhaf, 2013); customary restrictions of the type used in many tribal societies (Larmour, 2013); common-law remedies (Hodas, 1988; Meiners and Yandle, 1998); regulation by clubs, leaseholders’ associations, or other voluntary bodies (Bate et al., 2000); regulation by municipal governments or other polities with only hundreds or thousands of inhabitants; regulation by intermediate level governments with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants; regulation by national governments with millions of inhabitants (Anderson and Watson, 2011). This paper will suggest that some mixture of these other approaches to dealing with the problem of the commons would have been superior to the highly centralized governance mode embodied in the Dominion Fisheries Act. The methodology adopted in this case study is based on the study of a range of printed primary sources, including transcripts of parliamentary debates, reports of official inquiries, documents created by the Colonial Office in London, and the Annual Report of the Department of Marine and Fisheries. These primary sources have been viewed through the theoretical lenses discussed below. I have adopted a single-case rather than a multiple-case approach because the single-case approach allows for the extended and detailed study of how theory relates to a critical or revelatory case (Yin 2009, 48). The case study presented in this paper is also intrinsically important as the territory covered by the Canadian Fisheries Act of 1868 eventually included much of the North American continent. Moreover, this law was representative of broader trends, as rulers around the world replaced customary systems for governing CPRs with bureaucratic state management in the second half of the nineteenth century. Thismove towards the bureaucratization of CPRs was particularly pronounced in British colonies (Sivaramakrishnan, 1999; Beinart and Hughes, 2007, 200–213, 269–288), although this bureaucratic approach soon spread from the British Empire to other countries, including the United States during the Progressive Era (Barton, 2002, 143, 163). The Canadian case study presented in this paper is thus representative of a global trend towards the bureaucratization of CPRs.",1

Hayek and Vernon Smith on the Misesian Action Axiom",June 2016,Nathaniel Paxson,Nikolai G. Wenzel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"With the introduction of mathematical modeling in the 19th century and its subsequent hegemony, economics as a discipline has largely become a de facto branch of applied mathematics. Working in the face of this general trend, heterodox economists who endeavor to explain the complexity of human action have splintered in many directions. Recognizing the oversimplifying assumptions of equilibrium modeling, constrained optimization rational choice modeling, and econometric correlation modeling, non-mainstream economists have been assiduously trying to understand human action through other lenses of social science. The formation of inter-disciplinary associations with anthropologists, biologists, psychologists, physicists, neuroscientists, legal scholars, political scientists, historians, and even entrepreneurs has become increasingly common for professional economists as they search for tractable economic explanations of the world. Recognizing the importance of interdisciplinary research programs, F.A. Hayek wrote that ”an economist who is only an economist cannot be a good economist” (in Smith 2008, 510). Ludwig von Mises, a standard bearer of heterodoxy, viewed economics formally as part of praxeology, a deductive axiomatic methodology which begins with the action axiom, is validated by subjective introspection, and is practiced using logic and rational argumentation from first principles. Praxeology establishes a clear demarcation line between psychology (reasons for choosing ends) and economics (analysis of choosing means given ends). The Misesian action axiom postulates that human action is purposeful, but does not look to underlying reasons. But is this sufficient? We argue that the action axiom is a very useful heuristic for understanding individual choice, but that – alone – it is insufficient, and can be complemented by a deeper understanding of the underlying process of choice. Section 2 discusses the action axiom, starting with Mises’s definition, and continuing with the argument that the axiom is a superb starting point for analysis of choice – but only a starting point, in light of problems with limited reason and contextually embedded reason. Section 3 offers a primer on Hayek’s theory of the sensory order, towards a reading of Mises enriched by cognitive psychology. Section 4 presents Vernon Smith’s ecological rationality and neurological “hard-wiring” as a continuation of the Misesian research project. The final section concludes.",2
29.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,25 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-014-0280-x,The epistemic claim to the life-world: Alfred Schutz and the debates of the austrian school of economics,June 2016,Daniela Griselda López,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The aim of this article is to make a contribution to the reflection on the “interpretive turn” (Boettke 1990, 1998; Ebeling 1985, 1986, 1990; Lavoie 1990a, b, 1994; Storr 2010a, b) within Austrian economics going back to Alfred Schutz’s notion of life-world sketched out in his first book The Phenomenology of the Social World (Schutz 1967/1932)Footnote 1 (hereinafter PSW). In the context of the discussions on how hermeneutics can enrich economicsFootnote 2 the problem of objectivism in the production of knowledge is emphasized -what the specialists have called the “danger of objectivism”, i.e. the danger of substitution of social reality upheld by social scientists. It is contended that this objectivism “over-dichotomizes theory from history, and scientific from everyday understanding.” (Lavoie 1994: 57–58) as a consequence of the purpose of social sciences establishing themselves as “objective science of subjective phenomena”. As Lavoie states when referring to “praxeology as an objective science of subjective phenomena”: “Both sides of this formula” (…) “are misleading, and taken together they are dangerous” (Lavoie 1994: 59). “Science, whether social or natural, is not objective in the sense of being a historical and perspectiveless, nor is the subject matter of human sciences subjective in the sense of being arbitrary” (ibid). Although there is consensus on Schutz belonging to the Austrian School of Economics and the importance of Schutz in economic analysis, Lavoie does not find in his work particularly enlightening insight into this dichotomy and Schutz is placed under the title “objectivistic Austrianism”, thus positioning Hans-Georg Gadamer as the key to portray a superior “Hermeneutical Austrianism” (ibid.: 61). From this standpoint, Schutz’s phenomenology would be a clear victim of the danger of objectivism present across the Austrian tradition. Such danger constitutes for Boettke, Lavoie and Storr (2001) a “problem with economics as an academic discipline” in which “instead of trying to understand the problems of everyday economic life, economists have largely satisfied themselves with playing logical games and solving imaginary puzzles” (Boettke et al. 2001). The authors clearly acknowledge “the loss of the world” implied in this scientific attitude and understand that “the traditional Austrian account of subjectivism, like the verstehen school with which it was linked, never completely overcame the subject/object dichotomy” (Boettke et al. 2001). These authors seek to solve the problem of objectivism by using John Dewey’s analysis as they believe he establishes the need to build “philosophies about the world we live in. It forces us to consider actual problems instead of imaginary puzzles” (ibid.: 15). Their aspiration was to link the world of meaningful economic action to the world of economic science, and Dewey (particularly his theory of inquiry) sets forth the need “to begin with our experience-in-the-world and to test our theories by returning there”, thus making it possible to recover the everyday world lost by economics (ibid.: 26). In this analysis, Schutz is also unable to suggest valid elements towards overcoming such dualisms. Boettke (1998) also speaks along the same lines when he says that “The gulf between historicism and economism simply reflects the classic social science dichotomy between ‘thick’ and ‘thin’ description. Economists possess a penchant for ‘thin’ descriptions and historians value ‘thick’ description” (Boettke 1998: 61). Although the author acknowledges the value of Schutz’s reflections, “the universalistic approach based on purpose-rational action is made possible by introducing degrees of typification, including the most abstract and anonymous typification to the more concrete typification of the historial agents” (ibid.: 63), he ends up subsuming Schutzian theory under a systemic “hybrid approach” called “action-system theory” made up by three elements: “pure theory, institutional or applied theory, and history and policy” (ibid.: 68). The critique on dualism is geared towards both the “theory-history dichotomy in the Menger/Schmoller debate” (Lavoie and Storr 2011) and Mises’ praxeology, who “transforms a legitimate distinction between theoretical and historical questions into a rigid dichotomy between them.” Mises argues that there is a strict dichotomy between theory and history, that while history deals with the particular and the concrete (it is context-specific), praxeology (theory) is universal and applicable “irrespective of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of concrete acts” (ibid.: 215). This dichotomy between theory and history is expressed in Mises’ work in the dichotomy between “thymology and praxeology” (ibid.: 229), a distinction that becomes the object of inquiry on the part of the authors. Among the reflections, Lachmann’s attempt is mentioned, who “wants to undo this dichotomy, but never really elaborates how the theory of understanding needs to be changed, freed from its subject/object baggage, in order to accommodate economic theory (…) But, he does not really elaborate how we might begin to overcome it” (ibid). Still, the Schutzian project is never considered as it overcomes such dichotomies. It is important to point out that part of that project is recovered by Storr (2010a), though not with the radical approach that Schutz gave it; i.e., an in depth philosophical analysis of the features of the life-world (Lebenswelt), of the pre-scientific intersubjective world of culture as foundation of social sciences. The author points to “Schütz’s natural links to the Austrians and the affinity between Schütz’s phenomenology and Mises’ praxeology” and argues that “had the hermeneutical Austrians relied on Alfred Schütz rather than Hans-Georg Gadamer to support their positions much of the firestorm surrounding their methodological pronouncements could have been avoided.” The author’s standpoint is based on Schutz’s attempt towards phenomenological foundation of Mises’ praxeology (ibid.: 150–151). However, although the potential of the Schutzian perspective is vindicated, first to justify praxeology as a science of meaning and secondly to explain “an approach to empirical/historical work that favors ethnographic methods” based on “stock of knowledge and culture” notions, the author steers away from the Schutzian idea of culture and chooses to assert the definition of culture as proposed by Clifford Geertz. In the text, there is not only a lack of argumentation for this change of perspective but, as a consequence of this reasoning, the thorough nature of Schutz’s project goes out of sight. Likewise, Storr goes back to Schutz’s work (Storr 2010b) to approach the problem of objectivism and spontaneous social order pointing to the “different concepts of objectivity” present in Mises and Schutz’s reflections and highlighting that, for Schutz, “the difference between pure economic theory and economic history is, thus, not a qualitative difference in the style of reasoning involved in either enterprise but instead has to do with the degree of anonymity of the ideal types employed” (ibid.: 172). There is, for Schutz, a meaningful distinction but not a stark dichotomy, as Mises frequently suggests, between theory and history (ibid.: 173). However, the author maintains that “Schütz also leaves open the question of how these anonymous ideal types are arrived at” (ibid.: 172). Moreover, he argues that the “objective scientific theorems do not rest on how these theorems were developed. Indeed, for Schütz, scientific constructs are simply more anonymous or less concrete ideal typifications than the constructs employed by historians” (ibid.: 173). This statement overlooks the reference to the abstraction and generalization processes developed by Schutz as key towards the construction of ideal types: “The manner of construction may be abstraction, generalization, or formalization, the principle of meaning-adequacy always, of course, being observed” (PSW: 244). Even Prendergast makes reference to this particularity in Schutz’s work and states that PSW “offered a theory of concept formation” (Prendergast 1986: 22). In addition Storr argues that in Schutz’s work, “the claim to universal validity of theoretical cultural sciences has less to do with the origin of the ideal types employed and more to do with the degree of anonymity of the ideal types employed” (ibid.: 173), instead of looking at the Schutzian turn to the structure of the pre-scientific life-world as the origin of the social sciences concepts. So far, it is clear that the specialized literature has, on the one hand, not found an all-encompassing answer in Schutz’s work to the problem set forth by objectivism regarding the production of knowledge in social sciences while, on the other hand, has reduced its reflection to a theory of common sense knowledge and of the ideal types which is unconnected to a more in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the pre-scientific life- world. The central point of Schutz’s theory of ideal types and stock of knowledge can be recovered in authors such as Storr (2010b), Knudsen (2004),Footnote 3 Kurrild-Klitgaard (2001), Mote (2001), Ebeling (1999), Koppl (1997), Foss (1996) and Pietrykowski (1996). Basically, it is the topic of economic coordination or of the spontaneous orders which on a first look appears to have obtained a greater benefit from the Schutzian perspective. However, in spite of the mention of the importance of the theory of ideal types as an answer to this “paradigmatic problem” of the economic theory, the limitations of Schutz’s theory are also mentioned when making reference to the concept of “unintended consequences.” The focus of the “unintended consequences” is based on the notion of spontaneous social orders proposed by Friederich von Hayek, who emphasizes, among other things, that these orders are not the result of human design. As pointed out by Storr (2010b), for Hayek “spontaneous orders are the unintended consequence of the nonetheless purposeful action of multiple individuals.” The specialists will say that there is no reflection about this notion in the Schutzian scheme. As mentioned by Lavoie, “in economics market processes stands for what is really a more fundamental category which applies not only to markets, but to all sorts of institutions: spontaneous order. It is the principle that the social manifestation of meaningful action is that of an evolving system which exhibits systematic, but generally unintended, consequences” (Lavoie 1994: 56). For Lavoie, authors like Schutz “leave one wondering exactly how to relate the level of meaning with the level of causal spontaneous order analysis” (ibid), which is expressed in a “particular tension in traditional Austrianism between its tenet of subjectivism, understood as the focus on intersubjective meaning, and its also fundamental tenet of spontaneous order” (ibid).Footnote 4
 Storr clearly recovers the critiques that point to an absence of a reflection regarding Schutz’s unintended consequences and proposes considering on the one hand, “the first order common-sense constructs that individuals use to negotiate the social world which necessarily make reference to unintended consequences and spontaneous orders” and, secondly, that “Schütz himself often engaged in causal spontaneous order analysis” (Storr 2010b: 176). Storr argues that “social stock of knowledge emerges spontaneously” and that as a consequence of the pragmatic motive governing the actors in the social world understood as a spontaneous social order that contains multiple and emerging “made orders”, the actors should resort to their stock of knowledge to explain the unintended consequences of their actions and other people’s actions. He adds that “individuals are necessarily spontaneous order theorists”. The analysis of the “unintended consequences” at this first level is at the basis of the second level of scientific-social constructions. However, as we will argue, Schutz resorts to categories of his own to understand the social order resulting from his particular notion of the life-world and an analysis of the unintended consequences in Schutz’s work would imply the reification of the author’s heuristic framework. We believe that the problem of these perspectives lies in that they do not deal in depth with the pre-scientific Lebenswelt,
Footnote 5 the first order construct from which the concepts of social sciences should be based. As we will show, the notion of the life-world appears in Schutz as a response to several dualisms: that of the Austrian School, that of Max Weber and of Henri Bergson, so from the beginning of his reflection, it was affected by the problem of dualism in the production of knowledge and its solution was at the heart of his conceptual scheme. As we see it, the critiques to Schutz and to the limitations authors find in his heuristic framework are due to the fact that his conceptual framework is reduced to a theory of ideal types, thus losing sight of the Schutzian comprehensive project of a foundation of the concepts of social sciences based on the notion of life-world. This notion is important because it brings about more than a theory of ideal types. In this sense, “three levels of inquiry”Footnote 6 are confused which, from the Schutzian perspective, make it possible to overcome dualism and which, as we will show, constitute the starting point of his reflection: 1- the level of the features of the life-world; 2- the level of scientific reflection and, 3- the problem of social order. It is important to point out the priority of the life-world in relation to any scientific reflection. As we shall point out, this priority is expressed through an epistemic claim of that world and it becomes the core of the Schutzian project. The reflection based on the characteristics of the life-world will give way to scientific reflection and, finally as stated by Harold Garfinkel regarding the epistemological problems, “differences in decisions eventuate in different conceptions (…) of the problem of social order” (Garfinkel 1953). We contend the recovery of the notion of the life-world enables us to think of social order based on the very Schutzian vocabulary, i.e., 1- not only based on a theory of ideal types and stock of knowledge but also based on the theory of intrinsic and imposed relevances and the communicative orders and, 2- not as a spontaneous order in which there is an emphasis on the constrictive dimension of social order in which human design is subordinated to the unintended consequences by the actor. In this sense, from our point of view, it is necessary to subsume the theory of unintended consequences under the theory of intrinsic and imposed relevances, which enables us to focus not only on the coercive nature of the order (imposed relevances) but also on the conscious attempt on the part of the actors towards its maintenance and transformation (intrinsic relevances). In this framework, instead of spontaneous orders, we shall argue for the idea of negotiated communicative orders based on a comprehensive social order theory. With the objective of providing an answer to these considerations, we shall show that Schutz’s project for a phenomenological foundation of the social sciences starts from a clearly defined problem: how to avoid the replacement of social life by the idealities and abstractions created by science. This question is articulated in the context of the discussions of the Austrian School of Economics –one of Schutz’s first and most important intellectual circles of belonging– which, at that moment, was going through an epistemological crisis. In what follows it will be shown that Schutz’s project for developing the notion of the life-world, reflected in his first book PSW, is a response not only to the epistemological crisis of the School but also to the dualism of Weber and Bergson’s theories. In particular, we intend to recover what may be called an “epistemic claim” to the life-world, which establishes the conceptual priority of that world in relation to any abstract scientific speculation. In order to account for these issues we will briefly discuss, firstly, the epistemological crisis which the Austrian School was going through, as well as Schutz’s position in relation to the issues raised there. The problem of dualism between economic theory and social life will be emphasized and, as a consequence, the inability to account for the subjective point of view. Secondly, we analyze Schutz’s project in PSW, i.e. the revision of Weber’s interpretive sociology and its philosophical foundation through the notion of the life-world, which retrieves and articulates the thoughts of Bergson and Edmund Husserl. Thirdly, we present the philosophical outline of the notion of the life-world in the early work of Schutz and its links with scientific theorizing so as to avoid replacement or reification. Finally, we go back to the problem of spontaneous order and we present the outline of a comprehensive theory of social order according to the hermeneutical framework proposed by Schutz.",3

When one of us (Baetjer) challenged his undergraduate Money and Banking course to create such an example, the other, a student in the course (Stein) accepted the challenge. The goal was not to represent ABCT in any comprehensive way; it was rather to illustrate the business cycle as conceived in Austrian theory, from cause to boom to bust, with an example undergraduates can readily understand. The parable that follows is the fruit of that challenge. We intend it to illustrate the core elements of ABCT, in particular the description given by Steven Horwitz (2000, pp. 125–6) and the version presented in graphical form by Roger Garrison in his PowerPoint presentations on Capital-Based Macroeconomics.Footnote 1 To that end, in order to keep the narrative easily understandable, we focus on a single imaginary entrepreneur in a restricted fictional setting, using him as a representative agent for the many individual entrepreneurs who collectively respond to money-induced distortions of the interest rate that the ABCT sees as the underlying cause of the business cycle. We present the example as the playing-out of the same plan in three different world-states in order to highlight the importance of the interest rate in coordinating the plans of savers and investors. In the first two scenarios two (different) interest rates provide this coordination because each is equal to the (different) Wicksellian “natural rate” in its own case. In these scenarios no cycle occurs. In the third scenario, though the interest rate is the same as in the second, it is lower not because of increased saving, but because monetary policy has pushed the market interest rate below the natural rate. This distortion misleads the entrepreneur and begins the business cycle. We hope to show that the two latter scenarios in which the entrepreneur undertakes his proposed investment are qualitatively indistinguishable to him in the moment of action. In the second his calculations are justified by events; in the third the same calculations are miscalculations. While miscalculations occur all the time even in an economy not undergoing intertemporal disequilibrium, this example illustrates with an individual instance the systemic malinvestment that creates the boom-bust cycle, according to ABCT.",

Evans,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper attempts to link together policies that are designed to promote entrepreneurship with general macroeconomic stabilisation. It utilises an Austrian school perspective in two ways. Firstly, in terms of a theory of entrepreneurship, and how this relates to both small and medium enterprise (SME) and regional development policy. And secondly, in terms of a theory of the business cycle, and how “easy money” can ultimately lead to a credit crunch. These two seemingly distinct micro and macro phenomena are bridged by the banking system—when a policy goal of low interest rates and availability of credit for businesses is financed through monetary expansion an unsustainable boom will follow (Mises 1912; Hayek 1935; Garrison 2001). We can treat “access to finance”, “SME support” and “regional development” as policies that attempt to promote entrepreneurship, and that all rely in some way on “easy money”. Although such policies are often seen as a crucial means to generate economic growth, efforts to expand the money supply beyond the stock of real savings leads to systemic crises. Therefore the admirable policy goal of promoting more credit for entrepreneurs can lead to negative unintended consequences. Whilst the Austrian school may have received more attention for business cycle theory than for entrepreneurship policy, this is changing. Coyne and Moberg (2014) is a recent example of a distinctly Austrian critique of “doing business” policies that offer targeted benefits to businesses. They provide a detailed explanation for how unintended consequences can occur when states attempt to encourage particular industries and companies, and end up undermining the entrepreneurial environment. Many of the criticisms of publicly subsidised credit focuses on moral hazard (i.e., that after grants have been given, receivers of grants don’t have the right incentives to be financially responsible). However this article will also draw upon what is potentially the far bigger problem of adverse selection (i.e., that the only people who require subsidised funds are the marginal entrepreneurs who’s ideas can’t raise capital at the market rate). An Austrian-school view of monetary policy creates a picture where credit expansion entices marginal entrepreneurs into the market, and the very same ones will be the first to leave when monetary policy tightens (Evans and Baxendale 2008, 2012).Footnote 1 Note that this helps us to move beyond the microeconomic attention to how incentives change behaviour, towards how faulty institutions can generate unintended consequences. In this paper “easy money” refers to a situation where government policy generates more credit than would exist under a regime of sound money.Footnote 2 We can draw attention to two distinct, but related, examples of “easy money”. The first is direct government subsidies, which attempt to support favoured companies, industries or regions. This paper will focus on one particular form in which such support is provided, namely “access to finance”. This is a targeted way in which policymakers intend to provide entrepreneurs with favourable credit conditions. But “easy money” is also a macroeconomic phenomenon. When the monetary authorities engage in an overly loose monetary policy this will tend to reduce interest rates and serve as an untargeted way to help entrepreneurs. However when interest rates are pushed below their natural rate this will sow the seeds for an Austrian business cycle. The artificially low rate will ultimately lead to a credit crunch and a painful recession will occur when the malinvestment is ultimately liquidated. This shows how the recession is an unintended consequence of easy money policies. These two examples of “easy money” policies can be related. Government spending must come from somewhere and budget deficits tend to ultimately be financed through monetisation. Although not necessarily the case, and without wishing to draw too close a link, to the extent that budget deficits are monetised these two easy money policies (subsidised access to finance, and artificially low interest rates) can be seen as two sides of the same coin. Ultimately this paper is an attempt to bridge the micro- and macro-economic aspects of public policy attention to entrepreneurship, and uses the Austrian school as a means to do so. Section 2 will provide an overview of the theory of entrepreneurship (in particular the Austrian-school attention to entrepreneurship, Mises 1949; Kirzner 1973; Huerta De Soto 2010; Foss and Klein 2012), how it relates to economic growth, and how it is utilised for public policy. This provides the theoretical core of the article. Section 3 discusses how this relates to SME policy, and also provides a critique of policies that aim to support regional development (such as the attempt to create clusters). It will be argued that they demonstrate a misunderstanding of the market process that results in a misidentification of market failure. Section 4 concentrates on “access to finance” policies with specific attention to UK government attempts to plug the so-called “equity gap”. It is argued that this rests on a conflation of barriers and costs. Section 5 draws upon aspects of the Austrian theory of the trade cycle (in particular the concept of “forced savings”) and the public popularity of efforts to keep interest rates artificially low. Section 6 documents the history of policy support to entrepreneurs within the EU to provide illustrative empirical evidence. It is important to stress that this concentrates on the boom phase of the business cycle and therefore attention is focused on policies enacted prior to the 2008 financial crisis. Given that the financial crisis can be viewed as a consequence of easy money policies (Woods 2009; Norberg 2010), it can be viewed—to some extent—as an unintended consequence of the policies discussed. Section 7 concludes.",8

Giménez Roche,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recent literature has shown that the nature of failures and financial troubles characterizing a business cycle bust are directly linked to the unsustainable nature of the investments made during the boom preceding it (Almunia et al. 2010; Barro 2006, 2009; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009). A recurrent fact behind these unsustainable booms seems to be the massive expansion of commercial bank credit set off by central bank (CB) interest-targeting accommodative monetary policies. However, not all enterprises enter the business cycle by means of bank credit. They can also use internal and external equity according to considerations of capital structure strategy and balance sheet valuation. This leaves other transmission channels open to monetary policy besides the traditional interest rate channel. Therefore, the explanation for the emergence of malinvestments during the boom and their failure in the bust must take into consideration how enterprises enter a business cycle through their investment decision-making. ABCT essentially explains business cycles as a process of the emergence of clusters of entrepreneurial errors resulting in malinvestments marked by an inconsistent relationship between investment and consumption market preferences (Rothbard 2000, pp. 8–9). This squares well with the aforementioned literature since ABCT links the unsustainability of booms to the expansion of investment projects done with financial capital backed in great part by bank credit rather than real savings (Hayek 1933; Mises 1980). Entrepreneurs decide to expand investment with financial capital that is not backed by additional real savings while households and other enterprises are not releasing resources from consumption, thus resulting in unstable economic growth. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Cowen (1997), conventional expositions of ABCT (e.g., Garrison 2001; Rothbard 2004) overemphasize the interest rate channel by assuming that entrepreneurs massively and immediately lengthen (i.e. increase capital-intensiveness) the structure of production when they should not. Although structural lengthening of production must occur at some point during the boom, it is an eventual rather than an immediate characteristic of it. If it were not so, ABCT would be incapable of explaining increases in real consumption so typical of booms and why booms sometimes take so long to turn into a bust—as indicated by Krugman (2008; 2010). In fact, in Mises’s expositions of ABCT (Mises 1980, 1998), it is explained that the boom involves attempts at both lateral and longitudinal expansions of the production structure (Mises 1998, p. 553). The presence of both lateral and longitudinal investments, as well as the divergence between consumptive and investment pressures, indicates that the problem does not necessarily imply an overinvestment in capital-intensive projects (Mises 1998, p. 556). Malinvestments represent a problem because entrepreneurs are investing where they should not and not just when they should not. Our point in this paper is that the distortion of market signals resulting from accommodative monetary policy exogenously set up conditions for the gradual and endogenous setting off of business cycles by entrepreneurs (cf. Garrison 1989, 2001). This occurs because transmission of accommodative monetary policy is not limited to the traditional interest rate channel, but also flows through other channels that more broadly distort entrepreneurial perception of profit opportunities before and during the boom. Consequently, distortions in balance sheet values and cash flow should also be added to the discounting distortion more typically accounted for in ABCT in order to explain overoptimistic estimations in capital structure and the set of ex ante profitable investment projects. The emerging potential gains of an economic boom thus generate a number of incentives that incite enterprises to ignite the business cycle even if they might know that the ensuing economic boom is ephemeral. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the ABCT theoretical framework in a novel way to clearly illuminate the role of capital budgeting evaluation in the emergence of malinvestments that characterize the unsustainable boom. After a brief exposition of the ABCT and the role of central banking in its framework, a synthesis of the different views on monetary policy transmission channel and corporate capital structure is presented for integration into ABCT. This integration includes a typology of enterprises and malinvestments that evolve through the business cycle. The exposition is formalized through widely-used financial analytical tools of capital budgeting.",3

Phelan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Austrian economics has had a major influence on the field of entrepreneurship, much to the surprise of some market process scholars, who see their work as having nothing to say about the secrets of entrepreneurship (Kirzner 2009). Moreover, the work in entrepreneurship seems to draw on different flavors of Austrian economics, with one school drawing on Kirzner’s notion of alertness (Shane 2003), another on Schumpeter’s creative destruction (Sarasvathy 2008), a third relying on the work of Lachmann (Chiles et al. 2007), and a fourth building on Misesian theories of action (Klein 2008b). In turn, these different starting points have generated a good deal of philosophical debate in entrepreneurship on the nature of opportunities and how entrepreneurs should behave to pursue opportunities (Alvarez and Barney 2007, 2010). Unlike economists, entrepreneurship scholars are interested in the micro-implications of their theories rather than the system wide effects on the economy. However, these attempts to resolve differences among theories of entrepreneurship have the potential to provide insights to scholars in Austrian economics. Recently, complexity theory has been touted as a potential solution to many theoretical disagreements in entrepreneurship (Boland et al. 2014; Phelan 2014). This paper seeks to extend those arguments to inform some of the debates in Austrian economics, around the issues of equilibrium, subjectivism, prediction, and spontaneous order. The device used to achieve these insights is a dancing fitness landscape, where the height of the landscape is a metaphor for the payoff of a particular resource combination. The payoffs are subject to change over time in response to exogenous and endogenous activities creating a dancing fitness landscape shaped by the actions of all agents in the economy. While the payoffs are ontologically objective, the beliefs of entrepreneurs about the payoffs are subjective with the payoff only being realized when action is taken. Austrian scholars who are committed to finding regularities in the market process and those that see a tradeoff between planned and spontaneous order at the margin will likely see complexity theory as a potential new tool in their methodological arsenal. Those that subscribe to what I refer to as the ‘strong form’ of Austrian economics will have more problems with the approach because of their insistence on spontaneous order in all things. However, even in the most extreme case, I argue there is still common ground between the two perspectives. In the remainder of paper I lay out the influence that Austrian economics has had on entrepreneurship theory and discuss the debates that have arisen in entrepreneurship about the nature of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial action. Following this discussion, I introduce the notion of a dancing fitness landscape and explain how it can resolve a number of debates in entrepreneurship that, in turn, has implications for theoretical debates in Austrian economics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the approach for different flavors of Austrian economics.",7

In this paper I revisit the question of coordination – of plans by prices and other social institutions. Prices contain ambiguous information that requires interpretation. How are they, in spite of this, able to coordinate plans and actions? The answer given in this paper is that they are not – they do not. I suggest that a closer examination of plan-coordination indicates that some plans should not be coordinated, at least as regards their outcomes. Coordination arguably, and in the work of Hayek at least implicitly, applies to the ‘rules’, the institutions, and not to the outcomes that occur from following them. This follows from the obvious notion that there must be room for creativity. While this may seem like a trivial point, made many times, it is not clear, at least as concerns the role of prices, that it has been fully digested. In Section 2, I review the Hayekian ideas of institutional evolution and consider how this relates to divergent and convergent social processes. This relates also to network-effects and the selection of rules and standards of behavior. I reconsider the criticism of Hayek’s theory of group-selection from this perspective. In Section 3, I apply these ideas to a consideration of equilibrium, order and coordination in general, and to the role of prices and profits and entrepreneurial action in particular. This entails discussing the nature and dimensions of competition. I conclude in Section 4 by summarizing the perspective on plan-coordination offered in this paper.",2
29.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,18 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-015-0318-8,Does belief in objective morality lead to coercion? An analysis of the arguments of Kelsen and Buchanan,September 2016,Niclas Berggren,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Factors that influence the prevalence and strength of free and democratic societies are of great interest, to friends and foes of freedom and democracy alike. Here, we will focus on one potential such factor: people’s beliefs about the nature of morality. Two leading scholars of the 20th century – Hans Kelsen and James Buchanan – can be interpreted as having suggested that such beliefs matter. The idea is that those who think that it can be known what is objectively right will tend to be unfavorable towards freedom and democracy, since people will then be allowed to make choices – individually by freedom and collectively via democracy – that may contravene that which is morally prescribed. “Moral objectivists” will be prone to more strongly advocate some form of authoritarian rule, which imposes the morally right laws, policies and regulations on people, than those holding different metaethical views. In this paper, I will present the arguments of the two scholars and evaluate them, as such and in light of some recent experimental studies. It will be argued that on theoretical grounds there is reason to doubt that the arguments hold (i) if moral objectivists do not think that the moral facts are known, (ii) if they are not motivated by the known moral facts or (iii) if the content of the objective morality that is believed to exist and to be known is such that it favors freedom or democracy. Nevertheless, I also report experimental findings that give some empirical support for a link between belief in an objective morality and an authoritarian inclination. We are dealing with metaethical beliefs, about questions such as “What is goodness?”, “What can we know about morality?” and “Are there moral facts?”.Footnote 1 The two scholars discussed here are proposing the empirical hypothesis that there is a link between certain such metaethical positions and ethical positions in the realm of politics. The central underlying question whether morality is objective or subjective is a factual one concerning the nature of moral beliefs. More precisely, the traditional cognitivist view of the objectivity of morals, moral realism, entails three claims: that moral statements express propositions, that some of these are true and that these are made true by objective features of the world (see Sayre-McCord 2011). The true moral propositions can be called moral facts. In contrast, ethical subjectivism, or “non-cognitivism”, denies that moral facts exist and that moral propositions are always only the expression of a subjective view.Footnote 2 There is an ongoing debate among philosophers about which side (if any) is correct, and it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt to make a pronouncement on that issue, or to present other metaethical positions.Footnote 3 In any case, what interests us is not really who is right and wrong in this debate but whether people believe that morality is objective or subjective and what this brings with it. That people hold beliefs of this kind is supported by a poll and some experimental evidence. The PhilPaper Surveys (2009) found that of the 484 respondents who did not indicate any affiliation with a university, and who may therefore be seen as “ordinary people”, 47.1 % accepted or leaned towards realism, while 30.4 % accepted or leaned towards anti-realism concerning the nature of moral judgments. Among all 3226 respondents, the figures were 52.5 and 30.9 %, respectively. And in an experiment, Goodwin and Darley (2008: 1359) could establish the following: [E]thical beliefs were treated almost as objectively as scientific or factual beliefs, and decidedly more objectively than social conventions or tastes. Individuals seem to identify a strong objective component to their core ethical beliefs, and thus treat them as categorically different from social conventions. Arguably, many of our participants viewed their ethical beliefs as true in a mind-independent way. Hence, it seems as if people do tend to have beliefs in this area, and that a majority leans towards something akin to the moral-realist view.Footnote 4 With these observations in hand, we can now move on to arguments about the political consequences of such a view.Footnote 5

Boettke,Daniel J. Smith,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many economists hold that the financial crisis of 2007 showed monetary economists “the limitations of monetary policy and cast doubt on some of the tenets of its intellectual foundations” (Blanchard et al. 2013, 3), leaving the profession in search of a new consensus (Nowotny 2014).Footnote 1 Yet, almost all the debates spurred by this lesson have focused on the technical aspects of monetary policy, missing the insights that a broader perspective of political economy could bring. We can divide monetary research into two broad categories.Footnote 2 The first category aims to refine technical models and improve data collection to better approach optimal monetary policy within a given monetary framework. Researchers in this vein generally assume they can hand over their findings for the monetary authorities to implement. The vast preponderance of monetary research falls into this category. The second category of monetary research explores the framework of monetary policy itself. Researchers of this sort often recognize that when the technically optimal is in conflict with the politically optimal, as is often the case in a contemporary democracy, political considerations are taken to supersede technical considerations no matter how well refined the latter are (Boettke and Smith 2013; Friedman 1992; Taylor 2009; Wagner 1986; Weintraub 1978).Footnote 3
 Ideal people in ideal settings can implement ideal monetary policy (Buchanan 1962b, 164). However, the researcher who takes knowledge and incentive problems—robust political economy—seriously does not set ideal policy for ideal people in ideal settings as their primary objective. As Buchanan (1962a, 28) recognized, “the almost universal neglect of the imperfections that might arise from the political attempts at applying the economists’ efficiency criteria represents a serious deficiency” in economic research. Researchers must also study the environment within which monetary policy is carried out and the practical implementation of technical findings within that environment (Mayer 1993, 1). Put differently, while monetary researchers have found increasingly sophisticated methods for zeroing in on the optimal monetary policy course, they usually neglect to consider the necessarily imperfect institutions within which monetary policy is implemented. Imperfect monetary institutions result in misaligned incentives and imperfect information (Willett and Keen 1993, 14). Such neglect renders technical models fragile to the implicit assumption that monetary authorities are free of political influences and can know how to follow the prescribed monetary course. The second category of monetary researcher rejects this unrealistic assumption. In other words, researchers recognize the importance of finding the technical optimum but deny that it has paramount relevance because of distorted incentives, lack of information, and high costs of administration. According to them, researchers ought to seek institutions for authorities and settings as they are, not as we hope them to be (Pennington 2011). These insights have been incorporated into, or at least acknowledged in, many fields of research in contemporary political economy. It is widely accepted that politicians are self-interested,Footnote 4 use policy to bolster their reelection bids,Footnote 5 find creative ways to control supposedly independent or discretionary bureaucracies and commissions,Footnote 6 and create regulatory agencies and bureaucracies readily captured by special interest groups.Footnote 7
 Yet, monetary economists have been reluctant to apply these considerations to their technical debates or to the design of our monetary institutions and the tasks we assign to them. As Mayer (1993, 2) observed, there is now a tradition in economics of treating practical problems the following way: Those components that can be analyzed rigorously … are given painstakingly and rigorous attention, but the other components are more or less dismissed by arm-waving. It seems as though the familiar principle that a chain is no stronger than its weakest link is turned upside down, as though it were more important to strengthen further the already strong parts of an argument rather than its weaker parts. This renders our monetary system prone to any deviations away from the implicit, ideal assumptions of our technical models, no matter how well calibrated the models become. The implicit assumptions of omniscience and benevolence on the part of monetary authorities render the profession’s technical optima nonoperational. This is especially disconcerting for an institution that Samuelson and Nordhaus (1985, 294) call “the most important factor in the making of macroeconomic policy.” Among those who came to recognize the importance of applying the concepts of robust political economy to our monetary institutions are F. A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, and James M. Buchanan. Over the course of their careers, they devoted their attention to monetary policy. But in their early work, Hayek and Friedman sought to improve monetary policy within the given monetary framework. They both held that a central bank was necessary and that an optimal course of policy could be found and followed successfully. They held that the primary task of monetary economists was to increasingly refine monetary models and measurement techniques. Over time, as they grew increasingly frustrated with actual monetary policy in practice and doubtful that monetary authorities could remain independent, due to knowledge and incentive problems, their research increasingly recognized the need for more fundamental changes to our monetary regime. By the end of their careers, Hayek advocated a system of competing private currencies (which he referred to as denationalizing) while Friedman suggested a computer was necessary if binding monetary rules were to be imposed. Unlike Hayek and Friedman, Buchanan more consistently examined the framework of monetary policy through the lens of robust political economy throughout his career, but it wasn’t until the end of his career that he argued for the need to bind monetary authorities through what he called the constitutionalization of money. By the end of their careers, Hayek, Friedman, and Buchanan each sought radical alternatives to our monetary institutions to overcome the motivational and epistemic problems addressed by political economy. In their quest to apply robust political economy to our monetary structures, each researcher’s ideas evolved through the consistent practice of professional humility, creative thinking, and emphasizing the politically possible, not the politically acceptable. To build upon their experiences and to continue their search for monetary regimes robust to knowledge problems and incentive issues, we hold that modern monetary researchers should adopt these same habits. Section 2 traces the evolution of Hayek’s research on monetary policy. Section 3 provides the same analysis for Friedman and Section 4 for Buchanan. Section 5 draws three primary lessons from the research experiences of Hayek, Friedman, and Buchanan as monetary researchers: the need for professional humility, creative thinking, and an emphasis on the politically possible, not the politically acceptable. Section 6 concludes.",10

Some reflections on the economists’ failure to predict the financial crisis,December 2016,Nicola Giocoli,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"“The obvious conclusion is that forecasts should not be taken seriously. There is not a lot of point asking an economist to tell you what will happen to the economy next year—nobody knows”. These words by Tim Harford closed his Undercover Economist column in the Financial Times Magazine of May 30, 2014.Footnote 1 The following picture, taken from a recent short paper by IMF economists Prakash Loungani and Hites Ahir, seems to validate them (Fig. 1). Based on the data of Consensus Economics, the world’s leading macroeconomic survey firm, which provides forecasts of real GDP for a large group of countries made by more than 700 professional forecasters around the world,Footnote 2 the picture shows the number of countries experiencing recession in the period 2008–2012 and the number of countries that, according to economists’ consensus predictions made by September of a given year, would experience recession the following year (Ahir and Loungani 2014). Number of Recessions Predicted by September of the Previous Year. (Source: Ahir and Loungani 2014). The negative record is impressive. Of the 77 countries under consideration, 49 of them were in recession in 2009. Yet, economists—as reflected in the averages published in a report available for sale, named Consensus Forecasts—had not called a single one of these recessions by September 2008! In his column Hartford underscores that this is not the famous complaint by the English Queen that no economist saw the financial crisis coming.Footnote 3 The crisis was already on its way (Northern Rock and Bear Stearns had already collapsed) when these forecasts were made. Moving forward in time, there were 15 recessions in 2012—that is, after the best economic minds of a generation had studied the crisis and its explanations for the previous 4 years. Still, only two of these recessions were predicted by September 2011. Not that the financial crisis was a special event either. Indeed, Loungani had made his name back in 2001, with a paper on the same topic and based on the same data source for the period 1989–1998, whose main result could be grasped already in the abstract: “the record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished” (Loungani 2001, 419).Footnote 4
 This is the portrait of a disaster. To say the least, economists active in the forecasting business suffer from a serious credibility issue. One may wonder what anybody should be willing to pay for the privilege of receiving twelve months of Consensus Economics’s service—the listed price actually runs at €620 for forecasts about the G7 countries and Western Europe. Or, more seriously, one may ask, why this failure? Why, as Köster (2014) called it, the “perpetual disappointment”? Generally speaking, consumers of economic forecasts belong to two categories. Many are in the private sector, especially businesses requiring advance information for devising their plans or making financial decisions. Several end-users are in the public sector, though: policy-makers need trustworthy forecasts as a foundation for their policies. The “garbage in, garbage out” principle strikes inexorably in both cases. In the former, however, the consequences of trusting wrong forecasts fall, at least in first approximation, entirely upon the users; in the latter, the mistakes affect everyone. Regardless of the specific measures undertaken, as well as of the other problems that may affect policy-making, the simple, but scary, truth is that economic policies are all too often based upon forecasts that are no better than those exemplified above. Forecasting failures translate directly into policy failures. The credibility issue becomes a credibility crisis: why should we trust the economists in power? The typical reply to this critique is that we live in a very complicated world, but with the help of more data and more refined models we would get better forecasts and, from there, better economic policies that would restore the discipline’s authoritativeness. Alas, it is not just a matter of data availability or improving existing models. My claim is that forecasting and policy failures are related manifestations of the same fundamental problem, namely, a defective philosophy of model building. Too many economists are unaware of the intrinsic limitations of what their discipline may achieve. Practitioners should recognize that the only possible predictions of economic events are pattern predictions; that the models they use for both forecasting and policy-making are uselessly precise, but seldom accurate; that their approach to economic issues should be that of the physician, rather than the engineer; more generally, that forecasting and policy-making are always a matter of art, not science. These limitations should lead economists to revise their offer to end-users, by severely qualifying their forecasts and policy proposals. Above all, they should advice them against the adoption of too specific policies, for lack of adequate empirical grounding. Helping devise institutions capable of preventing worst-case scenarios should become the economists’ more modest, but still invaluable, task. All of the fore-mentioned are hardly original points. On the contrary, they have all been made in the past, recently and not-so-recently. Starting from the early 2000s, Austrian economics scholars such as Peter Boettke, Peter Lesson and Mark Pennington have identified systemic robustness as an essential, though often overlooked, component of political economic analysis. Performing the robustness check for any political economy argument is crucial, these authors argue, because key economic propositions are often only valid under “best-case” assumptions (like, say, full rationality and perfect information), but fail in more realistic scenarios when these assumptions do not hold. Robust systems for organizing economic activities are on the contrary those that are able to stand up to the test of less-than-ideal conditions, including the “worst-case” scenario when none of the assumptions holds but the system still performs well – hence, the name “robust political economy” given to the approach.Footnote 5 It follows that every economic forecast or policy advice should first be subjected to the robustness check and discarded if too dependent on specific assumptions. While recognizing the validity of the robust political economy approach and its relevance for explaining the economists’ dismal record vis-à-vis the financial crisis, the present paper argues that a similar lesson may be drawn borrowing from the wisdom of a short list of big names in economics. Appealing to the discipline’s history to tackle so pressing an issue should not sound obscure: economics does have a useful past and evoking it often helps illuminate current controversies.Footnote 6 The economists’ failure with respect to the crisis is a case in point. Accordingly, the paper builds on the lessons by the likes of Hayek (§1), Neville Keynes (§2), Mankiw, Tinbergen, Maynard Keynes and Lucas (§4). The glue to keep such an odd bunch together is provided by science historian Ted Porter (§3). A natural science field that recently managed to survive a similar credibility crisis offers a success story to imitate (§5).",

The depression is generally noted for its sharp decline in prices and production that occurred after the sharp run up in the money supply and prices that occurred during and after World War I (WWI). Despite the harsh contraction and the apparent lack of fiscal and monetary stimulus, the economy briskly recovered. James Grant (2014), following Murphy (2009), Powell (2009), and Woods (2009a), has offered it as a case study of how recovery was promoted and not inhibited by fiscal austerity and non-expansionary monetary policy, or laissez faire.Footnote 1 All these writers echo earlier work by Benjamin Anderson (1945, 25) who characterized it as “Our Last Natural Recovery to Full Employment.”Footnote 2
 Kuehn (2011, 2012) criticized the natural recovery laissez faire view described by Murphy (2009), Powell (2009), and Woods (2009a). He argues, among other things, that fiscal contraction mostly preceded the depression and that monetary easing in 1921–1922 in fact sparked the recovery (Kuehn 2011, 276–78, 284–85; Kuehn 2012, 156, 158). Vigorous discussion filled subsequent blog posts and other popular outlets, such as Krugman (2011a, b, 2012a, b), DeLong (2011), Selgin (2011), Boudreaux (2011), Murphy (2012), and Glasner (2012). Grant’s (2014) book has prompted another round of discussion, including Cato (2014), Rosser (2014), Krugman (2014), Murphy (2014a, b), Selgin (2014), Glasner (2014), Glasner (2015) and DeLong (2015).Footnote 3 Critics of the laissez faire view have generally pointed to the unusual characteristics of the depression and the monetary easing that took place from 1921 to 1922. There are now various interpretations on both sides. This paper argues that the depression did in fact end from a natural recovery, and this was due to a market reallocation of resources spurred on by the intense liquidation and fiscal and monetary contraction which continued during the downturn. Recovery began around the first round of wage cuts in March 1921 and before the monetary easing that began in mid-1921. In order to fully understand the Depression of 1920–1921 and the subsequent market reallocation, one must first understand what caused the depression and what the market was recovering from. In other words, if the market is required to reallocate resources, they must have been misallocated in the first place. What caused this cluster of misallocated resources and bad, or mal-investments in 1920? In addition, why was the cluster of errors concentrated in certain industries more than others? This paper argues that Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) answers these questions and not only explains the 1920–1921 Depression and recovery but also the postwar boom that caused the bust. Briefly, ABCT argues that government promoted credit expansion distorts the interest rate and leads to an unsustainable boom that misallocates resources, which leads to a bust in which resources must be reallocated. The unequal sectoral shifts in the boom, bust, and recovery of the postwar era are all explainable by ABCT. As will be explained below, data limitations and other constraints prevent a thorough econometric testing of ABCT, and as a result the empirical analysis is in line with previous research that analyzes ABCT from a historical-economic perspective rather than an econometric study (Newman 2014, 483–84). Making the case for both a market based recovery and an ABCT explanation means responding to Kuehn (2011, 2012), so far the most academic contributions to the discussion, and also considering previous examinations of the Depression by economic historians, including Friedman and Schwartz (1993 [1963]), Romer (1988), Vernon (1991), and Bordo et al. (2007).Footnote 4 It should be noted though that while Kuehn criticized the natural recovery view, he appears sympathetic to the Austrian credit cycle interpretation of the depression, and has argued for Austrians to provide a more rigorous empirical analysis that traces out the specific malinvestments (Kuehn 2011, 274, 288–89). The paper is structured as follows. Section II provides an outline of ABCT and related theories, as well as how it will be applied. Sections III, IV, and V break down the postwar era and provide the requisite historical and economic analysis, and Section VI concludes.",5
29.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,15 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-015-0333-9,"Learning as an emergent, creative process",December 2016,Christopher J. Coyne,Vipin P. Veetil,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The central thesis of Joseph Stiglitz and Bruce Greenwald’s Creating a Learning Society is “that most of the increases in standards of living are, as Solow suggested, a result of increases in productivity—learning how to do things better” (2014: 5). Creating a learning society is especially important, they argue, with the movement toward the “knowledge economy” in the 21st century. Two key questions underpin their analysis. The first question is whether laissez-faire markets produce an efficient level and pattern of learning and innovation. They argue that markets fail in this regard because the creation of knowledge involves a wide variety of externalities and information asymmetries. The second question is what kinds of government interventions can fix these market failures. They propose a whole host of measures (Part 3 of the book) including: government investment in public universities, the protection of infant industries, and exchange rate controls intended to protect the domestic economy. Stiglitz and Greenwald present a variety of reasons why laissez-faire markets do not produce a Pareto efficient amount of innovation, including the prevalence of externalities. Innovation builds on past innovations. Individual innovators cannot reap all the benefits their innovations create for other economic agents, some of whom may not be born yet. This means that there will be under-investment in innovation. A monopoly does not help solve the problem. Although a monopoly may internalize more externalities than competitive firms, monopoly power brings dead-weight loss and creates market distortions of other kinds. Externalities, according to Stiglitz and Greenwald, are not the only reason why markets fail to produce optimal innovation and learning; there are three other reasons. First, capital markets fail to optimally fund innovation because ‘knowledge capital’ cannot be easily collateralized as compared to physical capital. Second, successful innovation requires coordination between different economic actors. But the secrecy that is necessary to secure the profits from innovation does not lend itself to large-scale cooperation. Individual economic actors often do not have the incentive to share their prospective innovation with each other, leading them to (individually) make plans that cannot be completed. Finally, laissez-faire economies tend to be highly volatile and unstable. This reduces learning by making capital more costly and less accessible. In this essay, we argue that while Stiglitz and Greenwald ask important questions, their analysis is neutered by the limitations of what Wagner (2010) refers to as the Neo-Walrasian approach in explaining changing relations between human actors. This approach seeks to establish logical relations between the attributes of individual economic actors and social outcomes. For instance, general equilibrium theory studies the relationship between endowments, preferences, and production possibilities on the one hand, and prices on the other. These logical relations exist outside of historical time. The dependence between the plans of different economic actors is simple and equilibrium prices are sufficient statistics to coordinate these plans (see Thompson 1992). We discuss an alternative paradigm, the Neo-Mengerian approach, for understanding and analyzing the process of economic growth. In contrast to the Neo-Walrasian approach, the Neo-Mengerian approach views social phenomenon as emergent outcomes of the interactions between different economic actors (Wagner 2010). The relations between the plans of different micro-entities form an ecology, which evolves in historical time (see O’Driscoll and Rizzo 2014). The dependence between the plans of different economic actors is complex rather than simple. Although prices serve as useful statistics, they are never sufficient statistics to create social harmony (see Thompson 1992). Each economic entity makes decisions with limited knowledge of the plans of other entities (see Lewin 1999). While information asymmetry is a source of trouble in the Neo-Walrasian perspective, distributed knowledge is an ordinary working feature of the system in the Neo-Mengerian perspective. Competition is a rivalrous process (see Hayek 1948; Kirzner 1992; Wagner 2001). It is a verb. Micro-entities often take actions that cause the plans of other entities to fail (Lewin 1999). Prices are not the only force through which economic actors affect each other; externalities too are an ordinary working feature of the system. The Neo-Walrasian and the Neo-Mengerian approaches are not competing schemes of thought; rather they are non-commensurable (Wagner 2010). Reality presents us with both structure and process. The two approaches are useful for understanding different economic problems. For instance the Neo-Walrasian approach is a useful means to answer questions such as: “what would happen to the price of apples if the preference for apples changes?” and “what would happen to the interest rate if the temporal distribution of endowments changes?” However, the Neo-Walrasian approach is less useful to study processes that involve the creation of new relations between economic actors. The Neo-Walrasian approach takes the relations between economic actors as given and asks how resources are allocated within this nexus of relations. It views markets as systems to process information about preferences, endowments, and production possibilities. However, in reality the process of economic growth involves the creation of new products, new ways of doing things, and new markets. It involves the creation of new economic relations and the destruction of old economic relations. It is our contention that such processes are better studied through a Neo-Mengerian window. We proceed as follows. The next section describes the fundamental principles of the Neo-Walrasian approach. We distinguish between the market-failure and the market-discovery literature within this paradigm. The third section presents the Neo-Mengerian approach. We make the parallel distinction between invention and innovation on the one hand and between scientific knowledge and relational-knowledge on the other. The fourth section discusses the relation between economic growth and knowledge. We argue that economic growth is a process of innovation and the development of relational-knowledge. The fifth section concludes the paper.",1

Wagner,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In our judgment, the best element in the Austrian tradition of macro theorizing is its emphasis on the structure of production, in contrast to the customary use of a circular flow of economic activity. Within the circular flow conception of the economic process, everything is instantaneous and time is of no consequence. Inputs are applied and outputs derived, without the passing of time as being significant in any but a notional sense. In sharp contrast, traditional Austrian theory insists upon a structure of production where some activities are directly involved in producing consumer goods while other activities are involved in producing capital goods that will facilitate the production of consumer goods in years to come. A key question in traditional Austrian theory is what determines the time-length of this structure of production. The answer is that it depends on the willingness of people to postpone current consumption relative to the gain in future consumption that people anticipate will result from that postponement. A structure of production view of the economic process yields several insights that unavoidably are hidden from a circular flow view. One is an appreciation of the significance of the interest rate as exerting an influence throughout the entire social structure of production. The interest rate is not merely the price of money, the price of loans, or of any other singular item or market. It is rather something that shapes the entire pattern of production within a society, and it speaks to how it is that the orientation of people within a society toward present and future is of great economic significance. This significance comes readily into the foreground in the traditional Austrian framework, but it comes close to vanishing within the circular flow notion of economic activity. Traditional Austrian macro started with conceptualizing an economic system as a structure of production and not a circular flow. A central feature of this conceptualization is that the activities of some enterprises are closer in time to the creation of consumer goods than are the activities of other enterprises. To be sure, this conceptualization reflects an objectification of the economic process. From the point of view of participants within the process, they operate inside a flow of activity where inputs enter a firm and outputs exit a firm. Market transactions are everywhere, regardless of how they might be placed within a structure of production. Yet recognition that there is a temporal pattern to the structure of production is the most valuable distinguishing feature of traditional Austrian theory of the system of economic interaction as a whole. It is a very short step from a structure of production to Hayek’s (1937, 1945) recognition that the knowledge that accompanies and propels economic interaction is never assembled in one mind or place but rather is distributed throughout the universe of economic activity.",8

Specifically, I address the concept of macroeconomic policy. Most economists, when thinking of macroeconomic policy, probably think of activities undertaken by some nonmarket actor, such as a central banker or fiscal agent, to influence familiar macro variables such as inflation or unemployment. While such policies fall under the scope of those considered here, I want to adopt a broader definition of macroeconomic policy. The definition I chose is any policy that proposes to influence directly a variable that, ontologically, is an emergent outcome of some social process. For example, inflation is not something that is immediately visible to an acting individual in the same way as, say, the price of apples is during a weekly trip to the grocery. Inflation is an example of a complex phenomenon—something whose existence that, while certainly real, must be inferred through theorizing, rather than apprehended by direct observation (Hayek 1967). The same is true of education, in the sense it is typically treated by many policy makers. Within a polity, a cross-sectional average describing the level of education, such as literacy rates or total years of schooling, attained by the public can easily be constructed. Measures can then be adopted to raise this number, due perhaps to perceived desirable causal effects between an increasingly educated populace and economic well-being. Such attempts fit the above definition of macroeconomic policy. However, it is obvious that underlying this average are the decisions of many, many individuals pursuing knowledge in ways deemed most effective given the local and particular knowledge of education-seekers. As such, there are an uncountable number of concrete educational strategies pursued by the public that would map on to a given ‘average’ level of education, however statistically constructed. It follows that any sort of exploitable relationship between average levels of education and economic prosperity (probably proxied by GDP, itself problematic for the same reasons) is chimerical—it is based on illusory correlations between variables whose very construction is an exercise in misplaced concreteness. In this sense, macroeconomic policy—attempting to manipulate emergent outcomes by directly acting on those outcomes, and ignoring the micro-level processes in virtue of which the emergent results have any meaning (Buchanan 1986)— is fundamentally incoherent. Before proceeding, I should make clear that the above claim rests on the adoption of a theoretical framework fundamentally different from that of mainstream economics. Wagner (2007b) usefully distinguishes between the paradigm of value and the paradigm of exchange as two lenses through which a social theorist can examine the social world. The value paradigm focuses on the formal implications of rational choice, informed by preferences and constrained by market variables, for the allocation of resources. In this sense, social outcomes can be modeled as equilibrium snapshots that directly follow from individuals’economizing behavior. Furthermore, these outcomes are of the same degree of complexity as the variables that inform the agent’s constrained optimization problem. A familiar example is representative agent modeling, where aggregate outcome variables are simply scaled-up versions of the variables that fall out of the representative agent’s constrained optimization problem. In contrast, the exchange paradigm focuses on the implications of trading activity within a given set of institutions, with resource allocation following as an emergent—and thus of a higher order of complexity—outcome of the social process within which agents act. In this paradigm, equilibrium snapshots are replaced by disequilibrium, or even non-equilibrium, processes that unfold over time. The adoption of this latter paradigm is the foundation of New Austrian economics, or what has been called by Wagner (2010) Neo-Mengerian economics. This stands in contrast to the Neo-Walrasian paradigm, adopted by the mainstream. I will not defend the adoption of the Neo-Mengerian paradigm here; readers interested in the relative merits, and ontological justification, of this paradigm should consult Wagner’s (2010) text. Instead I take this framework as my starting point, showing how its adoption renders conclusions that are familiar and unproblematic within the Neo-Walrasian paradigm to be untenable from the view of Neo-Mengerian social theory. I proceed in the remainder of this paper as follows: In Section 2 I briefly recapitulate the important distinction between micro-level and macro-level phenomena in the New Austrian paradigm. In Section 3 I consider a concrete example, NGDP targeting and free (laissez-faire) banking, showing how these proposals, which appear to be close substitutes from the perspective of mainstream macro theory, actually are significantly different from the perspective of New Austrian economics. In Section 4 I discuss a key theoretical result that follows from the previous two sections. This insight has been mentioned in particular forms by mainstream theorists, but its importance has not been sufficiently appreciated. In Section 5 I conclude by discussing the implications of the insights built in this paper for future New Austrian social theory.",1
30.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,09 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-016-0355-y,Dynamic coordinating non-equilibrium,March 2017,Santiago J. Gangotena,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Neo-Walrasian conceptualizations and DSGE models are incompatible with the emergence of coordination and discoordination in economic activity. These conceptializations of economic activity and the models they embody rely on the notion of equilibrium, a state in which all gains from trade given the institutional arrangments that govern exchange have been exploited. The strength of equilibrium as a tool for economic analysis is that it selects and constrains the state of an economic system at any given point in time. In other words it provides a solution concept that allows the theorist to characterize the outcome of economic processes. While many models that employ equilibrium as a solution concept can leave some gains from trade unexploited, these unexploited trading opportunities are due to underlying assumptions about institutional arrangements regarding information (or lack of information) possesed by participants, and the existence of markets (as in the case of models with incomplete markets) in which trading can take place, not from a failure of equilbrium to obtain. As such the resulting equilibrium assumes that all possible gains from trade that can be exploited, given the institutional arrangements governing exchange, have been exploited. The strength of equilibrium as a solution concept is also its weakness because by assumption it rules out the process of the emergence of coordination, and the possibility of discoordination. Unless one strictly believes that the world is everywhere and at all times in equilibrium such that all shocks to the system are exogenous, equilibrium tools are at best an approximation from which a large class of interesting and relevant economic phenomena are excluded. While many theoretical conceptualizations stemming from the Austrian tradition are capable of dealing with the emergence of coordination and discoordination, the process driven approach can be hampered by the use of equilibrium for the reasons stated above. In addition, verbal reasoning as the main tool of the Austrian tradition, is at best an imperfect substitute for formal models that seek to fully flesh out the implications of the different institutional arrangements that allow economic coordination (or the lack of coordination) to take place. Put another way, models are not theory. Theory consists of verbal reasoning which among other things specifies the correct conceptualization of the objet under scrutiny. Modeling instantiates, to borrow the language of computer science, those conceptualizations in a structure that allows conclusions to be drawn about the object under scrutiny. As I will argue below verbal reasoning is a poor substitute for formal models (and should rather complement them) especially when the object under scrutiny is the economy as an integrated whole. Neo-Walrasian conceptualizations are fundamentally incompatible with a process driven approach to economic phenomena because of the use of equilibrium. As such DSGE models are the best suited tools for the Neo-Walrasian paradigm. On the other hand adopting the rigour of DSGE tools is fundamentally incompatible with the process driven approach of the Austrian tradition. In what follows I will argue that process driven conceptualizations need to be complemented with formal models. In contrast to DSGE models I call these Dynamic Coordinating Non-Equilibrium models (DCNE). DCNE models consist of a class of agent based models (ABM) that follow certain guidelines to ensure their compatibility with process oriented conceptualizations. I will attempt to provide a novel justification for DCNE models, and lay out their relationship with respect to theory and empirical work. I then provide a structure that aids in the construction, and communication of such models, that is readily accesible to researchers both familiar and unfamiliar with agent based models (ABM). I will first attempt to elucidate the necessary link between tools and conceptualizations in order to motivate what follows.",1

Niles,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The problem that is before us is usually referred to by the catch-phrase gratuitous nature of credit. It is the chief problem in the theory of banking. Ludwig von Mises ([1953] 1971, 352) This purpose of this paper is to isolate and highlight Austrian thought on a key element of banking theory: gratuitous credit. Many of the disputes in Austrian banking and business cycle theory have at their root a fundamental disagreement about the nature of gratuitous credit. In order to resolve these subsidiary issues, the core issue must be addressed. Ludwig von Mises named it as the “chief problem in the theory of banking.” This paper will trace how Austrian banking theory has grappled with this problem, beginning with Mises himself. It will show that, instead of achieving a clear answer, Austrian theory has foundered on this issue, resulting in an unresolved incoherence in current Austrian banking theory that has split Austrian thought into various camps. The purpose of this paper is to crystallize and draw attention to this issue. It can point the way to resolution, but actual resolution is a difficult task that remains to be accomplished. Reintegrating these camps and putting Austrian banking theory in a position to credibly move forward first requires identifying this inconsistency. This paper is an effort in that direction. After first identifying what gratuitous credit is, as explained by Mises, this paper will trace how subsequent Austrian theorists took one side or the other on this issue and related sub-issues. Gratuitous credit is the problem that banks can and do periodically over-issue credit, resulting in boom and bust cycles. In their theoretical treatment of this banking issue, Austrians have vacillated on: the economic potency of gratuitous credit, whether it is a natural free market phenomenon, whether it requires, for its occurrence, a facilitating intervention such as a central bank, whether free banking institutions, such as the clearing mechanism, can rein it in, whether it requires a government intervention in banking to rein it inFootnote 1
 the economic significance of gratuitous credit - can it serve a productive role in the economy? These disagreements often put Austrians on the same or differing sides in surprising ways. For example, Friedrich Hayek and Murray Rothbard were on the same side in viewing gratuitous credit as potent under free banking i.e., as capable of causing a business cycle in a (fractional reserve) free banking context. As a result of this view, both men advocated government intervention to rein in the problem (see footnote 1). Yet, at the same time both men disagreed on the importance of the central bank in being a fundamental cause of the problem of gratuitous credit.Footnote 2 In contrast, Lawrence H. White agreed with Rothbard that the central bank is a fundamental cause of gratuitous credit. Yet, White and Rothbard disagreed on the efficacy of the clearing mechanism under (fractional reserve) free banking to prevent the problem (Selgin and White 1996). Table 1 summarizes the different positions taken by Austrian banking theorists on the constellation of issues that surround gratuitous credit. It categorizes them into five schools of thought, grouped by their positions on key issues. Each school of thought is identified by its principal leader(s) and seminal text(s) that mark a break from prior thought. The goal of this paper is to classify Austrian banking theory using the principal theorists who established new schools of thought. It does not aim to be a comprehensive catalog of every thinker in each school. The rest of this paper will explain those differences, referring principally to primary texts. It will cover Austrian banking theory from its first comprehensive exposition in Mises ([1934] 1971), which I call “Mises I″Footnote 3 and will end with the “Free Banking School” of White and Selgin.",4

The determination of the transaction price leading to execution is of little consequence to the process of equilibration. The only requirement for equilibration is that the transaction price lie between the bid and the ask price. The authors did not leave a role for the entrepreneur as they did not consider the impact of uncertainty and search costs on exchange and equilibration. Using an extension of the Sugarscape model (Epstein and Axtell 1996; Wilensky 1999), I consider the role of transaction costs in providing opportunities for entrepreneurs to earn profits in a world where each agent acts according to unique mental structures and under different circumstances. They act under conditions of asymmetric information and interpretation (Klein 2012). The existence of costs to finding a trading partner require the agents to adopt and test production and search strategies as well as parameter values that are part of these strategies. These would otherwise be unnecessary in a world absent costs of finding a trading partner. This increases the costs of trade relative to a world where agents can trade with one another without regard to geographic distance. Entrepreneurial agents discover profit opportunities by experimentation (mutation) where they adopt new strategies for production and exchange. These strategies, when they are successful, tend to be reproduced by other agents and thereby guide the market toward a dynamic steady-state that is akin to the static equilibrium of neo-classical theory (Kirzner 1973, 1997).Footnote 1

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Austrian theory of the business cycle, beginning with Mises (1953) and refined by Hayek (1966, 1935), is a monetary business cycle theory developed within the framework of monetary institutions at that time, when the world was on a gold standard. While recognizing the possibility of government-issued fiat money, Mises and Hayek show that monetary fluctuations can cause business cycles even when the monetary base remains unchanged.Footnote 1 Fractional reserve banking allows the money supply to expand and contract because of increases and decreases in banks’ desires to hold reserves rather than lend, even with a constant monetary base. During a boom, banks become more optimistic and less cautious, so they reduce their reserves and lend a greater fraction of their deposits, expanding the quantity of money and pushing down interest rates. Ultimately, Mises (1953: 365) notes, “…the moment must eventually come when no further extension of the circulation of fiduciary media is possible. Then catastrophe occurs…” Economic expansion slows, so banks become more pessimistic and more cautious, causing them to hold a larger fraction of their deposits on reserve, resulting in a contraction in the money supply and a rise in interest rates, even with a constant monetary base. The boom eventually leads to a bust, and some investment undertaken because of the monetary distortion of price signals during the boom proves to be unprofitable. That unprofitable investment caused by the monetary expansion is malinvestment. The Austrian business cycle theory depicts a lengthening of the structure of production as a result of lower interest rates during the boom, resulting in more investment in projects that are further removed from final consumption goods. Mises (1953: 360–361) says, “Now if the rate of interest on loans is artificially lowered below the natural rate as established by the free play of forces operating in the market, then entrepreneurs are enabled and obligated to enter upon longer processes of production.” When monetary expansion ends, resulting in a business cycle downturn, some of that lengthening in the structure of production proves unprofitable. In the Mises-Hayek model lower interest rates skew investment projects toward earlier stages in the structure of production, and there are good reasons to think that lower interest rates encourage such investment projects. Garrison (1986) provides a description and detailed defense of the Austrian business cycle model based on Hayek’s framework. The lengthening of the structure of production in the Mises-Hayek framework occurs because investors are lured into projects that appear feasible because the market rate of interest is below its natural rate which, following Wicksell (1936), is the rate that would equate the supply and demand for capital goods if capital goods were lent without the mediation of money. Malinvestment occurs because investors react to the temporarily lower market rate. Mises (1953: 355) says that “The money rate of interest and the natural rate of interest need not necessarily coincide… [but]… it is certain that the money rate of interest must sooner or later come to the level of the natural rate of interest.” When that happens, some investment that appeared profitable at the former money rate is revealed to be malinvestment. The analysis that follows builds on two observations regarding investor reactions to monetary factors affecting the market rate of interest.",5

Salter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The 2008 financial crisis, largely unanticipated by the economics profession, has resulted in a serious re-examination of business cycle theories in an attempt to discover what went wrong. One aspect of this re-examination is renewed scholarly interest in the Mises-Hayek, or “Austrian,” theory of the business cycle (ABCT). Several studies have located in Mises’s and Hayek’s writings on monetary theory and business cycles a potentially useful framework for understanding the financial crisis (Borio and Disyatat 2011; Caballero 2010; Calvo 2013; Diamond and Rajan 2009a; Hume and Sentance 2009; Leijonhufvud 2009)Footnote 1 Other studies, frequently not citing Mises nor Hayek, nonetheless contain themes that are easily reconcilable with those in ABCT narratives (Diamond and Rajan 2009b; McKinnon 2010; Meltzer 2009; Schwartz 2009; Taylor 2009). In this paper we analyze the discussion of the Mises-Hayek business cycle and its constituent parts. While other works have explored specific links between Austrian theory or theorists and mainstream work (e.g., L. H. White forthcoming explores Hayek’s influence on contemporary economics), we consider a number of broader points. What themes and mechanisms are being discussed? What themes and mechanisms are not being discussed? How do these studies deal with updates to the theory that has occurred since the 1930’s? And given the renewed interest in ABCT, how can that theory be put to work in answering pressing economic questions going forward? It is sometimes argued, informally, that whatever the Austrian literature has to contribute to the economics profession has already been incorporated into modern economics. However, if this is the case, why do prominent scholars turn to the old Mises-Hayek theory in search of answers where modern macroeconomic falls short? We think there are compelling reasons to review the recent references to ABCT and to point out some examples where gains from trade can be reaped between “Austrians” and “non-Austrians.” The next section of this paper contains a review of how current economic researchers are engaging Austrian business cycle theory. Section 3 is an assessment of this literature, in terms of what themes originally discussed by Mises and Hayek have been captured accurately, what has been captured inaccurately, and what has been overlooked. Section 4 discusses why the ABCT should be considered as theory with explanatory power. Section 5 summarizes the current literature on ABCT and the potential for ABCT as a progressive research project going forward and how it can contribute to the mainstream literature. Section 6 concludes.",29

Fuller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In a society where digital technologies are pervasive, few issues excite as much concern as does digital privacy. Governments’ own track records of digital privacy intrusion notwithstanding, a significant fraction of individuals believe that government regulation is the necessary solution to privacy risks. A “post-Snowden era” Pew Report (2014) finds that 80 % of American adults “agree” or “strongly agree” that “Americans should be concerned about the government’s monitoring of phone calls and Internet communications,” (Madden 2014). The same survey, however, finds that 64 % of respondents indicate government should do more to regulate digital advertisers (Madden 2014). This reveals a tension: the median American is fearful of government surveillance, but also tasks that institution with protecting him or her from unwanted digital privacy intrusion. Even in the early days of the Internet, Bibas (1994) reports that the legal status quo protected data privacy poorly and that the “predictable” American response was for a “law” and a “federal government agency” to assume the protective role. Laypeople are not alone in these opinions. Hoofnagle, a law professor and outspoken com- mentator on digital privacy topics, argues (Hoofnagle 2005) that the “[Federal Trade Commission] has to move into the twenty-first century and meaningfully address Internet privacy,” that “the FTC should abandon its faith in self-regulation,” and that “the FTC is certainly capable of protecting privacy online.” Similarly, Solove, a law professor and digital privacy expert, remarks that, “the market in privacy is not a well-functioning market...” (Solove 2004: 87). He, along with Hirsch (2010), concludes that regulation is necessary to correct the deficiencies inherent in the unhampered market. Using insights from the market process tradition in economics, I argue that calls for top-down regulatory solutions should be tempered by a full accounting of the costs which these regulations may impose. Other examinations of the costs of digital privacy regulation (Lenard and Rubin 2009) have focused extensively on the ways that these laws constrict the free flow of information. As Lenard and Rubin (2009) indicate, this focus is due to the economist’s preoccupation with the perfect competition model in which perfectly informed agents are the ideal. Though I also discuss the constriction of valuable information flows, I take a slightly different tact than authors such as Lenard and Rubin (2009) who have focused so extensively on that consequence of regulation. Kirzner’s conception of the entrepreneur and his extension of that type to analyze the effects of regulation on the market process provide the framework for my analysis. Market process theory has a tradition that emphasizes the “dynamics of interventionism” (Mises [1949, 1998]; Rothbard 1962; Kirzner 1985; Ikeda 2002; Ikeda 2005). As such, this analysis does not stop with the immediate effects of intervention, but seeks to trace its long-run, spillover impacts on other markets, industries, and actors. As this paper shows, digital privacy law generates perils by failing to provide an analogue to the market’s disciplinary corrective of profit-loss accounting, by stifling the market’s discovery process, and by creating superfluous avenues of discovery. Following Lenard and Rubin (2009), I examine regulations which curtail the collection and use of “nonsensitive information”–data which might be used to profile or identify an individual, but not information that could be used to gain access to the individual’s assets (credit card or social security information). Neither do I deal with laws restricting the use of personal information for the purposes of false representation. This would include, for example, obtaining an individual’s photo in order to impersonate them online. Privacy concerns that regulators commonly address and which are the focus of this paper include: the surreptitious collection of information by Internet vendors from visitors to their sites and the sale of that information to third parties. The justifications for this data collection are numerous, but common ones include the ability to target advertising directly toward interested consumers, to sell to third party data brokers, or to conduct market research on one’s customer base. Visions of a world where Internet merchants can accurately predict a consumer’s reservation price or where employers can discriminate based on health risks surmised by culling data from an applicant’s social media activity (two examples raised by Acquisti et al. 2015) may admittedly frighten the average Internet user.Footnote 1 Buchanan (2005) notes that many are “afraid to be free,” and this appears notably so on the Internet. Some prefer Buchanan’s “parental socialism,” desiring the state to impose privacy rules. Government-mandated digital privacy rules are not neutral, however, with respect to the workings of the market; as Kirzner (1985) argues, all intervention stifles and redirects the market process. As such, this paper suggests that digital privacy law represents an opportunity for economists who have traditionally focused their attention on more prominent examples of intervention–antitrust, tariffs, taxation, and the like. Opportunity-cost reasoning suggests that it is impossible to precisely quantify the impact of digital privacy laws; if anything, this makes a thorough examination of these costs all the more important. The paper proceeds in Section 2 with a literature review of the economics of digital privacy as well as a brief overview of the market process framework. Section 3 applies that framework to illuminate the perils of digital privacy law. Section 4 concludes with implications.",5

Some of these headlines in popular media outlets, such as The Atlantic, TIME, and Newsweek, include: “Synthetic Drugs Are Multiplying Too Fast for Regulators to Outlaw Them” (Khazan 2013), “Fentanyl-laced Heroin Linked to Dozens of Deaths in Northeast” (Jauregui 2014), “DEA Launches Nationwide Raid on Synthetic Drug Dealers,” (Kedmey 2014), “College Kids Are Unknowingly Rolling on Bath Salts” (Kutner 2015), and “Illicit Version Of Painkiller Fentanyl Makes Heroin Deadlier” (Bever 2015). In a short report published in 2014 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Bush and Woodwell (2014), in reference to synthetic drugs, note that “[m]anufacturers of these compounds have modified their chemical structures, sometimes only very slightly, to evade current laws and regulations to be able to continue marketing these products as ‘legal highs.’… Over the past 5 years, the DEA has identified more than 200 designer drugs… Designer drugs are drugs synthesized to be chemically and pharmacologically similar to illicit drugs in order to avoid DEA scrutiny” (2014: 1). However, fentanyl-laced heroin and surges in synthetic drug use are not new crazes. In February 1991, The New York Times ran an article, “A Potent ‘Designer’ Drug,” discussing how over 100 people died from overdoses related to fentanyl variants. The article briefly articulates how designer drugs emerge by slightly modifying the chemical structure of known drugs such that these drug producers are creating technically legal drugs. However, a discussion of the origin of this line of legal circumvention has been neglected as an explanation for the persistence of such dangerous drugs. This paper puts forth an explanation that present-day synthetic drugs and designer drugs emerged out of a process of induced ‘malnovation’ (a form of innovation focusing on legal circumvention) that originated in response to Title II, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (CDAPCA). From the policymaker’s prospective, this incentive to circumvent the law and innovate is unintended and “bad,” as it works against the broader goals of the policy to curtail illegal drug sales, use, and abuse. The intended goal of the CSA was to spread information regarding the public health issues associated with the use of various drugs, as well as create a definitive and comprehensive list of illicit and licit drugs categorized based on a variety of factors related to accepted medical use and potential for addiction. To allow for the potential for new, positive drug innovations, “malnovation” strictly refers to the new drugs that are deemed dangerous and harmful by policymakers. The goal of this paper is not to suggest that all drugs created after 1970 are necessarily more dangerous and less desirable than those created prior to 1970. Instead, this paper offers an explanation as to why such scheduling laws did not have the desired outcomes, as well as suggests that scheduling laws have made the drug problem in the United States, from the perspective of policymakers, worse than before. More specifically, this paper addresses how the structure of drug scheduling created new incentives for “clandestine chemists” (or as I will refer to them, “drug entrepreneurs”) in a way that previous laws did not. It also created the incentive for non-chemist drug entrepreneurs to bring to market drugs that might be produced in other countries, but are not illegal domestically. This categorization of malnovation refers to entrepreneurship at multiple levels of the illicit drug supply chain. The CSA aimed to create a black and white list of drugs that are illegal, addictive, and unsafe. Public health safety and the dissemination of relevant information were a priority with the implementation of the 1970 act. Each drug schedule category varies in medical value, propensity for addiction and dependence, as well as punishment rendered, but overall it has created a long list of all known drugs that have been and can be abused. This listing mechanism created several unintended consequences.Footnote 1
 Previous literature has addressed a variety of ways in which drug policies and prohibition have changed the incentives of economic agents operating within drug markets, often resulting in unintended consequences. Thornton (1991), by applying the Alchian-Allen Effect (1964) framework to illegal drug trafficking, shows that when drug traffickers face punishments based on the transported volume of drugs, they will decrease the transported volume of drugs and increase the potency in an effort to decrease the risk of detection and arrest in order to remain profitable. Becker et al. (2006: 56) suggest that under a regime in which drugs are illegal, drug producers that are better able to enforce contracts (that are otherwise unenforceable by courts) through means such as violence would have an advantage over other producers in a manner that would not exist if drugs were instead legal and drug production was curbed via taxation instead of prohibition. Prohibition policies, by creating enforcement costs and the additional costs of settling disputes, act as barriers to entry that concentrate market share to incumbent criminal organizations. Smaller, marginal illegal enterprises, on the other hand, are limited in their abilities to avoid law enforcement and facilitate illegal contracting through credible threats of violence. Furthermore, Becker et al. end their article by summarizing a substantial unintended consequence of drug prohibition policies: “Suppliers who avoid detection make huge profits, which provides them with resources to corrupt officials and gives them incentives even to kill law enforcement officers and competitors” (2006: 60). Supply-side restrictions, such as prohibition, create super-normal profits for successful drug entrepreneurs. Miron (2001) also investigates the relationship between drugs and violence. Miron finds insufficient evidence of drug use having an independent effect on violence, and he states that cross-country data show drug abuse and homicide rates to have a negative relationship (2001: 625–626). This gets to the root of a common misconception that drugs, as mind-altering products, beget the violence and crime associated with illegal drug markets. Instead, it is the illegal nature of the drug market that perpetuates violence and crime. Miron, like Becker et al., argues that because individuals operating in black markets are unable to settle disputes through the legal system, they may resort to violence to solve disagreements (Miron 2001: 618). His cross-country panel results “are consistent with other evidence that suggests an important role for drug prohibition in increasing the level of violence” (2001: 629). We can see from the previous literature how drug prohibition policies lead to unintended consequences such as increased potency, increased market concentration to criminal organizations, increased corruption, and increased violence. However, relatively little has been said in the literature about the unintended consequences that manifest through changes in the quality and forms of illegal drugs in response to policy changes. Furthermore, there are several of these unintended consequences specific to the CSA. Despite the intentions of policymakers to shift punitive measures away from drug users and onto producers, traffickers, and sellers and to approach the problem of addiction as a public health concern, the CSA did a massive disservice to users, addicts, and the general public. In fact, this type of legislation directly created a larger and more worrisome public health problem—the induced malnovation in drug markets. The primary interest of this paper is to articulate three specific unintended consequences of drug scheduling protocols in the form new, induced drug discovery. These consequences include new incentives for drug entrepreneurs to: find recreational uses of lower scheduled drugs, seek out and create entirely new or previously unscheduled drugs, and slightly modify the chemical structure of existing, scheduled drugs. Furthermore, this paper points out how drug control acts that aim to be comprehensive actually nullify the comprehensiveness of their plan because the passage of such policies incentivizes entrepreneurs in drug markets to superfluously discover new drugs that they can sell to circumvent the punishment associated with the new legislation, as well as use lower scheduled drugs in unintended ways to escape more severe penalties.Footnote 2
 Section 2 provides a detailed account of the Controlled Substances Act and subsequent legislation that is important to the progression of malnovation. Section 3 explains three forms of induced malnovation incentivized by the CSA. Each of the subsections will address a form of induced malnovation: The incentive for illicit drug entrepreneurs to innovate schedule II – V drugs such that they can be used to recreational purposes. The incentive for illicit drug entrepreneurs to chemically modify scheduled drugs such that they different enough and thus are not illegal (analogs and designer drugs). The incentive for illicit drug entrepreneurs to create new drugs that have not been scheduled or bring unscheduled drugs to the market, and are therefore technically not illegal. Section 4 highlights the secondary effects of induced malnovation in information dissemination within drug markets and the medical/treatment community, as well as offers concluding remarks.",8

By determining the interest rate on the financial market, the banking system or the central bank are said to be able to influence consumption, investment, and the external balance and thus to impinge on aggregate demand (Boivin et al. 2011: 374 ff.). Although it is generally acknowledged that the interest rate cannot and should not be manipulated at will, the idea that the financial market and the interest rate are themselves subject to real resource constraints, even in the short run, is only rarely emphasized. That there is such a real resource constraint which the monetary authorities should account for if they want to avoid a major economic breakdown has been argued most forcefully by the Austrian School since Ludwig von Mises formulated Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) (Mises 1912). While other schools of economic thought focus most of their attention on the nominal constraint caused by inflation in an overheating economy, the Austrian School’s business cycle theory views the problem as entrepreneurs lacking access to a sufficient number of real resources to complete their investments. This theory, although it temporarily spread from Vienna to other centers of economic theory like the London School of Economics (Robbins 1934), was largely abandoned after the Keynesian Revolution. Modern Austrian economists tend to argue that the marginalization of ABCT is due to ideological reasons: Keynes won the battle of business cycle theories in the 1930s because he offered policy-oriented solutions favored by politicians and applied economists. Yet even on a purely theoretical basis, however, there are good reasons to doubt the relevance of the arguments for the existence of a real resource constraint presented so far by the Austrian School. Not only do the several explanations provided by Austrian economists differ substantially (Braun 2012), but they also do not go beyond the stage of mere metaphors. There is no precise and comprehensive discussion of the resources that are supposed to constrain monetary policy and the consequent economic expansion in ABCT.Footnote 1
 The present paper has two goals. First, it locates and illuminates the limits and weaknesses of ABCT when it comes to pinpointing the relevant resource constraint. Second it reveals the still unexploited potential that lies dormant in at least some versions of ABCT. In accomplishing these goals, it concentrates on the role of the so-called “subsistence fund.” This concept, adopted by Mises ([1912] 1953) from Böhm-Bawerk ([1889] 1930), demonstrates best what the Austrians imply when they talk about resource constraints. It is also where they stop short in their analysis, and where there exist new starting points for a deeper discussion of the issue. It will become clear that the idea of a resource constraint on investment was relaxed even more in ABCT once the subsistence fund had been abandoned. In section 2, we track the historical development of the subsistence fund. We demonstrate that it served primarily as a basic metaphor or placeholder for a deeper analysis of the process that turns savings into investments. Section 3 presents the largely unsuccessful efforts made by Wicksell ([1898] 1936); Mises ([1912] 1953), and Strigl ([1934] 2000) to go beyond the metaphor and to integrate the subsistence fund as a real variable into economic theory, especially business cycle theory. None of them was completely successful, leading the subsistence fund to be abandoned even as a metaphor in the framework of ABCT, where it figured most prominently. In section 4, we demonstrate that this latter development is unfortunate for ABCT as it leaves it at a loss to explain why a boom should turn to a bust before hyperinflation sets in.Footnote 2 We argue that modern renditions of ABCT, especially those based on Hayek ([1935a] 2008]), refrain from implementing a meaningful resource constraint due to their abandonment of the subsistence fund. Although it barely emerged from the status of a metaphor, the concept of the subsistence fund at least hinted at what could be the cause of the upper turning point of the business cycle. For these two reasons, its omission must be seen as a step in the wrong direction taken by Mises, Hayek, and most of their followers.",2

Unlike traditional fiat currencies, Bitcoin allows for a stable supply of money while doing away with the need for a monopoly issuer of currency like a central bank, among other advantages. However, due to the strong presence of the dollar and other incumbent fiat currencies, it faces significant hurdles in order to gain widespread acceptance. This raises interesting questions about currency switching and whether or not it can take place spontaneously or not through the market process. For this problem is different than when money emerges out of barter. The emergence of money from a state of barter is commonly understood to be a case of spontaneous order (Menger 1892). Indirect exchange helps reduce the double coincidence of wants problem present in barter and is mutually beneficial to traders as it helps lower search costs and slowly leads to the emergence of money. But in the presence of a well-accepted medium of exchange, consumers as well as merchants would face higher search costs were they to adopt the new currency that is hardly used by any. While there are examples of a “switch” taking place in the presence of extreme inflation or by government fiat, this paper is concerned with the process and mechanisms involved in making a switch spontaneously specifically in the absence of such contingencies. For even if the new currency would prove to be superior, the question is why should rational actors begin to hold it or accept it as payment for goods if they are not sure they will be able to spend it later? Who would move first to the new money-network, and why would they do so? Shortly, the Bitcoin scenario is different to that of dollarization, where the residents switch away from their domestic currency to another already well developed network, that of the U.S. dollar. The bitcoin scenario poses a challenge of developing the network in the first place. In a recent article, Luther (2015) cites the costs of switching and coordination as major obstacles for bitcoin. In particular, he maintains that network effects favoring the status quo could prevent bitcoin from gaining widespread acceptance even if it is superior to incumbent alternatives. As such, he concludes “cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are unlikely to generate widespread acceptance in the absence of either significant monetary instability or government support.” He thus remains skeptical as to the widespread acceptance of bitcoin. In what follows, we argue that systematic mechanisms within the market process do exist and allow for spontaneous switching, even in the presence of strong network effects. Specifically, we note that (1) private non-network benefits, (2) entrepreneurial efforts to encourage coordination, and (3) the ability to use multiple currencies at once encourage the adoption of superior alternatives. For even in the case of money, the utility that a given user derives does not depend solely on the number of users in the network. There is still a certain amount of purely private net benefit that comes from using the new money, such as lower storage cost, lower risk of fraud, and lower transaction fees, regardless of the number of others using it or size of the network. Next, profit maximizing entrepreneurs play a coordinative role by creating opportunities for rational actors to maximize net private benefit of using the new currency and the ability to use the new currency (despite its small network) while keeping benefits of the old currency (large network size) allows for “switching cost” to be minimized. Section 2 of the paper provides a literature review of money and network effects. Section 3 provides a brief overview of Bitcoin as well as presents evidence to show the scale of its adoption as well as the role of two specific entrepreneurial firms (Bitpay and Coinbase) that can be credited for much of the current Bitcoin adoption. It provides a discussion of the role of the entrepreneur in producing a network switch. The concluding section provides some final thoughts on the role of entrepreneurial coordination in a theory of endogenous institutional switches and discusses room for further work along this line, specifically its applicability to other institutions such as law and the legal order.",21

Lucas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Homelessness has persisted as one of the developed world’s most visible social problems in recent decades. The rampant foreclosures of the 2008 financial crisis launched homelessness back to the political center stage. Casual observation suggested that over 20 years of federal involvement had done little to alleviate this problem. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2008 estimate tallied over 664,000 homeless nationwide, nearly doubling the agency’s 1984 estimate of between 250,000 and 350,000 (United States Department of Housing and Urban Development 1984, 2009). A new approach was needed. In the wake of the crisis, the United States federal government responded with a new large-scale initiative—Opening Doors: The Federal Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. Rooted in the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009, the plan is marked by both an unprecedented increase in funding for locally implemented homelessness programs and a dramatic reallocation of resources. The centerpiece solution is the Housing First model, where social workers offer short or long-term housing subsidization quickly and without preconditions rather than as an eventual step contingent on “housing readiness” (e.g., mental stability or addiction recovery).Footnote 1 Beginning with Tsemberis and Eisenberg (2000), a significant body of research has emphasized the efficacy of Housing First on both housing retention and cost-benefit margins (Culhane et al. 2002; Moore 2006; Gulcur et al. 2003; Perlman and Parvensky 2006; Tsemberis et al. 2004; Padgett et al. 2011, Stefancic and Tsemberis 2007; Goering et al. 2011). Adoption of the Housing First policy paradigm has coincided with significant centralization toward a national homelessness initiative as well as a dramatic increase in federal expenditures. As Fig. 1 details, federal targeted homelessness assistance hovered around $2.5 billion until the HEARTH Act in 2009; by 2014, spending exceeded $5.4 billion in adjusted 2011 dollars. The broader literature on homelessness has favored this expansion of the federal government’s response to homelessness (see, for example, O’Flaherty 2010; Byrne et al. 2014; Tsemberis 2010). Federal Targeted Homeless Assistance Expenditures Sources. Despite this literature’s promising findings and the good intentions of many working to end homelessness, researchers and policymakers have neglected many of the unintended consequences of this “evidence-based” initiative. This paper sheds light on the unobservable or unmeasured costs of this centralized approach to ending homelessness. I argue that federal homelessness policy under the Housing First approach 1) generates resource misallocation, 2) exacerbates the Samaritan’s dilemma, and 3) invites rent seeking. Federal targeted homelessness assistance decisions are largely informed on the basis of unreliable and misleading data, resulting in misallocation and crowding out of alternative service solutions. The Housing First model arguably worsens rather than alleviates perverse incentives facing potential recipients of homelessness aid via the “Samaritan’s dilemma,” the incentive that individuals face to alter their behavior in order to receive charitable benefits (Buchanan 1975). Finally, this new federal policy mandate effectively perpetuates a homelessness industry that receives concentrated benefits at the expense of diffuse taxpayers, creating a tension between the desire to end homelessness and the desire to continue and expand homeless programs via the federal budget. Researchers have addressed some of the unintended consequences of homelessness interventionism in the past. Tucker (1990, 1991) explores the mechanisms by which housing policies like rent control, zoning, and emergency shelter exacerbate homelessness.Footnote 2 Jencks (1994) argues that the explosion of emergency shelter in the 1980’s contributed to homelessness in that period (see also Culhane 1992). Troutman et al. (1999) find that the federal and local housing and homelessness programs of the 1980’s and 1990’s were ineffective at alleviating homelessness in metropolitan areas, citing perverse incentives facing the homeless and sheltered poor. All of these studies pertain to a policy paradigm characterized by the “linear” approach, where homeless individuals are moved from shelter to transitional housing to permanent (independent or partially subsidized) housing conditional on behavioral stability (e.g., addiction recovery or mental health counseling) (United States Interagency Council on Homelessness 2015).Footnote 3 Since 2009, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (henceforth USICH) has initiated a large-scale shift away from the linear approach toward the Housing First model, where the homeless are moved from the streets or shelters into permanently subsidized housing quickly and independently of perceived housing readiness. No systematic analysis of the political economy of this revised approach has been undertaken. This paper uses the definition of homelessness outlined by the Congress in its central homelessness legislation, the McKinney-Vento Act.Footnote 4 A person or family is considered homeless if they “lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;” sleep in a place not “ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings;” sleep in emergency shelter, transitional housing, or other temporary service housing; will “imminently lose their housing” and lack the resources to obtain new housing; or are youth or families without independent permanent housing over an extended period. The complete text of the federal definition is supplied in an Appendix. As this comprehensive definition suggests, a wide variety of situations and causes underlie modern homelessness in the United States. It is a phenomenon reported to affect over 560,000 people as of January 2015; dynamic estimates of indicate that several times this number experience homelessness over the course of a year. The two main forms of assistance under the Housing First model are permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing. Permanent supportive housing provides time-unlimited housing subsidization in new or existing units in addition to optional support services; individuals are permanently eligible for this subsidized housing and cannot be removed due to drug use or mental instability (United States Interagency Council on Homelessness 2016a). Rapid re-housing provides temporary housing subsidization to newly homeless individuals and families—also independently of behavioral or economic preconditions (United States Interagency Council on Homelessness 2016b). While individuals in emergency shelter are counted as homeless, individuals in permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing are not. The national Housing First bed inventory has risen rapidly over the past decade, totaling 47 % of all homeless program beds by 2015. When mentioning the Housing First model or “federal homelessness policy”, this paper refers principally to these two interventions.Footnote 5
 Robust political economy provides a framework that illuminates many of the complications inherent in an expert-driven, centrally organized effort to alleviate homelessness. Many forms of government intervention are justified on the basis of models that rely on “optimistic” assumptions. Robust political economy asks whether a system is workable under difficult (e.g., realistic) assumptions (Pennington 2010, Boettke and Leeson 2004a). Recently, robust political economy has been employed to analyze specific policy regimes within the mixed economic system, or what Mises called the third way (Mises 1930: 304). These include critiques of international development (Beaulier and Subrick 2006), antitrust (Voigt 2006), and central banking (Salter 2016; Paniagua 2016), among others. The framework is useful for exploring a policy initiative’s unique constraints by assessing two forms of alignment: 1) means versus ends (the “knowledge problem”) and 2) policy ends versus personal ends (the “incentive problem”) (Leeson and Subrick 2006). I employ the robust political economy lens to identify unseen costs arising from the new federal homelessness policy paradigm’s fragility to realistic constraints on knowledge and incentives. The paper proceeds as follows. Section two discusses how epistemic constraints facing government-led targeted homelessness funding result in a misallocation of resources. Section three analyzes the way Housing First exacerbates the perverse incentives of the Samaritan’s dilemma. Section four explores the rent-seeking implications of a federally sustained homelessness infrastructure. Section five concludes.",7
30.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,25 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-016-0346-z,Market process(es) and (un)knowledge,September 2017,Loïc Sauce,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Austrians usually (but implicitly) suppose that the unknowledge conception of the market process is a universal conception that can be equally well applied to the study of very different kinds of markets, from derivatives to airplanes, raw materials or cauliflowers (Lachmann 1986). Differences in terms of price flexibility and volatility, velocities of adjustment of different data, innovation pace, stability of demand, short- and long-term rigidity of the coefficients of production, and the like, between industries are generally neglected in the canonical Austrian theory of the market process. Yet, all markets and industries do not work in the same way. Some markets are incessantly harassed and jostled by entrepreneurial initiatives. On other markets, incumbents are firmly established for decades and almost immune from unexpected attacks. According to the Kirznerian theory of the market process, this quasi-immunity can only be explained by the fact that a unique producer obtained (by virtue of a previous entrepreneurial action or by virtue of a State intervention) an exclusive control over necessary inputs that block competitive entry into his field of activity. This analysis in terms of entry barrier is adapted to analyze monopolistic market structures. But monopoly is an extreme configuration among a continuum of market structures and we can doubt whether this framework exclusively focused on the accessibility to specific resources and barriers to entry is also adequate to answer the question: Why are some markets more jostled than others? Why is there a diversity of market processes? Lachmann is a notable exception in his recognition of the existence of several types of market processes. In his last book, The Market as an Economic Process (1986), Lachmann stresses the importance of disaggregating the highly abstract theory of the market process into a series of ideal types of particular kinds of markets (Vaughn 1994: 159). Some markets are dominated by merchants, while others are dominated by salesmen. Some markets exhibit almost perfectly flexible prices, while others exhibit quasi-fixed prices. There are different classes of holders of raw materials and resources with different functions and goals (an idea we can already find in one of his first papers, Lachmann and Snapper 1938). To understand these phenomena, Lachmann argues, the Kirznerian framework is too abstract and must be amended to increase its empirical content.Footnote 2
 Among the numerous factors that shape the environment in which the market process takes place, Lachmann singles out the heterogeneity of capital goods as particularly worthwhile. He forcefully remarks that ‘market processes involve the mobility of certain types of capital goods, others do not. To ignore such phenomena causing the diversity of market processes, where they matter, for the sake of obtaining a level of abstraction permitting us to speak of the market process would be quite wrong’ (1986: 3). Capital goods exhibit several degrees of inter-market mobility because capital goods are functionally heterogeneous and cannot be automatically shifted (or “reshuffled”) from one industry to another, or even between two firms belonging to the same industry. The range of substitutability of any capital good is not limitless. Thus, according to Lachmann, the only way to increase the explanatory power of the unknowledge theory of the market process is to integrate the theory of capital into the theory of entrepreneurship. In so doing, theoreticians would focus more on the way entrepreneurs exploit opportunities (the implementation and dismantlement moments of the entrepreneurial process) rather than on the way they detect opportunities (the alertness, or pre-action, moment of the entrepreneurial process). Lachmann’s noteworthy identification of capital mobility as an explanans of the diversity of market processes is completely in line with his early works on the theory of capital and with his conception of the entrepreneur as a creator/destructor of capital combinations (for comprehensive appraisals of Lachmann’s conceptions of entrepreneurship and capital, see Endres and Harper 2013 and Lewin 1997, 1999, respectively). According to Lachmann, entrepreneurship and capital belong together: ‘As long as we disregard the heterogeneity of capital, the true function of the entrepreneur must also remain hidden’ (1956: 16). The essential role of the entrepreneur consists in identifying new investment opportunities, detecting intersectional maladjustments, and filling the ‘holes in the pattern’ (ibid.: 10), that is, mismatches between supply and demand and misallocation of resources, by forming and dissolving combinations of functionally heterogeneous and specific capital goods to create complementarities, synergies, and value in a forward-looking plan of production (Foss et al. 2007). Lachmann defines the market process as a permanent reconfiguration of the ‘streams of service’ to which capital goods give rise (Lachmann 1956: 72). The primary purpose of the theory of the market process should thus be the investigation of the conditions under which the reconfiguration of these streams of service takes place, because the smoothness of the reconfiguration cannot be taken for granted once the heterogeneity of capital goods is taken into account. Nevertheless, even if the relationship between entrepreneurship and capital ownership/controlFootnote 3 is repeatedly underlined, Lachmann does not address the question of knowing if the types of capital assets combined by entrepreneurs (and notably the easiness of their redeployment) has an impact on the possibility for entrepreneurs to change smoothly the existing modes of complementarity of the capital goods combined (what Lachmann calls “capital regrouping”). However, it seems obvious that one cannot assert that the market process is a permanent shift in streams of services emanating from capital goods without inquiring how the shifts of capital goods are actually implemented. This absence is particularly surprising since Lachmann notices (1) that entrepreneurs are combiners of capital goods and (2) that capital goods have different degrees of mobility. The question “what is the impact of these different degrees of mobility of capital goods on the behavior of entrepreneurs” should thus logically follow. Indeed, if entrepreneurs are conceived as asset owners/controllers whose main economic function consists in reshuffling physical and financial capital between markets, it necessarily implies that the easiness of inter-market inflows and outflows of capital imposes a constraint on entrepreneurs to revise their plans of production by regrouping capital, to exit the market and to enter (or create) a new market. The readjustment process takes time. It is also costly (Bylund 2015a) and is probably more often discrete than continuous. What I call “reshuffling costs” are the economic counterparts of the easiness of redeploying specific assets. Reshuffling costs are neither capital losses, nor costs of failure, but the monetary costs incurred to solve problems by reshuffling capital goods and dismantling a particular capital combination. Reshuffling costs must be carefully distinguished from the ambiguous concept of transaction costs (Bylund 2011, 2015b). This concept is now a catch-all expression for economists (Klaes 2000). It was initially defined in a contractual setting at the micro-level as the direct monetary costs of using the price system. By contrast, in New Institutional Economics, the concept is applied to non-market settings to measure the comparative efficiency of alternative procedures of resource allocation, forms of governance and institutional arrangements (Williamson 1991). The way Williamson (1995: 250, Italics original) defines transaction cost illustrates the vagueness of the concept: ‘[transaction costs is] the ex ante cost of drafting, negotiating and safeguarding an agreement and, more especially, the ex post costs of maladaptation and adjustment that arise when contract execution is misaligned as a result of gaps, errors, omissions, and unanticipated disturbances; the costs of running the economic system’. To avoid ambiguities, I use the term reshuffling costs as the monetary counterpart of all economic and non-economic forms of frictions that impede voluntary exchanges and the conversion of specific assets into cash. The level of reshuffling costs depends on non-economic factors, such as technological constraints (transport costs, for example) or legal constraints (artificial entry/exit barriers, labor market regulation, costs to break contracts, and so forth), but also on strictly economic factors. As for any other market, the liquidity of the second-hand markets for capital goods determines the easiness of capital reshuffling and the associated costs. When second-hand markets for capital goods exhibit a low degree of liquidity (or simply do not exist), reshuffling costs may become prohibitive and even engender sunk costs that prevent entrepreneurs from regrouping capital. There are thus both exogenous constraints and endogenous market-based impediments to capital regrouping and both have consequences for entrepreneurship and the smoothness of the adjustment process. Note that reshuffling costs and sunk costs do not depend on the physical characteristics of a particular capital good, but exclusively on the liquidity of the second-hand market for this good. A capital good is not specific per se. It is specific only if the second-hand market for it is illiquid or does not exist. Thus, asset specificity is not a datum determined by physical characteristics, but a variable determined by market phenomena.Footnote 4 Note also that reshuffling costs do not appear because there is an unfavorable price differential between the price at which the entrepreneur bought the capital good and the retail price at which she/he can resell it or the cost to scrap it. Retail prices of the capital goods merely permit to compute if the cost of reshuffling is higher or lower than the cost of maintaining the same capital combination (that is, user cost). It also follows that reshuffling costs should not be counted as a cost of production, but as a cost incurred to change a capital combination: this is not the cost to implement a plan, but the cost to dismantle it. It is thus an ex post cost that entrepreneurs face when they want to change their initial plan, either because their initial plan was erroneous or because it can be improved (see Machaj 2013). Finally, note that reshuffling costs are not relevant for managers, but only for entrepreneurs, since they proceed from an entrepreneurial decision to change a plan in order to “set things right”.Footnote 5
 By introducing the imperfect mobility of capital, we can establish several empirical implications about the unfolding of the market process, as follows: At the microeconomic level of analysis, low liquidity of second-hand markets for assets can impede (or even make impossible) the entrepreneurial activity of ‘linking up different markets’ (Kirzner 1973: 124) via inter-market capital reshuffling. This negative impact on the intensity of entrepreneurship is not due to entry barrier (either artificial or not), but to economic costs to correct errors. The viscosity of capital regrouping makes harder for entrepreneurs to test new disruptive behaviors and to exercise their judgment to discover new attributes and new combinations of capital goods (Foss and Klein 2012) in order to “jostle” the routine ways of doing. If it is difficult for entrepreneurs to get rid of their capital goods, they would incur high losses (capital losses, as for any entrepreneurial error, plus reshuffling costs) if they try a new plan that proves incorrect. The incentive to introduce novelty and to make experimentation is thus greatly reduced, because both the cost of failure (capital losses) and the costs to solve the problem (reshuffling costs) are too high.Footnote 6
 From a more macroeconomic point of view, the viscosity of capital regrouping may have large short- and long term consequences since, as Lachmann himself recognizes, the trial-and-error entrepreneurial process of discovery of new attributes of capital goods by reshuffling capital is an important (but largely unpredictable) endogenous source of investment, growth, and total factor productivity: ‘All progress does not start with investment in new machinery, but often with thousands of entrepreneurs experimenting with, and in the process reshuffling, their existing capital combinations; or that in addition to the innovators and their imitators there are also those who try to go one better than those achievements they emulate, so that a new technique of production becomes modified and diversified in the very process of diffusion’ (1958: 100). 
Contra the canonical Austrian theory of the market process, we cannot suppose anymore that all industries will adjust in the same, supposedly smooth and continuous, way. Quite the opposite, we can expect that adjustments will be discrete (threshold effects), slow (important time-lag between change in market data and adjustment), and abrupt (in terms of job creation/destruction, for example) in a high reshuffling cost industry, while they will be quasi-continuous, frequent, fast, and smoother in industry with low reshuffling costs (the situation implicitly depicted by the Austrian theory of the market process). Considering the constraints of reshuffling costs on entry and exit, we can expect the market structure of an industry with high reshuffling costs to be oligopolistic with a suboptimal allocation of resources. This situation can be linked to path dependency as it is a necessary consequence of high reshuffling costs: if the plans implemented in the past cannot easily be dismantled, we can suppose that most of them will never be fully adapted to the evolution of the market. In terms of knowledge, industries with high reshuffling costs tend to become structurally transparent because of the stability of its market structure and the rigidity and predictability of incumbents’ behavior and slowness of adjustment. This point will be developed in depth in the next section. My analysis of the diversity of market processes puts second-hand markets for capital equipment at the center of the stage. Although Lachmann points out the importance of these markets for the dynamics of the economy, he never asked whether their imperfect liquidity can have consequences for the smooth working of the market process. There are many cases to illustrate how Lachmann gets through this issue. In his 1941 paper On the Measurement of Capital, Lachmann analyzes the role of second-hand markets in the valuation of capital goods. He points out that second-hand markets for industrial equipment usually do not satisfy the requirements of largeness, general accessibility and continuity over time to coordinate a large number of subjective estimates of capital. But, he adds, the inability of second-hand markets to provide a reliable valuation procedure for capital goods (and notably the most specific capital goods) is solved in practice with the modern methods of business accounting that can be regarded as an ‘institutional objectivation of subjective attitudes’ of valuation (1941 [1994]: 101). In this paper, Lachmann introduces second-hand markets in order to address an important topic of the theory of price, but he does not try to link it to the theory of the market process. Yet, beyond the valuation of capital goods, it was also possible for Lachmann to detect that the deficiencies of second-hand markets for capital equipment increase reshuffling costs and constraint inter-market flows of capital and are thus an impediment to the discovery/creation function of the entrepreneur. The way Lachmann treats second-hand markets in his paper Sir John Hicks on Capital and Growth (1966) is perhaps the most symptomatic. They are mentioned as an essential link between various sectors of the economy, but they are not considered as a potential source of difficulty for entrepreneurship, even if he concedes that capital reshuffling is usually not instantaneous and may have short-term (but not long-term) consequences: ‘Once we recognise, with our author [Hicks], the heterogeneity of all capital, we must also recognise that existing capital combinations have to be dissolved from time to time, as expectations change. Existing capital combinations will thus have to be “re-shuffled” at intervals which may, but need not, coincide with those between our “market days” by the discarding of some and the purchase of other existing capital goods, such as buildings, equipment, ships, etc. This second-hand market for certain kinds of capital goods provides another link between various sectors of the economy. But here of course there will be lags’ (Lachmann 1966: 121). Second-hand markets for capital goods are central for a production economy, but they are not seen as a potential source of difficulty, neither for the theoretician, nor for the daily decisions of businessmen, investors, and entrepreneurs. Similarly, in The Market as an Economic Process (1986), Lachmann recognizes that owners of capital may suffer capital losses if they are ‘unable to let their capital flow to greener pastures’ (Lachmann 1986: 17), but he did not investigate further what consequences such inability may have on the behavior of entrepreneurs. Constraints on inter-market flows of capital rigidify (or even make virtually irreversible) the production plans implemented. This has consequences for innovation and discovery. But it also has consequences for the knowledge held by entrepreneurs. Indeed, by stabilizing the number of existing incumbents, it strengthens their knowledge about each others’ behavior. The recurrence of interactions between well-identified producers help understanding their characteristics and increase the predictability of their strategies. For example, it becomes easier for incumbents to accurately predict the pricing, quality and marketing strategies or the elasticity of supply of their competitors, or to better understand their engineering process, cost structure, subcontractors, human resources management, and so forth.Footnote 7 What must be discovered to trigger and nourish the market process becomes commonplace for incumbents. Reshuffling costs are obviously not the sole determinant of the characteristics of the situation in which entrepreneurs act; nevertheless, they help shaping it.",1

OPR has many themes, and readers will disagree about which are most fundamental. I read OPR as an attempt to synthesize Rawlsian and Hayekian post-enlightenment liberalisms, thereby resolving problems these views pose for the other. Hayek provides reason to doubt that Rawls’s political theory can justify determinate principles of justice, whereas Rawls provides reason to doubt that Hayek has an adequate evaluative method, a way to ensure that the social order is legitimate. Briefly, Rawls is too confident in moral reasoning, Hayek too skeptical. OPR provides a resolution to both problems, and it is this resolution I want to assess. Let’s begin with Rawls. Rawls (1971: vii) saw his work as an attempt to “generalize and carry to a higher order of abstraction the traditional theory of the social contract” and to provide a theory of justice that is “superior … to the dominant utilitarianism of the tradition.” Rawls thought that the problem of identifying principles of justice for political institutions could be solved by converting it into a deliberative problem: “the question of justification is settled by working out a problem of deliberation: we have to ascertain which principles it would be rational to adopt given the contractual situation” (17). As readers well know, the deliberative situation is the original position model, which outputs justice as fairness and its two principles of justice. Fortunately, we need not review these details. Instead, I wish to draw readers’ attention to the reasons that Rawls recast his views between Theory and Political Liberalism in order to demonstrate the post-Enlightenment character of the later Rawls’s political theory. To understand the transition, recall that in Theory Rawls thought that the problem of political justification had two stages. The first stage is the original position. The less familiar second stage is an attempt to show that justice as fairness possesses inherent stability (498). Inherent stability is achieved when each person in a well-ordered society endorses justice as fairness as regulative of her behavior because she sees compliance with the demands of justice as fairness as a proper part of her good in accord with her “full deliberative rationality” (421). Rawls grew dissatisfied with his account of inherent stability because it assumed that citizens of a well-ordered society would agree on a common conception of the person and personal good. But a well-ordered society would tend to undermine inherent stability because members of the public would develop reasonable, but distinct conceptions of the person and diverse conceptions of the good. Thus, Rawls 2005: xv-xvi) claims that “the account of stability in part III of Theory is not consistent with the view as a whole” because “a modern democratic society is characterized not simply by a pluralism of comprehensive religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines but by a pluralism of incompatible yet reasonable comprehensive doctrines” Due to reasonable pluralism, members of a well-ordered society will not accept justice as fairness as regulative of their actions based on the social factors Rawls identified in Theory. Rawls constructed political liberalism to show that justice as fairness can be adopted from a plurality of reasonable points of view. In other words, the stability of justice as fairness rests on the formation of an “overlapping consensus” of reasonable comprehensive doctrines (133–172). Thus, in Political Liberalism, the two-stages of Rawlsian political justification are clear: first we develop a “political conception of justice” and then we check to see if the political conception can become the object of an overlapping consensus of reasonable comprehensive doctrines. If it can, then free and equal persons can treat each other justly in a legitimate and rightfully stable fashion. Political liberalism is a post-Enlightenment liberalism, then, because it bases the legitimacy and justice of the social order on the recognition that the free exercise of practical reason leads to systematic disagreement about matters of ultimate import. The problem of political liberalism is to determine how people who reasonably disagree can still live under institutions whose coercive power is justifiable from multiple points of view. As he was recasting his theory as a political liberalism, Rawls began to worry that reasonable pluralism engenders a second problem: reasonable pluralism about justice. He admitted that members of a well-ordered society would agree only on a family of liberal political conceptions of justice that share some common features. The burdens of judgment, the features of practical reason that lead to reasonable pluralism about the good, should “lead us to recognize that there are different and incompatible liberal political conceptions” (xlvii). Thus, for Rawls a society can be just, legitimate and stable for the right reasons if it is based on political conceptions of justice other than justice as fairness. Instead, a political order need only be regulated by “one of a family of reasonable liberal conceptions of justice (or a mix thereof)” (xlvii). Rawls still maintained that, for him, justice as fairness is the “most reasonable” conception of justice, but he admits that there are other reasonable views (xlvi). This is no small point. Rawls was so concerned by reasonable pluralism about justice that he claims that showing “how a well-ordered liberal political society is to be formulated given … a family of reasonable liberal political conceptions of justice” is “another aim” of Political Liberalism. In sum, the fact of reasonable pluralism forces two changes on Rawls: the admission that stability cannot be based on a shared “comprehensive doctrine” and that justice as fairness is not the only reasonable liberal conception of justice. Gaus will press reasonable pluralism further still, but let us motivate further concern with reasonable pluralism by drawing on Hayek’s critique of Enlightenment reason. This critique poses a severe threat to Rawls, as it threatens our capacity to select a discrete, manageable, publicizeable set of overarching principles of justice. Hayek (2007: 102) argued as early as 1944 that at least one of Rawls’s burdens of judgment, disagreement about the weight of moral values, will lead to reasonable pluralism. As Hayek notes in The Road to Serfdom, even the “scales of value” of rational and moral persons “are inevitably different and often inconsistent with each other.” But we can productively read Hayek as developing his own, more radical, account of the burdens of judgment. Hayek (1952: 16) understands the mind as a system of rules that organize subjective percepts in cognitively unique ways. The mind itself is “a particular order of a set of events taking place in some organism and in some manner related to but not identical with, the physical order of events in the environment.” The result of this structure is that different minds will map the world differently such that their knowledge of the world is inevitably subjective, limited and dispersed. Hayek’s famous “abuse of reason” project rests on these ideas, since social scientific inquiry must begin, …from what men think and mean to do: from the fact that the individuals which compose society are guided in their actions by a classification of things or events according to a system of sense qualities and of concepts which has a common structure … and that the concrete knowledge which different individuals possess will differ in important respects (Hayek 1979: 57). Consequently, solving social problems is limited by insuperable complexity, given that “the number of separate variables which in any particular social phenomenon will determine the result of a given change will as a rule be far too large for any human mind to master and manipulate them effectively” (73). Human cooperation can only proceed on the basis of “common acceptance of formal rules” that themselves have not been rationally constructed (163). Hayek’s critique of reason heaps more reasonable pluralism on the Rawlsian plate. Hayek’s emphasis on the diverse and dispersed nature of moral reasoning gives us sufficient reason to doubt that we could even agree on a set of reasonable liberal political conceptions of justice. After all, given that persons’ moral perspectives are radically situated in their environment, it is hard to see why their theories of justice should not vary much more widely than Rawlsians suggest. Further, we have strong reason to doubt that we could properly publicize the institutionalization of a single set of principles because there are powerful barriers blocking our ability to determine what others’ reasons are. Given the diversity of personal perspectives, reasons for action will be specific to each agent’s unique epistemic circumstances. Even knowledge of persons’ reasons will be difficult to acquire, much less whether the totality of their reasons favor one set of principles of justice over another. If Hayek’s theory of mind and society is correct, the prospects for Rawls’s post-Enlightenment liberalism are dim. The success of political liberalism depends on delineating a family of reasonable liberal political conceptions and making sure that the conception a well-ordered society converges on can become the object of “full publicity” (Rawls 2005: 67). Under radically situated and subjective cognitive conditions, members of the public will likely be unable to complete either task, even if they are as careful, knowledgeable, and moral citizens of a well-ordered society. We may now put Hayek in the hot seat. A common worry about Hayek’s political theory is that his skeptical, evolutionary epistemology is in tension with the political reforms he defends. John Gray (1984: 139) brings this tension out as a conflict between the “rationalist” and “skeptical” aspects of Hayek’s thought. On the one hand, Hayek thought we could critique social policy, but on the other hand, he emphasized the limits of our knowledge. In Gray’s terms, there is an uncertainty in Hayek’s thought “as to the relations of tacit knowledge with theoretical insight in political life.” This tension is present in Hayek’s moral theory. As I understand him, Hayek, like Rawls, endorsed a sort of Kantian contractarian test for the legitimacy of a social rule or law (Gray 1984: 56–78; Sugden 1993: 411–422). In other words, those legal rules are legitimate that “command general assent” (Hayek 1978: 15) and that survive Kant’s test, which we employ by “asking whether we can ‘want’ or ‘will’ that such a rule be generally applied” (28). Hayek believed that the consistent application of the test of Kantian assent will “amount to a test of compatibility [of a rule] with the whole system of accepted rules.” In other words, while the Kantian contractarian test cannot assess the system of moral rules as a whole, it can bring them into alignment and organize them into a hierarchy if used iteratively by testing each rule in sequence (24, 29). The problem for Hayek’s test, as any Rawlsian will point out, is that it is indeterminate. Rawls recognized early in his career that a simple Kantian test like Hayek’s would generate indeterminacy. Consider Rawls’s argument for the veil of ignorance: The restrictions on particular information in the original position are, then, of fundamental importance. Without them we would not be able to work out any definite theory of justice at all. We would have to be content with the vague formula stating that justice is what would be agreed to without being able to say much, if anything, about the substance of the agreement itself (Rawls 1971: 121). Hayek (1978: 132) gestures at informational restrictions, such as his significant but seemingly throwaway remark that “the most desirable order of society [is] one which we would choose if we knew that our initial position in it would be decided purely by chance.” But he merely gestures. Accordingly, we have no method of generating determinate recommendations with the Kantian test, as too many alternatives will pass it. The problem is compounded by Hayek’s emphasis on tacit knowledge, since the information needed to determine whether a rule is acceptable or superior to another rule is hard to come by. The Rawlsian critique of Hayek, then, is that his emphasis on dispersed, tacit knowledge renders his own test indeterminate; Hayekian reason cannot tell us which rules are justified. All Hayek can do is to provide us with a method of rejecting a certain subset of moral rules. He has not told us which rules are best or that can justifiably be imposed on all persons. Granted, the Hayekian will appeal to the principles defended, say, in The Constitution of Liberty and volume 3 of Law, Legislation and Liberty. But the Rawlsian will claim that Hayek has only provided us with rules that work best, not rules that are morally justified. Hayek may give us reason to think that certain political practices will bring about more welfare than others, but he has given us a poor test of which political practices have a bona fide moral justification that make these practices authoritative. Hayek and Rawls pose problems for the other. Hayek compounds the sources of reasonable pluralism, demonstrating that Rawls’s political liberalism cannot overcome critical epistemic hurdles. Rawls would likely counter that Hayek’s test is too formal and indeterminate to evaluate whether social rules are justified or not. Both Rawls and Hayek want an evaluative test for our moral and legal practices, but neither has succeeded. It appears that we need a new Kantian test, which OPR provides.",2

Munger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Kant’s invocation of “public reason” seems paradoxical. On one hand, the freedom that enlightenment requires must allow any argument to be made, and so to be heard. But Kant himself placed strict limits on the form of arguments, and motivations for arguments, that can be allowed to be advanced as moral justifications. The society must be allowed to argue about any subject, but some arguments are out of order. Who determines what amendments are in order and which cannot be considered? On first glance, Kant appears to be thinking…of himself. And maybe a few other really smart people, identified as being smart because they make the sort of arguments that smart people make: “[B]y the public use of one’s own reason I mean that use which anyone may make of it as a man of learning addressing the entire reading public.” (Kant, 2010: 3). But this would be a tendentious reading. Kant is actually thinking of standards and justification that the community over time has come to endorse. The advantage of this approach is obvious: “men of learning” only make the sorts of arguments that would be allowed in an informed debate that accepts cultural truths and respects norms that learned people would all agree should be respected. Gaus (2011) is an extremely important book, one that takes seriously the problem of “public reason” for the purposes Kant laid out. After all, Kant claimed that this “spirit of freedom” was spreading fast, and that “Men will of their own accord gradually work their way out of barbarism so long as artificial measures are not deliberately adopted to keep them in it” (Kant, 2010: 9). But Gaus wants to argue that the origins and constraints on public reason can be decentralized, and that cooperation can emerge out of public reason in a way that really will allow societies to “work their way out of barbarism.” Gaus’s process of decentralized emergence of agreement over norms and goals is surprisingly isomorphic with Hayek’s claims about the process of decentralized emergence of agreement over the values of resources in an economy using the price system. No one individual in an economy knows enough to be able to value all resources and thereafter direct them toward higher-valued uses. But the unfettered market system, “so long as artificial measures are not deliberately adopted” to prevent price adjustments, will adjust toward an aggregate summary of the subjective assessments of values held by all the individuals in the society. We don’t have to agree on “value,” because we can agree on a “price.” If your value of the object is greater than the price, and mine is less, you may well want to buy it from me, and I’ll be happy to sell it. Our agreement is on the mutual benefit resulting from that transaction. Our disagreement about subjective value is actually the source of the gains from trade: we disagree about a value, so we have good reasons to agree on a price. What is the analogue to the market as a process for yielding subjective truths for public reason? The heart of Gaus’s project is to ask “whether free and equal persons can all endorse a common political order even though their private judgments about the good and justice are so often opposed.” (Gaus 2011: 2). In other words, given the initial disagreement, is there an institution that will lead to mutual benefit and cooperation in a justified moral system, as the disagreement over value leads in markets to an agreement over price? The analogy to market equilibrium is important because, as in the convergence to public reason, the mechanism used to animate convergence in general equilibrium theory—the “Walrasian Auctioneer” (Walras 1877, 1899) –gives an “as if” role to human agency. I will argue that Gaus needs an analogous sentient human actor—the “Kantian Parliamentarian”—to make his system converge to workable “public reasons.”.Footnote 1
 For Hume, and then for Hayek, the process of emergence of laws (as opposed to legislation) is based on trial and error, using as a selection mechanism the relative prosperity and success of groups who organize their societies using just those rules. Other groups might mimic the good rules, or the good rules might win out through expansion of territory or prosperity. But the important thing is that the (ex post) good consequences could not have been known in advance because of pervasive ignorance and dispersed knowledge. Gausian public justifications are known in advance, and in fact must be justified in advance by reason. But the society can’t proceed without information necessarily unavailable to it. Vallier (2011) called this problem “the indiscernibility of justificatory reasons.” No one individual has enough moral knowledge to be able to do what public reason requires if it is going to work as Gaus proposes. For an outcome to qualify as a fully justified public reason, the society must solve a large-scale coordination problem with many independent agents who have never met, have different information and different experiences, and who disagree about both ends and means. Gaus is clear about how the equilibrium—once chosen—can be policed by social opinion and disapproval. The problem is not mutual authority but dispersed authority. Once a society of free and equal persons has coordinated on specific moral rules and their interpretation, the point of invoking moral authority is to police this equilibrium selection against “trembling hands”—individuals who make mistakes about what rule is in equilibrium—and those who otherwise fail to act on their best reasons. In these cases the overwhelming social opinion concurs in criticizing deviant behavior. An individual who violates the social equilibrium will not simply be able to check demands on her, for she will meet the same demand from almost all others. In Mill’s terms, the deviant will not simply confront the opinion of other individuals but of “society.” (pp. 47-48; emphasis added). The problematic assumption is italicized. How does this initial coordination take place, and by what rules, if we have not yet agreed on rules, and know that we disagree? We cannot simultaneously have (1) a set of moral intuitions in a society arrived at by some essentially random historical process and therefore justified ex post; (2) a publicly justified justificatory reason arrived at using a priori reasoning; and (3) a societal judgment that will police deviants who disagree. The problem is that societal judgments are actually derived from traditions, and defend traditions. If these traditions are optimal, then all is well. But “optimal” is a high standard, and in any case the needs of society are dynamic, so that optimality if it exists is evanescent. How can a large group of people preserve good rules and yet move to better rules if deviance is punished? Gausian public reason requires that public justifications be more rationally or epistemically accessible to members of the public than can reasonably be expected, given how the dispersed nature of reasoning makes it extremely hard to reconcile or even discuss. I will argue that to make this work one needs an additional actor, the Kantian Parliamentarian, to police both the original equilibrium selection and subsequent resolution of disagreements at the stage of convergence, ruling certain claims out of bounds. To see how this might work we must first examine the use of the “Auctioneer” in economics, to understand the analogy.",1

Boettke,Rosolino A. Candela,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Gerald Gaus has produced a “big book” and not just in terms of sheer size, but in terms of the fundamental issues addressed and the literature he employs. Prior to the twentieth century, the field of economics was part of the broader discipline of moral philosophy. At the time it was simply known as political economy. But writers in the field contributed not only to our technical understanding of value theory, capital, and production theory, and the theory of economic development, they also tackled questions in ethics, epistemology, political theory, and even institutional design. Consider the writings of figures such as David Hume, Adam Smith, and J. S. Mill. By the time economics emerged as a separate discipline with Alfred Marshall, the sort of broad questions that were given equal weight by Hume, Smith, and Mill were increasingly put in the background and the technical details of economic analysis moved to the foreground. Questions of background and foreground in analysis too easily lead to situations where what is in the background tends to be not only de-emphasized, but forgotten. Thus, the sort of analysis of the Scottish moral philosophers and the British utilitarians that recognized man as he is (an imperfect creature) and the imperfect world he occupies (we live in a world of scarcity and with imperfect knowledge) gave way to proofs and theorems. For mathematical tractability reasons, many of the imperfections of man and the world he occupies had to be minimized. Instead of the strictures of critical reasoning, the striving for sound logic, and good argument guiding the economic theorist, theory construction was now a game of mathematical model building where logical validity was the only check, and the testing of the propositions for their relevance to the world of affairs would be done through a separate intellectual act of sophisticated statistical analysis. In this climate is it any wonder that economics became increasingly divorced from philosophy? Gaus tackles this from the other side, and finds fault in the philosopher’s excess of abstract theorizing from ideal conditions. So in some sense, the twentieth century was a flight from reality and a retreat into the abstract in both the social sciences and the humanities. From the economic point of view, there were some bold thinkers who refused to follow the trend – for our purposes here we will just list Hayek, Buchanan, and Sen as the primary examples, though perhaps only Hayek came the closest to fully escaping ideal theorizing. As caricatures of the ideal theorists in economics and philosophy we would mention Arrow and Rawls. The very invoking of these names should focus the reader immediately on the tensions in our narrative – for it is not a simple story. Arrow was deeply concerned throughout his writings with questions beyond a technical nature in economic theory, and Rawls as well thought his political philosophic efforts were not limited to worlds devoid of human frailties. But in both cases, a reasonable argument can be made that the theoretical efforts of Arrow and Rawls fails to address the problems we must address in dealing with flesh and blood human beings; fallible yet capable creatures, who despite their differences with one another must somehow stumble upon rules of social intercourse that enable them to live better together than they would apart. As we read Gaus’s tome, this is his great achievement. He successfully marshals arguments and evidence from the social sciences (economics, politics, psychology, etc.) to address fundamental questions in the humanities (nature of freedom, the ‘good society’, etc.). Gaus is writing a philosophical treatise, so it is different in nature and scope than say Deirdre McCloskey’s similar efforts in The Bourgeois Virtues (2007) and Bourgeois Dignity (2010). In McCloskey’s work, she informs us that we cannot answer empirical questions philosophically. As a result, she goes to the social sciences and the historical record to address the questions concerning the fundamental determinants of human well-being. Gaus, on the other hand, is asking a different question --- what rules that bind behavior can we publicly justify that also enable us to live with one another despite our differences and to realize the great gains from social cooperation? In stating the puzzle in this way, Gaus is able to show that our moral intuitions do not always align with the moral demands required for us to realize peaceful cooperation and productive specialization. Our moral intuitions too often impute to us a moral authority over others that cannot be publically justified. The moral demands required of us actually pare down the claims we can make on others and limit the justifications of coercion we can actually make. In making his case, Gaus relies on both evolutionary arguments and social contractarian arguments. This, again, is to us one of the strong suits of Gaus. He blends political philosophical traditions together in a way that most interpreters refuse to do. Somehow, Locke, Hume, and Hobbes all get to contribute to our understanding of morals and public authority, as well as their modern representatives in Nozick, Hayek, and Buchanan. Gaus’ central motivation in this work is the following: “can the authority of social morality be reconciled with our status as free and equal moral persons in a world characterized by deep and pervasive yet reasonable disagreements about the standards by which to evaluate the justifiability of claims to moral authority?” (p. xv). He defines social morality as “rules that we are required to act upon and which provide the basis for authoritative demands of one person addressed to another” (p. 1). Stated differently, social morality refers to “the set of social-moral rules that require or prohibit actions, and so ground moral imperatives that we direct to each to engage in, or refrain from, certain lines of conduct” (p. 2). In establishing a social morality and then institutionalizing it in political and legal structures, we must not only account for our imperfect nature on both sides of that intellectual exercise, but also to account for the relationship, if any, that exists between ethics and the political/legal order. Modern ethics and political philosophy render foundational priority to one’s relations to other individuals, or as Gaus would describe the relationship, as primarily concerned with “whether free and equal persons can all endorse a common political order even though their private judgments about the good and justice are so often opposed.”(p. 2) As a social being, how we account for the relationship between ethics and the political/legal order depends significantly not only on one’s relations with others, but also ultimately of how individuals choose to live their own life. It may not simply be that the ethical order of “social morality” is reducible to the political/legal order. They may be related yet distinct from one another, such that individuals can have moral obligations that are both morally and legally binding and other obligations that are morally binding though not necessarily legally binding (Rasmussen and Den Uyl 2005, p. 85). If so, this leads to us to ask the following question: can there be any principles by which to differentiate those ethical norms that concern the political/legal order from those that concern only the moral?Footnote 1 If so, does this suggest a deeper ethical foundation that underpins the institutional conditions of “social morality”? To answer this question, we will draw from the ethical implications of the socialist calculation debate for a liberal market order (Kirzner 1988). These ethical implications are drawn from what Israel Kirzner regards as “ethical by-products” that emerge from the entrepreneurial market process. Following this Kirznerian insight, we argue that such ethical by-products that emerge from rational economic calculation have two implications for social morality in times of moral disequilibrium. First, that the demands of social morality require a deeper moral foundation for its justification. Secondly, the failure to make a distinction between the institutional prerequisites for individual human flourishing and those for social morality assumes away the problem that Gaus is attempting to resolve, namely how autonomous individuals converge on “rules that are actually followed by its members and so form a basis for an ordered and cooperative social life” (Gaus 2011, p. 179).",1
30.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,09 August 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-016-0358-8,Social morality and the primacy of individual perspectives,September 2017,Gerald Gaus,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"I am especially grateful to the Review of Austrian Economics for this opportunity to reflect on themes in, and questions about, The Order of Public Reason (OPR) more than five years after it was published. It is gratifying to know that anyone is still interested in the book, and it is especially gratifying to know that those who, like me, appreciate the brilliance of Hayek are still interested. It is also welcomed since, at this point, I am able to stand back and better appreciate how readers view the book. I can now better see what worked well and, well, what did not. I hope it is not a sign of sheer hardheadedness, but I remain convinced of the core claims of the analysis. I now, however, see different ways to put some of the points — ways that I think help avoid interpretations the text may bear, but which I think lead in wrong directions. OPR sought to challenge many of the presuppositions of ethics and social philosophy, yet employed many of the tools (“deliberative models”) and concepts (“public justification,” “self-legislation,” “moral authority”) of moral and political philosophy to do so. My audience was primarily philosophers of social ethics and political philosophy, and I self-consciously sought to stress the way my view was continuous with some of the core philosophical traditions — especially Kantian, contractarian, and Rawlsian. I believe this was accurate, necessary and helpful for wider understanding, but it also tended to invite readers to think the view was more Kantian, or more Rawlsian, than it is. It is certainly far more Hayekian than Kantian or contractarian, as Vallier shows. This journal is the perfect forum to stress this point. It is thus especially useful for me to reflect on the interpretations advanced by these three excellent essays, by Peter Boettke & Rosolino Candela, Michael Munger and Kevin Vallier, and see if I can reframe some of these matters in helpful ways, and then see where the conversation might lead. The three essays present variations on a common theme: I need to embrace more extensive commitments than OPR acknowledges. Boettke and Candela suggest a deeper ethical foundation, Munger insists that the analysis supposes a “Kantian Parliamentarian,” and Vallier argues that the problem of “global” justification may call for devices such as a civil religion. In my estimation these proposals lead to places that I do not wish to go — nor should anyone devoted to core Hayekian insights. As I stress in my recent The Tyranny of the Ideal (2016), the guiding aim is to sketch a framework of moral accountability and cooperation that makes room for the widest possible diversity of moral views, yet which all can see as supporting moral claims on each other in a system of cooperation. Consequently, the goal is to show how a diversity of moral views can lead to a cooperative social morality while abjuring as far as possible “external” moral claims — claims that do not derive from the perspectives of cooperating individuals. The diverse individual moral perspectives, and what they understand as normative, must be the real engines of social normativity. The importance of this was not sufficiently stressed in OPR, though I certainly thought it. I distinguished there two perspectives, that of philosophical reflection and that of real moral agents (OPR: 266), but this fundamental distinction is underdeveloped. The critical idea was that the normative basis of our shared morality is to be grounded not in the “Archimedean perspective” (Gauthier 1986, 233; Gaus and Thrasher 2016) that reveals correct principles of morality independent of the perspectives of those in a practice of social morality. OPR seeks to avoid appeal to any such transcendental source of moral claims and demands. The “normativity” that exists in a system of social morality comes from the normative commitments of the participants. Yet OPR is, after all, a work in moral and social philosophy, and develops a theory of a justified social morality. The claims of OPR itself are made from a philosophical or theoretical perspective, which takes up issues that are, as it were, about the nature of social morality but not in it. In itself this is not unusual, being characteristic of many theoretical studies in the social sciences and humanities. Economists, for example, seek to better understand the features of systems of consumers and producers — features such as supply and demand and the division of labor — that the participants did not intend to produce and with which they may well be uninterested. This idea is also the core of Hayek’s (1988: 6) analysis of morality: “To understand our civilisation one must appreciate that the extended order resulted not from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from the unintentional conforming to certain traditional and largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection ….” Like Hayek, OPR understands social morality as undesigned, arising out of individual intentional moral decisions. Thus it asks, given the normative commitments of individuals holding a certain array of normative views, under what conditions can an entire system of individual interactions reach a moral equilibrium on some rule R, such that R provides all with shared empirical and normative expectations and grounds a practice of accountability — always from the normative view of each and every participant? In understanding OPR, then, it is critical to keep the two perspectives distinct. The system of interactions based on diverse individual perspectives gives rise to a social morality; the philosophical perspective (the perspective we theorists take up), studies and then tests the system, drawing on concepts such as moral accountability and public justification. The normative task of the philosophical theory is to show that ideas like social cooperation, moral accountability and public justification are attractive and powerful at the philosophical level, so that critical observers will employ these concepts to judge the system. This results in an important, but much more modest role, for the “moral point of view” than in most moral and political philosophy — from Kant to Rawls, from Smith to Sen, from Locke to Nozick. In these traditions almost all normative results derive from the proper specification of the philosophical, “objective,” view which in some sense leaves behind, or radically abstracts from, individual perspectives, and then constructs true morality from some favored position. We might say that on this more traditional view the philosophical perspective is the fountainhead of our knowledge of morality. OPR certainly does not reject the moral point of view; some notion of objectivity is critical to all moral thinking. According to OPR the moral point of view is a perspective you and I as critical observers take up when we ask “Does this moral rule merit our endorsement? Does it pass the test that shows it to be acceptable or is it based on oppression, ignorance and false consciousness?” The system of individual perspectives generates a social morality, but moral agents always have the ability to reflect on it. Only once we have a theory of the unintended system of social morality can we do this; the point of having a philosophical perspective is to allow this sort of evaluation. Here, perhaps, OPR departs from Hayek, or at least some of the more extreme remarks in The Fatal Conceit (1988: 68 ff.) where he suggests such reflection can get little grip, as no theory can sufficiently understand the normative system. OPR rejects both the philosopher who would legislate morality from her philosophical theory, and the quietism that says we must accept the morality that has evolved. In this essay I wish to stress the primacy of the individual normative perspectives in generating social morality; this will motivate why I think the urge to embrace deeper commitments should be resisted. Rather than going over the presentation in OPR to emphasize the individual viewpoint, I shall sketch a modest recasting of the analysis in terms of models of individual moral interaction. The aim is to keep our eye on the primacy of the individual perspective, and see just where the philosophical perspective enters in. As we do that, I believe that many of the queries and concerns of these three insightful essays can be addressed more clearly. I make no attempt to show that all of what I say here can be translated into the language of OPR, though I believe that there are no significant alterations in content.",1

Instead, he sought to create a general intellectual framework by which to evaluate current and future constitutions in different nations. As ever, his general approach stressed the limited role of government and the importance of private institutions. At every key juncture, he relied heavily on a mix of constitutional theory, legal history, and general economic analysis to defend that central thesis. One can admire Hayek’s earnest mastery of the material that he discusses. But at the same time, the limitations of his overall framework become apparent in a closer reading, which is perhaps why in the long run this book has enjoyed a less profound influence on intellectual discourse than The Road to Serfdom that preceded it, and the three-volume Law, Legislation, and Liberty that followed it. In order to make some overall assessment of The Constitution of Liberty, I shall proceed as follows. In Part One, I shall examine Hayek’s view of the tension between the evolution of law and the planned structure of the American Constitution. In it, I show that it was never possible for any system of spontaneous evolution to put into place the appropriate constitutional structure. In Part Two, I turn to a closer explication of several key notions in Hayek’s theory, analyzing the relationship of the cardinal notion of liberty to the three notions with which it must share center stage: equality, coercion, and monopoly. I discuss how these related notions deal with ordinary citizens’ relationships both with one another and with government at both the federal and state level, and I explain why the correct analysis takes a tripartite form. The use of force or fraud is barred except where it is strictly justified, as in cases of self-defense. The absolute refusal to deal is allowed in competitive markets in which the availability of alternative choices allow for bargaining on both sides of the market to reach a social optimum. But—and this is the set of cases that Hayek understands least well—a party with either a legal or natural monopoly is rightly under a duty to provide services on what the standard formula calls fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms. The influential but mischievous work of Robert Lee Hale tends to collapse the competition case into the monopoly case, extending the notion of coercion far beyond its proper scope. The correct analysis applies different rules to the three types of cases in the manner indicated. In Part Three, I turn to the role of ignorance in legal theory. Here, I attack the Hayekian view that ignorance of basic social structures is so strong that it commits us to an evolutionary approach, instead, I defend the alternative view of ignorance captured in the Rawlsian notion of the veil of ignorance. The point of the distinction is that we do know enough to determine some sense of the optimal social structure in light of the general structure of individual preference sets, and this account maps well onto classical liberal theory. We need common rules to respect uniform preferences where any individual deviation could prove fatal to others, as in the cases of force and fraud. But we need market institutions to match individuals with the proper set of goods and services. The first set of questions requires a centralized response that the second does not. Additionally, planning for infrastructure is a case in which it is necessary to organize the structure of the legal system, even if it is most unwise for the government to determine the composition of the traffic as opposed to setting the rules of the road. Part Four returns to the question of contractual regulation and draws the strong contrast between contractual formalities and substantive regulation. The former function as ex ante substitutes for ex post litigation costs, and thus promote the security of transactions without altering any of the substantive terms of the deal. Conversely, regulation restricts freedom of contract, and thus is not justified in dealing with competitive markets, but is a viable option in cases of monopoly power. The antitrust laws may be properly invoked to prevent certain kinds of horizontal contracts and merger arrangements. However, in those cases where firms cannot be broken up, rate regulation may also be appropriate, functioning as an extension of the traditional rules of private necessity where persons in imminent peril who have available only a single source of protection may take it by paying just compensation, or undo bargains to the extent that they provide their rescuers with supracompetitive benefits. The dangerous extension of the role of state power under progressive theory is found not in any of these cases, but lies in its willingness to use state power to convert competitive markets into monopoly markets, thereby securing a triple threat—lower output, greater uncertainty, and higher administrative costs. Finally, Part Five critiques Hayek’s general intellectual approach, which tends to operate at too high a level of generality in ways that miss the key institutional arrangements that determine the success or failure of different government schemes. That attitude comes at a high cost in the American context where, in combination with his general anti-theoretical bent, Hayek disparages the efforts of the great classical liberal justices to confine regulation to its proper sphere of monopoly control and protection of competitive arrangements, most notably in labor markets. There is a deep irony here, for Hayek turns his back on the judicial approach that systematically tried to preserve the exact same legal arrangements Hayek defended in The Constitution of Liberty. His unwillingness to delve into the practice of judicial review put him on the wrong side of the great constitutional tussle between classical liberals and their modern progressive opponents. His unwillingness to accept any theoretical structure compromised many of his finest instincts in political economy with questionable institutional judgments.",2

Smith,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Disasters can shatter lives and communities. At the very least, they temporarily disrupt local or regional economies. One of the major, lingering sources of disruption following a natural disaster is that many products normally available before the disaster experience critical shortages. The prices of products, such as bottled water, ice, and chainsaws, often rise in response to increased demand and disrupted supply. The reduced availability of common consumer goods can increase disaster victims’ hardship and delay the return to normalcy. Furthermore, even if products remain available at higher prices, victims may lack the financial resources to purchase needed items because of their drastic loss of wealth and possibly even their income. The standard economic account of resource allocation in postdisaster contexts argues that price increases—potentially quite large ones—are required for businesses to observe demand shocks and reallocate goods and services accordingly to their new, highest valued uses. Price increases convey the knowledge, from consumers to retailers to producers, that goods such as generators and building supplies have become more valuable in the disaster area, and provide the incentive for suppliers to expand production or deliver more of their goods to the disaster area. Price increases also provide the incentive for consumers to economize on their use of these goods. This standard economic account forms the basis for criticism of price-gouging laws (Brewer 2006–2007; Carden 2009; Culpepper and Block 2008; Lee 2015; Montgomery et al. 2007; Munger 2007). Economists have highlighted the swift response of Walmart and other national retailers to recent disasters (Horwitz 2009a, b; Rosegrant 2007a, b). Yet, many large retailers voluntarily freeze prices after and, sometimes, even before a disaster (Rosegrant 2007a). In addition, churches and charities often deliver effectively zero-price aid to disaster victims. These cases prove by example that sharp price increases are not always necessary to direct some of the most effective societal responses to disasters. Without the uninhibited price system, economists expect substantial inefficiency in both public and private resource allocation following a natural disaster. Indeed, we do see ineffective public sector responses to disasters (Corneulle 2011; Boettke and Smith 2010). Public sector agencies often provide the wrong type of aid, or the right aid to the wrong place, or the right aid at the wrong time. The knowledge problems that plague central economic planning seem to prevent effective public sector disaster relief (Sobel and Leeson 2007; Boettke and Smith 2010; Chamlee-Wright and Storr 2011). Businesses and nonprofit voluntary organizations, however, often find a way to provide effective assistance to those affected by disasters, and help mobilize and allocate community resources (Boettke and Smith 2010; Chamlee-Wright and Storr 2009; Storr, Haeffele-Balch, and Grube 2015; Smith and Sutter 2013). A survey of the Mississippi Gulf Coast in Chappell et al. (2007) after Hurricane Katrina provides evidence on this. Residents were asked to identify their most important source of aid both immediately after Katrina and before normal economic activity resumed. The results of the survey clearly reveal that the voluntary sector outperformed the public sector (Table 1). How do private sector agencies overcome the inherent knowledge problems involved in allocating resources after a disaster without the price system to guide them, even while public sector agencies flounder? This contrast calls for both theoretical and empirical clarification. History demonstrates that many businesses, charities, and churches must be learning in nonprice environments. This process of learning involves assessing individual needs based off observation, word-of-mouth, introspection, and trends from past circumstances. Importantly, it must also involve mechanisms for ensuring the accuracy of the information as well as a feedback process (Chamlee-Wright and Myers 2008). Yet, economists lack an understanding of how this social learning occurs. As Horwitz (2011, 79–80) observes, “In economics, we have a fairly precise understanding of the price coordination process and the ways in which prices, profits, and losses serve as knowledge wrapped in an incentive to both inform and motivate market actors to mutually adjust behavior in ways that enhance social coordination and better serve all of us customers.… The question is just how well the analogs of these processes work outside of price coordinated environments.” This paper draws on recent research on natural disasters to improve our theoretical and empirical understanding of nonprice learning. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and tornadoes in Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, highlight the sharp contrast between ineffective public sector aid and effective assistance from the private sector. We draw heavily on field research we conducted after the deadly tornadoes that struck Tuscaloosa on April 27 and Joplin on May 22, 2011.Footnote 1 This paper explores the coordination of activity in a nonprice disaster-relief environment generally, however, and is not specific to any one case or event. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the disaster-recovery literature detailing both private and public sector responses. Section 3 offers a theoretical explanation for how shifts in demand might be discovered and interpreted by private sector entities after a disaster without the use of prices. Section 4 documents the ability of private sector agencies to identify the demand for local goods and services. Section 5 details the important role of applying knowledge across disasters. Section 6 discusses how relief providers allocate resources to those in need. Section 7 discusses implications of our explanation for social learning for three issues concerning disaster response. First, we contend that one of the most visible forms of inefficiency in voluntary response, the so-called disaster after the disaster, actually provides evidence of the significance of social learning by voluntary organizations; second, that public sector agencies are unable to use the credible but tacit signals of demand; and, third, that price gouging laws have some previously overlooked economic effects. Section 8 concludes.",8

Hendrickson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Central to the theory of capital developed by Bohm-Bawerk (1891) and Wicksell (1893) is the idea that production is naturally a time-consuming process. More roundabout production processes generate more output, but often require a longer period of production (the time between the start and the completion of production). Within this context, the interest rate is the mechanism that coordinates production and consumption decisions across time. For example, since the interest rate is a function of the rate of time preference, changes in the interest rate communicate changes in the degree of patience of consumers. When consumers become more patient, the rate of time preference and therefore the rate of interest declines. More patient consumers are willing to wait longer for consumption. Firms therefore undertake more roundabout methods of production. This type of view of production is potentially important for understanding the coordination of behavior between households and firms. A firm considering entry into a particular market or adding capacity faces a number of decisions related to time. For example, the decision to build or expand a factory entails a substantial fixed cost. Firms therefore have an incentive to try to determine the optimal point in time to build or expand the factory. This decision is complicated by the fact that it takes time to build the factory and it takes time from the start of the production process to the ultimate creation of the output good. As a result, a firm that builds the factory is doing so based on their expectations about the demand for the product they produce after the factory has been built and after some period of production. In this context, it is possible to imagine how discoordination between households and firms could result. For example, a firm might see a growing trend in the demand for their product. If the firm incorrectly forecasts this trend, the firm might enter “too early” and find lower than expected demand when the product is brought to market. In addition, if firms face potential competition in bringing their product to market, they not only have to make decisions based on their forecast of market conditions, but also must take into consideration the likely behavior of their competitors. This creates the possibility of a coordination failure between firms since each firm’s decision to enter the market could be independently desirable, but collectively undesirable. All of this is further complicated by the fact that the period of production is also an endogenous variable. For example, a firm that chooses a more roundabout (more lengthy) production process might want to wait longer to start construction on the factory because of greater uncertainty associated with demand over a longer time horizon. However, if the firm faces competition from other firms, the firm might want to enter the market sooner to obtain a first-mover advantage. A firm’s investment decision therefore depends on their expectations about the demand for the product they produce (or intend to produce), their decision about “roundabout-ness” of the production process, the costs associated with entry into a market or expansion within a market, as well as the expectations regarding the behavior of potential competitors. The potential for discoordination within this type of environment is the foundation of the business cycle theory of Black (1987) as well as the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, most closely associated with Hayek (1931).Footnote 1 In particular the Austrian theory attributes such discoordination to deviations between the market rate of interest and the natural rate of interest, which causes the length of production of firms to diverge from the preferences of consumers. This divergence results in malinvestment on the part of the firm thereby creating a recession. Similar themes have also been picked up by Taylor (2007; 2009; 2012), who emphasizes the role of low interest rates in creating a boom and subsequent bust in the housing market.Footnote 2
 The Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) emphasizes the relationship between interest rates and the time structure of production. This theory therefore places particular emphasis on the behavior of firms when interest rates change. As a result of this emphasis, the most common modern criticism of the ABCT, commonly referred to as the rational expectations critique, focuses on firm decision-making. The rational expectations critique suggests that the ABCT either requires that firms make systematic errors in response to changes in the market interest rate or that firms do not use all available information when making production decisions (Cowen 1997; Wagner 1999). Similarly, if economists are capable of writing down a model explaining why malinvestment occurs, this raises questions as to why firms are not also aware of such explanations of malinvestment and therefore able to avoid it (Tullock 1987; Caplan 1999). Given both the resurgence in the popularity of arguments related to the structure of production and the challenge posed by the rational expectations critique, the purpose of this paper is to provide a foundational framework that can be used to consider the decision-making process of firms when the time structure of production is important, when firms face uncertainty about future market conditions, and in which firms have rational expectations. In doing so, it is possible to consider the effects of interest rate changes on the time structure of production and the timing of investment decisions that is immune from the rational expectations critique. The model consists of two firms, each of which faces a two dimensional investment decision. Along one dimension, the firms must choose the length of their production process, which influences when and how much they produce. Along another dimension firms have to determine the optimal time to enter the market, given that there are random fluctuations in demand and a fixed cost of entry.Footnote 3 The decision to enter can be considered akin to a financial option since firms have the option, but not the obligation to enter the market. The decision for firms is to choose the optimal point in time to exercise this option. This is complicated by a number of factors. Since demand is stochastic, firms face a risk of entering the market too soon and possibly taking losses as a result of a series of adverse demand shocks. This is further complicated by the fact that firms choose the length of the production process and therefore do not start generating revenue until some time after entry, but incur the costs immediately. This combination of factors implies that firms would prefer to wait until demand is sufficiently high before entering the market. However, there is a first-mover advantage. The firm that enters the market first, operates as a monopoly and will enjoy some period of higher profits until the second firm enters. Thus, while firms would like to wait until demand is sufficiently high, they also have an incentive to preempt the entry of their competitor. This requires strategic behavior on the part of each firm. I show that for a particular range of demand, firms will employ mixed strategies. Further, I show that when firms employ mixed strategies, this creates the possibility of simultaneous entry/investment and therefore coordination failures. The model produces two important results. First, the length of production, or the time-to-build, is inversely related to the real interest rate. Second, firms have a greater incentive to try to preempt the entry of their competitors when interest rates are low. Firms are therefore willing to preempt their competitor at lower levels of demand. In addition, the probability that they enter is more sensitive to changes in demand when interest rates are low. I conclude by discussing the role of interest rates in producing boom-bust investment behavior as well as limitations of the model and opportunities for future research.",6

Furton,Alexander William Salter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The 2008 financial crisis has resulted in significant introspection by monetary economists, financial economists, and macroeconomists. The result has been several strands of literature that, by topic or method, had previously been considered beyond the scope of orthodox economics. In this paper we engage one strand in particular: that which holds that the monetary authority must be bound by a firm rule that the monetary authority itself cannot change, what some have called a ‘monetary constitution’ (Buchanan 2010; Hendrickson and Salter 2015; Salter 2014; White et al. 2015; Yeager 1962). The literature on monetary constitutions typically focuses on the favorable economic effects (e.g., macroeconomic stability) that can be achieved by adopting a monetary constitution, and some of which argues that this is the only way to achieve such favorable effects. While we believe this latter, stronger claim has merit, we contribute to the literature on monetary constitutions by approaching the concept of a monetary constitution from a different angle. It is our contention that the rigor afforded by a monetary constitution is best understood by the effort to bring the governance of monetary institutions under the rule of law. Current monetary arrangements are unacceptable both due to their destabilizing consequences, and because they operate outside a rule of law. As Hamburger (2014) argues for administrative law more generally, we will argue that monetary institutions and policies are currently unlawful, and that this is the indirect source of their ineffectiveness. Our target in this paper is the overwhelmingly-dominant form of monetary institutions and practices in developed economies: discretionary central banking. As White (2010) argues, current monetary arrangements are fundamentally at variance with the rule of law. We will show why, making reference to ideas that are widely accepted, this is in fact undesirable. Our paper thus complements the growing literature that holds that central banks are, in part, responsible for the financial crisis, either by facilitating an unsustainable expansion of credit in the years before the crisis (Borio and Disyatat 2011; Calvo 2013; Leijonhufvud 2009; J. B. Taylor 2009; John Taylor 2007; see also Cachanosky and Salter 2016, and the references therein), or by failing to act decisively when the turmoil in financial markets spilled over into final goods and services markets, resulting in a precipitous drop in aggregate demand (Hetzel 2012; Sumner 2011, 2012, 2015). It also complements the growing literature that questions not just the performance of discretionary central banking, but discretionary central banking in general (Aguiar-Hicks et al. 2014; Bédard 2014; Boettke and Smith 2013; 2015a, b; Hogan 2015; Paniagua 2016; Selgin et al. 2012). While making use of these arguments, we directly engage normative considerations as they relate to political philosophy as well. Our approach harkens back to the understanding of political economy as the body of knowledge informing our conceptions of the ‘good society,’ occupying the space ‘between predictive science and moral philosophy’ (Buchanan 2001). Our work thus can be viewed, along with those of Frankel (1977), Steil and Hinds (2009), and Zelmanovitz (2015), as an analysis of money and monetary policy in the realm of social philosophy more generally. Our argument will proceed on two separate but related lines. Our first-order normative arguments will focus on building the case for lawful money on the same grounds on which lawful institutions stand more generally. Our second-order normative argument will focus on why unlawful monetary institutions are not appropriate means for achieving familiar macroeconomic desiderata such as aggregate demand stability. If we have a rule of law applied to monetary institutions and policy, we can have macroeconomic stability. But if we forsake the former, out of a desire to give authorities the room for action deemed necessary to secure the latter—as exists with current monetary institutions—we inadvertently lose both. We organize the remainder of this paper as follows: in Section 2 we recapitulate familiar arguments for the rule of law in general, as well as its importance when applied to money. In Section 3 we examine discretionary central banking in theory and practice. We perform this analysis to determine whether or not such discretion is justifiable on strictly consequentialist (means-ends) grounds. In Section 4 we conclude by exploring the implications of our argument more generally, with special focus on the relevance of broader social-philosophic concerns to the analysis of monetary institutions and policy.",1

This conviction is motivated by developments over the last few decades in the fields of finance and production theory that have implications for the usual understanding of Austrian capital theory, and by the connection to insights from accounting as highlighted by Ludwig von Mises and Ronald Coase but never explored further. In this paper we offer such a reexamination along these lines, pointing up the neglected insights of Mises, the work on production functions by Franklin Fisher and his collaborators and the important work of John Hicks and Frederick Macaulay relating to the role of time in production and investment. What emerges from this examination is, we believe, a more relevant and coherent capital theory, and a rich agenda for further research. In the next section we attempt to capture the essence of Carl Menger’s approach to capital, highlighting the important distinction between goods and the valuable services they yield (implying that goods are valuable only because they yield valuable services) and highlighting also the importance of money in facilitating exchange and production and in providing the means to value them. In section 3 we look at the capital-theory of Böhm-Bawerk and suggest that, in many respects, this was a wrong turn, although it did set in motion valuable efforts to clarify the importance of the heterogeneity of productive-resources and their growing complexity over time, which is the subject of section 4. In section 5 we turn to an examination of the production-function, micro and macro, and show that it is logically untenable and useless as an instrument for empirical investigation, and that this has been known for decades. Of the Austrians after Menger, only Mises followed Irving Fisher in focusing on the valuation of resources. He did so in the context of explaining the importance of calculation. Mises’s approach to capital has not been sufficiently understood and appreciated. This is the subject of sections 7 and 8. By way of conclusion we draw from our considerations to provide a research agenda in Austrian capital theory.",16
31.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,18 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-016-0366-8,The international business cycle as intertemporal coordination failure,March 2018,Simon Bilo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is a comovement of macroeconomic aggregates among countries that we call the international business cycle. I explain this comovement using a framework of intertemporal coordination failure, where the monetary policy of one country makes the plans of people in different currency areas mutually incompatible. It is one of the features of such incompatibility that it is not visible at the moment when people make their plans but only becomes visible later on, when it leads to recession and to visible adjustments to the plans. Some economists have called the set of adjustments a “cluster of errors.” My analysis builds on the Austrian tradition in macroeconomics, which seeks to attribute the set of visible adjustments during the recession and the recession itself to a common cause: intertemporal coordination failure. This tradition includes works of Hayek (1967 [1935], 1975 [1939]), Garrison (2001), Mises (1971 [1924], pp. 339–64), Machlup (1940), Robbins (1971 [1934], pp. 30–54), Rothbard (2000 [1963]), and Wicksell (1962 [1898]) and dates back at least as far as the writings of the currency school, as Mises (1943) points out. The key Austrian insight is that expansionary monetary shocks induce people to invest in production processes that are too long, or, put differently, too temporally distant from consumption. Once the monetary expansion comes to its end, the overly long and irreversible investment plans turn out to be too costly to finish, revealing thereby an underlying intertemporal coordination failure. Drawing on previous contributions for the closed economy, particularly those of Garrison (2001) and Hayek (1967 [1935], 1975 [1939]), I apply the Austrian version of coordination failure to the international context of two currency areas, which is a topic that only a few works—notably﻿ Hayek (1937), Hoffmann (2010), Cachanosky (2012, 2014, 2015), and Cachanosky and Hoffmann (2016)— have explored. My framework of intertemporal coordination failure builds on Hayek’s early insights into how temporary changes in exchange rates (1937, pp. 50–51) and interest rates (1967 [1935]) lead to unsustainable irreversible capital allocations, which he did not develop into a full-fledged international business cycle theory. The framework explains comovement of aggregate economic activities in different currency areas with a floating foreign exchange rate by reference to monetary policy and its effects on prices in two important markets: the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign exchange. The market for loanable funds and the market for foreign exchange both differ in a certain respect from most other markets: a change in the price of milk, potatoes, or most other goods represents only a change in the relative price of one good with respect to all other goods. This is not true of a change in the price of loanable funds or foreign exchange. In the market for loanable funds, the interest rate relates the price of all present goods to that of all future goods. In the market for foreign exchange, the exchange rate determines the relative price of all domestic goods and all foreign goods. A change in the interest rate or a change in the foreign exchange rate therefore changes the price of a large set of goods relative to another large set of goods. The pivotal role of these two prices and the relative speed of their responses to monetary expansion, as shown for example in Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), make them good candidates to explain international business cycles. Because new money enters the economy through the domestic market for loanable funds, the foreign market for loanable funds, and the market for foreign exchange, prices in these three markets are affected sooner than prices in other markets. When monetary expansion creates an excess supply of loanable funds at the prevailing interest rate, real domestic and foreign interest rates decline and the domestic currency depreciates against the foreign currency in nominal terms as well as in real terms. The fall in the interest rates makes longer and more capital-intensive production processes more profitable. The depreciation of the domestic currency makes production for foreign consumption more profitable. Eventually, the changes in relative prices resulting from the monetary expansion are reversed, and the prices return to their final equilibrium position. These adjustments are, however, not expected by everyone, which causes costly intertemporal coordination failures. People who are invested too much in cross-border production or in capital-intensive production earn less profits. Some production processes become obsolete; and depending on their specificity, some factors of production have to be reallocated, while other factors become permanently idle. Intertemporal coordination failures are therefore the center of the explanation of international business cycles proposed below, where I argue that it is the market for loanable funds and the foreign exchange market that fail in their coordinative roles, particularly in the context of vertical production processes. Such intertemporal coordination failure is costly to remedy and has effects at home as well as abroad. My findings are consistent with the stylized empirical characteristics of international business cycles, including the dynamics of real imports and real exports and international comovements of real output, real consumption, real investment, and employment.",2

McClure,David Chandler Thomas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Austrian Business Cycle Theory, as the epigraph highlights, offers valuable insights into one particular type of cycle, one that is set off by “excess supplies of money” that trace to exogenous central bank policies. In this paper we present an endogenous business cycle theory in which a cycle emerges from considerations of sticky consumption and entrepreneurial error. Although sticky aggregate consumption is a demonstrable phenomenon in economies throughout the world (Carroll et al. 2011), to our knowledge it has not yet been incorporated into capital structure macroeconomics. As will be explained, on the heels of a technological advance, sticky consumption facilitates accelerating elongations in the capital structure; these differ fundamentally from the structural changes traditionally anticipated. Even though sticky consumption augments capital structure elongations that facilitate more rapid economic growth, if duplicative overinvestment in research and development occurs, economic contraction will follow the exposure of such error. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss sticky consumption and the evidence and explanations that suggest the potential fruitfulness of its inclusion in capital structure macroeconomics. In Section 3, we examine the implications of incorporating sticky consumption into the analysis of how technological advance (innovation) impacts the economy in general and the capital structure in particular. In Section 4, we explain how systematic entrepreneurial error arises from the capital structure lengthening that comes out of the sticky-consumption analysis of technological advance discussed in Section 3.

Malt,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Hayek (1946) distinguished ‘true’ and ‘false’ individualism. False individualism presents a strict ‘individual-state’ dichotomy, and maintains that social process must be subject to conscious control if they are to serve human ends. True individualism emphasises non-compulsory conventions, and teaches humility toward spontaneous orders which result from human action but not human design. True individualism originated in British philosophy, particularly Scottish Enlightenment thought. By contrast, false individualism derives from Cartesian rationalism. This philosophical distinction led Hayek to criticise Mises for his teacher’s “extreme rationalism, which as a child of his time [Mises] could not escape from” - this rationalism, Hayek believed, is “factually mistaken” (1978, xxiii-xxiv). In this paper I take up Hayek’s distinction but focus on methodological individualism. I reconstruct methodological individualism as understood by rationalist philosophy, identifying the foundational philosophical concepts common to both Cartesian rationalism and Misesian praxeology: intuition and deduction; reductionism; judgement; dualism. I then present Hayekian alternatives to these Cartesian concepts: dualism may be dissolved; judgements need not guide action; explanation may proceed at an emergent system-level; economics need not proceed via deduction from intuited first principles, but by identifying and formalising patterns. I argue that the Hayekian alternative enables a gestalt switch between individual and ‘system-level’ perspectives on economic phenomena. Consequently, methodological individualism is ‘true and false’: it is true, in that economic phenomena are grounded in the actions of individuals; it is false, in that a system-level perspective allows us to reconceptualise traditional problems and - perhaps - opens new domains of enquiry. Importantly, this paper should not be understood as attempting to decisively refute Cartesianism or praxeology.Footnote 1 My aim is to identify and oppose the concepts that (consciously or otherwise) shape the Misesian and Hayekian paradigms within Austrian economics. Neither am I concerned to argue that either Mises’ or Hayek’s (or other variants) is the true version, or ‘gold standard’, of methodological individualism. It seems extremely unlikely that either paradigm’s validity can be established a priori; they must be judged by the fruits they yield. Although I will not (here) use the non-Cartesian concepts to conduct actual research, the final section suggests three new avenues of research: optimisation; stigmergy; computational complexity.",

In fact, they don’t have much competition when it comes to understanding the phenomenon of the organization across various approaches, including neoclassical economics, neo-institutional economics (especially the analyses of Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson), Austrian economics (including its so-called radical subjectivist approach represented by luminaries such as Ludwig Lachmann), entrepreneurship studies, as well as other disciplines such as strategic management. Through the mastery of these various disciplines — the breadth and the depth of their knowledge of the literature is remarkable — they have produced a unified body of thought that is presented in Organizing Entrepreneurial Judgment.Footnote 1
 The book accomplishes many feats, especially in its attempts to bridge a gap between Austrian economics, entrepreneurship studies, and managerial economics. For instance chapter 6 on the economics of the business firm and chapter 8 on its internal organization don’t have, to my knowledge, any peers in the literature. These chapters have inspired my teaching as I find them superior to many textbooks. Among the important ideas the book promotes, one may find that “economists and management scholars should view their work and applied problems through an entrepreneurial lens” (p. 222) instead of the standard neoclassical closed framework, which still largely dominates the field. Foss and Klein also insist on the idea that entrepreneurship takes place in all sorts of firms, not only in nascent ones (p. 224). This last statement is part of the fight against three biases they see in entrepreneurship studies: The start-up bias, the opportunity discovery bias, and the sole-entrepreneur bias. Their theory, which consists in enriching the opportunity discovery approach by replacing it with “judgment,” offers a response to these three biases — namely that entrepreneurship (a) occurs also in established firms, (b) consists in judgment and not simply in opportunity discovery, and (c) is also made of teams. I embrace most of Foss and Klein’s conclusions and I mostly concur with their vision of the theory of the firm. But despite its high promise, Foss and Klein’s book presents a misleading, and ultimately flawed, theory of entrepreneurship. My disagreement lies with their rejection of the Kirznerian theory of the entrepreneurial function (point (b) above).Footnote 2 Thus I mostly focus the present essay on this aspect of their book. My analysis can be stated as follows. First, it is my contention that in establishing judgment as the fundamental explanans of the theory of entrepreneurship, Foss and Klein introduce another bias: that of seeing entrepreneurship as related to allocating resources in firms. Just as John Locke found justification for ownership in the mixing of labor and nature, the authors offer a sort of “Lockean” theory of entrepreneurship, that is, a theory presenting the nature of entrepreneurship as resting on the mixing of one’s own labor (judgment, imagination, exploitation, etc.) with owned resources. The analogy with Locke’s theory has its limits, of course, but it provides some insights into the problems judgment theory encounters.Footnote 3 The question is whether by attempting to “enrich” the discovery framework they also change the fundamental essence of entrepreneurship theory and end up mixing categories that should remain clearly separated. Second, introducing the process of judgment offers fewer insights than the authors believe. More can be obtained through Kirznerian discovery analysis. This is especially true since the notion of discovery seems, according to Foss and Klein, essential to the judgment process itself. In fact, as I discuss below, judgment can be subdivided in various elements that, contrary to the authors’ assertion, can be subsumed under the Kirznerian approach to the Misesian notion of homo agens (i.e., human action understood as a composite of the pure entrepreneur and the Robbinsian maximizer). It follows that opportunity discovery through alertness is the essence of the entrepreneurial function and the ownership of resources is not a necessary attribute of entrepreneurship. Third, I believe most of Foss and Klein’s criticisms of Kirzner’s theory should be rejected, as Kirzner offers a more fundamental theory of entrepreneurship; one that can be applied beyond the realm of the (nascent or mature) firm. The essence of entrepreneurship is at stake here. Kirzner locates it at the point at which a new ends-means framework (forming an individual’s preferences) is being identified. This is the discovery framework. It stands in contrast to what can be named the “Rothbard-Salerno-Foss-Klein” (hereafter RSFK) approach, which has been critical of the Kirznerian framework for decadesFootnote 4 and locates the essence of entrepreneurship in the process of judgment.Footnote 5 And this is not semantic. It is a very important point of theory for the reason that entrepreneurship seen as a function of human action helps us explain social change, market processes, development, and growth — it goes far beyond the nascent and mature firm. The authors intend to replace the “discovery view” with the “judgment view” by revitalizing the Knightian research program (p. 3). Indeed, as they contend, Frank Knight saw organizations, profit, and entrepreneurship as closely related (p. 18); something that seems to be absent, according to the authors, from Kirzner’s theory. Foss and Klein see themselves as bringing back the Knightian understanding of entrepreneurship into the modern research program on entrepreneurs, firms, and management. In the following pages, I offer a detailed analysis of their view in five sections: (a) the separation thesis, (b) the notion of opportunity, (c) entrepreneurship as judgment, (d) entrepreneurship as implying asset ownership, and (e) firms and capital goods. I offer a conclusion in the last section.",4

Munger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"James McGill Buchanan won the 1986 “Swedish National Bank's Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.” The selection committee cited “his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.” And in fact, Buchanan’s “contractarianism” is often cited, or criticized. I would argue instead that Buchanan saw the greatest problem in society as the necessity of restricting coercion unless it would be fully justified. For Buchanan, there was only one situation that could justify coercion: consent.Footnote 1 Much is known of Buchanan’s contributions to the Public Choice movement in its “Politics Without Romance” (Buchanan 1979) incarnation. As Shughart (2008) says, “Public Choice applies the theories and methods of economics to the analysis of political behavior.” To put it simply, Public Choice has made use of the assumptions of maximizing behavior, subject to constraints, aggregated using the equilibrium behavior to ensure that individual actions are somehow coordinated and adjusted to account for the actions of others.Footnote 2 And to be fair that’s a big part of Public Choice. But it is not all that Public Choice is, and it’s not all it should be. In this essay I review statements and arguments by James Buchanan from a number of sources, and argue that the following statement is the best simple summary of his work in political economy: Buchanan’s Method: Starting with three assumptions—methodological individualism, behavioral symmetry, and politics as exchange—we proceed to analyze the rules and processes groups of people will adopt and sustain to achieve joint or collective goals. It is dangerous to be too optimistic about the “public interest” motivation of individuals, but it is also dangerous to be too dismissive of doing things in groups. Further, there are four underlying notions that are key to understanding Buchanan’s thought. These are (in no particular order): (1) Philosophical anarchism, (2) The Relatively Absolute Absolutes, (3) Ethical neutrality, and (4) Subjectivism. The “method” above, filtered through the four underlying notions, is the key to Buchanan’s political economy. The reason that it’s important to get this right is that this was not, and in many ways is not, the way that the profession reacted to news that Buchanan had won the Nobel Prize. In terms of that reaction, it is useful to recall John Maynard Keynes’ prediction about reaction to his own work, in the Preface to the General Theory: “[The reaction] will fluctuate, I expect, between a belief that I am quite wrong and a belief that I am saying nothing new.” The most interesting part of the reaction to Buchanan’s prize is that critics made both claims, in the same breath! One of the most famous reactions was the piece commissioned by the New York Times, written by Prof. Robert Lekachman, a deservedly obscure economist at Lehman College. He wrote: As a founder of Public Choice theory, Mr. Buchanan has extended the imperial grasp of the free market model to politics. Other Chicago trained or influenced scholars have applied the logic of self-interest to the career choices of criminals, selection of marriage partners, and decisions to bring into the world few, many, or no new inhabitants… Mr. Buchanan's contribution is an argument that politicians…are powerfully motivated by self-interest. The novelty, if any, in this discovery is his claim that self-interest is the only force operating upon them. Those who linger on the imperfections of private markets, refuse to reduce all human behavior to simple self-interest and fret about the unemployed and the poor, will continue to support business regulation remedies for gross inequity and social programs in aid of vulnerable groups…. Nobel prizes are not awarded to physicists who rediscover Isaac Newton. Yet, Public Choice theory resurrects the Adam Smith of “The Wealth of Nations” (while conveniently ignoring the Adam Smith of the earlier “Theory of Moral Sentiments,” who emphasized conscience as monitor of human action). The anonymous Nobel Jurors inevitably make choices among conservatives, liberals and mild radicals, with occasionally ludicrous results. In 1974, the prize was divided between Gunnar Myrdal, one of the architects of the Swedish welfare state, and Friedrich Hayek, a stalwart opponent of the welfare state. It is as though an award were split between an evolutionist and a scientific creationist. (Lekachman 1986; emphasis added) Notice that Prof. Lekachman cannot bring himself to settle on a criticism: We all already know that, and it’s wrong.Footnote 3 That clipping, of Lekachman’s review, became the near-universal sneering dismissal of Buchanan’s Nobel. But no part of the criticism is correct. It is risible to claim that Buchanan’s work was part of an orthodox Chicago modelling enterprise. He never argued that people are motivated only by self-interest. And far from arguing the perfection of markets, or the imperfections of choosing groups, Buchanan’s scholarship was devoted to exploring how groups might improve on market institutions. In what follows, I will first consider Buchanan’s “method,” which I claim has three elements. I will then examine the particular notions that underpin Buchanan’s unique contributions to Public Choice. Finally, I consider Buchanan’s contributions to political philosophy, in terms of his views on political authority.",12
31.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,05 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-018-0417-4,Public choice as political philosophy,June 2018,David Schmidtz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"By the mid-1800’s, John Stuart Mill had taken empiricism to the limit, arguing that everything we know comes to us by experience and experiment. We draw inferences from observed empirical regularities. Even propositions like “two plus two equals four” are learned by generalizing from observed results. In his day, Mill was highly visible and highly influential as an expositor of the new moral sciences. Accordingly, he was taken very seriously when, in a series of works culminating in 1848 with Principles of Political Economy, Mill separated the study of how goods are produced from the study of how goods are distributed. That is what you do for sake of analytical rigor and tough-minded science: if two things can be separated, you separate them. Here is a further thought. Mill thought humanity had largely exhausted frontier of technological progress (Vallier 2010). To be sure, the telegraph was invented in 1837, and by 1848, many thinkers suspected that electricity’s potential, especially in the realm of distance communication, was far from exhausted. Thus, even as Mill was writing, there was plenty of reason to doubt Mill’s view that a steady-state economy was around the corner, and plenty of reason to doubt that better distribution was the only remaining avenue for substantial human progress. On the other hand, by 1831, Mill, inspired by economists such as David Ricardo had already separated production from distribution (Vallier 2010). So, it is hard to know exactly what Mill could have been thinking, but perhaps he was set in his ways and simply overlooked increasingly plain evidence that technological progress was exploding rather than tapering off. In any case, for whatever reason, Mill did believe the coming age would be an economic steady state with relatively little news on the production side. Human progress would come via better distribution, not rising productivity, which made distribution the crucial topic. Today, we hardly remember John Stuart Mill pressing that distinction, or that we simply took Mill’s authority for granted and went along with him. Today, we cannot see how spurious that distinction was, for we can hardly imagine not seeing production and distribution as separate topics. But sometimes, what seems to be two things is actually one thing, along the lines of the morning star and the evening star. If we presume to treat them as radically separable simply because they appear to be separable, we end up being badly misled. Indeed, in the aftermath of Mill’s distinction, philosophy was cut off from the scientific study of what makes some societies more productive than others. The latter became the province of some other department. Within departments of philosophy themselves, the impact was not detectable by the tools left to philosophy, but nonetheless momentous. Since Philosophy and Political Economy came apart, we have portrayed what society produces as a pie. Philosophy has been like the proverbial drunk looking for his keys under the street lamp not because that is where the drunk dropped his keys but because the light is better there. We treat the question of justice as a question of how to treat the pie because pie is what we can study with the analytical tools we have left. Questions about what produces the pie had to be left to the social sciences. What philosophy was equipped to do was to bring a priori intuitions to bear on the question of what to count as a fair way of dividing the pie. In Philosophy, the picture is something like this (Schmidtz 2016). We look at a snapshot of a busy intersection. We see how arbitrary it is that some people have red lights and others have green. We focus exclusively on the snapshot because the cause and effect and the empirical generalizations about the process that we study in sociology, economics, and psychology—these things are all autonomous social sciences now. Where the pie comes from is a social science. How people navigate in their communities, and which ways of managing traffic work better than others, are questions of social science. What works is the province of social science. What is fair is the province of Philosophy. If we set aside social science and just look at the snapshot of social life at its busy intersections where traffic is congested and conflicts of interest become apparent, then it seems obvious: In an ideally just world, everyone would have a green light. At the same time. That may be highly impractical. If that is justice, then we have to compromise justice for humanitarian reasons: that is, so that human beings can afford to live together at all. If that is justice, or the basic ideal of justice, then every compromise that we accept so that people can tolerate living together is a lamentable practical concession to the corruptness of human nature. When do we go back to square one and ask whether our intuitions about the snapshot are anything other than ridiculous in a world of cause and effect? We cannot go back. If we did, we would be doing social science, and therefore not working on justice anymore. Yet, there was a time when we knew that justice has roughly nothing to do with how we treat the pie, and everything to do with how we treat bakers. If we set aside everything we have learned about the terms of engagement under which bakers are better off living together, there is no testable answer to question of how to divide pie. There are only untestable intuitions. We know justice is not merely a matter of opinion, but that is what we made it resemble when we started treating Philosophy as outside the realm of empirical test. Under those constraints, the best we can do is to theorize about why unreasonable people have intuitions unlike ours. Hume and Smith understood, as did James Buchanan, that economic justice pertains to an ongoing process, not an outcome. What we call “pie” is a metaphor for lifetimes of work. To Hume, we assess patterns of mutual expectation. To be sure, not all conventions command respect. On Hume’s theory, the conventions that command respect are useful or agreeable to self or others. To Smith, the question is even more pointedly empirical. We assess conventions in terms of how they affect wealth of nations. How do wealthier societies manage commercial traffic? What are documented consequences of alternative trade policies? Their questions mattered, and their questions had testable answers. By the mid-1900’s, when James Buchanan was starting out, Philosophy had painted itself into a corner. It had taken Mill’s intellectual division of labor to logical conclusion. A once-exciting and fruitful empiricist project culminated in philosophers analyzing the meanings of words as used in ordinary language, and affecting a certain pride in knowing that there is nothing more to philosophy than that. That is one story about how Philosophy came to be what it is today, isolated and marginalized as the social science departments emerged in 1800s. Was Mill really that pivotal? I am not sure there is any such thing as an unequivocal historical record. If there is, I am not enough of a historian to isolate it. I suspect that no historical record that can settle exactly why things happened as they did. Hume taught us, after all, that correlation is one thing, while causation is another. So let me mention three other key events that also correlate with philosophy’s marginalization. We can think of them as competing or as complementary explanations.",1
31.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,13 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-017-0389-9,Schumpeter: Theorist of the avant-garde,June 2018,Erwin Dekker,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The point of departure for Schumpeter in his TWE is the static theory of the classics, which is in 1911 epitomized by the theoretical framework of Walras (TWE, 100), and the recent expositions of Clark and Pantaleoni (TWE, 473). This static theory is what Mises has later described as the evenly-rotating economy in which the processes occur over and over again, unless disturbed by external factors such as population growth or changes in tastes. Or as Schumpeter describes that system: “Since it exists, theoretical economics has in essence sketched a static, self-repeating and constant economic life. (…) The great revolution in of the [economic] theory of the subjective value theory has left the static quality of the house of economic theory untouched” (TWE, 100–101)Footnote 1
,.
Footnote 2 This classical view is well captured by the epigraph of Marshall’s Principles of Economics: “Natura non saltum facit,” (Nature does not make a leap) (Marshall 1920).Footnote 3 It is Schumpeter’s goal to break with this static model, and instead introduce a dynamic model of the economy. In a move that resembles Keynes’ strategy in the General Theory, Schumpeter denounces everything that came before him as the classics. And all the classics are guilty of the same sin, only analyzing the static economy: “They did not imagine that there could be an alternative concept to the static economy” (TWE, 477). In this static economy all changes are on the margin. And individuals find no incentive or energy to do anything more: “most of the time such people are on slippery ground and the effort to stand straight exhausts their energies and suppresses all appetite for further exploration” (TWE, 162). In that sense the static model is reflective of an ossified society, ‘a dormant economy’ (TWE, 481), in which traditions govern individual behavior and whenever changes occurs they are small and incremental: “It is the usage of that, which one has learned, working on the inherited foundation, doing what everyone does. There is only passive adjustment and acceptance of the circumstances” (TWE, 125).Footnote 4 The attack that Schumpeter will mount against classical theory, pertains just as much to its theoretical apparatus as the underlying idea(l) of a static economy. Thus his claim about the incomplete static theories is also a criticism of the lack of dynamism in the economy itself, or at the very least the failure to promote such dynamism by classical economists. It is this dual criticism that theorist of the avant-garde Peter Bürger identifies as characteristic of the avant-garde. In a discussion of his work Richard Murphy argues that: “according to Bürger, the historical avant-garde of the early twentieth century (…) develops not only in response to the need to mark a break with the artistic tradition as a whole, but more specifically in response to the need to distinguish its emergent artistic credo from the conventional aestheticist principles” (Murphy 1999, 78). The avant-garde, according to Bürger, rejects the quietist, consolatory and apologetic function of art, and seeks to criticize the institution of art, or at least the current position of art in society. In order to do so the avant-gardes force a break with the past. This is very apparent in the manifestoes of one of the most prominent twentieth century artistic avant-garde movements, futurism. In this and later manifestoes they preach the destruction of the old, and the celebration of the new. Marinetti, the most prominent futurist, compared the museum to a cemetery, in which the classics are buried, literature up to now has: “exalted contemplative stillness, ecstasy, and sleep” (Marinetti 1909/2009, 51). The classics were only representing a: “fixed moment in universal dynamism” (Boccioni et al. 1910, 64). Schumpeter originally had wanted to call his theory dynamic, but decided against it, as he observes in a letter to the American economist Clark, because of the negative reactions to that term among his German friends (Schumpeter 2000, 48). He, however, makes clear that his theory of development is no mere extension of the static theory: “development and equilibrium in the sense that we have given these terms are therefore opposites, the one excludes the other” (TWE, 489). Schumpeter was forcing a break with the classical economic theory. He was not merely making marginal adjustments, but forcing a radical break, just as economic development caused: “entire layers of society [to] lose the ground under their feet” (TWE, 503).",4

Sobel,J. R. Clark,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth and development, particularly when it involves the discovery of new capital goods and technology (Lee 1991; Baetjer 2000; Baumol and Strom 2007; Sobel 2008; Bjørnskov and Foss 2013). Some technology entrepreneurs, such as PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, have written books or given lectures that discuss technology entrepreneurship from a business person’s perspective (Thiel 2014). While entertaining and informative, they are mostly attempts to describe their own path and extrapolate from anecdotal personal lessons. At present there is a striking lack of material available to be used as a foundation for a course in, or a cohesive set of ideas upon which to build an understanding of, modern technology entrepreneurship. Lacking a cohesive theoretical framework hampers the ability to teach, identify, and assess the most valuable areas for new technology applications. This paper attempts to make strides toward the development of a more unified framework in the area of technology entrepreneurship based on innovative extensions of some of the major contributions to knowledge and market process theory in the literature. These theories, particularly the knowledge theory of Hayek (1945), have been applied to a wide range of topics, including the problems inherent in centralized FEMA disaster relief (Sobel and Leeson 2007), but are largely absent from the literature on modern technology entrepreneurship. One exception is the early application of Hayek’s theory to early computer software in the pre-internet era by Baetjer (2000). When modern technology ventures, such as Twitter, Waze, and even 3D printers, are viewed within these frameworks, however, a more unified approach to the field can begin to take shape. This framework has the potential to be useful both in the teaching and practice of technology entrepreneurship. The paper proceeds by discussing these major theories, with applications and extensions to modern technology ventures.",7
31.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,10 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-017-0382-3,The institutional determinants of self-governance: a comment on Edward Stringham’s Private Governance,June 2018,Bruce Benson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Edward Stringham’s Private Governance (2015) really is an excellent book and very important contribution to the expanding literature on private arrangements for the development and enforcement of rules. It is particularly valuable because, for the most part, it focuses on historical and modern examples of such arrangements actually working very effectively. Perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that even very complex markets develop and evolve because of private governance, not because of state-made laws and regulations. I could fill many pages discussing all of the great things this book does, but that would not be very fun compared to a presentation of more critical comments. Therefore, I am going to focus on chapter 9 which deals with individual self-governance: the importance of moral beliefs as internally imposed determinants of choices and behavior. While I agree with Stringham that moral beliefs are important determinants of individual decision that many economists fail to recognize, I believe there are some inconsistencies within chapter 9 and between this chapter and others. To illustrate, note Stringham’s (2015: 139) contention that for any given moral choice people can act in the following ways: (1) they may always act morally, not considering any tradeoff between morality and material gains; (2) they may adopt moral constraint sometimes (and perhaps usually) but abandon them at a certain price; (3) they may consider morality valuable but always consider the tradeoff between morality and material gains; or (4) they may only consider material gains and never consider morality. This all implies that there is a set of shared moral beliefs that are essentially universal and unchanging. However, if moral beliefs are the beliefs about what is right (or righteous) that individuals adopt, as Stringham also suggests, then moral beliefs can change with changing circumstances, as illustrated below. Therefore, there is another option to the four listed above – (5) adopt different beliefs. While many rules, including moral beliefs (and constitutions, statute law, legal precedents, custom and usage, etc.) tend to be fixed in the immediate period, they are also endogenous over the longer term.Footnote 1 Therefore, beliefs regarding righteous behavior can vary across circumstances and over time. This contention is explored below, but in this context, note that Stringham’s discussion of moral beliefs is also somewhat inconsistent with the rest of the book. Stringham argues that private governance institutions are endogenous, and that they evolve as rational actors look for ways to more effectively pursue their objectives. Institutions are the “rules of the game” that influence and guide behavior (North 1990) so morality is an institution, and like other institutions, its rules can be changed if doing so facilitates peoples’ pursuit of their objectives.Footnote 2
 Pursuit of personal objectives requires scarce resources including labor and entrepreneurial time and effort, as well as capital and generally land. Rules of the economic game, including relevant moral beliefs, develop because scarcity results in competition for control of scarce resources. The rules establish obligations that underlie property rights to the resources and their products, as well as the procedures for establishing, attenuating, and transferring those rights, including rules to coordinate competition for resources. Violent competition will occur unless rules can establish incentives to compete in some other way, such as through markets or through political institutions. In fact, there are two broad types of interaction that can facilitate the individual’s control over resources and pursuit of objectives. One is cooperative interaction, including team production (e.g., of goods, protection, mutual insurance, mutual security, social activities, religious activities), as well as the division of labor and voluntary exchange (of goods, but also of support, friendship, loyalty, etc.). Such voluntary cooperation requires trust, of course, so as explained below, rules that encourage ethical behavior, including respect of private property rights, must evolve in order to support participation in such positive-sum games. Stringham’s discussion of morality focuses on these rules. A second method for an individual to achieve at least some personal objectives involves taking property and/or products from others who claim ownership, through force (violence or threats of violence) and/or guile (including fraud, shirking on obligations, corruption, etc.). Stringham characterizes such behavior as immoral, and it is according to his characterization of universally recognized rules of morality. The fact is, however, that rules to facilitate involuntary transfers can also be institutionalized. Legislation (positive law) is generally designed by one group and imposed on others by using coercive threats. Importantly, moral beliefs also arise within such transfer processes. Those pursing involuntary transfer processes have not decided to behave immorally in their own minds, because they have adopted beliefs that justify their actions. As Kant (1960: 16) explains, people may ... picture themselves as meritorious, feeling themselves guilty of no such offenses as they see others burdened with; nor do they ever inquire whether ... they would not have practiced similar vices, had not ... circumstances of time and place ... , kept them out of the way of these vices. This dishonesty, by which we humbug ourselves and which thwarts the establishment of true moral disposition in us, extends itself outwardly also to the falsehood and deception of others. If moral beliefs are considered from a positive perspective, however, such beliefs are “true moral dispositions” for those who adopt them. Indeed, Frank (1988) argues that because it is difficult (that is costly) for humans to pretend beliefs that are not actually adopted, it follows that if acting as if certain beliefs are real is desirable then it is rational to adopt them. This suggests that belief systems are adopted, perhaps subconsciously, that reduce the psychological costs of taking actions in particular situations, even though the same behavior would violate their conscience in different situations. Thus, for instance, in order to benefit from institutionalized coercive wealth transfers “in good conscience,” transfer recipients generally see those who lose wealth as enemies and/or as morally inferior. In fact, they tend to believe that they have the moral “right” or entitlement to part of that wealth. After all, transfer recipients who openly condone the process can not acknowledge a binding obligation to respect other people’s property rights. Over time these individuals “rationalize” their behavior, given the circumstances they face, so in their own minds their actions are morally justified. They consider themselves to be morally superior to anyone who believes differently than they do, and particularly, those from whom wealth is being taken. Similarly, as suggested below, those subject to plunder or extortion develop moral beliefs about interactions with the thieves or extortionists and with each other that do not facilitate cooperation. The contention that moral beliefs are rationalizations of behavior consistent with incentives does not imply that Stringham’s four choices listed above are not relevant. Once beliefs are established and used to guide behavior in an uncalculating way, whether for cooperation or involuntary transfers, they may be quite inflexible, even in the face of results that conflict with expectations based on the beliefs. Under these circumstances, decisions are limited to Stringham’s four choices. Once it becomes apparent that behavior based on existing beliefs is in significant conflict with an individual’s interests, however, so that the individual must either repeatedly violate the belief or repeatedly forgo obvious benefits or incur obvious costs, an individual will face a moral dilemma as she is forced to question the validity of existing beliefs. The impetus for rationalizing new beliefs arises. Thus, the rationalization of beliefs does not imply that all norms are always “rational” when considered in the light of full information or immediate circumstances. Rather, the argument is that when they evolve, the direction of evolution can be predicted with an economic model of rational decision making. In order to illustrate the impact of institutions on moral beliefs, three different institutional settings are examined below. To categorize and differentiate the resulting moral beliefs, terminology used by some sociologists is adopted; the three categories examined here are labeled “dignity culture,” “honor culture,” and “victimhood culture.”Footnote 3 These three categories are discussed in Sections 2, 3, and 4 below, where it is also contended that the institutional arrangements that support them (and particularly the dignity and honor culture) are not necessarily those stressed by sociologists.Footnote 4 Section 5 concludes by emphasizing that these three moral systems are not mutually exclusive. They may exists simultaneously within a political community creating conflict between people who hold different beliefs, and such conflict can lead to institutional changes that influence the evolution of moral beliefs. Furthermore, an individual may adopt different moral behavior in different situations.",1

Wilson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"First, what is legal centralism? The law professor Marc Galanter (1981) credits anthropologist John Griffiths with coining the term “legal centralism” in a 1979 working paper. Galanter notes, “The view that the justice to which we seek access is a product that is produced—or at least distributed—exclusively by the state, a view which I shall for convenience label ‘legal centralism,’ is not an uncommon one among legal professionals” (p. 1). Early on, Stringham interprets legal centralism this way: “To a legal centralist, any cooperation must be attributable to the state, but in actuality, cooperation can be attributable to steps taken by the individual parties” (p. 22). It is in this statement that I see my reluctance. If legal centralism is about the state exclusively providing justice—and by that I mean negative justice, the meting out of punishments for wrongs committed in concrete cases—then I am inclined to unashamedly clothe myself in the label. But when legal centralism jumps to the point that cooperation in the positive sense must be attributable to the state, I am quick to shed the label “legal centralist.” 
Private Governance is a compelling defense of the proposition that “mechanisms of private governance are far more ubiquitous and far more powerful than commonly assumed” (p. 6). Early on, Stringham references Hayek’s use of the word marvel to describe the price system (p. 7). The reference is apt. This book exudes wonder; it exudes excitement for voluntary associations; and it exudes an enthusiasm to share the author’s astute observations with the reader. In short, it exudes Professor Stringham. I agree with the central thesis, and with most of his specific arguments as well. Stringham looks to history to see how people actually solved problems of fraud and cheating without government intervention. His examples, from the first stock market in early seventeenth-century Amsterdam to PayPal in the 20th and 21st centuries worldwide, are illustrative and insightful. I particularly like how he diagrams the financial crisis and explains financial tools in simple language.",

In a prisoner’s dilemma, players have two options, either cheat or defect. Regardless of what the other player does, each player receives a higher payout from cheating than from defecting. Thus, perfectly rational and perfectly selfish players playing a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma should be expected to engage in mutual defection. However, the payoffs are designed such that mutual cooperation is better for both players than mutual defection. Nevertheless, since defection is the dominant strategy, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection. Or consider the trust game. In the trust game, one player receives an initial payout, say, $10. The player then has the option of sending money to a second player. Whatever amount the first player sends to the second player is multiplied by a factor of, say, 3. The second player in turn has the option of returning some of the money back to the first player. If both players (in a one-shot game) were perfectly selfish and rational, theory predicts that the first player will send nothing. The first player would predict that the second player, being completely selfish, would keep all the money for himself, and so would send nothing. Games like this were designed with the goal of understanding real-world incentives and conflicts. In some cases, researchers were trying to determine whether the USSR and the USA would fight a nuclear war. As game theory developed, researchers produced ever more sophisticated games and models, and more thorough mathematical analysis of how such games might be played in different cases. But if we look around, we find that real people do not quite play the way the games predict. The games predict mutual defection, a lack of trust, a lack of trustworthiness, a disposition to cheat, and a lack of unconditional generosity. In fact, people are disposed to cooperate, trust each other, deserve each other’s trust, and to be at least somewhat generous, though there is tremendous variation around the world in game behavior (Brennan and Jaworski 2015). What this means is that our models present an unduly pessimistic view of human behavior. As a result, we might exaggerate or misunderstand the sources and nature of our basic institutions. Further, the solutions we propose to solve the problems we think we face might be useless or make things worse. 
Private Governance deserves to be read alongside Elinor Ostrom (1990), itself a work not yet sufficiently appreciated by mainstream economists, despite Ostrom’s 1990 Nobel. Its implications for philosophers and political theorists are in the abstract quite similar. The typical political theorist or economist relies upon or defends various models—models that seem quite sensible, from the comfort of his armchair—of how the world works. He then defends various normative conclusions—such as the need for a state, or for heavy-handed state regulation, or for the mass privatization and commodification of resources—on the basis of these models. What Ostrom and Stringham both find, though, is that once we leave the comfort of the armchair, we see that our models frequently fail to match reality. As a matter of fact, real people in the real world are able to solve a wide range of problems with institutions more nuanced than anything an economist or theorist would devise on paper. In short, we often make arguments to the effect that if certain conditions obtain, disaster will result. We then spend a great deal of time proposing solutions to these potential conditions. Yet only a few economists and political scientists look around and notice that, in fact, the conditions that supposed to lead to disaster appear all over, and yet there is no ensuing disaster. Somehow, things are not as bad as models predict.",2

Those profit opportunities are exploited through such means as creating new firms and developing new contractual frameworks, thereby dissolving the alleged situations of market failure. This logical claim lies behind Stringham’s numerous historical illustrations extending from the emergence of stock markets in Amsterdam and London in the eighteenth century to the emergence of PayPal and eBay today. In all these varied instances, Stringham describes how market participants crafted institutional measures and organizational practices that enabled them to secure gains from trade against the predatory actions of those who would undermine those gains. Stringham claims that a society that is governed wholly by private ordering can operate successfully despite numerous claims to the contrary that such societies would be plagued by problems stemming from uncompensated externalities and un-provided public goods. Sure, societies will require governance arrangements, but those arrangements need not entail the type of compulsion associated with governments. As Stringham explains, positions of authority will be present throughout the domain of human activity and interaction; however, those positions will be granted by those who participate in the relevant societal processes. Authority will operate within society, but that authority will operate through moral suasion and not through what we recognize as governmental compulsion. Moral suasion, it should be noted, includes banishment or exclusion of those who offend predominant sentiment within a particular nexus of interaction. To use one of Stringham’s illustrations, several people who meet regularly at a coffeehouse might morph into a stock exchange. Should one of those people renege on a trade, the profitability of the exchange to the other members will be imperiled. Banishment of offending parties maintains the integrity and the profitability of the exchange. Should public ordering impose some form of open access requirement, the self-ordering features of private ordering will be weakened, possibly setting in motion some demand for additional public ordering to combat the weakness of private ordering that public ordering created. Stringham illustrates his argument with numerous substantive instances, some historical and some contemporary. Historically, Stringham explains how the world’s first stock market emerged in Amsterdam without participation with some nascent Securities and Exchange Commission. There was no SEC to “protect” investors, for investors protected themselves as assisted by the desires of firm organizers to assure those investors that they were not being cheated. In this respect, it should be noted that independent auditing developed in the same manner: the organizers of firms wanted to provide assurances to investors about the use of their capital. Whereas most people today seem to attribute auditing to governmental fiat, Watts and Zimmerman (1983) show that auditing developed long ago as part of the effort of entrepreneurs to demonstrate to investors that they were using investor funds as those investors would have wanted them to be used. It is also notable that concerns about independent auditing that have arisen in recent years have nothing to do with private ordering and rather pertain to the intrusion of public ordering as illustrated by SEC regulation to restrict the openly competitive organization of auditing. Among other things, Stringham explains how short sales and forward contracts, both of which facilitate commercial development, originated despite opposition from the Dutch government. The central point here is that it was not governmental action that facilitated expansion in the extent of the market. To the contrary, government held back that expansion, but that expansion occurred anyway as private citizens ignored and bypassed the suffocating efforts of government. Stringham then turned his attention to London in the eighteenth century, after which he examined such contemporary situations as the emergence of PayPal and eBay and their ability to provide assurance for transactions between strangers. Suppose you are committed to the proposition that there will be no governments with their various agencies to impose the wills of their governing officials and supporters upon a society. Thus there will be no SEC to enforce registration requirements, no Federal Reserve to enforce bank capital requirements, and so on. Would such a world bereft of governments be a world that possessed the qualities we recognize as civilized living that we experience today? Stringham answers in the affirmative, and he is surely right to do so. There’s surely nothing that a government does that can’t be accomplished through the market processes generated through the private ordering principles of private property and freedom of contract and association. Every situation postulated to be plagued by problems of externalities and public goods implies the presence of profitable opportunities for constructing organizations and contractual forms that overcomes those problems. Stringham provides numerous cogent illustrations of this theme. To claim that market failure exists is simultaneously to claim that people knowingly fail to exploit recognizable profit opportunities. This is surely a claim an economist would not want to make without invoking auxiliary assumptions to make the market failure claim seem plausible all the same. Those assumptions typically involve small magnitudes or large numbers which renders the claim intuitively plausible, much like the pre-Copernican claim that the sun rose in the east and set in the west.",2
31.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,04 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-017-0386-z,The evolution of private governance: Neither anarchism nor Statism,June 2018,Larry Arnhart,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As naturally social and political animals, human beings have evolved to live in social orders that arise as self-regulating spontaneous orders. Every evolved human society has some form of governance. In most of their evolutionary history, human beings have lived in foraging bands, in which governance has been through customary norms enforced by social punishment of wrongdoers and informal or episodic leadership. Since the Neolithic Revolution, most human beings have settled into agrarian societies with more formal, bureaucratic, and centralized governments. Since the end of the Middle Ages, many modern states have claimed a monopoly on the legitimate exercise of violence, which was Max Weber’s definition of the state. Foraging bands have often been identified as anarchistic societies, because as what anthropologists call “stateless societies,” they seem to lack any governmental rule. But if “anarchy” is taken in its literal sense of “no rule” or “no governance,” then foraging societies are not anarchies, because they do have some form of governance, even if the governance is informal, fluctuating, and decentralized. In fact, pure anarchy is a fiction, because no human society can endure for long without some governance. Some anarchist theorists have implicitly conceded this point, as suggested in Peter Marshall’s history of anarchist thinkers and movements (Marshall 2010). Anarchists begin by distinguishing between society and the state, he indicates, and then they argue that a society can be a self-regulating order of governance without a state. He observes: Pure anarchy in the sense of a society with no concentration of force and no social controls has probably never existed. Stateless societies and peasant societies employ sanctions of approval and disapproval, the offer of reciprocity and the threat of its withdrawal, as instruments of social control. But modern anthropology confirms that in organic or 'primitive' societies, there is a limited concentration of force. If authority exists, it is delegated and rarely imposed, and in many societies no relation of command and obedience is in force (Marshall 2010, p. 12). But if it is true that ""pure anarchy. .. has probably never existed,"" and is therefore a fiction, it is also true that pure statism has never existed, and is therefore a fiction. If we accept the Weberian definition of the state as holding an absolute monopoly on the legitimate exercise of force, then such a state has never existed, and can never exist, because human beings have evolved to form spontaneously ordered groups for their governance; and while authoritarian states might vigorously try to suppress such private governance, no state can ever fully succeed in claiming an absolute monopoly on governance to the exclusion of private governance; and liberal states will leave plenty of room for such private governance. Authoritarian states will create maladaptive societies that promote violence and poverty, while liberal states will create adaptive societies that promote peace and prosperity, because liberal states provide more room for the private governance that arises from the naturally evolved nature of human beings. Consequently, liberal states will tend to prevail in competition with authoritarian states through evolution by cultural group selection. Although he does not present his argument against the background of human evolution, that’s the picture of human social evolution and political theory that I draw out of Edward Peter Stringham’s book on private governance (Stringham 2015). Stringham’s argument is ambiguous. On the one hand, he has argued for “Hayekian anarchism” (Stringham 2015, pp. 206–225; Stringham and Zywicki 2011). Given Hayek’s reasoning about how spontaneous orders evolve without central planning or deliberate design, Stringham suggests, Hayek should have seen that the logical conclusion from this is anarchism, but instead he insisted that anarchism was impossible, and that the spontaneous order of markets depended upon laws coming from monopolistic government. Hayek should have seen that his argument for market competition as superior to central planning supported a free market for governance without any need for a monopolistic government. On the other hand, Stringham pulls back from explicitly arguing for pure anarchy, and he suggests that Hayek might have been right in his classical liberal endorsement of limited government that leaves ""room for greater experimentation and competition among providers of governance,"" because ""even where governments are pervasive, so too is private governance"" (Stringham 2015, pp. 225–26). Here Stringham seems to agree with my conclusion that even if pure anarchy--the absence of any government--is impossible, every government must leave some room for a free market of private governance, and a liberal government will leave lots of room for this. In developing my evolutionary interpretation of Stringham’s account of private governance, I read Stringham against the background of Morris Hoffman’s account of the evolution of legal punishment (Hoffman 2014). Stringham seems to agree with Hoffman’s claim that human beings have three evolved instincts--to cooperate, to cheat, and to punish cheaters. He also seems to agree with Hoffman that social order requires three rules that are driven by the common problems of property and promise. The first rule is that transfers of property must be voluntary. The second rule is that promises must be kept. The third rule is that serious violations of the first two rules must be punished. If “property” is understood broadly to include one’s self-ownership, one’s liberty, and one’s possessions, then the rule protecting property encompasses both criminal law and the law of torts. If “promises” are understood as legally enforceable agreements for exchange and cooperation, then the rule securing promises would encompass contract law. The punishment required by the third rule is manifest at three levels. Through first-party punishment, we punish ourselves with conscience and guilt. Through second-party punishment, we punish our tormentors with retaliation and revenge. Through third-party punishment, we act as a group in punishing wrongdoers with retribution. Stringham agrees with Hoffman about all of this. The disagreement, however, is that Stringham sees--correctly, I think--that third-party punishment does not have to be monopolized by the modern state, as Hoffman assumes, because third-party punishment can be enforced through private governance.",

Individuals are not born with knowledge of the lowest cost means of achieving their goals, the best theories to explain the world around us, or the best way to govern human interaction so as to avoid conflict and promote cooperation. We can err. And in a world of scarcity, errors crowd out alternatives. Societies thrive when individuals are free to undertake many experiments in cooperation, and failed experiments are shut down in a peaceful and orderly manner. F.A. Hayek (1968) refers to this sort of process as competition. Both the freedom to experiment and responsibility for failure are necessary for innovation and progress. Experimentation allows us to discover new ways of doing things, but we must also stand ready to abandon existing approaches. Competition also enables adaptation. Even if a static state was desirable, it is simply not achievable given that environmental conditions, preferences, and ideas can always change. This is why Hayek (1960) always focused on the struggle between the forces of progress and the forces of decline. Stasis is not a viable option, even if we do not value progress for its own sake. We can only dispense with peaceful forms of competition when we already know the best way of doing things, and the best way of doing things often changes. While Hayek developed his theory of competition with regard to the production and exchange of goods and services, he later came to apply it to the rules that govern market exchange (Stringham and Zywicki 2011). Following Leoni (1961), Hayek (1973) argues that a long process of legal evolution allowed the West to stumble into a set of legal principles and practices that secured extensive spheres of individual control within which individuals are free to choose. Judges tried out different legal principles as methods for resolving disputes, learning from one another in a decentralized fashion. This accidental emergence of liberal institutions made individuals free to act on their own knowledge and ideas—especially those that were at odds with existing practices—and thus allowed for the West to thrive. Later, Hayek (1988) made competition over rules a centerpiece of his theory of social evolution more generally. Societies that adopted rules of private property and freedom of contract prospered and grew, supplanting societies that relied on rules of common property. This essay extends Hayek’s analysis of institutions by focusing on a particular aspect of rules: jurisdictional boundaries. To whom should a given set of rules apply? I focus on why this question matters for classical liberals, though many of the arguments below are relevant for a wide range of political theories. Good boundaries—those that enable innovation and adaptation—are in important respects like good methods of production or good scientific theories: they are best discovered through a competitive process. Section 2 introduces the concept of jurisdictional boundary problems, arguing that such problems (a) are ubiquitous, afflicting all sorts of governance arrangements and (b) are subject to the same sorts of knowledge problems that make competition so valuable for directing economic activity. Edward Stringham’s book Private Governance is especially relevant for raising the issue of how to effectively draw boundaries. Stringham focuses not on the boundaries of government authority but on the formation of private clubs as a source of governance. Clubs too have boundaries, depending on both who is admitted into membership and what being a member entails. Though he is not primarily concerned with boundary problems, Stringham explores a variety of historical cases in which club governance proved to be an effective and peaceful method for adjusting boundaries on the margin. Clubs work well primarily because individuals consent to join and cheaters can be expelled. But Chapter 13 of Private Governance takes a different turn, in two respects: its subject and its mechanism. Based on Stringham’s work with Zywicki (op. cit.), it offers a Hayekian argument for market-made law. They utilize the Hayekian idea of competition as a discovery procedure to put forward a case for Hayekian anarchism. So rather than relying on the mechanisms of consent and exclusion, Chapter 13 relies on a decentralized process of social learning. This is at least a difference in emphasis on what mechanisms make private law work well. As far as subject goes, the sort of law discussed in Chapter 13 is different from the governance provided by clubs that the rest of the book discusses in at least one important respect: it is meant to adjudicate boundaries themselves and not merely to establish or renegotiate them. As a result, it more directly addresses the problem of boundary conditions. While both parts of Stringham’s work offer important insights, I argue that the competitive approach taken in Chapter 13 is especially underappreciated. Section 3 distinguishes between two criteria that classical liberals have traditionally used for evaluating boundaries: ex ante consent to jurisdictional boundaries or the ability to exit from them ex post. Both criteria emphasize individual choice, but they come at it from opposite directions. The consent approach evaluates institutional arrangements according to whether individuals have agreed to them ex ante, while the exit approach evaluates institutions according to whether individuals have an exit option. I then make a case that exit-oriented liberalism is underappreciated, especially in its capacity to deal with boundary problems by enabling a competitive discovery procedure.",3
31.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,03 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-017-0379-y,Intertemporal capital substitution and Hayekian booms,September 2018,Simon Bilo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Booms and economic crises both come with reallocation of production factors. The symmetry can puzzle an economist who wants to explain business cycles with a theory that identifies reallocation as the cause of economic crises. Such a theory becomes hard-pressed to explain the existence of economic booms without referring to coincidental exogenous events. Krugman’s (2010) relatively recent comment in this regard reminds one of Haberler’s (1946, p. 71) and Hummel’s (1979), pp. 42–45) criticisms of the canonical versions of Hayek’s business cycle theory, such as Prices and Production (Hayek 1967 [1935]). The theory, which has seen some renewal of interest among economists (Cachanosky and Salter 2016), seeks to explain recessions as reallocations of previously misallocated production factors; however, it has little to say about the causes of booms. Hayek’s (1967 [1935]) cryptic comments on the topic highlight the failure of the theory to persuasively explain the existence of the boom occurring together with reallocation of production factors. Relatively recent contributions to the theory such as Garrison (2001, 2004) and Koppl (2014) also fail to address the problem. Garrison (2001, p. 70) states that Hayek’s framework implies a causality between monetary expansions and economic booms. However, his explanations—that this happens through a transfer of resources from the intermediate stages of production (Garrison 2004, p. 339) and possibly through higher and more intensive employment of labor and other production factors (Garrison 2001, p. 72; 2004, pp. 335, 345)—are only informal. He does not provide a causal price-theoretic mechanism connecting monetary expansions and economic booms. Koppl (2014, p. 37) addresses the related fact of low unemployment during economic booms and high unemployment during recessions and explains it by reference to differing demands for labor. Koppl’s explanation, unfortunately, begs the question because he does not present the underlying causes of the different demands for labor during recessions and booms and how these causes translate into different quantities of labor supplied on the level of the whole economy. Perhaps Garrison’s (2001, pp. 207–209 and 212–220) combination of the monetarist real-cash-balance effect, which connects higher money supply with a higher purchasing power of people, with Hayek’s theory could lead to such an explanation. However, Garrison—again—does not explain the mechanism through which the higher purchasing power translates into higher quantities supplied on the level of the economy as a whole. Taking a different approach than the one suggested by the real-cash-balance effect, I address below the puzzling origins of booms in Hayek’s theory with a model of what I call intertemporal capital substitution. One of the more critical assumptions of Hayek’s theory, also emphasized by Garrison (1984), is that production of final consumption goods takes place in time and consists of a set of production stages. Each stage consists of production factors with varying degrees of specificity. It has a certain temporal distance from final consumption, and it sells its output to the temporally following production stage. Changes in the real interest rate affect the relative profitability of investing in a particular stage and thereby its relative size measured in terms of the monetary value of the production factors it represents. This means, for example, that a decrease in the real interest rate disproportionately increases the present value of expected revenues from—and also the profitability of—the stages more remote from consumption. Nonspecific factors of production then respond to the lower interest rate by moving toward the more remote stages. The reallocation of factors toward these remote stages plays an important role in Hayek’s transmission mechanism, whereby an expansionary monetary shock leads to a liquidity effect and a decrease in the real interest rate. Hayek’s theory considers monetary expansion as what Tyler Cowen calls “the proverbial original sin” that starts the economic boom and changes the production structure. The end of the monetary expansion then leads to recession, at which time the real interest rate rises and the factors of production have to be reallocated. Although it is plausible that monetary expansion changes the allocations of production factors and the allocations become unsustainable when the expansion ends, it remains unclear why monetary expansion within the framework of Hayek’s theory causes an economic boom at all. Hayek is aware of this problem; however he hides his attempt to solve it in a long-forgotten footnote (1967 [1935], p. 93 n1), in which he explains the asymmetric consequences of increasing and decreasing the number of earlier stages, or, in his terminology, lengthening and shortening the production processes, after the monetary shock. The reason for this assymetry [sic] between a transition to longer processes of production, which need not bring about any of these peculiar disturbances, and a transition to shorter processes, which will regularly be accompanied by a crisis, will perhaps become more evident if it is considered that in the former case there will necessarily be time to amortize the capital invested in the existing structure before the new process is completed, while in the latter case this will evidently be impossible and therefore a loss of capital and a reduction of income inevitable. (Hayek 1967 [1935], p. 93 n1) In what follows, I build on this brief statement, in which Hayek explains the economic boom by reference to what economists now call “higher capital utilization” in the later stages of production. I model this transmission with an assumption of intertemporal profit maximization by the owners of durable specific capital goods in the later stages of production. With the exception of the single monetary shock in the model, the owners have perfect foresight regarding the future, which I assume to highlight that the conclusions of the model do not depend on money misperceptions or some expectation irrationalities. The persistent monetary shock in this model lowers the real interest rate for an extended period of time; and the relative profitability of the production stages that are closer to consumption decreases for that reason as well. Nonspecific production factors consequently are reallocated to the earlier stages of production. The reallocation cannot reach its full extent at once, however, because production has a temporal order even among the new earlier production stages. Some stages need new types of complementary, presumably specific, inputs that preceding stages have yet to produce, and this production takes time. Earlier production stages therefore have to wait until they can fully expand their output and to outbid a correspondingly greater number of nonspecific complementary factors from their initial employment in the later stages. The lag implies that while the demand for these nonspecific factors increases in the wake of the monetary shock, it does so to its full extent only later on. The owners of durable specific capital goods in the later stages of production expect the increase in the cost of nonspecific production factors that they employ, which opens for them a window of opportunity. They have an incentive to utilize a higher fraction of their durable capital goods earlier than they planned as the uses of these goods will be less profitable when the price of nonspecific complementary production factors increases. The higher use of the durable capital constitutes the initial economic boom and increases both the demand for nonspecific factors of production and the output of consumer goods.Footnote 1 In a sense, my model is similar to Hayek’s (1937) discussion of investment that raises the demand for capital at the end of the boom, where specific capital also increases demand for complementary production factors. Hayek argues that while it might not be profitable to plan on replacing specific capital goods in the earlier stages of production once they wear out, the owners might still decide to use the goods as long as the returns on the use cover the variable cost. This decision means that “nearly the whole amount which it was originally expected would be earned as interest and amortization becomes available” to the complementary production factors to finish the overall production process and naturally increases the demand for such factors (Hayek 1937, p. 175). In contrast, instead of concentrating on the end of the boom and the relatively early stages of production, as in Hayek’s case, my analysis focuses on the beginning of the boom and the relatively late production stages. My model also extends beyond the context of Hayek’s theory. First, it contributes to the work on irreversible investment under uncertainty, including Bernanke (1983), Majd and Pindyck (1987), Pindyck (1993), and Bar-Ilan and Strange (1996). In the spirit of Hayek’s analysis, these authors recognize that investment becomes specific to a limited number of tasks and thereby irreversible once undertaken. They, however, diverge from Hayek by applying the insight of irreversibility to firms’ ex ante investment decisions—that is, whether and when firms decide to invest. Following Hayek, my model looks at the effects of irreversible investment on firms’ decisions about output ex post—that is, after the investment. Rather than considering the situation where a firm decides about an investment that might yet turn sour, I therefore consider the Hayekian scenario, where a firm suddenly realizes that an already-incurred irreversible investment is the mistake that it ex ante wanted to avoid. Since my model emphasizes a firm’s decisions ex post, it relates even more closely to works on irreversible investment under uncertainty such as those by Dixit (1989), (1992). He points out that the existence of incurred irreversible investment indeed affects firms’ decisions. It can delay otherwise-desired exit from the market. Rather than considering the binary choice of entry and exit, however, my model focuses on the output decisions of a firm that previously made an irreversible investment decision that is mistaken from today’s perspective. Works representing the second stream of literature that my model relates to, discuss the issue of capacity utilization. Notably, Greenwood et al. (1988) and Greenwood et al. (2000) view capital utilization and capital depreciation as two related endogenous variables. Firms’ choice over utilization and depreciation matters in these works because the old—already-existing—capital and the newly produced capital are two separate types of goods. A positive productivity shock that pertains only to the new capital decreases firms’ opportunity cost of higher utilization and depreciation of the old type of capital. The shock therefore leads to higher employment and output. My model shares with these models the idea that capacity utilization and capital depreciation are endogenous variables that can explain the dynamics of business cycles, with two important differences, however. First, the model pertains to the consequences of monetary shocks rather than those of real shocks. And second, while Greenwood et al. (1988) and Greenwood et al. (2000) find that higher output, employment, and capital utilization can be explained by existence of more efficient substitutes for the capital in use, my model explains these variables by reference to an expected increase in the price of nonspecific complements. The model therefore builds a connection between monetary shocks and capital utilization. It is—to my knowledge—a novel explanation of the stylized fact of pro-cyclical capacity utilization as evidenced in Basu (1996), Stock and Watson (1999, pp. 21, 31, 42), and Basu and Fernald (2001, pp. 276–277). In what follows, I first give a brief explanation of the mechanism of the reallocation of production factors in Hayek’s business cycle theory. I then build a model of intertemporal allocation of durable specific capital and show how it explains the presence of Hayekian booms.",

Martin,Nikolai G. Wenzel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How are we to organize collective action? James Buchanan (1975) famously worried about the possibility of empowering the productive state without lapsing into the predatory state. We turn to the writings of F.A. Hayek for answers. Hayek devoted a half century to such questions, culminating in his great works on The Constitution of Liberty and Law, Legislation and Liberty – along with many ancillary but formidable essays on philosophy, politics and economics. At the broadest level, Hayek argued in these writings for the desirability of liberty and the need to limit and structure the state in such a way that liberty would be preserved. Compared to the contemporary welfare states found in both postwar Europe and the USA, Hayek’s prescription would certainly have been to shrink government in terms of its budgetary size and also in terms of its power over citizens and activities in a society – in other words, to reduce the scope of the state. The argument Hayek used to reach these conclusions were not, however, free of internal tension. On the one hand, Hayek’s epistemological foundation for limited government is among his most important and radical (see Wenzel 2010). He argues powerfully that no central planner has sufficient knowledge to run an economy, and furthermore that no one has sufficient knowledge to determine ends for others (see, especially, Hayek 1945, 1960). Pushed to their logical conclusion, these arguments seem to prescribe the smallest possible state in both scope and size, or perhaps even no state at all (as argued recently, for example, by Stringham 2015). Elsewhere in his writings, however, Hayek endorses government activity that goes far beyond a “night watchman” state. He explicitly renounces laissez faire and affirms that “[t]he range and variety of government action that is, at least in principle, reconcilable with a free system is…considerable. The old formulae of laissez faire or non-intervention do not provide us with an adequate criterion for distinguishing between what is and what is not admissible in a free system” (Hayek 1960, 231). By endorsing what we identify as a “supra” minimal scope for the state, Hayek approves of state provision not only of defense and justice – but also “certain publick works and publick institutions” (Smith 1981[1776], IV.ix.51, 687–688), such as infrastructure, roads and bridge, along with social insurance, conscription, a minimum safety net, and even countercyclical investment (see Hayek 2007[1944], 120 or 1979, 44 and 59). These supra-minimal state tasks, despite Hayek’s careful conditions on how they ought to be executed in a way consistent with liberty, appear to violate the lessons of Hayek’s own teachings on political economy. Section Two describes Hayek’s wide scope for a productive state; it also examines the constraints Hayek believed would prevent this wide scope from endangering liberty. Section Three contends that Hayek’s own articulation of the knowledge problem renders these constraints impotent. We grapple with this somewhat confounding result in our conclusion.",1

Leaving aside the theory of value (on which it is impossible to find authors as far apart as Ricardo and Marx, on the one hand, and Böhm-Bawerk, on the other) and avoiding to focus on the theory of interest (which was, however, Böhm-Bawerk’s final aim and success) as well as on the more recent theory of fluctuations (which was, by contrast, Hayek’s new aim), it remains to be seen whether Schumpeter’s statement holds with regard to the theory of capital and to its crucial concept of the higher productivity of time-consuming methods of production. In the following decades many scholars have focused exclusively either on the classical or on the Austrian theory of capital while just a few of them have extended their analysis to the similarities between the two theories.Footnote 1
 Now, if one focuses exclusively on capital, one can realize that these ‘roots’ can be noticed not only in Ricardo but also in other classical authors in so far as they shared, or tried to improve, the theory of capital inherited from Adam Smith. In this sense, Böhm-Bawerk’s theory can be viewed not only as a link between the classical and the Austrian theory of capital, but also as a condition for the further development of this theory as carried out, on the one hand, by John Hicks and, on the other, by Austrian economists of a more recent generation. Under this perspective it is necessary to mention not only the book on the theory of capital published by von Hayek (1952) [1941] at the end of a series of controversies on these and related issues,Footnote 2 but also, and above all, the books on the same theory published by Lachmann (1978) and Kirzner (1996) at the beginning of the so-called ‘Austrian revival”. The two protagonists of this revival opened the door to a series of successive developments and reconstructions some of which are based on the Menger-Lachmann trajectory (see Harper and Endres 2010), while others are rooted in Böhm-Bawerk’s own theory (see Hennings 1997). Among the most recent literature, we can mention here Garrison (2001),Footnote 3 who has tried to build a capital-based macroeconomics open to a dialogue between the Austrian and other streams of economic theory, and Lewin (2011) who, as a student of Lachmann, has extended the latter’s analysis to modern issues such as business organizationFootnote 4 and human capital.Footnote 5
 This paper is accordingly divided in two Parts. Part I will focus on the similarities (and dissimilarities) between Adam Smith (as leader of the classical theory of capital), Böhm-Bawerk (as leader of the corresponding Austrian theory) and Hicks (as leader of the derived neo-Austrian approach to this theory). Part II will focus instead on the dissimilarities (and similarities) between Böhm-Bawerk and the following neo-Austrian authors who eventually turned the theory of capital (and its principal agent, the capitalist) inherited from the classics into the theory of entrepreneurship (and its exclusive agent, the entrepreneur).",3

Very little is, however, known about his early writings. This work remains unavailable to English-speaking scholars because it has not been translated yet. In 1902, Mises began his stream of academic publications with The Development of the Relationship between Lords of Manor and Peasants in Galicia, 1772–1848 that he wrote under the supervision of Carl Grünberg (1861–1940), a Marxist historian and member of the Younger German Historical School (Schumpeter 1954b). His contemporaries praised the first academic publication of the future distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association for an excellent historical study as a part of the Knapp-Grünberg research program (Wimbersky 1906; Kaser 1904).Footnote 1 Over Christmas of 1903, Mises made a transition from the Historical to the Austrian School (Hülsmann 2007; Pallas 2005; Kirzner 2001; Butler 1988; Rothbard 1988; and Edwards 1985).Footnote 2 He read Menger’s Principles (1871) which in his own view made him an economist (Mises [1978] 2009). Mises acknowledged that his early work was more historical rather than economic research, though he pointed out his antagonism towards the methodology of the Historical School (Mises, [1978] 2009: 6). Mises held very critical views of Hegelianism and its influence on historicism and Marxism. Like many of his contemporaries, Mises was influenced by the ideas of interventionism (ibid.,11). And he had “no interest in the Austrian School” when he enrolled in the University of Vienna in the fall of 1900 (ibid., 250). Mises enrolled in the University of Vienna because of his interest in history and law, not economics. By that time, the Methodenstreit had ended which resulted in the descent of the Historical School from its prominent role in the German-speaking academia (Caldwell 2001; Pearson 1999; Roll 1992). He, however, wrote his first academic publication on the topic of the liberation of peasants under Austrian rule which was a widely studied subject by the Younger German Historical School, including his professor Carl Grünberg. von Mises (1902) received exceptionally positive reviews from several representatives of the Historical School, including that by Kaser (1904) “in the principal organ of the German socialist of the chair, Schmoller’s Jahrbuch” (Hülsmann 2007). Hülsmann(2007) is the only biography of Mises that reviews his very first academic publication. While Greaves and McGee (1993) and Rothbard (1988) mention this work, Pallas (2005), Kirzner (2001), Butler (1988), and Edwards (1985) do not discuss it.Footnote 3 As a matter of fact, historians consider von Mises (1902) an excellent study of the liberation of serfs in Galicia, Eastern European part of the Austrian Empire (Chaloupek 2012; Struve 2008; Blum 1945). Simons (1971), who has reviewed the Polish studies on the peasant revolt of 1846 in Galicia, considers von Mises (1902) the representative of the Austrian historians with great expertise in that topic. Contemporaries of Mises praised his work for the following features: continuation of the Knapp-Grünberg tradition, an excellent study of the Vienna archive, and a thorough literature review of both German- and Polish-language sources (Wimbersky 1906; Kaser 1904). We argue that von Mises (1902) does not represent the tradition of the Historical School.Footnote 4 First, the work is not written as an anti-rationalist ideological historical case study with a focus on superindividuality. His focus is on a rationalization of the history through understanding the behavior of Austrian rulers, bureaucrats, landlords, and serfs. Second, Mises does not support the Knapp-Grünberg argument about the historical development of serfdom under a Slavic rule as compared to a German rule. Third, we find that von Mises (1902), especially, his skepticism of the Prussian bureaucracy, puts his work at odds with the ideology of the Historical School.Footnote 5 Menger’s Principles was the seed that fell on fertile ground. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the intellectual environment which influenced Mises as a young scholar. Section 3 examines von Mises (1902). Section 4 contains the concluding remarks.",1

The fact that human beings have subjective values, he argued, is not contingent, but is universal and axiomatic. This fact is the cornerstone of his theory, and the justification for his claim that history is concerned with individual choices. This point was almost completely overlooked in reviews of the book, and historians to this day have had essentially nothing to say about subjective value theory. Of all the historians who reviewed or mentioned Theory and History, only Louis Hacker’s review in of the book in the New York Times mentions Mises’ views on subjective value. Hacker was an economic historian who began his career as a progressive under the tutelage of Charles Beard, moved into Marxism, and ultimately developed a conservative appreciation of capitalism (Zeman 1998) Unfortunately, Hacker’s treament Mises on subjective value was brief and superficial (Hacker 1957). Mises’ stress on subjective value must have seemed strange for an American audience reared on empiricism and epistemology. For them, the term “subjectivity” referred to the subjectivitiy of facts, not of values. Most historians recognize that an understanding of history begins with an epistemological question: “how can we know the truth about the past?” Historians believe is is their duty to draw the contours of what is knowable, and explain the methods by which we can gain objective knowledge of the past. In this view, history is a critical discipline of sorting through empirical evidence to find patterns and meaning. In the empiricist tradition, the only relevant knowledge of the past comes from sensory experience. Mises rejected this kind of historicism and argued that some knowledge of the logic of human action could be located outside of history. But since the professionalization of history in the late nineteenth century, and the rejection of speculative history, most historians have rejected attempts to locate historical knowledge outside of empirical observation. Divine providence, a Hegelian spirit, or other forces driving histoy forward lie outside of the evidence. Instead, it is objective treatment of the evidence, which, according to Peter Novick, “has been the quality which the profession has prized and praised above all others” (Novick 1988). Although historians recognized that pure objectivity is not reachable, it may at least be considered a goal of scientific inquiry. There is of course no way to survey the views of all American historians of the period, but their writings about their own discipline demonstrate a few common perspectives that might indicate how they would have understood Mises’ views on subjective values and the individual. First, we can recognize a sort of anti-philosophical ecumenicism, in which historians refused to consider or take a position on theoretical issues. About this, W.B. Gallie wrote in 1964 that historians “show an almost pathological disincliation to commit themselves to any general statements about their work, its aims, subject-matter and methods…” They wish that “no approaches or avenues, no styles or methods even, are excluded in advance or a priori” (Gallie 1964, page 53.). Since Mises was defending a particular and narrowed form of historical inquiry, some readers might have rejected his views on subjective value as overly rigid. The stress on “common sense” at the expense of philosophy may have played a significant role in turning historians away from Mises. In his book Understanding History (1950) the historian Louis Gottschalk described the historical method as simply the method of learning from the past, of arranging facts chronologically and considering the importance of tempoarlity in one’s analysis. For Gottschalk, “philosophy” was something that people had. For example, each historian, he wrote, has a philosophy which shapes the way they approach the evidence. Gottschalk didn’t define philosophy as a process or argumentation with the intention of seeking the truth (Gottschalk 1969). History, in this view, was a form of empirical social science. While historians could cooperate with social scientists, historians were ultimately resonsible for checking the generalizations of social science. In essence, the difference between the two disciplines was that social scientists made general abstractions, and historians cared about particular phenomena for their own sake. As Gottschalk’s work demonstrates, historians did not propose a theory of subjective value to defend the importance of the individual and the particular in history. Take, for example, the Univeristy of Kansas history professor, James Malin, who had a visceral reaction against any kind of artificial construct of social science. For Malin, the individual historical person was unique and particular, and could not be “measured or analyzed by application of a formula” (Malin 1954, page 2.). This might, on the surface, be thought similar to Mises’ views about methodological individualism. Although Mises believed the individual was the only historical actor, he did not deny the use of all social scientific constructs. Malin also believed strongly in the indpendent existence of an objective past. He despised any form of relativism and any attempt to make history useful for the present. History-as-actuality, he thought, existed outside of the mind of the historian, and was valuable for its own sake. Mises’ view here was more similar to that of the English historian R.G. Collingwood. For Mises, history was about reconstructing ideas from the past. History had no value for its own sake, but was only valued insofar as it satisfied the subjective desires of individuals.",1

Mill’s expansive scholarship is a prime example. His enduring On Liberty (Mill 1977) remains a staple of free speech, privacy, and paternalism debates in philosophy. His closely related work in economics, by contrast, has not been so fortunate. Mill’s early support for laissez-faire, turning latterly to socialism, rendered him a slightly confused figure in the canon, standing uneasily between classical and modern liberalism (Gaus 1983). Along with his involvement in the East India Company, it became easy to characterize Mill as an apologist of bourgeois liberalism with too little to offer either the industrial working class or those exploited under colonialism. This is what makes Persky’s (2016) study enormously valuable. Equal parts history of thought, intellectual biography, study in political economy, and radical manifesto, The Political Economy of Progress uncovers historical fault lines that show where different conceptions of political economy separated and, perhaps, how they might be re-united. Persky revives a radical Mill who was deeply, if imperfectly, engaged with the economic challenges of his time. He was keen to imagine a better, inclusive future and wanted to develop a social science that would help achieve it. In what follows, I outline the contribution of each chapter, noting some of the historical links that Persky uncovers. Then I introduce two problems facing radical political economy. The first is that normative demands for substantial material equality can end up being allied to exclusionary politics, including nationalism and eugenics. The second is a weakness in the account of capital accumulation that Mill, as well as subsequent Marxist, and even neo-classical, economists have used to link capitalism with inevitably rising inequality. Austrian market process theory contests this account, suggesting that the radical critique of capitalism is partly misplaced.",5

Thomas,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The analysis of central planning and interventionism and their respective consequences for the market process are among the most significant contributions of Austrian Economics (Mises 1929; Mises 1951; Mises 1949; Hayek 1945;Lavoie 1985; Boettke 1998). Contributions in the Virginia Political Economy tradition similarly emphasize the causes and consequences of intervention (Tullock 1989, Tullock 1967). As Boettke and Leeson (2004) point out, scholars in the Public choice and Austrian economics tradition have relaxed different methodological assumptions in their respective contributions to this literature. While Public Choice scholarship challenged the benevolence assumption underlying public interest theories of government intervention, Austrian economists challenged the assumption of intellectual perfection underlying the same theories (Boettke and Leeson 2004, 355). In their contributions to the literature on intervention, public choice scholars have showed persuasively that intervention usually comes with concentrated beneficiaries who have an incentive to lobby for regulation (Tullock 1967). Austrian insights on intervention have emphasized the detrimental implications of socialism (Mises 1929, 1951, 1949; Hayek 1944, 1945) as well as interventionism for the market process (Mises 1929, 1949; Rothbard 1970; Kirzner 1985; Ikeda 1997). But while scholars in both fields seem to intuitively understand that intervention often creates redistribution from lower income households to the middle class, an empirically observable trend that has been called Director’s Law of Public Income Redistribution (Stigler 1970), there has been little systematic inquiry into the distributional consequences of interventionism. Put differently, there are few theoretical predictions or empirical explorations of the composition of the group of bearers of the dispersed costs of regulation (Olson 1971). One reason for the lack of inquiry into the distributional consequences of regulation is that on the flip side of concentrated benefits are dispersed costs, which by virtue of the fact that they are dispersed, are difficult to measure and trace. In fact, Hayek (1945, 71) suggests that “there is usually a surplus of interests which could show that particular measures would confer immediate and obvious benefits on some, while the harm they caused was much more indirect and difficult to see”. Hayek’s point in this quote is very similar to Frederic Bastiat’s (1995) famous broken window fallacy. To the horror of the economics profession, the obvious consequence of the broken window, that is the extra business for the glazier, has caused many to jump to the conclusion that sometimes breaking a window may not be such a bad thing. The unseen cost to the baker, the loss of a suit, often goes unnoticed. This fallacy remains pervasive in public discourse and Austrian economists continue to work hard to remind the public of the unseen costs of destruction. But we have a really hard time doing this, precisely because the costs are unseen and difficult to estimate. I argue here that systematically applying Austrian insights to the dispersed costs side of the analysis of intervention can help us offer a better sense of how large those costs may be and who tends to bear them. Put differently, we can offer some more substantive pattern predictions about the distributional consequences of interventionism. An emergent literature on the regressive effects of regulation highlights those distributional consequences both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. This paper proceeds as follows, the next section reviews the literature on interventionism and regulation from the Austrian and Public Choice perspectives and beyond. Section three provides a list of four theoretical predictions regarding the distributional consequences of regulation by applying some standard public choice and Austrian economics insights. Section four reviews the existing empirical evidence on the distributional consequences of regulation. Section five concludes.",4
31.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,17 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-018-0420-9,The nature and limits of Gary Becker’s theory of racial discrimination,December 2018,Sanford Ikeda,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The analysis of discrimination in the social sciences before Becker, at least according to Becker, was primarily in sociology and psychology although he mentions Donald Dewey (1952) as an earlier contributor in economics. Becker notes (1957: 13n2) that psychologist Gordon Allport treats racial discrimination as the result of error about, among other things, the inferior productivity of Blacks compared to Whites (Allport 1955). Others viewed racial discrimination as inherent in capitalism, which gives Whites an advantage in economics and politics that they use to privilege themselves over Blacks. In each case, market capitalism enables Whites to gain at the expense of Blacks. Becker’s contribution is to show counter-intuitively that under capitalism, or more specifically market competition, 1) that Whites bear a cost for discriminating against Blacks, 2) that while Whites might gain overall against Blacks by discriminating, some Whites actually lose from it while some Blacks actually gain, and 3) if Blacks attempted to retaliate by discriminating against Whites, Blacks would be net losers. Overall, taking discrimination as given, Whites and Blacks behave rationally not erroneously, but competitive markets tend to “soften” the impact of their “taste for discrimination.” In the Instruction to his 1957 book, Becker refers to his contribution as the development of a theory of “non-pecuniary motivation” in the sense that it explores “the use of non-monetary considerations in dealing whether to hire, work with, or buy from an individual or group” (Becker 1957: 11). This can work both ways – a prejudice against (discrimination) or a bias in favor (nepotism) an individual or group. I have attempted to remedy this neglect by developing a theory of discrimination in the market place that supplements the psychologists’ and sociologists’ analysis of causes with an analysis of economic consequences (1957: 11). This “supplement” consists of conceptualizing discrimination in terms of the difference in the money wages of distinct (racial) groups, which he claims “gets at the essence of prejudice and discrimination” (1957: 14). His aim is to formulate a theory that is at least testable in principle, a methodological concern characteristic of the University of Chicago’s empirically minded economics faculty at the time (Friedman 1966: 7). Unlike Allport’s approach, Becker’s discriminators do not make mistakes. In addition to employers, Becker goes on to trace the consequences of non-pecuniary motivation on the part of fellow workers and of customers, as well as what happens when discriminators operate in markets with market power. He demonstrates how racist behavior imposes a cost on the discriminator and the “discriminatee.”",2
31.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,04 July 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-017-0394-z,Moral markets: A marginalistic interpretation of Adam Smith,December 2018,Walter G. Castro,Rafael E. Beltramino,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Adam Smith was a moral philosopher before fathering economics. His Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS) dates from 1759, and his “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” (WN) is from 1776. Various authors have stated that these two works are part of a unique and coherent intellectual construction. In particular, James Otteson proposed an interesting analogy about the structure of moral and economic rules, stating that for Adam Smith, both of them develop from an exchange of information between people cooperating with each other and interacting in a market, a concept that underlies the human interactions described in TMS and WN (Otteson 2002: 6–7). Otteson finds in TMS the process of the delimitation of a moral market in which sentiments, behaviors, and judgments of approval are exchanged. Basing our interpretation on certain passages of TMS and exploring Otteson’s thesis, we will attempt to show that moral phenomena are a type of market process. To do so, we will state a theory about the emergence of moral rules through what we think it is a Moral Market Process, in open opposition to what can be called an economic analysis of morals.Footnote 1 We will attempt to show the existence of a Moral Market through the description of its main elements. First, we will state the existence of a moral problem, demonstrated by human’s scarcity of affection, which is cushioned partly by the formation of a Moral Market. To demonstrate the existence of this Moral Market, we will show the existence of moral exchanges of individuals demanding and supplying sentiments, behaviors, and judgments of approval and converging on moral prices. We will also suggest that moral prices are determined and vary marginally toward an assumed moral price of equilibrium that is set by the most universal moral rules of justice as a system of signals guiding the agent’s actions in the Moral Market. It is clear that Smith never wrote about moral markets, prices, moral demand or supply, or marginalistic determination. Therefore, these terms represent our own interpretation of Smith’s ideas. We agree with Smith when he writes that moral relationships (moral exchanges, for us) are explained ab initio by the principle of sympathyFootnote 2 rather than by the utility principle, which explains economic relationships.Footnote 3 Moral exchanges are not initially the result of calculation; they are formed gradually through emotional behaviors that slowly give form to a different cognitive instance that is reflexive and deliberate. Therefore, agents may realize ex post their convenience, subsequently strengthening, for utilitarian reasons, the sympathetic origin that characterizes moral relationships. As a result of the process of interpersonal exchanges, moral prices emerge as social standards of what is right or appropriate, first in the agent’s sentiments and later, at a rational level, in the sympathy that mediates their judgments of approval. In this sense, the idea of moral exchange is latent in TMS when Smith describes a sympathetic relationship in which the agent moderates his conduct to obtain the approval of a spectator. This moral relationship appears only if both agent and spectator can match their sentiments. First, the spectator, thanks to an effort of his imagination, sympathizes with the agent, although with a sentiment of lower intensity than the one the agent is experiencing. However, the agent must control his ways of expressing his sentiments through his behavior to obtain the spectator’s sympathy. In TSM, Smith describes thoroughly and with examples the socialization process (moral market, for us), showing how an agent reaches a tacit agreement with a spectator of sentiments of the first order and then how both, based on the same principle of sympathy, attempt to obtain the moral approval of a spectator of the second order or a meta-spectator and so on, until they achieve the approval of an Impartial Spectator. Smith uses the metaphor of a spectator whom he gradually places farther away from the original event, signifying with this rhetorical figure of speech the increasing level of objectivity and impartiality of his judgments—that is, of moral rules (Smith 1790:68/72). Smith also finds in the regularity of certain ways of feeling, behaving, and judging by the agents and in the usual adoption of certain moral relationships the cause that would explain the spontaneous appearance of these rules. These rules promote harmony and concord, stating the moral approbation of a behavior. In our hypothesis, moral rules are the result of the process of exchanges that determines the moral equilibrium prices to which every moral market tends to arrive, regardless of its purpose and scope. We suggest that whereas in economics the free market’s efficiency tends to gradually remove poverty (or at least change its definition), in the same sense, the moral market tends to gradually remove conflict,Footnote 4 reaching greater social harmony through free moral relationships of greater concord and justice in the absence of sufficient relationships based on love and benevolence. From this perspective, we conclude that a legislator or a judge who makes or interprets laws against the free and spontaneous process of the formation of moral rules interferes with the moral prices of the system. We can call these tamperings “moral price controls” that affect the order’s harmony, increasing the level of conflict in social relationships. After this introduction, In section II, we define some of the main conceptual tools of our work. In section III, we posit the existence of Moral Markets, and we suggest a marginalistic analysis of them. In section IV, we propose a mechanism for the determination of moral prices considering the different kinds of moral exchanges. Finally, in section V, we consider three particular problems: the problem of rationality in moral exchanges, our interpretation of Smith’s metaphor of the Impartial Spectator, and the consequences of intervention in moral markets.",

In an interview she gave to the Austrian Economics Newsletter, Shenoy remembered her “longest connection to the Austrian movement” (Shenoy 2003, 1). Her father, Bellikoth Raghunath Shenoy (1905–1978), a student of Hayek’s in the 1930s at LSE, was “the only liberal economist between Athens and Tokyo”.Footnote 3 He deeply influenced his daughter’s political vision as well as her economic analysis. Shenoy remembered that although Murray Rothbard’s Man, Economy, and State and Israel Kirzner’s studies on entrepreneurship were fundamental for her decision to become an economist, it was Hayek’s works on political philosophy, which greatly impressed her. Both The Constitution of Liberty, and Law, Legislation and Liberty were crucial to understanding the central role of market in social orders, being the market which precedes the state and not vice versa. Along with Hayek’s works, Shenoy was deeply impressed by Menger’s analysis of institutions: The older Austrians were examining institutions and social forces that had already developed in people's actions. Then they were trying to work out the principles that are implicit in how people are acting. The point is that they realized that there was already a market economy out there working. They began to see that people were acting on rules that were first manifested in people’s actions and then articulated. This is like language. It is a way of understanding the origins and background of Austrian analytics. The ""something"" they are analyzing is preexisting, not created by one mind or one generation but over a long period of time. The older Austrians were the latest in this analytical line. (Shenoy 2003, 3) From a methodological perspective, Shenoy recognized some peculiar regularities in economic behavior, and the importance of the historical framework in order to understand them. She explicitly criticized the methodological turning point that occurred in economics in the 1930s; i.e., the adoption of mathematics and the method of natural science in economics, which determined the rupture between the discipline and its real object of study: human action and its application, which is, according to her, not related with a rational economic agent, but with the complex dynamics of social phenomena, which are the object of economic history. Shenoy explicitly followed McCloskey’s argument that economists are not scientists, but story-telling historians: “neoclassical economists are even further removed from even the remotest possibility of learning about the issues involved in studying human action” (Shenoy 2010, 60). Shenoy’s research field was focused around the historical origins and causes of development: her main theoretical efforts were directed to present an endogenous theory of progress. Her Ph.D. thesis dealt with modern England as a case study to show the evolution of Western countries towards a flourishing economy as well as a liberal democracy. In her works, she applied Austrian categoriesFootnote 4 to underdeveloped countries in order to test the validity of those categories and to show the disutility of any governmental policy oriented to promote development (she deeply criticized the massive planned regulation in India, during the 1960s and 1970s, whose aim was to promote development), including Keynesianism. Following Hayek’s suggestions (Hayek 1944), she regarded interventionism as a way to a dangerous escalation towards corruption, illiberalism, and even totalitarianism.",3

Aldrich,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Their book comes at an important time for two reasons. First, while some politicians continue to deny its validity, climate change and rising sea levels are contributing to more regular and more damaging disasters. While named storms such as Hurricanes Mitchell, Sandy, and Katrina have been among the most visible recent disasters in North America, nations around the world are facing more frequent typhoons, mudslides, and other extreme weather consequences. In the 2000s, for example, the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT, accessible at http://www.emdat.be/) recorded ten times as many disasters in the Americas as was reported in the 1960s. See Fig. 1 below for a graphical representation of this monotonic upwards trend. This is not a function of better record keeping or a result of the still rare natural-technological disasters such as the meltdowns as the Fukushima nuclear power plants in Tohoku, Japan. Instead, anthropogenic global climate change has made all of us more likely to be affected by disasters. Even politically conservative Gulf Coast parishes such as Houma in Louisiana are investing in a variety of strategies to handle the simultaneous problems of subsidence and rising tides. Now, more than ever, we need to understand the mechanisms that drive disaster recovery and risk mitigation. Natural Disasters in the Americas Between 1940 and 2015. Second, assumptions about the role of the federal government have shifted dramatically over the past century. In the late nineteenth century the United States faced several large scale disasters, such as the 1881 Great Fire in Michigan, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1889 Johnstown flood. These events had serious consequences: 5000 Michigan residents became homeless due to the fire; in San Francisco, some 5000 people died under the crush of fallen structures or from the fires that burned for three days following the earthquake. More than 2000 people in Pennsylvania passed away in the flood. Yet the federal government did not provide any serious assistance to evacuees and victims. Instead, what we would call a non governmental organization - the Red Cross under the leadership of Clara Barton - set up food, water, aid, and shelter for the survivors (Roberts 2013). In San Francisco, an ever expanding industrial economy borne out of the post-Civil War era helped speed its recovery (Vale and Campanella 2005). There was no outcry over this lack of assistance or demands from local residents for political accountability for the recovery. Our society used to envision disaster response and recovery as the purview of residents and local organizations, not the national government. In the early twenty-first century our norms now center around the role of federal agencies, especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which is now nested in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in crisis situations. Opinion polls and popular culture alike reflect a strong expectation that when floods, fires, or tornados strike, it will be the government, and not local citizens, who lead and sustain the recovery. For example, a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation Poll in 2011 showed that more than 60 % of 1000 respondents had a great deal or a moderate amount of confidence in the federal government’s ability to respond to future disasters. None of the survey questions asked about the ability of local faith based organizations, voluntary groups, civil society organizations, or local government units to take on such challenges. Our norms create unrealistic expectations about the size and scope of government response to catastrophe and may lead local residents to wait for assistance. 
Community Revival in the Wake of Disaster pushes against our government-centered narrative to argue that local citizens self organize and use trust and collective mobilization to bounce back after disaster. Rather than waiting for top down government assistance, the book shows how local entrepreneurs moved quickly and decisively to jumpstart the rebuilding process. Here it joins a growing number of other books on resilience post disaster which emphasize bottom up responses to crisis (cf. Kage 2010, Chamlee-Wright 2010, Aldrich 2012). While the books making up this nascent literature on organic, local approaches to resilience diverge in some ways, they share a common core. They all argue that social capital serves as a critical resource in the post disaster sphere. These works recognize the power of the community to work collectively and its ability to influence individual decisions, such as exit or voice, that every survivor must confront. Finally, these books all share a belief in the role of social networks in critical informational distribution, known formally as the signal to noise problem. That is, they recognize that social networks are best positioned to provide trusted, trustworthy information at a critical moment. It is worth reflecting on how social ties play a role in disaster situations.",5

Buchanan’s 1981 visit to Chile: Knightian democrat or defender of the ‘Devil’s fix’?,March 2019,Andrew Farrant,Vlad Tarko,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Is “enlightened dictatorship” a viable path for economic development? Economic growth under politically authoritarian regimes, whether Lee Kuan Yew’s Singapore, General Park Chung-hee’s South Korea, Chiang Kai-shek’s Taiwan, Deng Xiaoping’s China, Greece under the regime of the Colonels, and Pinochet’s Chile appears to provide a positive answer. However, various other growth disasters (e.g., Portugal under Salazar and Idi Amin’s Uganda) suggest that the particular examples noted above (e.g., Singapore and South Korea) are highly unusual outliers which are far from easy to replicate. Indeed, there is ample evidence to show that the gamble of ‘wise and benevolent’ dictatorship is a high-variance wager (Tullock 1987; Easterly 2014). Similarly, there is much evidence suggesting that democracy is statistically associated with growth (Acemoglu et al. 2008, 2014; Peev and Mueller 2012; Sylwester 2015). Although the debate over the merits of enlightened autocracy and benevolent dictatorship is far from over (e.g. see Sachs 2012a, b; Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Easterly 2011), there are important similarities between contemporary assessments of ‘benevolent autocracy’ (e.g., Easterly 2014), and Paul A. Samuelson’s late 1970s and early 1980s analysis of “capitalist fascism” (e.g., Samuelson 1983: 75). The most controversial historical example of “capitalist fascism” is probably Pinochet’s Chile. Indeed, Samuelson repeatedly singled out Chile in his own writings on the topic. As Samuelson himself noted, “some keep hoping for an efficient fascism, one that will promote material efficiency … It is the conservatives’ ‘final solution’ to stagflation … The recent Chilean case may be used to illustrate a paradigm” (1980: 815–816). In particular, Samuelson viewed “efficient fascism” as the “Devil’s Fix That Does Not Fix” (1983: 75): The “cure” usually “turns out to be worse than the disease. Dictators tend to be venal … Their henchman … [perpetrate] all the foolish market interventions that Adam Smith warned against” (Samuelson 1980: 815). Although the Chilean “Chicago boys” – primarily students of Arnold Harberger (e.g., Sergio de Castro) – played an intimate role in both the initial design and subsequent implementation of Pinochet’s economic reforms (see Valdes 1995), a number of prominent Mont Pélerin Society (MPS) members including Milton Friedman, Gordon Tullock, Friedrich Hayek and James Buchanan made several rather controversial mid-late 1970s and early 1980s visits to Chile (Fischer 2009, Maclean 2017). For instance, Sigmund (1982: 35) reports that the Chilean “Chicago boys” regularly “flew American professors such as ... Hayek … Harberger, and James Buchanan to Santiago to express their approval of the [regime’s] new programs.” Similarly, Wilson (1992: 77) writes that “Friedman ... Hayek, James Buchanan, Gordon Tullock, all the stars in the firmament of monetarism and public choice, were on hand from 1973 as unhidden (hired) hands to guide General Pinochet’s military dictatorship according to their economic theory.” In addition, the MPS held a particularly controversial meeting in Chile in late 1981 and this meeting appears to provide further credence to the frequently encountered charge that the MPS had an intimate mid-late 1970s and early 1980s relationship with Pinochet’s military dictatorship (see e.g., Plehwe 2009, Dean 2014: 155, Barder 2013: 114). Although the relationship between the MPS and the Pinochet Junta has attracted much negative commentary in the ever-burgeoning literature on neoliberalism and the MPS, this paper primarily focuses on one particular aspect of that far larger story: The charge that James M. Buchanan defended Pinochet’s dictatorship because it provided a stellar “opportunity for the application … [of Buchanan’s mid-late 1970s] proposals for constitutional reform” (Lehmann 1990: 79). For example, Cunningham (2002) notes that Buchanan visited Chile after the 1973 coup to provide “economic advice to the military government … [and] talk at the headquarters of the Admiralty in Viña Del Mar where the coup (proximately originated)” (120).Footnote 1 Although similar charges can be found in Maclean’s (2017) much-vaunted analysis of Buchanan’s early 1980s visits to Chile, Maclean’s narrative primarily focuses on Buchanan’s May 1980 visit and only briefly mentions Buchanan’s late 1981 participation in the MPS meeting in Chile. Accordingly, our analysis here primarily focuses on the charge that Buchanan’s 1981 MPS paper provided an analytical defense of military rule in Chile (see, e.g., Fischer 2009: 325). According to Plehwe (2009), the “links between General Pinochet and Milton Friedman are fairly well known … [but Karin Fischer’s] account of the role of the economists [Friedrich] Hayek and James Buchanan … demonstrates the extent to which neoliberal knowledge and capacity building extended well beyond the economic sphere.” (32). Indeed, Fischer argues that because of the heavy “‘Chicago’ focus characterizing Chile’s road to neoliberalism, the Virginia School’s influence has been underemphasized and conflated with that of the Chicago School” (Fischer 2009, p. 324). In particular, Fischer argues that Buchanan “delivered a highly abstract paper titled ‘Limited or Unlimited Democracy’ to the Mont Pèlerin Society meeting in Viña del Mar in Chile in 1981,” and reportedly told his audience that an “[un]limited democracy was a polity predisposed to disable a political market that would otherwise promote the most efficient allocation of scarce resources.” Consequently, the “only meaningful task of the government would be to deprive the polity of its ability to do so” (2009: 325). Fischer’s assessment of Buchanan’s 1981 paper (titled “Democracy: limited or unlimited” and never published in English) and public choice theory owes much to Stepan (1985) who charges that the Virginia School sought to turn the “state into a firm” and wanted to atomize “civil society into an apolitical market” (1985: 323). Although Fischer adopts Stepan’s basic interpretation of the Virginia School – public choice theory “sought to limit democracy ... [and] depoliticize the state in order to enable unconstrained market forces to guide human interaction” (2009: 325) – she argues that the Pinochet junta “was committed to using its governmental powers in precisely this manner,” and Buchanan’s MPS paper consequently provided “theoretical support for the regime” (2009: 325). Indeed, the “neoliberal utopia of a society self-regulated by the market” was seemingly “just within reach, fostered of course by a military regime with absolute political power” (325). We argue that any reading of Buchanan’s MPS paper which views Buchanan’s analysis as a defense of military rule in Chile is significantly wide of the mark. For one thing, the evidence shows that Buchanan was highly critical of MPS colleagues who defended Pinochet’s “capitalist fascism” (Samuelson 1983: 75). Indeed, El Mercurio reported that Buchanan had provided a passionate defense of democracy (a “spontaneous intervention”) during an unspecified MPS session and had upbraided a number of MPS colleagues who defended dictatorship (November 22 1981: D4). Our analysis of Buchanan’s late 1981 visit to Chile draws upon a range of primary source material including documentary evidence gleaned from the Buchanan House Archives (BHA), the relatively heavy Chilean media coverage of the MPS meeting, and material from the MPS papers. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an account of the background to Buchanan’s late 1981 visit to Chile. As we show, Buchanan was not initially meant to speak to the MPS on the topic of unlimited democracy. Section 3 provides an account of the analytical core of Buchanan’s 1981 paper. In particular, we note Buchanan’s MPS defense of universal suffrage and constitutionally-limited majoritarian democracy. Section 4 provides an account of Buchanan’s relatively brief MPS analysis of Samuelson’s early 1980s theory of capitalist fascism. Section 5 evaluates Buchanan’s mid-late 1970s and early 1980s assessment of the ‘Devil’s Fix.’ Section 6 provides concluding remarks.",14
32.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,19 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-018-0419-2,Buchanan and public finance: The tennessee years,March 2019,Alain Marciano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"James Buchanan’s views on public finance have already been analyzed and they are quite well known (Johnson 2005, 2006, 2014, 2015; Medema 2005; Wagner 2017). The study of his dissertation – “Fiscal Equity in a Federal State” (1948) – or one of his first articles – “The Pure Theory of Government Finance” – (1949) has shown how Buchanan was inspired and influenced by economists such as Knut Wicksell or the Italian masters of public finance, such as Antonio de Viti de Marco or Maffeo Pantaleoni as well as by some of his professors at the University of Chicago Henry Simons or Frank Knight (Wagner 2017; Buchanan 2007). The latter are then not only viewed as those who “converted” (Buchanan, 2007, 68, 71, 216) Buchanan to free market economics, turning him into “zealotous free marketer” (Econlib 2002),Footnote 1 but also more or less implicitly as those who led him to specialize in public finance. This may easily lead to the conclusion that Buchanan chose public finance for ideological reasons, that is to learn arguments that would allow him in order to defend free markets and to criticize the intervention of the government. This is precisely what, to quote but one significant and recent author, Nancy MacLean does: “Buchanan chose an area of economics not surprising for a libertarian seeking a job in a southern public university: public finance, which focuses on the proper role of government in the economy.” (2017, 41). In this paper we depart from this conclusion. The claim we make is that Buchanan did not chose public finance at Chicago, under the influence of Knight or Simons. He had actually already chosen this area of research when he was a post-graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 1940–1941. That very year, but also those he spent in college in Tennessee, are very important to understand Buchanan’s interest in public finance and, beyond, his intellectual trajectory. Yet, not much -- to say the least -- has been written about that year nor about the years. The object of this paper is to fill this gap, and shed light on a period of Buchanan’s life and work that remains hazy and has given birth to unfounded conjectures. In other words, in this paper we focus on what Buchanan actually did, and discuss what did the persons he effectively interacted, before he arrived at Chicago. Actually, the little we know about Buchanan’s life in Tennessee was written by Buchanan himself in his autobiography, Better Than Plowing (2007). In particular, he gave the names of different persons and professors that he reminded of for having been important for him. He wrote a few general words about Anne Ordway, Eva May Burkett and William Mebane who were his professors when he was at Middle Tennessee State Teachers College (MTSTC) in Murfreesboro.Footnote 2 He was a bit more specific about Carlton C. Sims, also a professor at MTSTC and Charles P. White professor at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, but the meagre details he gave clearly convey the impression that whatever role Sims and White had been seems to be secondary and negligible at least from a scientific and academic perspective. Their ideas could safely be neglected, and they were. To our knowledge, commentators never paid attention to them. Thus, a first object of this paper is to shed more light on these scholars and their role by studying their work. We thus show that the question Sims and White were interested in and what they wrote revolved around the role of institutions in public finance. To them, matters in public finance were primarily institutional (Sims) or even constitutional (White). Or, put differently and more precisely, the type and amount of public goods provided, the level of taxes or who pay them were primarily a matter of wealth but wealth was somehow a relative value that depends on the institutional structure, the boundaries of political units and the allocation of responsibilities among different institutional levels. We also show that both Sims and White were rather favorable to a certain level of centralization of functions and government intervention. This may have been the lessons that Sims and White taught Buchanan. It is impossible to know precisely. No archival evidence allows us to make such a conclusion and even to infer that Sims’s and White’s works did influence Buchanan and orient his work. It is nonetheless hard to imagine that no such influence existed. The themes they were interested in were exactly the themes Buchanan worked on during all his career. In addition, what Buchanan wrote in those years also reveals a proximity with their claims. Indeed, our analysis does not only consist in discussing Sims’s and White’s work but also Buchanan’s in those years. Thus, and this is the second object of our paper, to bring to light and analyze “Gasoline Tax Sharing Among Local Units of Government in Tennessee” – the essay he wrote for his M.A. under White’s supervision and that he defended in 1941 and that remains totally ignored among historians of thought and economists. This leads us to the three arguments we make in this article. First, Buchanan can reasonably and plausibly be said to have been influenced by Sims and White: from the theme – a question of public finance and more precisely of relationship between different levels of government – to the nature of the problem – a matter of institutions – in passing by the solution envisaged – namely the creation of a central administrative agency to administer the sharing system of the gasoline tax among lower units of governments. This is thus our second claim: by tracing the origins of Buchanan’s interest in public finance to these years he spent in Tennessee before coming to Chicago, our article gives credit to the view that he did chose public finance to understand the role of the government in the economy but it contradicts the claim that he was already a libertarian or it confirms what Buchanan had said about being a socialist but that had never been demonstrated.Footnote 3 Then, and this is our third and last claim, the analysis of Buchanan’s MA thesis allows us to show that a lot of the ideas that will matter for him in his career – the importance of ethics and the principle of an equal treatment for equals, the need to link taxes to benefits, at least for certain goods, the importance to adapt the scale of provision of a public good to the type of public good – were already present in this first work. This what we try to do by identifying and making as explicit as possible the connections that can be made between the ideas Buchanan put forward in this work and his (and others) later work.",5

32.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,21 November 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-017-0403-2,Ludwig Lachmann’s peculiar status within Austrian economics,March 2019,Virgil Henry Storr,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Lachmann occupies a strange position within modern Austrian economics. He is viewed as something of an outsider and his views are often regarded as outside the mainline of modern Austrian thought. But, on several key issues – especially subjectivism and institutions – Lachmann’s positions are the dominant positions within the school. In suggesting that Lachmann’s influence on modern Austrian economics is underappreciated, I do not mean to suggest that he is the most influential figure within modern Austrian economics. Menger, Mises, Hayek and even Kirzner are arguably more influential than Lachmann. Additionally, I am not forgetting the hundreds of papers and handful of edited volumes that have substantively engaged Lachmann’s work (see, for instance, Koppl and Mongiovi 1999). Nor am I forgetting that he was one of the featured speakers at the famed 1974 South Royalton Conference that played such an important role in the revival of Austrian economics (particularly in the US) alongside Kirzner and Rothbard (Vaughn 1998).Footnote 1 Lachmann is certainly a recognized leader of the modern Austrian school of economics. But, I am suggesting that, despite the recognition he has and does receive, Lachmann does not get his due. Recall how Lachmann has been described by both his fans and his critics. Lachmann is frequently described as a gadfly and an outsider. His student Donald Lavoie (1994, 1), for instance, called Lachmann “a dissident member of a dissident school of thought.” Lachmann’s work, Lavoie explained, was not only outside the mainstream of economics (which is the case with much of Austrian economic thought) but was also outside the mainstream of Austrian economics. Lachmann, Lavoie explained, attempted to push Austrian economics in a direction that many or even most Austrians did not want it to go. Indeed, Israel Kirzner has suggested that, by the end of his life, Lachmann was not even an Austrian anymore. According to Kirzner (2002, 287), “In 1950, … Lachmann was clearly expressing a view of economics largely built upon Mises. … in 1961, he was most explicit in his commitment to praxeology and to its Misesian character. Yet, as the years passed … the focus of Lachmann’s intellectual attention … began to shift from Mises to Shackle.” Similarly, Karen Vaughn (1998, 108) in recounting Lachmann’s message at the South Royalton conference describes him as “in most respects the odd man out.” She also insisted that his message there was “virtually incomprehensible” and “murky” (1998, 110). And, Vaughn (ibid.) explained, she was not alone. It was clear, she (ibid.) claims, that Lachmann was challenging the Austrian school to be more radical but exactly what he was asking them to do was difficult for many in the room to discern. Rothbard, however, seems to have understood Lachmann’s arguments at South Royalton and afterwards, and he rejected them. According to Rothbard (1989), Lachmann was a nihilist. Rothbard (1989, 56–7) writes that Ludwig M. Lachmann, who had been a disciple of Hayek in England in the 1930s and who had written a competent Austrian work entitled Capital and Its Structure in the 1950s, was suddenly converted by the methodology of the English economist George Shackle during the 1960s. Since the mid-1970s, Lachmann, teaching part of every year at New York University, has engaged in a crusade to bring the blessings of randomness and abandonment of theory to Austrian economics. Rothbard was convinced that Lachmann was undermining the core teachings of the Austrian school. So, Lachmann is viewed as being on the periphery of Austrian economics by even many of his friends (“a dissident member of a dissident school”) and is viewed as working to destroy Austrian economics by his harshest critics. It is a common and often repeated trope that Lachmann is a nihilist, that if we follow him, then economics is not possible, that if we follow him we cannot make claims or reach conclusions about the real world, that if we follow him we cannot say much about all that much. But, this brings us back to the puzzle that I want us to explore. Well, I think that we can make the case that while we modern Austrians curtsy to Menger, or Mises, or Hayek, or Kirzner, or Rothbard, on at least two issues at the heart of Austrian economic thought, we march with Lachmann.Footnote 2
 If I am right, this raises a critical history of thought question about Lachmann’s move from the edges to the center of Austrian economic thought. My sense is that any answer to this puzzle has to do with the open rather than closed nature of his approach as well as the potential of his approach to inspire applied work within Austrian economics (what we might call the anti-nihilist thrust of Lachmann’s work). But, I want to focus on making the case that we modern Austrian economists “march with Lachmann.” There are at least two areas where Lachmann has, arguably, won the day, where Lachmann’s views appear to be the dominant ones, where Lachmann either directly inspired these advances in Austrian economic thought or anticipated them. The first is Lachmann’s insistence on the thoroughgoing application of subjectivism to our theorizing about action in the world and the second is Lachmann’s emphasis on the importance and key role that institutions play in guiding our actions in an uncertain world. Whether we admit it or not, we are all Lachmannians now. Or to be more precise, we are pretty much all radical subjectivists and Austrian institutionalists.",12

Kirzner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The free market society is one in which individual entrepreneurship is permitted to flourish, within the framework of a given system of property rights. Our concern in this paper is the justice of income distribution in such a system. Milton Friedman has written that the “ethical principle that would directly justify the distribution of income in a free society is ‘to each according to what he and the instruments he owns produces’” (1962: 161–2). Friedman believes that even Marxist critics of capitalism accept this ethical principle. “Even the severest internal critics of capitalism have implicitly accepted payment in accordance with product as ethically fair” (1962: 167). The Marxist far-reaching condemnation of the fairness of capitalist income distribution does not, Friedman states, challenge the ethical principle undergirding capitalist income distribution. Marxists simply maintain that, under capitalism, labor is exploited because in their view “labor produces the whole of the product but got only part of it” (1962: 167). So that, to defend the ethics of capitalist distribution, it is merely (!) required to insist, contra Marxism, that there are other ethical owners of instruments of production, who are ethically entitled to their share of the product. This would satisfy everyone. For this reason, we shall call Friedman’s capitalist ethic, “Friedman’s universal ethic.” However, Friedman’s application of this ethic faces, we shall argue, a serious problem. Our argument in this paper is that Friedman’s universal ethic is not a sufficiently solid basis on which to defend the justice of capitalism. The problem faced by Friedman’s universal ethic is that, as we shall see, it fails to provide justification for the winning of pure entrepreneurial profit. If one accepts the premise that justice demands fulfilment of Friedman’s universal ethic, − then one must concede that the prime mover of economic activity under capitalism, violates society’s basic ethical principle. After all, capitalism thrives only through its being the “free enterprise system”; but freedom to pursue pure entrepreneurial profit is, we shall argue, according to Friedman’s universal ethic, freedom to seek unethical gain. Or so, we maintain, it could well be argued, if one does not radically supplement Friedman’s ethical principle. In what follows we shall (a) show that the winning of pure entrepreneurial profit cannot be justified on the basis of Friedman’s ethical principle. Since capitalism depends on the freedom to pursue pure entrepreneurial profit, it thus follows that, according to Friedman’s ethical principle, capitalism would have to be judged to be an unethical system. But while the thesis of this paper does rest on the rejection of Friedman’s defense of capitalism, that rejection is not the prime mover of this paper. Rather, to fulfil that purpose, we shall argue (b) that a fuller understanding of the meaning of “pure entrepreneurial profit” reveals that Friedman’s universal ethic is of little relevance to capitalism, properly understood as a free enterprise system. Once the true meaning of pure entrepreneurial profit has been grasped, it becomes immediately apparent that Friedman’s universal ethic principle is not violated by the existence of pure profit, − that principle is utterly irrelevant to the winning of pure entrepreneurial profit. To pass ethical judgment on pure entrepreneurial profit, it is, we shall show, necessary to supplement Friedman’s ethical principle with additional ethical insights. This paper does not argue directly in favor of any one such possible additional insight; it will simply demonstrate how one such additional insight (that appears to us to be widely recognized) might, if it passes final ethical screening, serve as the ethical defense of pure capitalism, which, we argue, Friedman’s ethical principle is unable to do. It should be emphasized that our critique of Friedman’s defense of capitalist justice in the distribution of income, does not constitute an essay in ethical theory (a field in which this writer has no professional competence). Our critique consists of a series of economic insights which, once they have been recognized, demonstrate how the free market economic system embraces dimensions in regard to which Friedman’s ethical principle fails to provide ethical guidance at all. Our point will then be that a more penetrating series of economic insights shows that this failure is not to be seen as evidence of capitalist injustice – merely that the Friedman ethic must be acknowledged to be irrelevant to the central element, in regard to the justice of capitalist income distribution. Let us first see why Friedman’s “universal” ethical principle, on the basis of which he claims justice for capitalist distribution, necessarily fails to fulfil his claim in regard to pure entrepreneurial profit.",9

Clark,Benjamin Powell,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Classical liberals value protecting individual rights, the maximization of societal welfare, or some combination of the two. Within the broad category of classical liberalism, anarchist libertarians and minimal statists differ on which institutional system of governance they believe might best achieve these goals. Anarchists believe that rights protection and welfare are maximized when there is no state at all. Minimal statists believe that when the state provides certain, but limited, functions of governance, rights are better secured and welfare better promoted. We make no attempt to weigh in on this debate here. Our purpose is to argue that minimal statism, as traditionally rendered, ignores marginal analysis, and once incorporated, such an analysis compels a classical liberal to scale back the traditional minimal state to something “less than minimal.” Minimal statists have usually defined the necessary and permitted functions of government as distinct categories. Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises provide examples of this type of reasoning from three of the main classical liberal schools of thought, Objectivist, Chicago, and Austrian. Rand argued that, “The proper functions of a government fall into three broad categories, all of them involving the issues of physical force and the protection of men’s rights: the police, to protect men from criminals—the armed services, to protect men from foreign invaders—the law courts, to settle disputes among men according to objective laws” (Rand 1964: 106). Similarly, Friedman in an interview with Phil Donahue succinctly stated his position by saying, “I’m not an anarchist. I believe we need a government for certain basic functions. We need a government to protect this country from foreign enemies. We need a government to protect me from being bashed over the head by you” (Friedman 1979). Mises, like Rand and Friedman, also defined the role of the state in broad categories. He argued, A famous, very often quoted phrase says: “That government is best, which governs least.” I do not believe this to be a correct description of the functions of a good government. Government ought to do all the things for which it is needed and for which it was established. Government ought to protect the individuals within the country against the violent and fraudulent attacks of gangsters, and it should defend the country against foreign enemies. These are the functions of government within a free system, within the system of the market economy” (Mises 2006: 37). Contrary to Mises, we will argue that the government that governs least, i.e. is more minimal than minimal, is best. Police, national defense, and dispute adjudication are not dichotomous categories. What Murray Rothbard observed about policing more than 40 years ago applies to defense and dispute resolution as well: There is a common fallacy, held even by most advocates of laissez-faire, that the government must supply “police protection,” as if police protection were a single, absolute entity, a fixed quantity of something which the government supplies to all. But in actual fact there is no absolute commodity called “police protection” any more than there is an absolute single commodity called “food” or “shelter” (2006: 267). If some government provision of policing, defense, and dispute resolution is necessary, that does not do anything to establish what percent of all policing, defense, and dispute resolution must be provided by the government. Unfortunately, in defining a minimal state by categories of permissible areas of government action, minimal statists have implicitly and uncritically given the state too large of a role. If markets or civil society are capable of providing some policing, defense, and dispute resolution, then classical liberals should want the scope of government provision decreased. A less than minimal state would provide only the amount of these services that are both necessary and that markets and civil society fail to provide. The next section of the paper makes the case for the desirability of a less than minimal state on rights and welfarist grounds.Footnote 1 Section III surveys some evidence on the empirical relevance of non-state provisions of services that minimal statists have traditionally believed are the appropriate roles for a minimal state. The final section concludes.",7

Clark,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Murray Rothbard (2012[1977]: 4030) once famously asked the question, “Do you hate the state?” in an effort to contrast the brand of liberalism that he advocated (anarcho-capitalism) with the more utilitarian-flavored ideas espoused by the likes of David Friedman (1973). Rothbard wrote, There runs through For a New Liberty (and most of the rest of my work as well) a deep and pervasive hatred of the State and all of its works, based on the conviction that the State is the enemy of mankind. In contrast, it is evident that David [Friedman] does not hate the State at all; that he has merely arrived at the conviction that anarchism and competing private police forces are a better social and economic system than any other alternative. In this essay, within the specific context of a discussion of taxation, we argue that hatred of the state is in fact a unifying attitude among liberals.Footnote 1 We believe, the utilitarian-oriented anarchism advocated by David Friedman (1973), Bruce Benson (1990), and others (see Powell and Stringham, 2009) as well as the more mainstream minarchism found within Adam Smith (1776), Milton Friedman (1962), and F. A. Hayek (1960) among many others do share a common hatred for the state. Adam Smith wrote that tariffs are “a curse equal to the barrenness of the earth and the inclemency of the heavens,” (emphasis added, 1776: IV.2.36) and society prospers “in spite both of the extravagance of government and of the greatest errors of administration,” (1776: II.3.31). We think this sounds like someone who hates the state. Milton Friedman, like Smith, was no anarchist, but he too had no love for the state. To be sure, Milton Friedman saw a role for government as a “rule maker and umpire” and explicitly criticized anarchism for being “not feasible” (1962:25). Rose Friedman once recounted about a time when Milton was pulled over by a police officer for speeding and was additionally cited because he had added a home-made equals sign to his personalized “MV PQ” license plate. Surely a moderate liberal like Milton Friedman would approve of the laws against speeding and the minor requirement to have a license plate? No! According to Rose, he was absolutely furious and the very first thing he did upon returning home was to restore the equals sign on his car’s plate using some electrical tape. The differences among liberals are not so much about love or hatred of the state. The difference is that Rothbard’s brand of classical liberalism elevates individual freedom and unanimous agreement in human affairs to the highest level of importance to the exclusion of other concerns. This is of course most prominently seen in the non-aggression principle that denies the appropriateness of initiating force. To Rothbard, freedom itself is the end and the only end. In contrast, most other liberals place human welfare as the ultimate goal. Such liberals do believe that individual freedom and unanimity work most of the time to enhance human well-being, but there are nevertheless situations where the state can enhance welfare. Freedom is seen as a means to the end of human flourishing. We might think of the state as an abusive husband, who cheats, drinks, and abuses his wife and children. A wife in this situation can easily grow to hate her husband, and in reality many do. But should she leave him? Murray Rothbard says the wife who hates her husband must leave him! He is evil and is violating her rights. But human experience, sad though it may be, teaches us that many wives in such situations do not leave their husbands. And this is not just because the wife is afraid of the husband. The wife frequently understands that as vile as the husband may be, she would likely be even worse off without him for he brings home money and protects her and her children from others who might do her even more harm. This is not false consciousness either. The world is a harsh place, and a mean, drunk husband can in fact be a preferred alternative to having no husband at all.Footnote 2 Likewise, an extravagant and error-prone state may be preferable to anarchy. If you are a disciple of Murray Rothbard on this question, you need read no further. To Rothbard, the state is ipso facto evil and no utilitarian justifications are even possible to redeem it. To the rest of us however, the state is an evil yes, but perhaps a necessary evil. The remainder of this short essay will reflect on a few well-known situations in which the state’s hated power to tax can nevertheless enhance human welfare.",2

Devereaux,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"If we knew how freedom would be used, the case for it would largely disappear. (Hayek 2013 (1960): 31) In 2008, Nobel prize-winner Richard Thaler and Harvard Law School Professor Cass Sunstein published Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness. Their book reviews a list of ways behavioral economists have determined human behavior is biased—falls short of rational optimization—and suggests that changing the context of decision-making in some cases may subvert biases with no significant negative side effects. These contextual subversions of biased decisions are called nudges. Nudge theory is the operationalization of the worldview Thaler and Sunstein call “libertarian paternalism” (Thaler and Sunstein 2008: 4–6). While sometimes nudge is synonymous with a policy to reduce negative externalities (Reisch and Sunstein 2016), we are interested in the kinds of nudges intended to increase the utility of the nudged agent “as judged by themselves” (AJBT) (Thaler and Sunstein 2008: 5; removed italics from original; Thaler 2015; Sunstein et al. 2017: 1). We believe the nudge theory of Sunstein and Thaler and the literature building on their analyses is best understood as behavioral paternalism and not libertarian paternalism, as the conclusions made by nudge theory are bound up in the neoclassical interpretation of the Kahneman-Tversky frame of behavioral economics, and the libertarian nature of behavioral paternalism is tenuous at best (Gigerenzer 2015; Glod 2015). A great deal of analysis of behavioral paternalism has been conducted in the so-called Austrian economic and philosophical frame. The literature correctly identifies the normative presumptions inherent in behavioral paternalism, in that the conclusions of the axiomatic method underlying the construction of Arrow-Debreuvian value theory are used as a benchmark against which to compare real behaviors (Berg and Gigerenzer 2010; Whitman and Rizzo 2015: 12–13). Behavioral paternalists apparently accept some form of Simonian bounded rationality in real action (Camerer et al. 2003; Bernheim and Rangel 2007), but do not explicitly accept that ideal action is subject to constraints or bounds that are, at the very least, insurmountable by a sufficiently powerful and subtle choice architect (Rizzo 2016: 46–7). As noted in Berg and Gigerenzer (2010: 136), “…in many, if not most, interesting choice problems (e.g., buying a house, choosing a career, or deciding whom to marry), the decision maker knows only a tiny subset of the objectively feasible action set (Hayek 1945), the list of outcomes associated with lotteries, or the probabilities of the known outcomes (Knight 1921).” These points form what Rizzo (2016) calls the “four pillars of behavioral paternalism.” Despite this well-founded and arguably damning criticism of the nudge method, it has only grown in popularity in the decade since the publication of Nudge. Regardless of behavioral paternalism’s theoretical soundness, it seems as if “nudge units” like the United Kingdom’s Behavioral Insights Team team are here to stayFootnote 1 (Halpern 2015). In our view, AJBT nudges in particular remain popular because they place the expert outside of the constraints of reality, granting cognitive and informational abilities to behavioral paternalists and crafters of nudge policy not accessible by the individuals for whom the policy is crafted. The presumption that choice architects have enough insight and powerful-yet-subtle reach into the life of an individual agent to affect her choices predominantly in the direction of utility gains requires that behavioral paternalists will both have essentially solved Hayek’s knowledge problem and discovered how to cope with the radical uncertainty of Knight. We do not believe the existing critical literature has placed enough emphasis on (1) the epistemological constraints and limits to nudging in the era of complex computational methods and Big Data, where all relevant context on which to condition a nudge seems as if it could (one day) be apprehensible, and (2) the effect of nudge on the creative economy in the sense of Koppl et al. (2015), or what G. L. S. Shackle would have called diachronic action (Shackle 1972). In the words of the philosopher Henri Bergson, the human condition is characterized by “the continual creation of unpredictable novelty” (Bergson 1908). The presence of ongoing generation of unpredictable novelty means that the ministrations of behavioral paternalists will always be unpredictably incorrect, in that they can never fully take into account the choice context faced by individuals by the time interventions are implemented, and that errors will be likely non-normally distributed and the outcome of ministrations crafted at time t thus unapproximatable to some ideal at time t + 1.Footnote 2 In reference to point (1), while behavioral paternalists largely agree that dispersed and local knowledge is key to economic decision-making, they suggest that its importance as an obstacle to effective policy-making is overstated. Their arguments are, in summary: While we can’t measure subjective utility exactly, we can use other measures like deaths averted and tools to convert important measures of a system into monetary equivalents to approximate welfare (Sunstein 2014: 3). Nudges can be tested on active populations, with the ones that “work” kept and the others, discarded (Sunstein 2014; Colander and Kupers 2014). Hayek’s theory is correct to recognize that markets are complex systems, but it is incorrect—or at least, outdated—to claim that designers of regulations can’t improve upon market outcomes, given current and conceivable computing methods. Tools developed by computational social scientists like network theory and agent-based modeling, as well as the development of machine learning methods on Big Data, could overcome many of the obstacles to regulatory intervention implied by Hayek’s knowledge problem (Sunstein 2014; Bowles et al. 2017Footnote 3). Behavioral paternalists largely ignore the radical uncertainty horizon implied by point (2) by employing equilibrium analysis, which focuses on long-term stable preferences as a reference point for “true” preferences. How well the nudge method enables the realization of measurable goals, like saving more for retirement, and whether nudges are best left in public or private hands, has been addressed by Abdukadirov (2016). Choice architects of AJBT nudges have a higher standard than simply attaining measurable goals. Choice architects must demonstrate that a proposed AJBT nudge will, upon implementation, make nudged actors relatively better off in the nudged actors’ own judgment than in the absence of the nudge. This is a much more complicated question than how to attain a shift in savings behavior, or a slowdown on a dangerous strip of road, or an improvement in medication compliance. The action of a public nudge cannot be separated from the outcome it hopes to attain. Nudges can interact with knowledge formation, to its detriment (Rizzo and Whitman 2009). Determinism—and in its probabilistic form, expectational or Bayesian determinism—is not supported by the realities of individual action, in which processes are fundamentally irreversible and knowledge is radically incomplete. Nondeterminism cannot be safely assumed away in economic models, particularly not in formulations that advise a role for the paternalistic alteration of behavior. “The reality of time and change is the crux of realism” (Popper 1982: xix). As much of the prescriptive power of behavioral paternalism draws from artifacts of what Ilya Prigogine called the “classical deterministic orthodoxy” in physics (Prigogine and Stengers 1997: 5), acknowledging hard constraints on deterministic calculation exposes the effectiveness of AJBT nudge as an overstatement at best and drains behavioral paternalism of much of its prescriptive power, as we shall demonstrate. Both point (1) (behavioral paternalism’s epistemological constraints) and point (2) (radical uncertainty) have roots and references in the socialist calculation debate of the early twentieth century and after-debate of the mid twentieth century. Point (1) was best developed and understood during the early part of debate (pre-1945), and point (2) was developed—is, in fact, still developing—in the after-debate (post-1945) best characterized as the era of mechanism design using Arrow-Debreuvian value theory (Hurwicz 1973; Mirowski 2002). At the turn of the twentieth century, Marxian socialists like Kautsky claimed that freedom of choice in occupation and consumer goods was necessary to meet individual preferences within an individual’s budget, and to keep socialism from resembling a militaristic institution where occupation was assigned and not chosen (Lange 1937; Kautsky 1902). Ludwig von Mises soon deflated the hopes of the early post-Marx socialists by pointing out that in an economy where the state owns the means of production, input prices cannot form and therefore resources cannot be allocated to their best uses (Mises 1920). F. A. Hayek joined the debate to elucidate the function of prices as conveyers of dispersed knowledge and to argue that the adoption of the theoretical artifice of the Walrasian auctioneer is not an explication of method (Hayek 1940,1948). “…the sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form” (Hayek 1945: 524). Socialist economists like Fred Taylor, Oskar Lange, Abba Lerner, and H. D. Dickinson spent the twenty-or-so years of the socialist calculation debate adding elements of market competition and what they believed was sufficient price realization back into the socialist economic models (Taylor 1929; Lerner 1934, 1937; Lange 1936, 1937). Their efforts culminated in what was called “market socialism,” operationalized using the Lange-Lerner trial-and-error method. Confounding the debate was the global plunge into the Great Depression, which transformed rational planning from nice-to-have to something that seemed necessary to tame the chaos of the market (Boettke et al. 2008). By 1939, social planners were so convinced their program would be an unmitigated improvement to individual health, wealth, and happiness, they called it “libertarian socialism” (Dickinson 1939: 205). Libertarian socialism was intended to improve the conditions of the life of individuals as judged by themselves. According to Dickinson, the “system of libertarian socialism” (ibid: 205) exemplifies freedom while capitalism “stultifies freedom of choice by making intelligent choice impossible” (ibid: 36) by wasting resources used in marketing and advertising products, and by providing consumers with goods that “are not real human needs at all, but are wants based on what Veblen calls ‘conspicuous waste’” (ibid). The choice environment of capitalism exemplifies wealth hierarchy and leads the consumer to stray from his “genuine human needs” (ibid: 37). “In truth a considerable measure of standardization is a necessary condition of any rational liberty of choice. In most lines of consumption the consumer is faced, to-day, with a veritable embarras de choix” (ibid: 232). Dickinson’s embarras de choix is an early rendition of what behavioral paternalists call choice overload or tyranny of choice or, sometimes, the tyranny of freedom (Johnson et al. 2012; Schwartz 2000, 2004; Sunstein 2015; Thaler and Sunstein 2008). The problem of free choice and production arises when choosing occurs in the context of wealth inequality, says Dickinson. If the choice environment were altered to eliminate inequality of income the free market would provide “a very representative and sensitive index of consumers’ real preferences” (Dickinson 1939: 50). Dickinson warns against the false dichotomy of rigid planning versus a flexible market. Libertarian socialism is about maximizing “real social freedom” whose balance between planned and unplanned orders “might conceivably produce a more satisfactory blend of order and freedom than that which we enjoy to-day” (ibid: 230). Though the mainstream account of the socialist calculation debate called the socialist calculation debate in favor of the trial-and-error method (see especially the accounts of Bergson 1948, 1967), planners were to spend the rest of the twentieth century responding to Hayek’s epistemological challenge.Footnote 4 As a result, much of what formed the engineering core of mainstream economics and mechanism design in economics was an explication of the workings of the Lange-Lerner method (Hurwicz 1973; Arrow 2007). Like the old libertarian socialism, libertarian paternalism straddles a perfectly rational ideal and a reality far more complex than explainable in the neoclassical frame. The Kahneman-Tversky frame cannot endogenously account for behavioral biases, given its foundations in Arrow-Debreu. This presents an identification problem in the theory, where outside information—contextual information about the choice environment, but also information about the agent’s cognition and preferences that cannot be determined from a simple revelation of his preferences—must be included in order for the theory’s models to be identified. Hayek’s discovery of a grave epistemological problem inherent in central planning is the same epistemological problem with which nudge theory must properly contend if its prescriptions are to be scientifically meaningful, as noted in point (1). We will examine the arguments and workarounds to the epistemological problem proposed by behavioral paternalists in the era of Big Data and complex adaptive modeling. We shall then use discoveries made in the mechanism design era and more recent explications of nonequilibrium mechanics to condition our understanding about point (2), behavioral paternalism given the radical uncertainty of a creative economy.",9

Piano,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Global natural gas production has increased substantially since the early 2000s as a result of fracking shale gas (Hausman and Kellogg 2015). Shale gas cannot be profitably mined using the conventional technique of drilling downward and relying on natural pressure to force the gas to the surface. The reason is shale is too impermeable. Fracking, a process that combines horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing of shale through injection of chemically-treated water into the rock, made production of shale gas economically profitable.Footnote 1 The US has led the way in the shale revolution.Footnote 2 Its consequences include economic growth, job creation, windfall profits for public schools, and tens of billions in royalty payments to the owners of mineral rights (Black et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2016; Fetzer 2014; Feyrer et al. 2017; Weber 2012). Although much of the analysis of shale gas development suggests that there are economic benefits from production, a sizable literature also considers the possibility of a resource curse: that an increase in shale gas production makes an economy worse off (DeLeire et al. 2014; Maniloff and Mastromonaco 2014; Weber 2014). In addition, many studies focus on the environmental, ecological, and economic costs associated with hydraulic fracturing, including worse health near wells and lower property values in frack zones (Currie et al. 2017; Muehlenbachs et al. 2015). The perception of unmitigated costs of hydraulic fracturing has led to substantial concern regarding governance of shale extraction. These concerns are exacerbated by the tremendous diversity of the regulatory response, especially in polycentric systems of governance such as the US and EU, where there are multiple levels of government that share regulatory authority over shale gas development.Footnote 3 In the US context, one cause for concern is the perception that federalism has resulted in a patchwork of disparate regulations of shale gas development, with some US states pushing ahead with shale production and others banning it (Warner and Shapiro 2013; Wiseman 2010). The American regulatory regime has even been depicted as an institutional and regulatory Wild West, harkening back to the image of the American west during the nineteenth century as a time of disorder, conflict, and violence (Rabe and Borick 2012).Footnote 4 More favorable accounts of the American shale boom suggest that the system has not sufficiently addressed risks associated with fracking (Small et al. 2014). Governance of fracking in Europe is open to a similar critique, as the member countries enjoy substantial autonomy to regulate, and to prohibit, hydraulic fracturing even though the supranational EU government could assert authority to regulate shale gas development, including by establishing uniform standards. Like the US, the responses of the constituent members of the European federation have varied dramatically, with some pressing ahead with production and others banning it. Existing studies critical of fracking federalism hone in on differences in the regulatory stances taken by local regulators in making an argument that the political institutions governing fracking are inefficient. We argue that this view is erroneous. Hydraulic fracturing regulation is efficient when it responds effectively to market failures, such as an environmental externality. Although recent work suggests that the state response in the US varies too much in order to be justified from an efficiency perspective (Mason et al. 2014; Richardson et al. 2013), we contend that variation in policy approaches should not be interpreted as direct evidence of regulatory failure. Indeed, a diversity of responses by regulators and policymakers will be efficient whenever different jurisdictions experience different degrees and kinds of market failure. Moreover, there are several justifications for regulatory diversity within a polycentric system of governance beyond the extent of market failure, such as differences in preferences for economic growth and or epistemic function of polycentrism, which is to generate knowledge via localized experiments about how to best regulate shale gas development to address its social costs.Footnote 5 Substantively, we show why a diversity of regulatory responses, rather than a uniform policy imposed by the central government in the US or EU, is the most appropriate way to regulate shale gas development. This is for several reasons, including significant variation in the geological, geography, and built infrastructure where shale extraction takes place, the tremendous diversity of preferences regarding the acceptability of shale gas development, uncertainty regarding the appropriate ways to regulate hydraulic fracturing, the substantial capacity of local political units in each federation to regulate hydraulic fracturing, and few clearly identifiable interjurisdictional coordination problems that would justify uniform standards imposed by the central government. Rather than a cause for consternation, the diversity of regulatory responses in these federations generates knowledge of how to best regulate shale gas development, acknowledges the diversity of preferences over shale development, and encourages participation in the policy process from multiple levels of government. Our article contributes to several literatures. One literature considers the benefits and costs of polycentric governance of natural resources. Our conceptual framework extends on studies of federalism of watershed management (Blomquist and Schlager 2005; Heikkila et al. 2011; Schlager et al. 2012), as well as studies contemplating the appropriateness of federalism of climate change policy (Rabe 2011), by considering explicitly the benefits and costs of uniform versus diverse rules governing development within a polycentric system. We also more carefully consider both the benefits and costs of polycentrism. Recent studies suggest uncontrolled costs of hydraulic fracturing in polycentric systems of governance, especially the US (Burger 2013; Craig 2013; Osofsky and Wiseman 2014; Rabe 2014; Warner and Shapiro 2013; Wiseman 2009, 2010). Although several studies offer a nuanced perspective on hydraulic fracturing regulation (Spence 2013a, 2013b, 2013c), existing studies do not provide an adequate accounting of all the relevant benefit and cost categories of polycentric governance of shale gas development. in work which bears several affinities to our own, Holahan and Arnold (2013) use insights from Elinor Ostrom’s perspective on the commons to understand shale gas development. However, they do not explicitly consider why a diversity of regulatory responses may be justified or acknowledge the generative and epistemic properties of polycentric governance of shale gas development. In addition, while several studies provide insight into the local politics of hydraulic fracturing, including why some communities decide to ban fracking (Arnold and Holahan 2014; Arnold and Long 2018; Arnold and Neupane 2017), our paper provides an economic justification for such self-governance. Our perspective also complements work on conventional oil and gas development by Libecap (1989a, 1989b), Libecap and Smith (1999, 2002), and Libecap and Wiggins (1985). These works emphasize the importance of transaction costs (which, among other things, include the costs of bargaining between parties, monitoring adherence to contractual obligations, and enforcing property rights) in evaluating alternative institutional arrangements to govern mineral extraction. The transaction cost perspective shares important affinities with ours, as it suggests that the optimal contract choice to govern oil and gas development will vary with local conditions. However, existing work on oil and gas contracts focuses on solutions to production-relevant externalities, especially a pumping race, while we emphasize the importance of polycentric political institutions in generating knowledge about how to regulate the development of minerals, as well as consider externalities beyond production-relevant ones. Finally, we acknowledge the importance of the property rights regime governing minerals. The US is unlike most countries in that minerals can be severed from the surface estate and that the minerals can be publicly or privately owned. The severability of the surface and mineral estate, along with mixed public or private ownership of minerals, may influence the values of leases (Fitzgerald 2010, 2012). In addition, private ownership encourages innovation, as well as creates incentives for local collective action to support oil and gas development (Murtazashvili 2017). Private ownership of minerals also provides further justification for self-governance of minerals. In analyzing the foundations of effective property rights, Williamson (2009) emphasizes that private property institutions often develop locally in response to economic problems through a spontaneous process. One of the consequences is that there will be substantial variation in the quality of informal private property institutions, but also in the extent to which legal private property institutions recognize spontaneously-arising institutions. It stands to reason that variation in the regulatory and institutional response to oil and gas development makes more sense when there is substantial variation in the extent to which local jurisdictions have a history of private property rights to mineral extraction. Such historical legacies suggest that self-governance will be more effective in managing the process of development of minerals.",2

Ebeling,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is not as if that post-World War I wave of nationalism emerged out of thin air. In the middle decades of the nineteenth century, classical liberalism represented the rising and influencing set of ideas in the West. The ideals and policy prescriptions, especially in Great Britain and the United States, emphasized individual liberty, private property, freedom of enterprise, free trade, rule of law, and constitutionally limited government. They showed themselves in the movements to abolish human slavery, to widen the democratic voting franchise, and to extend civil liberties to minority groups in society; to repeal the Mercantilist trade restrictions that hampered freedom of commerce, investment and migration; and to devise ways to reduce the likelihood and cruelty of wars among nations. This is not to say that any of these goals were fully or consistently applied or achieved. But, nonetheless, they were the ambitions and goals of those who were drawn to the ideas of individual rights and freedom of association in more and more areas of everyday life (Ebeling 2018). But in the midst of the era of classical liberal reform, there emerged two counter-revolutions, both of which claimed that they were the “true” revolutionary movements to fulfill higher and more meaningful senses of freedom and social justice. These were socialism and nationalism. Both of them had part of their modern origins in the French Revolution during which the “nation” now claimed the allegiance of the people in place of loyalty to the king who had been overthrown and beheaded, and in the wars to save the revolution from foreign monarchs attempting to crush it; it was declared to be the duty of every French citizen to place the war planning needs of the national collective over that of personal and individual interest.Footnote 1 These counter-revolutionary forces against the political and economic liberalism of the pre-1914 era all came to a head in the First World War. Individual civil liberties were restricted, conscription was introduced in all the belligerent nations, freedom of trade and free movement of people were ended, domestic industry and agriculture were placed under government control and planning for both the war effort and the domestic needs of the population.Footnote 2 In addition, all the warring nations resorted to deficit spending, paper money and inflation to finance a large portion of their military expenditures.

In his approximately 900 page magnum opus, Human Action, the index indicates a scant four pages on migration (Mises 1949). However, earlier in his career Mises did explore economic and political consequences of immigration. He first explored the topic in the book that is the subject of this symposium, Nation, State, and Economy in 1919, and later refined some of those thoughts in Liberalism in 1927. In these writings Mises recognizes the economic case for unrestricted immigration and how such a policy is consistent with his larger philosophical liberalism. However, he sees the problem of immigration in a non-liberal world as “insolvable” and offers no advice of what type of immigration policy would be appropriate for a world populated by mixed-system interventionist governments. This paper begins by laying out Mises’ position on immigration and the fundamental problem he recognizes. His position will then be put in the context of the current academic debate surrounding immigration and its impact on formal and informal institutions in destination countries. Finally, this paper’s contribution will be to suggest an immigration policy for an interventionist world that takes into account the concerns of Mises, and the current academic debate, while still securing most of the economic gains that would result from completely unrestricted immigration.",3

Young,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Will a society’s political agents provide good governance? By good governance I mean that which is protective and productive rather than predatory (Buchanan 1975). Such governance serves to enforce property rights under the rule of law and provide common-interest public goods. Alternatively, predatory governance involves the expropriation and redistribution of resources in ways that directly or indirectly benefit political agents. Good governance is consistent with a generality norm, constraining political agents from enriching specific groups rather than individuals generally (Buchanan and Congleton 2003 [1998]; Congleton 2004). The answer to the question posed above must be sought first and foremost at the constitutional level. By a constitution I primarily refer to the set of formal (de jure) and informal (purely de facto) constraints that bind political agents.Footnote 1 A constitution determines when and under what circumstances political agents can impose external costs on others (Buchanan and Tullock 1962; Salter and Young 2018a). Conceiving of a constitution as a framework of constraints comes naturally to a political economist. However, scholars of government and constitutional law also emphasize the roles of de jure constitutional documents in giving form to institutions of governance and stating ends towards which governance should be aimed (Ginsburg 2010, p. 70; Elkins et al. 2009, pp. 38–39).Footnote 2 While not my emphasis in this paper, these roles are by no means unimportant. Scholars steeped in the traditions of Austrian economics have made important contributions to constitutional political economy (CPE). However, Austrians have often avoided interesting and important questions regarding constitutional realities today.Footnote 3 This is particularly true when it comes to de jure constitutional design. There are certainly exceptions to this generality. Notwithstanding the exceptions, I fail to find a single Review of Austrian Economics article that is focused on comparative constitutional design in the contemporary era.Footnote 4 Why this neglect? I suspect that it is partly rooted in some ambivalence towards the original CPE agenda endorsed in the writings of Buchanan and Tullock (1962), Buchanan (1975, 1990), and Brennan and Buchanan (1985). The Austrian commitment to methodological individualism and catallactics lends itself to a particular perspective when it comes to the political realm.Footnote 5 In relation to this CPE agenda, Austrians applaud its insistence on an analysis of “the acting or decision-making individual as he participates in the processes through which group choices are organized” (Buchanan and Tullock 1962, p. 3). Alternatively, Austrians are skeptical about the social contractarian traditions that were revived and reemphasized by CPE (Buchanan 1990, pp. 9–12). CPE “directs analytical attention to the choice among constraints” (Buchanan 1990, p. 3).Footnote 6 In The Calculus of Consent, this led Buchanan and Tullock (1962) to emphasize thought experiments within which individuals collectively and purposively design and unanimously consent to a constitution.Footnote 7 These sort of thought experiments can be objected to on at least two grounds. First, they are not very descriptive of real-world constitutional design and adoption. A CPE apologist might invoke “(symbolic or conceptual) unanimous consent” (Berggren 2014, p. 376) and “rules that should be justifiable to actors who did not actually agree to the specific terms themselves” (Pennington 2015, p. 565). However, the idea of symbolic and conceptual consent is exceedingly vague; if an individual does not consent to a constitution, by what standard does one determine that it should have been justifiable to him?Footnote 8 A second objection involves knowledge problems (Hayek 1945). Buchanan and Vanberg (1989) distinguish between an “interest component” and a “theory component” of constitutional preferences. The first of these involves individuals’ subjectively ranking different expected outcomes. As Buchanan and Vanberg note, contractarian approaches place emphasis on the interest component; from it flows the importance of consensus and a generality norm. However, the theory component involves individuals’ understanding of how particular institutional arrangements map to particular outcomes. (And this itself involves understanding the knowledge problems that political agents will face in different constitutional arrangements.) Emphasizing this component raises problems for any social contractarian approach. Individuals operating in actual democracies have little idea about how the policies they vote for map to outcomes (e.g., Caplan 2007; Brennan 2016). Why would they less incompetent about constitutional design? In addition to their misgivings regarding social contractarianism, Austrians can also be a bit dismissive of what James Madison referred to as “parchment barriers” – de jure constitutions. Wenzel (2010, p. 65) makes the point with flourish: “I emphatically reject the notion that good constitutional parchment is sufficient for successful constitutionalism.” Wenzel’s elaboration on that point is consistent with the argument of Salter and Furton (2018, p. 38): A written constitution can specify which set of rules, from a much larger set of feasible rules, will operate[. ...] But this is very different than the intended, and broadly agreed-upon, utility of de jure constitutions, which is as mechanisms for binding or constraining. De jure constitutions cannot perform this role [...]” Neither Wenzel nor Salter and Furton claim that de jure constitutions do not matter. However, I think it is fair to say that they characterize them as being of second-order importance.Footnote 9 Yet de jure constitutions are everywhere! The study of them should be of clear interest to students of political economy, Austrian or otherwise. In the half century that followed the adoption of the US Constitution, the coincidence of the modern nation state with a formal constitutional document became nearly universal. Of states that came into existence pre-1789, half of them went over 300 years without a de jure constitution. Alternatively, 85% of states that formed post-1789 had one by their second year of existence; nearly 95% by their fifth year (Elkins et al. 2009, pp. 41–43). Significant resources have gone into negotiating, drafting, and (almost always) later amending these documents. A lot of people in almost all nation states consider them to be of first-order importance. In what follows, I suggest some potentially fruitful CPE research avenues for Austrian scholars. I anticipate that some readers will demur; preferring to “advocate a strategy of moving away from designing optimal legal [by extension, constitutional] institutions, and instead think about growing institutions through flexible, evolutionary learning [...]” (Devins et al. 2015, p. 677). I would not discourage thinking along those latter lines. However, the reality of the constitutional world is that designers gonna design; we can at least, then, acknowledge the theory of the second best.",11

To demonstrate this, we borrow from a Swedish research tradition labeled the Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE, see, e.g., Eliasson 1996; see Johansson 2009 for a synthesis). At the heart of this school of thought is the notion that the entrepreneurial process that causes the market order to evolve is inherently collaborative: To pursue their innovative projects, entrepreneurs engage in cooperation with a number of actors, whose complementary skills drastically increase the probability that an innovation-based venture will be successful. The actors are drawn from several skill pools, which together form what we call the collaborative innovation bloc. Competition between various collaborative teams will bring about an evolution of the collaborative innovation bloc and ultimately result in innovation and economic growth. This perspective holds, we believe, great promise as a means to strengthen the Austrian understanding of how innovations come about in a modern market order and how the institutional underpinnings of that order should evolve (or change) in order for an economy to achieve more innovation and prosperity.Footnote 1 In large measure, the institutional framework determines the incentives for people to acquire and utilize their skills. Due to the complementarity of skills, institutions may have a more substantial effect on innovation and growth than suggested by an analysis that focuses on a single actor (cf. Phelps 2007, p. 553). By making the market order more concrete, suggestions on how policy and institutions should be tailored will also become more concrete and therefore more persuasive. After describing the collaborative innovation bloc in detail, we will demonstrate this by identifying a number of (quite concrete) institutions that foster the emergence of a collaborative bloc that is beneficial for innovation and economic growth. Even more importantly, our analysis shows a constructive way of thinking about innovation and its relationship with economic policy. For instance, our analysis will make clear that even when financial markets are fully deregulated, other institutions, such as the tax system or rules governing pension savings schemes, may influence how well financial markets can cater to the needs of entrepreneurs.",18

Foss,Peter G. Klein,Matthew McCaffrey,Male,Male,Male,Male,"We appreciate the chance to comment on Elert and Henrekson’s paper, “The Collaborative Innovation Bloc: A New Mission for Austrian Economics” (2019). The paper is part of a larger research program on (collaborative) entrepreneurship, institutions, and innovation policy carried out by mainly Swedish scholars (e.g., Eliasson 1984, 1991; Carlsson and Eliasson 1994). This program has proved useful for Austrian research on entrepreneurship (e.g. Bylund and McCaffrey 2017; McCaffrey 2017, 2018). In particular, it brings contemporary Austrian ideas into contact with two related Swedish traditions, both inspired by Schumpeter, on “development blocs” (Dahmen 1988; Johansson 2010) and “the experimentally organized economy” (Eliasson 1991). The Austrian and Swedish traditions have had close links in the past with considerable cross-fertilization. Thus, Swedish thinking on issues of growth and the business cycle was heavily indebted to Austrian capital theory (Erixon 2011), as well as to Schumpeter, while the Austrians in turn were directly inspired by Wicksell’s (1898) analysis of the inflationary consequences of a divergence between the natural and the loan rate of interest. Elert and Henrekson (2019) invite us to renew this broader conversation and we are happy to accept, given the important points of contact between Austrian economics and the development-bloc and experimentally-organized-economy approaches. Their emphasis on experimentation is particularly sweet music to Austrian ears considering the Austrian understanding of the market process as fundamentally experimental (Hayek 1968; Foss and Foss 2002). The development bloc notion also resonates with Austrian economics, though in other ways. For example, Austrian ideas on the time structure of production and the multiple specificities of capital offer complementary insights into why production is likely to be clustered, localized, and path-dependent (e.g., Desrochers 2001; Desrochers and Sautet 2004; Ikeda 2004). Specific points made in the Swedish program thus provide useful additions and complements to the existing body of Austrian thought. However, while we sympathize with the ideas underlying Elert and Henrekson’s discussion, we see several problems with the specific arguments they offer. First, we question whether the framework of the Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE) is necessary and useful for Austrian research. Second, we are unconvinced that the EOE framework is less abstract than existing Austrian theory and policy analysis. Third, while we agree that Austrian economics would benefit from a “meso” level of analysis, we are skeptical about whether the EOE framework is the best way to provide it. Fourth, Elert and Henrekson focus on Austrian works that build on Israel Kirzner’s “entrepreneurial discovery” approach to entrepreneurship, thereby overlooking a large body of work that runs parallel to several aspects of the EOE approach. We have in mind in particular the “entrepreneurial judgment approach” that we have promoted for several years (Foss 1993; Foss and Klein 2005, 2012; Klein 2008; Foss et al. 2019b).",4

Lucas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this issue, Elert and Henrekson offer an important and promising framework through which Austrian scholars to contribute to the study of entrepreneurship and innovation: the Collaborative Innovation Bloc (CIB). The CIB is a model of the innovation production process, in which new firms are founded, financed, and fostered into maturity. The CIB’s end result the introduction of novel products that add value to the economy. The authors outline five types of actors involved in this system: entrepreneurs, key personnel, early stage financiers, later-stage financiers, and customers. When each of these actor types is competent, active, and unhindered by “bad” institutions, the CIB functions effectively, operating as an impetus for economic growth. By contrast, “institutional bottlenecks” in the CIB resulting from bad policy will stifle innovation, limiting and even stagnating economic growth. Good theoretical frameworks are intuitive, tractable, and useful. They are intuitive when the constructs employed accord with our extant knowledge and general perception of the world. They are easy to explain at a variety of levels: laypeople, academic non-experts, and experts alike can understand and appreciate the model, albeit at increasing levels of technical detail. They are tractable in that the theoretical constructs employed can be meaningfully operationalized in the real world—whether through comparative analysis, qualitative inquiry, or quantitative measurement. Finally, they are useful because they offer explanatory power that extant frameworks do not. The CIB is intuitive, tractable, and useful. Elert and Henrekson intuitively blend existing theory and real-world observation to (quasi-inductively) develop their five actor types. Empirical study of the exchange processes in the CIB appears quite tractable: I readily envision (and encourage) comparative, qualitative, or quantitative work that would explore the pattern predictions emerging from this framework. Finally, the CIB is useful to explain variation in rates of innovation that other theories cannot fully account for—i.e., by identifying specific institutional bottlenecks hindering innovative collaboration. A principle strength of the CIB is its precision in specifying the actors and relationships that must exist for innovation to flourish. And perhaps because of this precision, the policy conclusions that Elert and Henrekson offer are similarly precise and straightforward: if a policy hinders the functioning of or coordination among any of these actor types, change that policy. However, this conclusion is a non sequitur—at least with the information provided. I principally agree with the examples of institutional bottlenecks that Elert and Henrekson offer: tax asymmetries in venture creation, labor and product market regulations, etc. The problem is that the diagnosis of these bottlenecks is exactly that: a “diagnosis.” Proper diagnosis of bad policy is only the first step toward policy prescription. Between the two lies a rocky, muddy road of causation, knowledge, and incentives. Why are institutional bottlenecks present in the first place? Do policymakers have the ability and/or the incentives to correct these bottlenecks? Although Elert and Henrekson acknowledge that there is a difference between identifying and removing bottlenecks (p. 39), they offer no path for bridging this divide—instead treating policy (and policy change) as “exogenous” to their model. In order to answer these questions, I propose bolstering the CIB framework with a good old-fashioned dose of public choice economics. Incorporating public choice to the CIB can help clarify the nature of institutional bottlenecks, by offering a more robust model of the actors tasked with designing the relevant institutions. Specifically, I consider the implications of modeling public actors—regulators, politicians, and experts—alongside the five existing CIB actor types. The results are a richer account of the sources of institutional bottlenecks, an appreciation for policy competition within the CIB, and a more sober view of the prospects for institutional change.",4
32.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,01 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00457-w,Where is the Austrian theory of collaborative orders? Comment on Elert and Henrekson,December 2019,Per L. Bylund,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Elert and Henrekson are right to address the lacking concreteness in Austrian economic theory regarding organizing, whether formal organizations or informal collaboration. In fact, I would argue that this is an area of theorizing that lacks more than only concreteness. Consider the literature on the theory of the firm as an example. Despite a growing literature in mainstream economics that addressed this collaborative layer of the market order, where the coordination of advanced exchanges and production processes takes place, Austrian economists were strangely reluctant to develop such a theory. Specifically, as I have commented previously, two decades after the rediscovery of Coase (1937) by Williamson (1967, 1973, 1979) […] O’Driscoll and Rizzo stated that “there is no […] Austrian theory of the firm” (1985, p. 123) and another decade later Foss (1994) made the same observation and could still, a few additional years later, safely theorize about “the Austrian lack of interest in the firm” (Foss 1997, p. 176). More than seventy years after Coase’s seminal article, Foss and Klein identified that “a small Austrian literature on the firm has emerged” but that “[u]ntil recently the theory of the firm was an almost completely neglected area in Austrian economics” (2009, p. 2). (Bylund 2011, p. 192) Certainly, there is more to organizing and collaboration in the market process than the business firm, but it clearly illustrates a neglect in Austrian theorizing—especially considering how “the Austrians [have] so many necessary ingredients for a theory of the firm” (Foss and Klein 2009, p. 3). Many of these ingredients are already in Menger ([1871] 2007), which raises the question of why they weren’t further made use of in Austrian theorizing. It is not until very recently that Austrian theorists have capitalized on these insights to attempt to explain business organizations. Important contributions include viewing the firm as a means for securing inputs and capabilities to carry out a production plan (Sautet 2000), for overcoming the problem of imputation in integrated or team production (Lewin 2011), for organizing unpriceable entrepreneurial judgment (Foss and Klein 2012), and for bringing about innovative production relying on intensive, market-incompatible specializations (Bylund 2016). Prior to this literature, the firm was assumed to be a normal, if not typical, occurrence in the market. von Mises ([1949] 1998), for instance, uses the terms “businessman” and “firm” almost interchangeably, and it is not until Rothbard ([1962] 2004) that there is much of a discussion on the firm—and then primarily regarding the upper bound of a firm’s size in terms of the cost of lacking the means for economic calculation.Footnote 1 These Austrian theories of the firm help fill this important gap in the literature, but they certainly do not meet Elert and Henrekson’s petition for concreteness. On the contrary, they provide abstract theoretical explanations for what role a firm, however it may be defined, can play in the market process. Or, as all of the mentioned theories make clear, why the entrepreneur may choose (or even needs) to organize production in a firm. From this particular perspective, the Austrian theories of the firm can be understood as a step toward concretization of the theory of entrepreneurship, since the firm is the typical vehicle by which entrepreneurs pursue profit opportunities. Entrepreneurship, and especially entrepreneurs’ pursuit of profits, is the “driving force of the market economy” (von Mises [1949] 1998, p. 805), but the way this happens—at least as is typical in the empirical market process—is through the founding and runningFootnote 2 of new firms. It should be noted that the Austrian theory of entrepreneurship suffers from the same lack of concreteness as Elert and Henrekson note regarding collaboration and innovation. For example, Kirzner (1973) sees in the entrepreneur the market function of ongoing error-correction (Kirzner 1978) and continuous adjustments to changing market data through alert entrepreneurs’ exploitation of discovered arbitrage opportunities. Lachmann ([1956] 1978) finds this entrepreneurial function to be the cause of continuous changes made to the market’s capital structure. Similarly, to von Mises ([1949] 1998) the economic function of entrepreneurship is limited to the bearing of uncertain future market conditions. Interestingly, and relevant to the argument put forth by Elert and Henrekson, Mises also identifies a sub category of entrepreneurship that “cannot be defined with praxeological rigor” but that “economics cannot do without”: those uncertainty-bearers “who are especially eager to profit from adjusting production to the expected changes in conditions, those who have more initiative, more venturesomeness, and a quicker eye than the crowd, the pushing and promoting pioneers of economic improvement”—the entrepreneur-promoters (von Mises [1949] 1998, pp. 255–256). Somewhat simplified, the entrepreneur-promoters are the disruptive entrepreneurs (Christensen 2013) who bring about creative destruction (Schumpeter [1911] 1934) and consequently push the market process forward toward (or through) the expansion of the extent of the market (Bylund 2016). It is the promoters who “revolutionize afresh each day the structure of prices” (von Mises [1949] 1998, p. 540). For Austrian theory of entrepreneurship to be concrete and relevant to policy-making, it would seem necessary to theorize specifically on the entrepreneur-promoters: who and what kinds of persons they are, how to incentivize them, what institutional settings are most conducive to their entrepreneurialism, and so on. But there is a tension here too, as pointed out by Mises. While entrepreneur-promoters exist and are an important concept, they are also—at least from Mises’ perspective—beyond the reach of proper economic theory. The theory of the firm literature here offers a means to expand that theory space without resorting to empirical arbitrariness and thus without losing theoretical rigor. By recognizing that entrepreneurs typically “embody” their innovations in business firms, as does Schumpeter ([1911] 1934, p. 66), or that the firm itself can be understood as the realization of an integrated production process beyond the extent of the market, as does Bylund (2016), offers an expansion beyond the pure entrepreneurial function that thereby suggests an economic mechanism for organizing and management—and therefore entry into the collaborative layer of the market order.",4

All three are constructive and take the ideas we propose seriously. As such, they have already helped further our thinking on the experimentally organized economy, the collaborative innovation bloc, and the future of Austrian economics. Arguably, the comment by Foss et al. (2019)—henceforth referred to as FKM—is the most critical of our perspective, which they criticize along four core margins. Nevertheless, they stress that there are “important points of contact between Austrian economics and the development-bloc and experimentally-organized-economy approaches,” and call our emphasis on experimentation “sweet music to Austrian ears.” Their criticism has been a useful way to further structuring our thinking concerning the relevance of our perspective, and while we scarcely believe that we will be able to convert FKM into true believers, we hope that they will look at our original contribution with a somewhat friendlier eye after reading this reply. Therefore, we will structure the next section of this reply around their four main critical points. The (more positive) comments made by Per Bylund (2019) and David Lucas (2019) will figure to some extent in this section, but since we believe that they highlight valuable ways in which the EOE perspective can and should be enriched, most of the points they raise will be dealt with in section 3.

32.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,16 January 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-0432-0,"A note on re-switching, the average period of production and the Austrian business-cycle theory",December 2019,Saverio M. Fratini,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The marginalist theory of distribution was initially grounded on the idea that distribution variables are the prices that firms pay for use of the factors of production: labour, land and capital. In particular, the rate of interest was generally understood as the price firms have to pay on the amount of capital employed.Footnote 1 Accordingly, because of factor substitutability, a decrease in the rate of interest was thought, ceteris paribus, to bring about the adoption of more capital-intensive methods of production. On this reasoning, the employment of capital – both in the production of a certain commodity and in the economy as a whole – was often regarded as measurable by the average length of the production process: more roundabout processes would require more capital but would also be more productive.Footnote 2 This vision collapsed in the 1960s as a result of the Cambridge capital theory controversy. As Samuelson wrote: the simple tale told by Jevons, Böhm-Bawerk, Wicksell, and other neoclassical writers – alleging that, as the interest rate falls in consequence of abstention from present consumption in favor of future, technology must become in some sense more ‘roundabout,’ more ‘mechanized,’ and ‘more productive’ – cannot be universally valid. (Samuelson 1966, p. 568.) In particular, it became clear that the rate of interest cannot be understood as the price paid for the use of capital. As explicitly stated by Bliss in his important book on capital theory: The value which accrues from a sale is the product of price and quantity sold. Hence if the rate of interest is the price of capital, the quantity of capital must be the wealth on which an interest yield is calculated. It will be shown shortly why this view is incorrect, but to cut a long story short, the conclusion may be announced at once. The rate of interest is not the price of capital. (Bliss 1975, pp. 6-7.) Despite these clear statements, however, the temptation to regard capital as a factor of production and the rate of interest as the price for its use resurfaces periodically. This may be due to the fact that applied economists have never stopped regarding income distribution as regulated by ‘factor productivity’ and theoretical economists are thus tempted to indulge in this vision. In particular, the propositions that tend to reappear concern a) the equality between the rate of interest and the ‘marginal product of capital’,Footnote 3 and b) the inverse relationship between the rate of interest and the ‘degree of roundaboutness’ of the production processes in use. Attention will be focused here on the latter. The ‘degree of roundaboutness’ in question is the notion of average period of production first introducedFootnote 4 by Hicks in Value and Capital (1946 [1939]) and further developed in Sargan (1955), von Weizsäcker (1971and 1977), Hicks (1973), Yeager (1976) and Malinvaud (1986, 2003).Footnote 5 This new concept of the average period is grounded on the idea of using the shares of costs anticipated at each date out of the total cost of production as weights instead of the shares of labour performed in each period out of the total labour embodied. Once this notion has been adopted, if a fall in the rate of interest brings about a change in the method of production of a certain commodity, then the incoming method is more ‘roundabout’ than the outgoing. Cachanosky and Lewin (2014) have shown more recently that this conception of the degree of roundaboutness corresponds to the notion of ‘duration’ used for the analysis of financial investment projects. They also claim that the adoption of this new average period of production ‘adds plausibility’ (p. 661) to the Austrian business-cycle theory,Footnote 6,Footnote 7 which they describe as follows: a monetary policy that reduces interest rates, increases the ‘average period of production’, or the degree of ‘roundaboutness,’ of the ‘structure of production,’ that is out of sync with consumer preferences, thus creating unsustainable imbalances in that structure. The increase in ‘roundaboutness,’ followed by its reduction when the monetary authority revises interest rates upward, is what constitutes the boom and bust in this business-cycle theory. (2014, p. 648.) This paper seeks to ascertain whether the new concept of the average period of production can actually prove useful in arguments of this kind. To this end, it starts from the traditional concept of the average period of production under the assumption of simple interest (section 2) and goes on to introduce compound interest and the new concept of the average period (section 3). The effect of re-switching on the results obtained by this new idea of roundaboutness is then addressed in section 4 and some conclusions concerning the working of the Austrian business-cycle theory are drawn in section 5.",12

Fratini,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Let me start this rejoinder with a simple experiment. Let us try to compare Cachanosky and Lewin’s description of the ABCT before and after the publication of my note. In an essay of 2016, they describe the working of the ABCT as follows: The distinctive aspect of ABCT in general is the effect of expansionary monetary policy (channeled through the financial markets) on the aggregate or average roundaboutness of the economy. Succinctly, starting from equilibrium, monetary policy that lowers interest rates provides an incentive in the market to increase the degree of roundaboutness beyond the point of sustainability. Because the central bank cannot keep interest rates low indefinitely, the increase in interest rates back to equilibrium levels makes the apparent profits of long-run and capital-intensive projects disappear revealing that they were not as profitable as had been assumed. The increase in the aggregate roundaboutness is the boom; the costly reallocation of resources back toward the “equilibrium level of roundaboutness” is the bust. (Cachanosky and Lewin 2016, pp. 24-5) In their comment to my note, Cachanosky and Lewin’s description of the ABCT is not as clear as it was earlier and something seems to have changed: In its most generic form, the ABCT posits a scenario in which, because of an unsustainably low discount rate, many investors mistakenly invest in unsustainable (ultimately unprofitable) ventures. A surge of investments characterized by higher Durations as a result of the lower rate of discount, is followed eventually by a surge of business failures reversing this trend, bouncing back to lower Duration, safer, investments. Regardless of whether the Duration[s] of some investments rise more or less than others, thus changing the ranking of ventures in terms of their Durations, investors are in general choosing higher duration investments. (Lewin and Cachanosky 2019) In the first quotation, it was rather evident that, according to the ABCT, low interest rates entail more roundabout processes of production (the ‘average roundaboutness of the economy’) and, in turn, the increase in the degree of roundaboutness of investments brings about an increase in the national income, namely an economic boom. In the second quotation, the description is more opaque. In particular, it is not clear whether they are referring to productive or financial investments, and the existence of a linkage between the fall in the rate of interest and the economic boom is not explicitly stated. It seems to me that the authors now have some doubts about this linkage. If my impression is right, then my note had the desired effect. In fact, as I will stress in the following section, the central point of my paper concerns exactly the possibility of a non-monotonic relation between rate of interest and net production.",2

33.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,13 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00495-4,"Karl Menger’s modernist journey: art, mathematics and mysticism, 1920–1955",March 2020,Robert Leonard,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Born in Vienna and dying in Chicago, Karl Menger (1902–1985) has been rightly described as a mathematician of considerable culture and erudition. Living in the Austrian capital until 1937, he was witness to the energy displayed by that city in a range of fields, scientific, intellectual and artistic. He is known to mathematicians for his original contributions to various areas of modern mathematics, such as the theory of curves and dimension and several fields of geometry, and his considerable efforts, particularly after his emigration to the U.S., in the development of mathematical pedagogy. He is remembered by historians of philosophy as an associate, albeit a somewhat reluctant one, of the Vienna Circle of Hahn, Schlick, Neurath and Carnap. By historians of economics, Menger is remembered as a catalyst in the Viennese chapter of the development of modern mathematical economics. Because of his family history, he had privileged access to economics circles in Vienna, and in time he became something of a conduit between the economics and mathematics communities. In the 1930’s, this was an unusual role, for social science was not a subject of predilection amongst serious mathematicians, and most of the academic economists in Vienna were sceptical about treating their subject in a mathematical manner. Their reasons covered the gamut, ranging from the epistemological to the political, but tradition was also important, for none other than Carl Menger himself, the mathematician’s father, had shown himself to be a mathematical sceptic. He had also insisted on the conceptual separation between the science of nature and the science of society, and argued, against the German historians, for the legitimacy of a universal, non-mathematical, economic theory. All of this had created the long-standing feeling in Vienna that economics was a unique and special sphere, not quite suitable for formal treatment. Menger junior exerted an influence upon the economics fraternity in several ways. First of all, he participated in several of their regular seminars and discussion groups, such as those surrounding Ludwig von Mises and Hans Mayer. Here, he acted as something of a fly in the ointment, pointing out cases of shoddy argument and challenging figures such as Mises for their lack of rigour or their inability to keep their politics out of their economic analysis. Secondly, as organiser of a somewhat similar group for mathematicians, his Mathematical Colloquium, he was able to promote an interest in economics among some of them. The most prominent example here was Abraham Wald with his contributions to the theory of Walrasian general equilibrium. Given the extent to which general equilibrium theory dominated the field in the second half of the twentieth century, it is this aspect of Menger’s Viennese career that has received most attention amongst historians of economics. Finally, he was an important influence upon Oskar Morgenstern who took a maverick interest in mathematics and would, in time, become the co-author with John von Neumann of the Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).Footnote 1 All that being said, in what follows, however, I would like to discuss an aspect of Menger’s life that has received little scholarly attention, namely the sphere of art and aesthetics, which, it turns out, was of considerable importance for him. Menger was actively interested in modern art of various kinds and, if one is to judge by various obiter dicta, he was also self-consciously Modern – aware of the novelty, and perhaps even heretical nature, of his artistic tastes. In the mid-1920’s, when he was in his early 20’s, he developed an interest in the work of certain graphic artists of the period, including members of the Dutch avant-garde movement De Stijl. Not only did he live for two years in The Netherlands, but he spent the first year or so living in an artists’ colony outside Amsterdam, close to his mathematical mentor L. E. J. Brouwer. During that time, he travelled to Paris to see Piet Mondrian’s studio, and at some point he acquired for his own Vienna apartment modern furniture in the style of that made by the Dutch Modernists. In Vienna, he discussed art with Clara Wittgenstein, the philosopher’s aunt, and he admired the Stonborough House, which Ludwig Wittgenstein had designed for his sister Margarethe. Menger spent the academic year 1930–31 in the U.S., first at Harvard, then at the Rice Institute in Texas. In Cambridge, Massachussetts, he engaged both Harvard’s George Birkhoff and MIT’s Norbert Wiener in discussions of aesthetics, a subject in which both mathematicians were interested. Travelling across the U.S., Menger was greatly taken by the native art of the American Southwest. Not only was he interested in art, but Menger drew connections between it and mathematics. He saw mathematics as an art form -- albeit one that had its own rules and often showed itself to be uncannily relevant to science – and in Vienna in the late 1920’s and early 1930’s, when defending freedom in the pursuit of abstract mathematics, in the context of the foundational debates, he invoked the very Modernist defence of “Art for Art’s Sake”. When he opposed Otto Neurath’s campaign for Unified Science, it was not because of any belief in a distinction between the natural and social sciences (regardless of what his father may have written), but because he believed that trying to try to impose restrictions upon what constituted legitimate “science” was to ignore the artistic nature of scientific and mathematical creativity. When Menger moved to the U.S., he eventually arrived at the Illinois Institute of Technology, the Chicago campus of which was then being built by Mies van der Rohe, whose architecture Menger likened to the work of Mondrian. In 1943, with encouragement from Walter Gropius, Menger and his wife Hilda developed a set of children’s building blocks, designed as an aid in architectural and cultural education. In 1952, at the Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry, Menger organised an educational exhibition, designed in this case to present the wonders of geometry to a broader audience. In short, the mathematician appears to have had a sustained, deep engagement with the world of art. In what follows, we retrace his aesthetic journey from interwar Vienna to postwar Chicago, via the Austrian alps, Dutch lowlands, Paris of Mondrian and deserts of the American Southwest.",1
33.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,05 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00445-0,The legacy of Max Weber and the early Austrians,March 2020,Stefan Kolev,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The relationship between the proponents of the different Historical Schools and the economists who in the course of the 1880s and 1890s were recognized as a Viennese or Austrian School is more complex than often asserted. The standard narrative about the irreconcilable hostility of the Methodenstreit during the 1880s is difficult to transpose, neither to the years before nor to the decades after the controversy between Carl Menger and Gustav Schmoller. This hostility-based narrative suffers not only from overrating the precision attributable to the historiographic category “school”. More importantly, it underrates the crucial role of those scientists who can be depicted with the category “in-between”. Such a scholar transcends the boundaries of the allegedly hermetically school communities: He or she can do so either because one’s works unintendedly share characteristics typical for both communities, or because the scholar has deliberately decided to bring harmony to the mutually hostile communities. This paper delves into the life and works of Max Weber through the lens of an “in-between” scholar during the post-Methodenstreit coexistence of the Historical Schools and the Austrians. After outlining in Section 2 a number of caveats for the category “school” in this context, Section 3 examines Weber’s role as an “in-between” biographically, while Section 4 does that substantively. His works shared characteristics typical for both communities, and he deliberately aimed at bringing harmony into what he saw as the deplorable ruins left behind by the Methodenstreit. By exploring the period from the 1880s to his passing in 1920, the paper studies Weber’s relationship to the Austrian School – and does so by introducing some typically Austrian “roundaboutness” in re-examining the Historical Schools’ evolution, enabling a more complex picture on Weber’s self-positioning vis-à-vis both schools. The core subject matter utilized to indicate Weber’s intentions vis-à-vis both schools and their controversy is his project of Social Economics. Particularly one sub-project within Social Economics – economic sociology – receives special attention: It is classified as the “missing link” necessary for Weber’s synthesis between the positions of Menger and Schmoller, an “irenic formula” capable of bringing harmony to the adherents of the theoretical and the historical approaches – and that even across several generations. This substantive focus also entails a personal focus for the paper: Weber’s links to the Austrians are studied especially (but not exclusively) through his nexus to Friedrich von Wieser and Joseph Schumpeter. It was those two Austrians – whether they belonged to the Austrian School or not depends on the narrowness of its definition – who, in the course of the last two decades of Weber’s life, became especially receptive to the research agenda of Social Economics in general and to economic sociology in particular. And the impact of Social Economics did not end here, the term – also as Socioeconomics – is still widely (and heterogeneously) used today (Davis and Dolfsma 2010/2015; Mikl-Horke 2011). Somewhat easier to overlook, the hopes of Weber, Wieser and Schumpeter about the attractiveness of their research program proved vindicated also in the very next generation: The political economies in the Hayek-Eucken generation are reconstructable as a continuation of economic sociology as understood in the age of Weber (Kolev 2018; Kolev 2019).",2
33.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,14 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00439-y,"On emancipators, engineers, and students: The appropriate attitude of the economist",March 2020,Erwin Dekker,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Central in my book The Viennese students of Civilization (2016) is the distinction between the student and the scientist as two fundamentally different attitudes toward the social world. Whereas both student and scientist are looking for knowledge about the social world, the scientist does so in order to improve the social world by controlling some social forces, the student on the other hand does so primarily to learn how to deal (cope) with the world. In the book I argued crucially that what sets the (early) Austrian tradition apart from much of the rest of economics is its belief that the researcher at best can study the order within society, but is in no position to change it. If there is anything she might be able to do, it is to see how these natural forces can be channeled to bring about good. She is consequently in the position of a student of forces that are beyond her control, a position, which as she realizes brings her close to natural scientists of the early modern kind. It also makes her marvel at the actual order that emerges from these natural forces. I contrasted this with the image of the modern scientist who thinks of scientific knowledge as an instrument to bring about social change. For the modern scientist the forces he studies are ultimately within control, although particular manipulations may prove difficult. Funny enough this social scientist also believes himself to be much like the natural scientist, but now of the modern engineering type, who can employ technology for the benefit of society. It is clear that this type of image dominates much of economics: from Keynesian demand management, to modernization theories in development economics, and from modern randomized control trials to efforts to improve consumer choice. The core idea for the scientist economist is that he produces useful knowledge which can be instrumentally applied. It is harder to imagine what the knowledge that the student produces is good for. After all she does not produce knowledge that can be instrumentally applied, and hence it is tempting to think of her as merely pursuing knowledge for knowledge’s sake. An important argument of this paper will be that this view is mistake. The student does produce valuable knowledge, and it is a type of value that extends beyond her own curiosity. In this paper I will call that knowledge therapeutic and edifying. It is knowledge that is relevant for action, and guiding human choices and behavior, and it might help inform governance, but not in an instrumental manner. It also contains what we might call a ‘negative’ element, it demonstrates what we cannot do, achieve, and what we better not choose or pursue. In my book I heavily emphasized this ‘negative’ component, in part to draw out the limits of any type of social knowledge, and to illustrate the distinctiveness of the Austrian perspective. But two chapters also dealt explicitly with the limits of the position of the humble student aware of her limitations, and without control over social forces. I questioned whether it is an intellectual position that can only lead to quietism, or fatalism. The limits of this position were quite apparent during the interwar period, when the Viennese students turned into custodians if not defenders of their civilization (the set of orders in society). At least a number of Central-European thinkers were no longer content being merely a student, but sought to find a way in which they could sustain these orders, and indeed help foster them. This put them in a more activist position, and some critics started to point to a seeming inconsistency in their intellectual position. On the one hand they claimed to study natural social orders, on the other hand they seemed to favor and promote certain types of social order and critiquing and actively seeking to prevent others.Footnote 1 This paper is an attempt to reconcile this inconsistency, by drawing out more precisely what the differences are. In particular it argues that my original distinction between scientists and students was too simple to make sense of the change in attitude of the Viennese students during the 1940’s, nor can it make complete sense of the critique they offered of positive science. In order to do so we will start from the following 2 × 2 matrix.Footnote 2 Attitude Position Activist/Constructive Accepting/Corrective Humanist Emancipator Student Scientist Social Engineer Positivist / Historicist Introducing the matrix this early in this paper undoubtedly raises many questions, more than we can answer at this point, but clarifying this matrix is the main purpose of this paper, and it should help us think about the attitude we have towards the social world and knowledge of it, as observers of the social world. Making attitude central might seem curious, and I understand it is an unlikely, even uncomfortable subject to study, but I think to capture the essential difference there is no better way. This is not to discredit other types of distinctions we can make between internalist and externalist positions, and about the difference between focusing on outcomes vs. institutional preconditions. It is simply to suggest that differences in attitude towards the social world are important, and the cause of fundamental disagreements between intellectual traditions. This emphasis on attitude is also an effort to make explicit what is often implicit in what Schumpeter has called the vision of particular economists (Schumpeter 1949). This is as much, I contend, an attitude toward the economy and society more generally. Schumpeter’s own attitude is in fact a great example of what we are investigating here. He was a very serious scholar in the social sciences, eminently concerned with understanding, but adopted a curious Viennese type of irony when it came to improving that world. The world was very worthy of his consideration, but attempts to change it could only be understood as human folly.Footnote 3 It is in part my continued struggle with this Viennese irony, and the attempt to characterize this not merely as a cultural phenomenon, but also as an intellectual attitude that has provided much of the impetus for what is to follow. But before we move to actual analysis let us first explore the four ideal-typical position that result from my small matrix. To do so I believe the first important thing to do is stake out clearly how the student is different from the scientist, and to build at least some credibility for the student position in the first place. A good place to start for this is with the work of the American pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty.",5

Boettke,Rosolino A. Candela,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) of the 1930s had a particularly special role in the evolution of economic theory and in preserving the economic principles inherited from classical political economy. Not only did it become the intellectual center for consolidating neoclassical economics into a unified economic theory.Footnote 1 It would also later prove to be the staging ground for the creation of various new schools of economic thought, which can trace their origins back to the LSE. For example, the development of the Austrian business cycle theory and the maturation of the market-process approach to economics by F.A. Hayek, the development of transaction-cost economics under Ronald Coase, and the pioneering of mechanism design theory by Leonid Hurwicz, all took place during their time at the LSE. Hayek, Coase, and Hurwicz would each be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, 1991, and 2007, respectively, for their contributions. For the purposes of the paper, however, we will be focusing on the contributions of F.A. Hayek, along with Lionel Robbins, in fostering an intellectual environment for the transmission and incorporation of Austrian economics, particularly the works of Ludwig von Mises, into a unified tradition of economic theory that consisted of various strands of economic thought that had either contributed to or were consistent with the Austrian tradition. The work done by Hayek, as well as Robbins, at the LSE not only consolidated the ideas of the Austrian traditionFootnote 2 that had developed from Vienna. In doing so, they also rearticulated the broader theoretical contributions of classical political economy as a counterweight against an emerging neoclassical and Keynesian paradigm. By contextualizing what would prove to be the flowering of a “Golden Era” at the LSE of the 1930s, our paper develops a relatively neglected link in the migration of the Austrian tradition from its Viennese roots to America. According to Erwin Dekker, the primary contribution of the Austrians in Vienna, or the “Viennese students of civilization” as he dubs them, was “to show us the power of the forces of society that work to our benefits. Language, markets and laws all make human interaction possible and mutually beneficial, and it is for this reason that Hayek argues that we should ‘marvel’ at the workings of the market” (Dekker 2016a: 128; see also Dekker 2016b). Given the collapse of the Habsburgs and the rise of fascism in Austria, the context of the Viennese period was one of concern for the decline of civilization and the preservation of those institutions integral to liberalism, economic calculation, and social cooperation under the division of labor, which include private property and freedom of contract under the rule of law. By the time the Austrian tradition had migrated to America, the emphasis that had come to define the Austrian economics included not only radical subjectivism and the role of expectations, but also the notion of the market as a process of entrepreneurial discovery (see Vaughn 1994). In between these periods, Hayek would become the most well-known and leading Austrian at the LSE. Along with Lionel Robbins, their mutually-held inspiration was to explicate the trade cycle theory advanced by Mises as well as render explicit the theoretical implications of the Misesian critique of economic calculation under socialism. Directly and indirectly, the research questions to which that many students and faculty of the LSE, including Abba Lerner, Ronald Coase, and Leonid Hurwicz, had been drawn were motivated by Mises’s critique of economic calculation under socialism in his 1920 article, “Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth” (1920 [1975]). In particular, rendering explicit what Mises had left implicit in his work generated not only a research program that would be advanced by Hayek and Robbins. This joint research program also became an effort to consolidate the lessons of classical political economy and early neoclassical economics, particularly methodological subjectivism, into a unified economic theory. The inspiration that Hayek drew from Mises can be best summarized as follows: The whole trade-cycle theory rested on the idea that prices determined the direction of production. You had, at the same time, the whole discussion of anticipations. I found out that the whole Mises argument about calculation really ultimately rested on the same idea, and that drove me to the ‘37 article, which then became the systematic basis of my further development (1978 [1983]: 383). The immediate lessons of the socialist calculation debate, as well as Hayek’s macroeconomic debate against Keynes, illustrated to Hayek and Robbins a larger and more fundamental agenda. This became a scholarly effort to remedy a particular deficiency of interpretation regarding the lessons of economics going back to Adam Smith. What emerged after the 1920s, as exemplified in Keynes’ “The End of Laissez-Faire” (1926), was the misconception that Adam Smith’s invisible hand and the “system of natural liberty” always generated beneficial outcomes independent of any institutional context. But as Robbins further writes: [T]he English Classical Economists never conceived the system of economic freedom as arising in vacuo or functioning in a system of law and order so simple and so minimal as to be capable of being written down on a limited table of stone (or a revolutionary handbill) and restricted to the functions of the night watchman. Nothing less than the whole complex of the Benthamite codes – Civil, Penal and Constitutional – was an adequate framework for their system (emphasis original, 1952 [1965]: 188) Moreover, Hayek emphasized a similar point: There can be no doubt that after Bentham's early distinction between the agenda and the non-agenda of government, the classical writers very much neglected the positive part of the task and thereby allowed the impression to gain ground that laissez-faire was their ultimate and only conclusion – a conclusion which, of course, would have been invalidated by the demonstration that, in any single case, State action was useful. To remedy this deficiency must be one of the main tasks of the future (emphasis original, Hayek 1933: 134). Throughout the 1930s, Hayek, along with Robbins, sought to render explicit the epistemic function of liberal institutions, such as private property and freedom of contract under the rule of law, in facilitating the coordination of an infinite number of individual ends without deliberate command via the price system (Boettke 2018). Therefore, it was an immediate concern with the attacks made by Institutionalists and Historicists on one side and the Cambridge economists on the other, particularly Keynes, which drew Hayek and Robbins into establishing a unified tradition in economic theory, within which the Austrian tradition represented the analytical core. As a by-product of their theoretical analysis, their broader goal was to use the technical principles of economic theory to emphasize the institutional arrangements necessary to preserving Western civilization, as had been emphasized by classical political economy.",7

Mises, often classified as a member of the third generation of the Austrian school (Klausinger 2006, p. 25),Footnote 1 was instrumental to the rise of interest in Austrian economics in the US after the Second World War, as Hülsmann (2007), Kirzner (2001) and Vaughn (1994) well document. It is probably not far-fetched to say that there would be no Austrian movement without Mises. Movements and their leaders, however, do not emerge in a vacuum, and while ideas matter, bodies carrying these ideas need sustenance and resources, both in a metaphorical and strictly literal sense. It would, for example, be difficult to write a substantial book such as Human Action (Mises 1996 [1949]) on a shoestring. It is therefore to get a better understanding of the financial context of Mises’s career in the US that I look closely at the financial resources available to Mises and his wife Margit—or the Mises family as I sometimes refer to them—after their arrival to the US. My investigation is not the first one to discuss the topic, and I review published works in the following section, particularly Hülsmann (2007) and Margit von Mises (1976). While these are helpful starting points in the discussion, they do not give systematic accounts of Mises’s financial situation as it evolved. In the remaining parts of the paper, I use archival materials, such as Mises’s financial records, to give a more nuanced discussion of the initial financial difficulties of the Mises family after their arrival in 1940 and of their general financial health while living in the US. I also look at some of the noteworthy episodes of this personal financial history, including details on the funding of Mises’s position at New York University between 1945 and 1969.",

However, we still have yet to reach an all-encompassing answer agreed upon by the discipline. Boettke and Coyne (2003) point out that it is widely agreed that the entrepreneur and the role of institutions are key in explaining why economic progress is achieved in some areas of the world and not others. My present research motivation is similar to that of Boettke and Coyne (2003) in that I am investigating the relationship between entrepreneurial activity and economic development. However, I wish to chiefly focus on how the role of property rights influences the substance of entrepreneurship that in some situations results in economic growth, yet economic stagnation or economic decline in others. I am also interested in the conclusions we can draw from the evolution in property rights during the process of economic growth and its effect on entrepreneurial activity. Scholars of the Austrian School of Economics have offered innumerable insights into our understanding of the market as a process in which alert entrepreneurs working with imperfect information choose among limited, competing means to achieve their ever-changing ends. In an analysis of the market process, “well-defined and enforced property rights” are taken as a starting point to show how exchange within this institutional foundation leads to welfare-enhancing outcomes as entrepreneurs seek to maximize profits and increase their overall satisfaction. Scholars of New Institutional Economics have shown the importance of institutions in shaping human prosperity and the productive outcomes of society and that not all institutional frameworks lead to prosperity. However, if we take well-defined property rights as our starting point, how do we explain institutional change and its subsequent impact on the market process? If the knowledge problem exists, how does it apply to the evolution of property rights and our classification of these rights as “well-defined” ex-ante? If holes in the current property rights structure present the entrepreneur with a profit opportunity if she is able to better define them, this seems akin to an entrepreneurial endeavor in the Kirznerian tradition since it is an unfortunate reality that property rights are often not well-defined ex-ante (or else such holes would not exist). By integrating these Austrian and New Institutional approaches, the once very fuzzy picture of economic growth becomes a bit sharper. To be clear, the problem I am attempting to tackle presently is not just a question of enforceability of the institutions, but rather a process of figuring out what belongs in the property rights framework as well as how to protect it. This inquiry is certainly not an attempt to undermine the importance of private property rights as a necessary foundation of the market process. Furthermore, I do not wish to explain the origins of property rights as a foundation of the market process. Instead, I am interested in processing how new property rights are adopted into the institutional framework and how property rights arrangements alter in response to new information. A strong literature (discussed further in Section 3) shows how institutional entrepreneurs play a crucial role in changing the institutional arrangement within which they operate. However, relatively little has addressed the role of the ‘institutional entrepreneur’ in fundamentally changing the substance of property rights within which they are operating. Institutional entrepreneurs are credited for finding better ways to codify/formalize existing informal institutions, adopting institutional frameworks from other nations into their respective space, and adopting mechanisms that better protect existing institutions. These institutions include property rights. More specifically, institutional entrepreneurs can play a role in bringing forth new property rights that did not previously exist or disbanding property rights that were problematic. If this is possible, what value does this form of institutional entrepreneurship give us in our understanding of the nature of entrepreneurship, development, institutional change, and human flourishing, more broadly? This paper seeks to address these questions and continue a conversation about the link between property rights, entrepreneurship and economic growth. Distinguishing between identifying a need for and establishing a property right and the enforcement of that property right enhances our ability to understand the role that property rights play in shaping market entrepreneurship and development. To put it another way, in diagnosing problematic property rights arrangements, it is important for us identify the source of the problem correctly. Since we do not live in a world in which property rights are always well-defined, and in many cases they may be clearly defined but a highly problematic for the environment in which serve as a foundation, our analysis must not be fragile to these realities. The analysis that follows will enhance the literature by opening up our ability to model the market process in situations in which property rights may be dynamic and not well-defined. By unbundling the many roles of the institutional entrepreneur, we are better suited to explain the mechanisms of institutional change. Section 2 reviews the literature on entrepreneurship and the market process. Section 3 discusses the role of property rights and institutional entrepreneurship. Section 4 introduces a new type of the institutional entrepreneur as a mechanism to overcome incomplete or poorly-defined property rights. Section 5 positions this new institutional entrepreneur as a factor in economic development. Section 6 offers concluding thoughts.",8

What would have been Friedrich Hayek’s main concerns? We have some basis for answering such questions. On one hand, Mises gave a set of lectures on development economics in 1959 in Argentina (von Mises 1979). When I first read these lectures, I thought they might as well have been prepared for a visit to Romania in the early 1990s. They were the clearest account I had seen by that time of some of the main transition debates, such as the debate about foreign investment and private property. On the other hand, one of the main recent concerns about the post-communist transition is the rise of right-wing populism in Poland, Hungary, and Romania. Hayek’s Road to Selfdom (1944) is in many ways a book about the threat of populism in the aftermath of adopting dysfunctional economic policies. Mises’ Argentina lectures cover, chapter by chapter, the fundamental problems of transition: (1) understanding how and why capitalism works, (2) understanding why socialism didn’t work, (3) understanding why advanced welfare states require high levels of already accumulated wealth, and, hence, mindlessly copying existing Western policies would likely fail (one needs, instead, to look into the history of western countries, rather than just at their present), (4) understanding the dangers and causes of inflation (a major problem in Eastern Europe in the 1990s), (5) understanding the importance of foreign investment as a mechanism for economic convergence, and the necessary institutional underpinnings for this process to occur and bring about development, with a particular focus on the importance of credible private property protections, and (6) the challenge of economic reform when most people don’t know economics and have misleading intuitions. There’s little doubt that Austrians like Mises or Hayek would have had serious qualms about the manner in which the post-communist transition was actually managed, although they would have agreed with prices liberalization and privatization. Moreover, the post-communist transition raised a typical Austrian dilemma – how to correct past misallocations of labor and capital. Indeed, post-communist governments scrambled to fix, with a minimum of social unrest, the massive misallocations of capital and labor that had been created during decades of communism. In this regard, their strategy was decidedly non-Austrian. Apart from privatization and prices liberalization, it also involved very high inflation and providing incentives to retire. Additional policies prevented market-driven capital and labor adjustments, such as the overly-cautious attitudes toward foreign investment, zoning laws preventing urbanization, and delayed formation of capital markets. Consequently, large fractions of the Eastern European populations were left behind during the transition and still cannot enjoy many of the benefits brought by market economies. This economic failure combined with a culture shock following the EU accession. The EU accession allowed numerous people, including many young people, to travel to the West, and bring back a distinctly more liberal way of thinking – more materialistic, more concerned with individual rights, and more cosmopolitan. This has caused a cultural rift within Eastern European societies between pro-European liberals and conservative traditionalists, partly nostalgic for the communist past and partly nostalgic for an imagined deeper past promoted by nationalistic fantasies. Indeed, a striking fact about Eastern Europe is that opinion polls consistently find that about half the population agrees with statements like “life was better under communism” and “communism was a good idea misapplied” (Nicoara and Tarko 2018). This cultural rift also created political and intellectual opportunities, as some of the otherwise well-educated and privileged beneficiaries of the post-communist transition are speculating the personal gains, in terms of prominence and power, that can be obtained by feeding populist, nationalist and religious fevers. This dynamic is eerily reminiscent of Hayek’s account of “how the worst get on top” in The Road to Serfdom. The failure to allow markets to quickly reallocate labor and capital, the push toward early retirement, continuing corruption, and the EU accession cultural shock have all been a fertile ground for the growth of anti-market and anti-European populism, infused with fundamentalist religion and nationalism. This has taken virtually everyone by surprise, although some warnings and insights were available in the Austrian literature from Hayek (1944) all the way to the more recent concerns about the interactions between culture and formal institutions (Boettke 1996; Lavoi and Chamlee-Wright 2001; Boettke et al. 2008; Evans 2008; 2008; 2014; Aligica and Evans 2009; Tarko 2015). Considering the failure of mainstream economics to predict the collapse of communism and the extent of the failure of socialist planning (Levy and Peart 2011), combined with the better insight provided by contrarian Austrian writers (Lavoie 1985a, 1985b; Steele 1999), one might have expected that economists would have looked primarily to Austrian economics for insight into what went wrong and how to engineer the transition. This did not happen. Mainstream economics did not pause to try out new conceptual tools, and the early post-communist Eastern Europeans do not seem to have been particularly influenced by Austrian economics. This was partly because the Austrian critique sounded so obvious to anyone who had experienced communism that it was hard to believe that it was controversial within the economics profession. To the extent that Austrian economists were listened to, it was with respect to the least original aspects of their advice, namely about the need to abolish price controls and establish market prices. In this regard, they overlapped with Milton Friedman and other pro-market economists as part of the “shock therapy” camp (Yergin and Stanislaw 1998). Other important insights, about the difficulties of reallocating heterogeneous physical and human capital, about the institutions underpinning foreign investment and financial markets, about democracy as a collective learning process, about the importance of civil society, and about the threat of populism, came into view only as the problems materialized.",3

Salter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the distinctive characteristics of the Austrian literature is the role assigned to the entrepreneur. In the Mises-Hayek-Kirzner analysis, the entrepreneur is no less than the driving force of the market. Without this particular economic function, there is no change in the market and therefore no convergence to equilibrium. The Austrian literature is also skeptic of what central banks can achieve. This criticism on central banking rests on knowledge problems faced by policy makers that eventually lead to costly mistakes. And, since there is no competition in central banking as there is in markets, mistakes are not corrected quickly enough and eventually society bears the costs. The 2008 crisis is an event about which a number of voices acknowledged the need of Austrian insights to understand how the imbalances that led to the crisis were built (Cachanosky and Salter 2017). In this paper, we apply Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurial alertness to the realm of central banking. We argue that policy makers are required to have a special kind of alertness. We refer to this particular quality as super-alertness, which stands as questionable assumption when implementing monetary policy. The difference is that central banks are not mere actors that operate within the market, but their actions in part determine the constraints and relative prices that prevail on the market. As such, they need to forecast market conditions in non-existing markets. But, information of non-existing markets does not yet exist. The efficiency of central banks should not be taken as given, but rather should be approached as a testable hypothesis. Selgin et al. (2012) find that the U.S. Federal Reserve, arguably one of the most efficient central banks in the world), fails to outperform the pre-Fed era. The problem, as we argue in this paper, is not only about policy design, but also about the particular type of knowledge that central bankers need to have to achieve its objective better than alternative institutional arrangements. The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section discusses Kirzner’s idea of alertness. Section three compares the market process and information of the cases of free banking and central banking. Section four introduces the super-alertness analysis. Section five draws implications from our arguments. Section six concludes.",2

On November 8, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that at midnight of November 9, the Indian government would demonetize the 500 and 1000-rupee notes (approximately $7.50 and $15 bills) removing 86.9% of the value of currency in circulation. The reason for this drastic move was to smoke out “black money” i.e. income and wealth on which taxes have not been paid. The government anticipated that a large share of the old notes was held by tax evaders and criminals, who would not deposit their stock of the revoked currency notes (and eat their losses), to avoid legal scrutiny. The Indian government would receive a revenue windfall based on the black money held in cash, not exchanged for new notes. For example, if 90% of the demonetized rupees had made it back to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the remaining 10% would have been written off, which would have provided a one-time massive dividend of approximately 1.5 trillion rupees ($24 billion) to the Indian government. Some estimated the windfall to be between 10 and 33% of the currency in circulation (Datta 2017; IANS 2017). This, however, did not go according to plan. After a vague and cagey responses for months, the RBI annual report (2017) confirmed that ₹15.3 trillion of the demonetized currency i.e. 99.3%, is back in the banking system and only ₹107 billion, or 0.7% worth of the old notes, were not returned. What is surprising is that Indians managed to return virtually all the old notes in such a small window. J.P. Koning (2017) points out this peculiarity of the Indian experience by contrasting it to the euro: “When the Euro was introduced in January 2002, people were given fixed windows of time to redeem existing national banknotes before their money status was revoked.… By the time this ten-year exchange period was over, 99.15% of Italian lira had been returned while 98.77% of French francs made it back.… What makes the final 98.96% [now 99.3%] return rate even more incredible is that, unlike the European demonetizations—which allowed unlimited, no questions-answered redemption—the Indian demonetization imposed per-person ceilings on the number of rupees that could be freely converted into new paper rupees. This was money laundering on a grand scale.” That 99.3% of the currency came back could mean one of two things. While there really was 10–40% black money in the economy, tax evaders and criminals never held this wealth in cash holdings; they were adept at laundering before demonetization through shell companies, tax havens abroad, and Swiss bank accounts. As they never held black money in cash, there was no problem in returning their old notes to the RBI through deposits. A second, and far more realistic, possibility is that Indians did hold large amount of black money in cash, but they are so adept at reacting to draconian state policies that in a mere 60 days, they displayed extraordinary entrepreneurship and managed to launder their money and deposit it in banks. William Luther reasons that India “consistently scores near the bottom of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index—130th in 2017. In that environment, one must learn how to skirt the rules in order to survive. So, naturally, Indians have become quite skilled in navigating bureaucratic obstacles.” (Luther 2017). As a result, a lot of the black money had already been laundered pre-demonetization. However, post-demonetization, some clever and new entrepreneurial actions helped launder money at a scale never seen before and return the revoked currency in a mere sixty days. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram thinks the latter, and has called demonetization, and the citizens’ response a great money laundering exercise (PTI 2018b). Indians are experts at circumventing laws and regulation and they even have a colloquial term for it in Hindi—jugaad. Jugaad has many meanings—finding a makeshift, low-cost, or creative solution to a problem; being entrepreneurial and innovative; removing obstacles; or troubleshooting. This curious Indian talent has made its way into academic journals and financial papers and is discussed in academic conferences (Radjou et al. 2010). Jugaadu is used to describe someone adept at jugaad and is almost always a compliment. Through 70 years of draconian regulations under socialism, Indians have honed this skill. There is a fix for everything, all rules can be managed; it is only a question of price. As entire cottage industries at varying levels of sophistication survive on providing these services, the cost of circumvention decreases. This ability makes Indians robust to shocks and adapt very quickly to unforeseen events. Even a 60-day window to exchange banned notes will lead to a higher yield than windows 60 times longer as provided in the case of the transition to the Euro. There are two aspects to this kind of response by Indians. First, that Indians were quite adept at circumventing the rules to launder money even before the demonetization announcement, and this skill was the direct consequences of the regulatory regime combined with weak state capacity in India. The second aspect is that post-demonetization Indian entrepreneurs discovered some new methods of circumventing the latest state diktat and laundering their money swiftly within the 60-day deadline (Rajagopalan 2018). This paper explores how government interventions led entrepreneurs to superfluous discovery processes in response to the government diktat of demonetization. Discovering new avenues helped with money laundering on such a massive scale after demonetization. Indians, quite used to top-down and pernicious state regulation, have learned to adapt. This kind of swift and sophisticated laundering in a mere sixty days is a result of the burdensome Indian regulatory state and the culture it has created within the Indian economic system. By exploring the Indian case of the response to demonetization, this paper shows how a single top down intervention like the demonetization policy impacts the entrepreneurial discovery process as individuals are incentivized to exploit uncontrolled margins in order to avoid the full consequences of the rules. In this sense, there are some “wholly superfluous” discoveries are necessarily for individuals to achieve certain ends, but they are not necessarily desirable. This is an addition to the existing commentary on the high costs demonetization imposed on the economy (Rajagopalan and White 2017). In the following sections, I discuss the interventions that led to demonetization and the kind of wholly superfluous discovery processes that followed Indian demonetization, that helped Indians survive the event of demonetization, but also laundered money at a never before scale and speed leading to undesirable future outcomes.",7

Dozier,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The social sciences are necessarily interdependent, with theory and evidence moving between disciplines and scholars as intellectual currency. Within the social sciences, one of the primary questions is how human societies adapt, change, and flourish. Archaeology, the study of the human past through physical remains and artifacts, is the only source of information about the vast majority of our human history. Anthropological archaeology relates archaeological findings within the context of social science theorizing to better understand the development of the diverse set of cultures and adaptations throughout the world.Footnote 1 Archaeology provides the basis for our understanding of when, where, and how humans went from small-scale, egalitarian foragers to sedentary, agricultural members of state-level societies. As such, archaeological work provides an academic framework for understanding the development of human societies for scholars working in a diversity of disciplines. In this paper, I explore the archaeological and anthropological influences in Austrian economic thought to the United States from 1870 to 1960, trailing the movement of various prominent scholars in the tradition. I especially note the work of Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) and Friedrich Hayek (1899–1992). In putting their work in context of archaeological knowledge about human social and technological evolution in their respective lifetimes, I aim to elucidate more subtle influences in their intellectual work. In compliment, I also trace the influence that similar theoretical perspectives has had on the field of anthropological archaeology, particularly with the concept of methodological individualism within American archaeology in the twentieth century. This work therefore is a general overview for the various points of contact between Austrian Economics and anthropological archaeology over the course of their intellectual histories. In closing, I reflect on the lasting influence of the Austrian school in recent anthropologically minded research in the field. This is not intended to be a complete history on the interaction between the fields, nor an analysis on the formal influences of the famous Austrian economists on archaeology; either such works would be quite the book. Rather, this is an extract, a highlight, of some of the similar challenges and interests between Austrian Economics and anthropological archaeology. It is my hope that it serves as an introduction to the parallel interests of these social sciences, especially as archaeological methods and theory are now more soundly ready to be used as data to accurately study economic development in the past (M. E. Smith et al. 2012).",1

Indeed, within the last decade or so, political philosophy has undergone something of a methodenstreit – an intense disagreement over the proper methodology of political philosophy. There has been talk of ideal versus non-ideal theory, end-state versus transitional theorizing, realism versus moralism, fact-sensitive versus fact-insensitive normative principles, and much more. Perhaps foolishly, this paper tries to contribute to this growing debate on the methodology of political philosophy. To offer a new contribution to an old debate, though, requires one introduce a new framework or lens of analysis. To this end, the next section introduces a new way of carving up the political philosophy landscape. Beyond the simple ideal/non-ideal theory distinction (explicated in detail in the next section), we can – following economist Richard Wagner – distinguish between political philosophers who are east of Eden and those who are west of Babel (§2). East of Eden political philosophers – the current, dominant paradigm – articulate a guiding ideal end state for us to strive in pursuit of. West of Babel political philosophers – much less common – deny that such an end state exists. For them, there is only continual and unending disagreement and conflict. The job of the political philosopher is to propose ways of adjudicating such disputes so that we may live better together. With this distinction in hand we can better carve up political philosophy’s conceptual landscape (§3). After examining this space, only one paradigm remains standing as a tenable pursuit: non-ideal political philosophy that is west of Babel. Problematically, though, since most political philosophy does not fall into this category, it is unclear what political philosophy looks like when practiced in this manner. To end, the paper sketches what such a research program might look like, particularly what is left for the political philosopher working within such a research program to do (§4). Though radically different from political philosophy as traditionally practiced, I believe this type of research agenda is the way forward, and, indeed, the future of the discipline.",4

This is a central challenge for both political theory and those who would practice politics. In this paper, I examine the ways in which liberal theory and democratic procedure have sought to address the justificatory challenge posed by the practice of politics and the existence of states. In the first section, I identify universal consent as the fundamental liberal standard of state legitimacy and consider how this standard might be satisfied. The main contention of this section is that although universal consent is a very high justificatory standard for any state to meet, a weakening of the demands it places on states via a shift to ideal theory will fail to adequately uphold the liberal principles of individual liberty and equality. In the second section, I consider the use of majoritarian democratic procedure as a ‘next best’ substitute for universal consent and conclude that a reliance on democratic procedure under a principle of universal suffrage is not only insufficient to protect liberal standards, but can also actively degrade them. In the final section I consider the future of the liberal project given these challenges and propose a measure for delivering universal consent which can legitimise contemporary states to those subject to them on their own terms, without reverting to idealisation or majoritarianism.",

For Smith, market society arose spontaneously as a result of the desire to trade and exchange. This simple fact provided a presumption in favor of whatever economic system produced greater liberty. At the same time, Smith warned that markets are all to often subject to manipulation and control by both governments and private actors. Hence he provided a prima facie argument against guilds and other institutions that restraint economic freedom. Smith’s approach is natural to economists. But among historians it is more common to encounter a variant of Polanyi’s (1944) argument that market society is a recent phenomenon; an artifact of modernity forced upon recalcitrant populations by capitalists and politicians. According to this view, peasants and townsfolk had no desire to engage in commercial society. They had to be coerced into doing so. For historians inspired by this Polanyian vision, guilds were institutions that sheltered workers from market forces and cultivated solidarity.Footnote 5 Markets were everywhere in medieval and early modern Europe. But they are also always and everywhere subject to control and restraint. For Ogilvie, as for Smith, the fact that guilds sought to restrict voluntary exchange and trade, there is a prima facie case against them. Again and again, Ogilvie provides examples of guilds raising prices and limiting the economic choices of ordinary people. For example, in early 16th-century York “labourers complained that the carpenters’ guild ‘would not suffer them to make a bed, a shelf, a form, [or] a stool, [or] nail a board, a door, a gate, [or] a window”’ (Ogilvie 2019, p.135). Similarly, in Dijon it was said that “the guild masters had organized such a monopoly ‘that no other than they are admitted to practice their occupations in the said town”’ (Ogilvie 2019, p.137). The historical record uncovered by Ogilvie’s research vindicates Smith and contradicts Polanyi. Regulation was the first resort of the powerful. Being excluded from markets was costly and these costs often fell most heavily on women, the poor, and on other disadvantaged groups such as non-citizen aliens (who happened to be the majority of many late medieval and early modern cities due to high urban death rates) and religious minorities. It is unsurprising that those with less power bore a disproportion share of the cost of guild regulations. The dark side of social capital for women’s economic opportunities is a long-running theme in Ogilvie’s work (see Ogilvie 2004), and plenty of literature from both European and non-European economic history suggests that the market can provide a path for women to gain in status and a means of escaping patriarchal control.Footnote 6 In York, bakers were prosecuted for sending their wives to sell wheat (Ogilvie 2019, p.275). In Memmingen, a glazier’s guild fined a member for letting his daughter carry out glazing work outside the household (Ogilvie 2019, p.278). There were always exceptions—-on occasion women took prominent roles in some areas of guild activity and guilds in some parts of Europe allowed Jews—but these were exceptions, and as Ogilvie demonstrates, even then, women’s guild rights tended to be limited and Jewish members had to pay extra fees.",3

Digitization proliferates in the economy beyond the internet and communications technologies sector, and is transforming production and consumption in most sectors of the economy as firms integrate technology tools and systems into their business processes (McKinsey Global Institute 2015). Many firms digitizing their business processes are adopting technology platforms, defined by a digital technology core with standardized interfaces to interconnect heterogeneous devices around the edge of that core. Parker, Van Alstyne, and Choudary define a platform as ... a business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers. The platform provides an open, participative infrastructure for those interactions and sets governance conditions for them. The platform's overarching purpose: to consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or social currency, thereby enabling value creation for all participants. (Parker et al. 2016, p. 5) The fastest growing firms, like Amazon, Netflix, and Uber, employ platform technologies and business models. By 2016, over 170 platform companies globally were valued at $1 billion or more. Why have digital technology platforms become such transformative elements of the economy? Digital technology platforms are scalable and adaptable to a degree that was impossible with preceding ways of structuring economic activity. Digital platforms are scalable to the extent that adding resources increases their capacity and the outcomes they can achieve. For example, if a company spends an additional $5 million to expand its technology platform and increases its sales by at least $5 million, its platform is scalable. Digital platforms are also adaptable to the extent that they are flexible rather than rigid in the face of unknown and changing conditions. Their economic value arises from this scalability and adaptability. Scalability and adaptability in platform systems are a consequence of modularity, or the extent to which a system is composed of smaller, often standardized, parts or modules. In a modular system, these standardized components are connected through specific relationships which are themselves often standardized. Standardization of interfaces and relationships simplifies the process of assembling a system, and can reduce the costs of modifying it as circumstances change. It also simplifies and clarifies the complementarity and substitutability relationships among system components. Consider how the standard HDMI interface allows televisions, laptops, phones, and projectors to work as a system to communicate high-quality video. The HDMI interface standard increases the ability of these components to be complements in a system; it also eases substitution of one component for another with the same capability. The combination of components and relationships forms the architecture, or structure of a system. A computer network comprising computer servers, ethernet cables, routers, and end-use devices (like computers or smartphones) is a modular system – within each category of component and type of function, different individual devices can perform that function to the extent that they are standardized and can substitute for each other. Replacing one device with another that performs the same function does not disrupt the system, as long as the new device abides by the specified interfaces and relationships required for the system to operate. Modularity is a key feature enabling the value of digital technology platforms. In this analysis I use Austrian capital theory synthesized with general systems theory to understand modular digital platforms as capital structures facilitating the recombination of capital as an adaptive feedback effect in a dynamic environment. The analysis relies primarily on seminal works in Austrian capital theory from Lachmann (1956), Lewin (2002), and Harper and Endres (2010). I also use general systems theory to understand digital platforms as hierarchical cyber-physical-social systems, relying on the work of Bertalanffy (1968), Bunge (1979), and Simon (1962, 1969). This analysis synthesizes Austrian capital theory and systems theory into a capital systems theory of digital technology platforms. Building on Irving Fisher, Harper and Endres define capital as “any resource – whether natural, artifactual, or human – that yields a flow of services people desire over time” (2012, p. 353). In this model, capital structure has capital components that are heterogeneous in capabilities and are connected through specific relationships into a system. The components and relationships form the architecture of the system. Modularity increases the degree of both substitutability and complementarity of capital components, amplifying their effects in ways that manifest in more scalable and adaptable systems. In so doing, modularity increases the capacity of a capital system to adapt to unknown and changing conditions and to absorb change in a dynamic environment. Section 2 provides a general definition of digital technology platforms and their modularity, while Section 3 provides the theoretical frameworks from Austrian capital theory and general systems theory. In Section 4 I synthesize the two frameworks into a capital systems theory, and apply it to an illustrative case study of Uber’s ride sharing platform before concluding in Section 5.",4

In turn, it is well-established that entrepreneurship is constrained and enabled by the institutional environment in which it occurs: Rules, norms, and other formal and informal institutions influence the extent and productive character of an economy’s entrepreneurial activity and, consequently, its development (Baumol 1990; North 1990; Mueller and Thomas 2000; Hwang and Powell 2005; Stenholm et al. 2013). Many scholars and policymakers implicitly assume that when entrepreneurship in emerging and transition economies is conducted legally and morally, it will naturally translate into economic growth (Acs 2006; Anderson and Smith 2007). Conversely, researchers frequently point to a weak institutional environment as an explanation when entrepreneurship and economic growth fail to emerge (Khanna and Palepu 1997; Lee and Kim 2009; Sutter et al. 2013). While not challenging the overall importance of institutions as rules of the game that are vital for entrepreneurship and economic development, we follow North (1990, p. 74) in acknowledgeing that “(e)ven with a constant set of rules, the games played will differ if they are played between rank amateurs and professionals or between a team in its first game and the same team in its one hundredth game together” (cf. Choi and Storr 2019). Moreover, the rules are rarely, if ever, constant: Individual entrepreneurs are embedded in an institutional context but their behavior may also change this context (DiMaggio 1988; Seo and Creed 2002). Thus, the view that institutions determine the extent to which entrepreneurship is productive is only part of the story. Causality is bidirectional, in that entrepreneurship is also one of the main drivers of institutional change (Elert and Henrekson 2017a). In the past, this important point has been appreciated by Austrian scholars such as Menger and Hayek (Yu 2001). This article is motivated by the fact that this bidirectionality has been largely overlooked in development contexts, even though the manner in which entrepreneurs respond to institutions is likely to be especially relevant when institutional quality is relatively poor. Economic adaptability may therefore be difficult to achieve if actors invariably operate strictly within the limits of existing institutions (Etzioni 1985). Evidence from economic history shows that entrepreneurial responses to institutions induced many of the institutional developments that made the prosperous world in which we now live possible (Jones 2003; Mokyr 2010; Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; McCloskey 2016). Likewise, when entrepreneurs in today’s developing and transition countries respond to institutional constraints – whether through “regular” business activity, institutional entrepreneurship, or evasive methods (Henrekson and Sanandaji 2011; Elert and Henrekson 2016; Elert et al. 2016) – they simultaneously affect future institutional evolution. This has important ramifications for development; both institutional change and economic development are contingent on the entrepreneurial response to institutions. In advancing this bottom-up argument, we hope to stimulate additional research regarding an aspect we deem central to understanding how institutional change comes about and prosperity evolves. Our view also sheds new light on the enigma of the sharply divergent paths taken by developing countries that started at similar income levels some decades ago. Differences in entrepreneurial responses to institutions help explain why some countries made the transition to growing middle-income countries whereas others stagnated or regressed.",8

Harper,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"We are living in “the Age of Aesthetics” (Postrel 2003), in which innovation introduces new kinds of aesthetic experiences that enrich our daily lives. The ensuing stream of new goods and services reflects the increasing importance of design and aesthetic qualities. As a result, aesthetic forms and activities have become a ubiquitous feature of market economies. Every day we interact first-hand with entrepreneurial offerings designed to deliver us aesthetic experiences—from a Mini Cooper to an Apple Watch, from a pair of Nike running shoes to a Dyson air purifier, from shopping at Whole Foods to drinking nitrogen-infused Cold Brew coffee at Starbucks. Indeed, the aesthetic dimension of entrepreneurship and consumption affects where we shop, what clothes we wear, what we eat and drink, what we drive, how we furnish our homes, what we watch, read and listen to for entertainment, and how we communicate and interact socially. Competitive market processes are generating ever more aesthetic variety and complexity, which encourages people to devote more attention to the aesthetic features of products and to affirm the importance of aesthetics through the choices they make and the actions they take. In short, aesthetic innovation influences and pervades our sensibilities, our thoughts, feelings, actions and lifestyles. The integration of aesthetics into product design and brand capital can also be highly lucrative, as witnessed by the commercial success of such corporations as Apple, Nike, Audi, Ikea, and Philips. In these businesses, aesthetic innovation is a core activity that is deeply integrated into the DNA of the firm itself, affecting how production and organizational processes are structured. Indeed, industrial designs, especially those such as the Apple iPhone and iPad which have attained iconic status, have become extremely valuable intellectual property not only of corporations but also for nations. Entrepreneurial aesthetics is an important source of creativity and innovation, and it provides real fuel for the engine of economic change and development. Defining what is an aesthetic object is likely to be as fraught and vexing as trying to define art. Some philosophers in the analytic tradition reject the possibility of identifying the individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for something to qualify as art or an aesthetic object. Others (Weitz 1956; Gaut 2000) argue that art and other aesthetic objects are indefinable—that they are not amenable to a real definition of their essential nature, and instead they recommend applying Wittgenstein’s notion of family resemblance. Defining the nature of beauty and other aesthetic qualities has had a similar fate. Over the centuries, philosophical thinking on the nature of beauty has yielded widely divergent and even incompatible conceptions of the requirements and sufficient reasons for something to be beautiful. The nature of beauty continues to elude us. Although the history of philosophy gives us enormous pause regarding attempts to define aesthetics and to identify its core features, it may help to give a sense of the sheer breadth of aesthetics by considering some of the definitions given by others. In the embodied mind literature, aesthetic experience is understood to include corporeal, sensory-perceptual, visceral, emotional and cognitive features of our encounters with economic goods and services. Aesthetic experiences are particular states of the mind and body—bodily responses (including gut-reactions), perceptions, feelings, emotions, acts of attention and other cognitions. Aesthetics is inseparable from meaning-making. It encompasses “all the processes by which we enact meaning through perception, bodily movement, feeling, and imagination” (Johnson 2018: 2). It involves “form and structure, qualities that define a situation, our felt sense of the meaning of things, our rhythmic engagement with our surroundings, and our emotional transactions with other people and our world” (Johnson 2018: 225). In addition, marketing research on the experiential and symbolic dimensions of consumer behavior has also led to comparably broad conceptions of aesthetics: “aesthetics deals with the experience of objects which provide the consumer with an element of beauty, or which are emotionally and/or spiritually moving” (Charters 2006: 239). Similarly, the current paper adopts an expansive definition of aesthetics that is not limited to the fine arts, luxury goods, fashion industries, or cultural industries. It rejects a sharp demarcation between the aesthetics of art and that of ordinary objects. It assumes that aesthetics is an integral part of regular economic life: “We constantly take into consideration not only order but symmetry, proportion, contrast, colour, saturation, hue, harmony, texture and balance in all aspects of our daily lives, such as when we choose fruits at the market, a house to live in, clothes to wear, a landscape to enjoy, a dish we cook” (Mandoki 2013: 141). Consequently, drawing insight from the philosophy of the aesthetics of everyday life (e.g. Dewey 1934; Forsey 2013a; Saito 2007), the approach taken here examines a wide domain of aesthetic phenomena beyond just the artworld, including designed objects, brands and routine quotidian practices, such as shopping in a mall. Accordingly, everyday aesthetic phenomena are integrated into higher-level, recurrent, widely shared routines and their aesthetic character permeates everyday economic activities and consumer lifestyles as a whole. “It is the network of choices we make, day after day, that is important, not the individual slices of experience” (Leddy 2014: 29; original emphasis). Consider for a moment the aesthetic character of something as humble as a McDonald’s French fry. It just oozes aesthetics. “Eat me”, it screams, as it lies there on your plate, a crispy golden delight, piping hot, smothered in salt, tantalizing you with its natural savory flavor derived from beef fat. The aesthetic delight intensifies even further when the fries are re-contextualized to become part of a child’s McDonald’s Happy Meal, packaged in a dazzling red and yellow box, shaped like a lunch pail, with the McDonald’s golden arches on top as handles and the image of a golden smiley face on it, replete with tender Chicken McNuggets, a side of juicy apple slices, a sweet apple-juice drink and a “cool” small toy tied to the latest family movie. The McDonald’s brand name itself triggers and expresses associations with all the attributes of Americana. The Happy Meal shows how even a simple meal can be configured aesthetically. The Happy Meal also reflects how homegrown aesthetic innovation can bubble up from below: its original form (the Ronald menu) was created by one of McDonald’s franchisees in Guatemala in the 1970s, and the concept was subsequently developed inhouse by a corporate product development team in the US.Footnote 1 The Happy Meal also shows how everyday aesthetic innovation by ordinary people (aesthetics-in-the-small) is economically more significant in terms of its contribution to our well-being than highbrow artistic creation (aesthetics writ large): “The discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a star” (Brillat-Savarin [1889] 2009: 15). Everyday aesthetic experience is a fundamental part of human flourishing. Admittedly, the aesthetic pleasure from eating a McDonald’s Happy Meal might not reach the heights and intensity of that from confronting a personally meaningful work of art. However, the sheer ubiquity of such everyday aesthetic experiences makes them important for human well-being. “The everyday is the portion of our aesthetic lives which we occupy the most” (Melchionne 2013: 4). Routinized patterns of experiential consumption in markets, however prosaic carrying them out might be, provide much of the aesthetic texture of our modern lives. Although it has been examined by several management and marketing scholars (e.g. Eisenmann 2013; Schmitt and Simonson 1997), aesthetics has been largely ignored by economists. “Deprived of aesthetics, not only the economy but also economics becomes ‘joyless’” (Mossetto 1993: 217). The general belief is that we as economists can ignore aesthetics because aesthetics concerns matters of mere subjective taste, the exogenous unchallengeable axioms of a person’s economic behavior. With its standard assumptions of stable and given preferences over the space of commodities (i.e. the objects of choice), the neoclassical theory of consumer behavior would regard differences between people in their aesthetic judgments of a commodity as no more than differences of personal tastes. It recognizes no difference between aesthetic taste and gustatory taste: aesthetic judgments are seen to be founded on purely subjective feelings of pleasure evoked by a good; they are no more than hedonic ratings. To judge a good as beautiful means no more than that “I like it”. To judge it to be more beautiful than another good means no more than “I prefer it”. Aesthetics offers no hope of illuminating economic behavior; resorting to aesthetics would be considered a futile endeavor and an ad hoc maneuver designed to mask analytical failure and refutation (Stigler and Becker 1977: 89). Austrian scholars (e.g. Kirzner 1973: 135–186) also typically treat aesthetic issues in a very circumscribed way, equating aesthetics with visual design characteristics of products, and limiting their attention to the role of aesthetics in product differentiation, quality competition and advertising strategies. To remedy the neglect of aesthetics in economic scholarship, this paper explores the aesthetic dimension of innovative entrepreneurship and co-creative consumption. The aim is not to present a complete account of entrepreneurial aesthetics but to identify some of the building blocks needed for a more fully developed theory of the aesthetics of entrepreneurship and consumption. In particular, the objective of this paper is to elucidate the nature of “the aesthetic” in the context of innovation. In particular, this requires us to indicate the range of aesthetic phenomena in economic life and to identify paradigm cases which can anchor our understanding of the aesthetic. In order to clarify the nature of aesthetic experience, the paper describes different types of attentional processes that characterize different modes of aesthetic experience. We are particularly interested in the appropriate concept of the aesthetic for considering our experience of “objects of choice” in the marketplace—not just physical goods but also services of all kinds. The next section examines the market as an aesthetic system that generates and appraises aesthetic objects, such as brands. Section 3 provides a case study of Harry Gordon Selfridge in order to illustrate some of the core components of entrepreneurial aesthetics, including aesthetic vision and aesthetic spaces. Section 4 focuses upon the relation of aesthetics to our ways of seeing the world—our modes of attention. It identifies four kinds (or modes) of aesthetic experiences in markets that are characterized by different ways of focusing and distributing attention across objects and their properties. Section 5 concludes the paper.",

For decades, governments have used active industrial policies seeking to steer investments in the economy to specific sectors or firms thought to be ‘leaders of the future’ or ‘future growth sectors’. Later years have seen a renewed call for the active industrial policies of the 1980s throughout developed and developing economies alike. Today’s such policies go under different names. Sometimes they are called innovation policies, sometimes industrial policies. Increasingly, they go under the name of environmental policies. For example, the EU Commission in January 2020 proposed a program called the European Green Deal Investment Plan, also referred to as the ‘Sustainable Europe Investment Plan’. The Plan is supposed to “mobilise” at least €1 trillion in investments over the next decade through the EU budget and associated instruments (Commission 2020). Most developed countries have similar programs and initiatives. All these investments of tax money beg the question to what extent centrally placed public coordinators (bureaucrats) or decentralized and competitive markets should be central to innovation policy? That is the key question in our paper. The paper leans on our recent book with the same title and results from a major interdisciplinary research program (Financing of Innovation) conducted at the Ratio Institute in Sweden between 2013 and 2018. Our paper is structured as follows: we first briefly review competing perspectives on innovation policy in the literature, next we discuss a key assumption for the argument of bureaucrats as central actors in innovation policies – that notion of ‘market failures’. Third, we review stylized empirical evidence on the ineffectiveness of public support schemes for innovation, showing that overall, such support schemes have a poor record in terms of affecting innovation outcomes. We outline empirical evidence and theoretical arguments that such support schemes are based on faulty theoretical premises in that market failures in innovation are not the key impediment for innovations in society. Based on research in innovation economics we argue that research and public policy needs to shift from an exclusive focus on knowledge creation through R&D and different forms of firm subsidies to a focus on knowledge dissemination and creation through commercial exploitation in free and competitive markets.",26

According to the latter, innovation involves the generation and widespread diffusion of knowledge about new products and methods of production. This is said to occur via a complex, non-linear process involving interactions between firms and other organisations (including universities, banks, technical standard institutes, and government). It follows that the performance of an economy in respect of innovation depends critically upon the institutions (rules) governing those interactions (Freeman 1987, Lundvall, [ed.] Lundvall 1992, Dosi et al. [eds.] Dosi et al. 1988, Nelson [ed.] Nelson 1993). Where the rules in question impede rather than facilitate interactions of the relevant kind, ‘system failures’ are said to occur, in the sense that reliance on a different set of rules might make it possible for the economy to perform better when it comes to generating and disseminating knowledge of new goods and technologies. This is said to give rise to a rationale for government policy that is arguably quite distinct from neoclassical accounts for intervention based on the notion of market failure, being based on shaping the institutional environment within which innovation occurs rather than intervening directly in the innovation process (Smith 2000; Metcalfe 2005, 2007: 447; Edler and Fagerberg 2017; Weber and Truffler 2017: 112. In that respect, the system failure approach to policy may share a good deal in common with the views of the Austrian and Bloomington schools, both of which also suggest that government policy ought largely to be confined to establishing the over-arching framework of rules within which economic activity occurs. However, while the IS approach shares a similar view of the economic process to Austrian economics, the work of the Austrian school, and also of Elinor Ostrom, also suggests that the IS approach to policy may nevertheless have under-estimated the informational demands its ‘systems-based’ approach makes upon policy-makers. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the nature of innovation and outlines the IS approach. Section 3 compares the IS and Austrian views of the economics process, while Section 4 uses the work of Hayek and Elinor Ostrom to highlight some potential shortcomings of the IS approach to policy. Section 5 summarises and draws conclusions.",4

The characterising features of innovation and its impacts have long represented an important strand of research across a range of social scientific disciplines but have been primarily associated with economics. Due to its economic significance innovation has not only attracted the attention of scholars but also, for better or worse, policymakers attempting to raise the long-run economic growth rates by encouraging innovative activity. Innovation has typically been defined with respect to economic, or to scientific and technological, change. As described by numerous researchers across social-scientific disciplines, the concept of innovation is readily extensible to non-economic phenomena, insofar as innovation is generically understood as a process underpinning the realisation of novelty. An example of such extension of innovation logics is the concept of “social innovation,” which has received enormous academic and policy attention in recent decades (e.g. Mulgan 2006, 2012a; Goldsmith 2010; Howaldt et al. 2018). Whereas there is some recognition about the applicability for certain Austrian economic themes (e.g. entrepreneurial behaviour and opportunities) for an understanding of social innovation (e.g. Mulgan 2012b), the extent of engagement between Austrian economic and social innovation theories per se has been, somewhat surprisingly, limited. The aim of this paper is, thus, to build upon previous efforts to bridge Austrian economics and social theorising by explicitly considering the notion of social innovation through an Austrian economics lens. In reflection of this observation we question – in a manner not entirely dissimilar to Rosen’s (1997) provocative quest to discern relationships between neoclassical and Austrian economics – is there is any potential for “intellectual gains from trade” between Austrian economics and social innovation? This paper provides a response to the question in the affirmative, identifying potential for intellectual rapprochement between Austrian economics and the ideas of social innovation in respect of topics such as entrepreneurship, societal coordinative processes, and institutional change and development. We do not necessarily suggest a seamless connection, lacking in tension, between the offerings of Austrian economics and social innovation but, rather, contend there are opportunities for intellectual “value-adding” of a manner bringing greater depth to both enterprises. Boiled down to its essentials we think that social innovation ideas could generate more well-rounded Austrian perspectives about multi-faceted dimensions of human action, whereas key tenets of Austrian economics could deliver analytical and methodological clarity to what is a largely normative domain of social innovation studies. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of recent literature on social innovation, familiarising the reader with key principles informing the discussion presented throughout the remainder of this paper. In Section 3 we critically undertake a thematic appraisal of social innovation themes through the lens of chief Austrian economic attributes – namely, spontaneous order, entrepreneurship, feedback mechanisms and institutional environments. This will be followed (Sect. 4) by concluding remarks relating to the scope for better integration of Austrian economics and social innovation, and possibilities for additional research intersecting these fields of inquiry.",4

There is a curious notion in development economics that the field emerged out of nowhere right after World War II. I used to share that view, writing in 2001: “{For decades and centuries} No economists paid much attention to the problems of poor countries…Suddenly after World War II, we policy experts, having ignored poor countries for centuries, now called for attention to their “urgent problems.””Footnote 6 Let us define the field at a minimum as the study of the development differences among nations and peoples. Apparently we believe that economists for decades and centuries had remarkably little curiosity about the dramatic development differences evident around them. It took me embarrassingly long to acknowledge some obvious ancient history of development thinking, and some other development economists are apparently taking even longer. As long ago as 1776, Adam Smith wrote a book called the Wealth of Nations. It turns out, after many hours of careful reading, that the book is indeed about the Wealth of Nations. Far from ignoring the wider world, Smith cited 164 different historical or contemporary place names or names of ethnic groups.

Specific place names in Africa are limited to some places on the coast, but there are very important discussions of the African continent as a whole. The rest of the world is well covered (shown in black), and the top 20 most mentioned places (shown as hatched) are spread around the world. Smith has abundant coverage of future Third World places such as Peru, Mexico, Chile, Egypt, India, Africa, Central Asia, and China. Smith’s First World success stories are England, lowland Scotland, British North America, and Holland. The future Second World is also covered in discussions of Russia and Eastern Europe. Smith’s terminology of course did not include “GDP per capita” or even “development,” yet the words he used express similar concepts. For developed, he used civilized, opulent, modern, prosperous, improved, advanced, or rich. For the least developed, he used savage, barbarous, rude, poor, unimproved, uncivilized, unfortunate, or ignorant. For economic growth or its absence, Smith uses words like progress, advance, stationarity, decline, or decay. Some of these terms are offensive, which make clear Smith shared prejudices of his day. In context of his specific examples, however, Smith is using these words as empirical descriptors for levels or changes of material income, human capital, and technology. As we will see below, Smith used his widespread examples to test his preferred hypothesis to explain development. The hypothesis is not a surprise – development happens based on free trade and free markets, making possible the division of labor and gains from specialization. Many of his examples use natural variation in trade based on access to waterways, or proximity to prosperous towns or rich neighbors. So for example, England, Scotland, and Holland benefit from access to waterways, towns, and rich neighbors. Inland Africa suffers from the lack of all three. The Incas and the Aztecs had not enough trade for a different reason -- they lacked money as a means of exchange. China and India were intermediate development examples because they had large domestic markets and good interior water transport, but had refused to participate in international trade. Free institutions and moral norms that support individual choice and trade also matter, as we will develop more below.",9

Governments across many parts of the world have effectively ‘closed down’ economic systems in response to the health threat posed by the pandemic. In some countries meanwhile governments have also committed themselves to policy measures - such as paying the wages of private sectors employees - that have rarely if ever been seen before. This paper considers the challenge the pandemic presents to policy makers by drawing on F.A. Hayek’s distinction between simple and complex phenomena. It argues that while government action may be warranted, the complexities entailed in addressing the multiple socio-economic dimensions at stake mean that on many of these dimensions it may not be possible to discern the contours of an effective policy response. Or, if such responses can be identified, to secure their implementation in a sufficiently timely manner. The paper then considers the implications of Hayek’s perspective for broader socio-economic challenges that policymakers are increasingly being urged to assume, with a focus on post-pandemic risk planning and arguments for post-pandemic industrial policy. The paper commences in section one by outlining Hayek’s distinction between simple and complex phenomena and how this is reflected in his critique of economic planning. It then proceeds in section two to consider some of the dimensions of complexity that underpin the coronavirus policy challenge. Section three argues that while government action may be a justifiable response to the pandemic, there may be few systemic mechanisms that enable policymakers to avoid large scale errors and to assess the effectiveness of alternative policy measures. Finally, section 4 argues that a continuation of activist government in a post-pandemic political economy may work to perpetuate aspects of the knowledge poor environment that characterises the pandemic itself.",11

Some sectors are dynamic and innovative, and others are characterized by stiff price competition. Oligopoly and monopoly characterize still others. Some industries are known for successfully seeking regulatory rents. This paper addresses the question of why firms in some industries behave competitively in the market but firms in other industries tend toward rent seeking. Although there are many types of economic rents, such as monopoly rents, scarcity rents, or Ricardian rents, for the sake of parsimony, this paper uses the term “rent seeking” to refer to the seeking of regulatory rents and other state favors. Competition to innovate and realize profit from unexploited sources is more important than competition to reduce prices. Profit comes from exploiting opportunities that have not yet been commercialized, which are found through the process of entrepreneurial discovery. This frequently involves producing new, unique advantages that had not been seen before and, as a result, were underpriced by the market. When done successfully, profits are the reward for the entrepreneur, which last until competition erodes them as prices adjust. Without the profits that come from entrepreneurial discovery, the tendency is toward price competition. This can result in consolidation and rent seeking behavior. This paper addresses the question of why some industries are innovatively competitive and others are dominated by rent seeking. In so doing, it develops a new theory based on characteristics of an industry’s productive assets that yield persistent profits over the long term which the market does not compete away, even as entrepreneurial discovery by competitors continues. Absent these characteristics, which this paper describes, incentives for rent seeking are magnified. All firms in a given industry use similar or identical assets for production of similar goods or services. The prospect of increased profits is an incentive for entrepreneurial innovation. Profits can be had if the productive asset, or property that a business exploits, offers a unique advantage that a competitor cannot trivially duplicate or impede. I term these business assets amimetic assets, from the Greek word amimitos (“inimitable”). Without such assets, firms look for other means to protect their profits. Rent seeking becomes attractive in these situations. Section 1 describes existing literature on market structure and innovation and is followed in section 2 by a description of the idea of property as a foundation for innovation and creative destruction. Section 3 details with examples the idea of amimetic assets, complementary to which section 4 overviews the role of amimetic assets in maintaining an innovative, dynamic economy. Section 5 provides empirical support.",1

Perhaps the first one is an obscure and abstract discussion on capital theory. There is also the informal (that is, unclear for a large part of the profession) and fringe theory of business cycles: the Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT). In terms of monetary policy, one finds a preference for a sort of competitive monetary arrangement in the absence of a central bank, such as Hayek’s (1979) currency competition or a free banking regime. This spread of topics gives the impression that Austrian macroeconomics is a collection of unconnected macro-topics. Horwitz’s (2000) main contribution consists in showing that this is not the case. Horwitz shows how to put these topics together consistently. From Horwitz’s book, one gets the message that there is, after all, such a thing as Austrian macroeconomics. This should not be a surprise; major figures in this tradition such as Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, Hayek, and Rothbard have worked in relevant macroeconomic topics. After 20 years of Horwitz’s contribution, it is time to assess its impact and continuing relevance in the Austrian literature. This paper takes the opportunity to revisit how the Austrian-macro pieces fit together, some of the main differences between Austrian and mainstream macroeconomics, some recent contributions since Horwitz’s book publication, and how the future of Austrian macroeconomics may look like. Before proceeding, a clarification is in order. As the subtitle of Horwitz’s book makes it clear, his work has en emphasis on Austrian theory. This paper follows this setting where, at the risk of oversimplifying in some areas and ignoring nuances, I refer to Austrian and mainstream economics as the two perspectives being compared.",1
34.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,01 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-020-00511-y,Two paths forward for Austrian macroeconomics,June 2021,William J. Luther,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At the heart of traditional Austrian macroeconomics is the idea that production takes places over time. Raw inputs are first transformed into intermediate goods and then on to final, consumable output, with more and more refinement taking place at each stage of production. In normal times, producers take the available technologies and prevailing time preferences into account when choosing how roundabout a production process to pursue. In a money using economy, however, unexpected nominal disturbances occasionally throw a wrench into gears, temporarily distorting the structure of production. The result of these nominal disturbances is unavoidable economic downturns, as malinvested resources are reallocated to a more appropriately roundabout structure of production. Since Hayek (1931), the idea of production taking place over time with the potential for miscoordination has often been presented, at least in Austrian circles, with reference to the Hayekian triangle. Indeed, Garrison (2002) has argued that “the triangles still hold the key to understanding Hayekian macroeconomics.” Others take issue with the triangle. Barnett and Block (2006) put forward fourteen “fundamental problems” with the Hayekian triangle. When presented with these problems, however, Garrison is purported to have replied succinctly: “Triangles yesterday, triangles today, triangles tomorrow, triangles forever” (Block 2018). Most working to advance a modern Austrian macroeconomics today view the Hayekian triangle as little more than a useful pedagogical device.Footnote 1 They accept that there are conceptual and empirical problems with the triangle. They understand that output does not always flow from one stage to another, more temporally proximate stage.Footnote 2 They realize that, for a given interest rate, the value of output will tend to grow exponentially over time, not linearly as it does along the hypotenuse of a Hayekian triangle. But some nonetheless maintain that the temporal structure of production—and the corresponding potential for distoritions—is a necessary feature of Austrian macroeconomics. In that sense, they can be said to hold the triangles forever view. No one has done more to improve and advance the triangles forever view in the last decade than Nicolas Cachanosky and Peter Lewin. In a series of papers (Cachanosky and Lewin 2014, 2016b, 2017b, 2018, 2020; Cachanosky and Lewin 2016, 2018b, 2018c, 2020), they explain how the financial concept known as Macaulay duration (D) can be used to measure the degree of roundaboutness. Macaulay duration refers to the expected average amount of time one must wait to earn a dollar from a given project. Cachanosky and Lewin (2014) argue that Macaulay duration “keeps the spirit of the concept but does away with the problems that arise in the traditional Hayek-Böhm-Bawerk approach.” They also explain how modified duration, − D/(1 + ι), where ι is the internal rate of return paid (or, compounded) each period, “captures Böhm-Bawerk’s argument that more roundabout projects are more sensitive to changes in interest rates.” Financializing the Austrian view of roundaboutness, or average periods of production, by making use of Macaulay duration comes with many advantages. It solidifies the forward-looking nature of the Austrian view, which some have called into question (Cachanosky 2015). It circumvents problems of reducing value to real quantities like units of physical capital or labor time (Cachanosky and Lewin 2014). It provides a clear path for pursuing distinctly Austrian questions empirically (Cachanosky and Lewin 2016a). But it also builds on a rich set of ideas in the Austrian tradition, some of which are not widely-known. In a work reminiscent of Horwitz (2000), Lewin and Cachanosky (2018a) trace the intellectual history of the average period of production, or roundaboutness of production processes. They begin, as is common, with Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, and Hayek.Footnote 3 But they also show that John Hicks, who had overlapped with Hayek at the London School of Economics from 1931 to 1935, had independently discovered Macaulay duration by 1939 in a conscious effort to improve Böhm-Bawerk’s capital theory. “Hicks’s formulation not only solves Böhm-Bawerk’s problems,” they write; “it is also a richer concept in that it provides a measure not only of the average amount of time contained in any investment, but also a measure of the elasticity of the estimated present value of the investment to a change in the rate of discount.” Hicks’s extension initially gained no traction among economists in general nor Austrian economists in particular, but it took hold in finance as Macaulay duration. Today, Cachanosky and Lewin argue, those working in the Austrian tradition would be well-served by building on Hicks’s often overlooked contribution to Austrian macroeconomics. The triangles forever view has its critics, though. The chief complaint so far concerns the issue of reswitching. As Fratini (2019a) points out, the non-linearity of unit cost functions with respect to the interest rate “has major implications for the choice of the method of production.” He shows that, for two projects A and B, where A is preferable to B at an interest rate of 0, there is an interest rate r1 > 0 where B is preferable to A and an interest rate r2 > r1 where A is preferable to B. The switching to B and then subsequent reswitching back to A as the interest rate rises is a major problem for the Hicksian measure of roundaboutness advanced by Cachanosky and Lewin. “According to the traditional Austrian conception of capital, more roundabout methods of production are also more productive, in the sense that they give a higher amount of final output per worker,” Fratini writes. “With the new concept, methods with longer average periods can instead, paradoxically, give a smaller final output per worker.” In response, Lewin and Cachanosky (2019) maintain that the measure of roundaboutness Fratini critiques is not their duration; and that the former is only equivalent to the latter “in a world in which the cost of production approach to the determination of value gives the same results as the subjective marginal productivity approach, namely in a world of static equilibrium without uncertainty.” An increase in duration, as they have defined it, does not imply an increase in physical capital per worker. Indeed, they claim that such erroneous implications, which follow from Böhm-Bawer’s physical conception of capital, are one reason why they favor Hicks’s financial conception of capital. “An increase in the capital value of a venture is consistent with all kinds of changes in the earnings patterns of the different resource owners,” they write. “Clearly, profits go up and that is what constitutes the essence of the boom phase of the cycle.”Footnote 4",1

Cutsinger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the years since the global financial crisis, there has been a resurgence of interest in Austrian business cycle theory.Footnote 1 Much of this recent work - at least that being done by Austrian economists - is built on Steven Horwitz’s book, Microfoundations and Macroeconomics (Horwitz 2000). In it, Horwitz integrates the Mises-Hayek theory of the business cycle with monetary equilibrium theory - an analytical approach that stresses the importance of money’s role as a medium of exchange in macroeconomic analysis (Hendrickson 2015). Monetary equilibrium is not unique to the Austrian school, however. Its origins go back to Hume (1777), and its “rediscovery” was a critical part of the monetarist counter-revolution.Footnote 2 What distinguishes Horwitz’s Austrian variant from others is his emphasis on the relationship between monetary equilibrium and the capital structure. Horwitz’s book has produced an extensive literature, particularly in the last decade. Hendrickson (2017) and Hendrickson and Salter (2016) have refined the link between money, interest rates, and investment, which is the core theoretical contribution of Horwitz’s book. Holcombe (2017) has clarified concepts unique to the Austrian theory like malinvestment, and others have integrated Horwitz’s framework with topics in open-economy macroeconomics (Cachanosky 2014). Echoing Horwitz, Wagner (2012) has argued for a market-process approach to the “microfoundations” debate in macroeconomics. Horwitz’s work has also been part of the renewed discussion about rules versus discretion in monetary policy (Horwitz 2011; Salter 2014, 2016). Surprisingly, however, there has been little applied work using Horwitz framework.Footnote 3 Horwitz’s variant of Austrian business cycle theory, which I review in more detail in the following section, predicts that excessive high-powered money growth will kick off a process of deposit expansion via the loanable funds market that temporarily lowers the market rate of interest below the natural rate, thereby misleading entrepreneurs into undertaking longer-term investment projects that are inconsistent with savers’ time preferences (Horwitz 2000, pp. 104–140). His framework implies that periods of severe inflation should be accompanied by both overinvestment and malinvestment, which suggests that such cases could potentially be used to illustrate the framework’s explanatory power. The challenge is finding an example where the monetary authorities did not bypass the banking system, which plays a critical role in Horwitz’s framework. There are, however, a few examples of severe inflation where the banking system played a key role in the monetary expansion. One such case is the inflation that occurred in the South during the U.S. Civil War. As I discuss in Section 3, the Southern banking system was an integral part of the rebel government’s monetary strategy, making it a useful case study to which Horwitz’s framework can be applied. In this paper, I use money, price, and banking data from the Confederacy to evaluate whether the South’s reliance on the printing press to fund the war distorted the Southern capital structure. While the data indicates that the rate of money growth was excessive, there does not seem to be any evidence of the sort of malinvestment predicted by the Austrian theory, which I argue is likely due to the sharp contraction in private loan demand brought on by the uncertainty surrounding the war and crowding-out by the state and Confederate governments. On the other hand, the evidence is consistent with other parts of Horwitz’s framework, such as forced savings, which the banking system channeled back to the state and rebel governments who used the resources so acquired to finance the war. While not malinvestment in the traditional sense, the political allocation of credit in the South was likely not consistent with a sustainable capital structure, especially in light of the knowledge and incentive problems that plague such allocation. In the final section of this paper, I briefly discuss the inferences that can be drawn from my analysis, and how they can be applied to other episodes of “money mischief.”",

The establishment of the rule of law, private property rights, and contracts provide the necessary foundation for social and market interactions based on mutual benefit rather than predation, and particular programs, like national defense and social safety nets, provide support and protection for citizens. Examining how these institutions are designed, who has power within them, and how effective they are at advancing human flourishing is crucial for understanding governance systems and reforming or improving inadequate institutional arrangements. The modern notions of public governance and public administration are inextricably linked to government and an expanding scope and scale of government programs and regulations. Such government activity is largely implemented and enforced by bureaucracies filled with civil servants and technocrats. While laws and executive orders give directives to and the budget process constrains bureaucracies, the daily operations of public administration are, for the most part, independent of the checks and balances of government. For the proponents of modern public administration, this independence ensures that government initiatives continue despite political changes and provides space for experts to design and enforce policy. Furthermore, proponents see bureaucratic public administration as the providers of technical solutions to pressing economic and social problems, including national security and defense, worker safety, health care, education, financial markets, trade, and welfare. While this approach has led to a more expansive government with programs for addressing many issues, bureaucratic management is not a panacea for collective action. As Vincent Ostrom argues in The Intellectual Crisis in Public Administration ([1973] 2008: 16–17), “Bureaucratic structures are necessary but not sufficient for a productive and responsive public service economy. Particular public goods and services may be jointly provided by the coordinated actions of a multiplicity of enterprises transcending the limits of particular governmental jurisdictions.” Similarly, Peter J. Boettke (2018) reflects on the increasing reliance on public administration and advances the notion of self-governance and polycentricity along with a humbler role for scholars and experts. From this view, an approach to governance must recognize the constraints of centralized government and the often-overlooked potential of democratic collective action. As Boettke (ibid.: 956) states, “This polycentric vision of governance stands in stark contrast with one that sees the necessity of a single hierarchical government that must induce compliance from its citizens.” Two recent books further develop this approach to governance: Public Governance and the Classical Liberal Perspective, by Paul Dragos Aligica, Peter J. Boettke, and Vlad Tarko (2019), sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of public administration and provides a framework for thinking about the proper scale and scope of government; and Public Entrepreneurship, Citizenship, and Self-Governance by Paul Dragos Aligica (2018), advances the theory of decentralized self-governance by citizens and non-elites. In Public Governance and the Classical Liberal Perspective, Aligica et al. (2019) articulate a classical-liberal perspective on public governance, grounded in the Austrian, Virginia, and Bloomington schools of political economy, that can enrich our understanding of when and how public governance can be employed for the common good, and when it cannot. Aligica et al. (ibid.) assert that classical liberal governance is more robust to the knowledge and incentive problems that plague collective action than modern administrative governance and suggest that our modern time presents an opportunity for a greater shift away from the administrative and welfare state, and toward polycentric governance. This approach embraces a “seeing-like-a-citizen” perspective which emphasizes normative individualism, limited and dispersed knowledge, and a realistic appraisal of human motives and potential rather than the “seeing-like-a-state” perspective of modern public administration, which emphasizes preference aggregation for control by a governance expert. A key contribution of the book lies in polycentric governance – a system in which many competing decision authorities exist throughout the system and at different levels, allowing for contestation and experimentation to find and implement the best solutions for addressing public issues. In this system, there is no single expert who can devise an efficient plan. Instead, there are many experts who all maintain checks on each other. In the authors’ vision, governing happens with one another to create and co-design methods of addressing the pressing issues of living in a diverse society. This approach allows for reform within the current system and a vision for an alternative governance structure. Aligica et al. (2019) then go on to discuss modern challenges and examples of a more polycentric approach including independent regulatory agencies, corporate responsibility, and metropolitan governance. In Public Entrepreneurship, Citizenship, and Self-Governance, Aligica et al. (2019) expands on this theory of polycentric governance by further developing the concepts of public entrepreneurship and citizenship. For Aligica, who is building off the contributions of public choice and the work of the Ostroms, public entrepreneurship and citizenship are the prerequisites for self-governance, consisting of an array of institutional arrangements that can tackle pressing problems and enable collective action. Aligica explains how these elements and ideas relate to one another in the creation of effective governance that is based on liberal democracy within a society that has an inescapable diversity of preferences, constraints, and morality. Further advancing the Ostromian concepts of coproduction and association, this approach to governance is dynamic and flexible yet also requires commitment and participation from citizens. Together, these two books advance a framework for understanding, studying, and reforming current governance structures in ways that advance liberty, accountability, and human dignity. In this special issue, scholars react to these books and discuss the implications for academic and policy research.",

We need to ask how diverse polycentric institutions help or hinder the innovativeness, learning, adapting, trustworthiness, levels of cooperation of participants, and the achievement of more effective, equitable, and sustainable outcomes at multiple scales. – E. Ostrom (2009: 435–6) Elinor Ostrom’s statement, quoted above, illuminates a specific path for policy research—one that involves institutional analysis within a system of polycentric governance. Conducting institutional analysis involves understanding and engaging in institutional design, the process by which the rules of the game are imagined and implemented. Researchers, following this tradition, study how rules constrain choice and affect behavior (North 1990). Governance, in this approach, refers to the process of interaction among decision-makers that lead to informal or formal rules and the action that takes place within those rules. In their 2019 book, Public Governance and the Classical Liberal Perspective, Paul Dragos Aligica, Peter J. Boettke, and Vlad Tarko highlight and articulate a framework for attempting to reconcile a tension between the pursuit of a new governance framework and the pursuit of marginal changes within an existing governance framework: There are many situations in which implementation of a public policy requires a change in rules, incentives, and processes – something that goes beyond the simple, basic operational-level implementation of a policy decision in a given setting. In fact, large parts of the reforms and policy implications from the insights of the public choice research program are precisely about the institutional structure of the administrative state and its functioning at all levels, from the lowest, the operational one, to the highest, that of constitutional choice. (Aligica et al. 2019: 214). Engaging in the study of polycentric political economy, as Aligica et al. (2019) emphasize, requires researchers to consider the entire ecosystem of governance and the consequences of the emergence or imposition of different rules at various levels. It is critical for researchers to actively question and challenge the regulatory framework, institutions, and policies that govern economic and social exchange, while still recognizing that we have existing institutions that may only feasibly be reformed rather than completely reimagined. This paper, inspired by and building upon the work of Aligica et al. (2019), seeks to reconcile the tension between an operational- or policy-level focus and the pursuit of higher-level institutional change within policy research. We argue that while research aimed at marginal changes within an existing governance structure can aid in the imagination of changes at the policy or constitutional levels, the invention of governance frameworks needs to be an end goal for policy researchers. This paper is structured as follows. Section two draws on the insights of academics in the classical liberal tradition to illuminate the role of policy researchers in conducting comparative institutional analysis in accordance with Aligica et al. (2019). Section three dives into what it means to apply polycentrism in ongoing research in the field of political economy. In section four, we examine the contributions of policy researchers to both operational-level and higher-level institutional analysis in a case study of state regulatory reform. We conclude, in section five, by advancing the vision for continued institutional analysis in policy research.",

(2019) theorize what public administration would like in as an ideal, classical liberal system. In their examination, they propose a system that builds largely on the work of Elinor and Vincent Ostrom to suggest a polycentric approach to the administrative state that encourages administrative action on the lowest possible level. Further applying work of other thinkers such as James M. Buchanan and Friedrich Hayek, they argue that such a system will be more constrained to intervening when it is truly needed and more incentivized to preserve individual liberty. While the authors establish the role and requirements of the institutions directly involved in such a system, they only briefly mention the role of the courts as a potential constraint on the administrative.Footnote 1 (Aligica et al. 2019, chapter 8). They do not conduct a deep dive into what this constraint would look like and how it might differ from the current role of courts in restraining the administrative state. In fact, the authors appear to suggest that Independent Regulatory Agencies (IRAs) and other internal adjudication may even be preferable to or more capable than courts at developing expertise and preventing regulatory excesses.Footnote 2 The authors make clear that their goal is not to imagine the “ideal end state of affairs” but rather to focus “on conceptualizing the institutional arrangements and the mechanisms and processes of institutional change that tend to move society” in a more classical liberal direction.Footnote 3 However, the courts and administrative law more generally would surely need to play a role both in ensuring those arrangements and mechanisms are properly maintained and that the mechanisms used to promote institutional change are not abused. The administrative state does not exist in a vacuum and the judiciary and legislature would play a role in any sizeable institutional change. This paper will consider what role the judiciary and various elements of administrative law, such as judicial deference, would play in the ideal classical liberal administrative state Aligica et al. (2019) have laid out. This response paper examines the potential modification to existing judicial deference models that might occur to be more aligned with classical liberal principles and the ideal role of deference more generally in a classical liberal governance system. While a greater level of deference to administrative agencies interpretations may be justified in the classical liberal administrative state where regulators have been appropriately constrained by aligned incentives and market preserving federalism, there is a risk such actions, even in this ideal administrative, would undermine the proper benefits of separation of powers and checks and balances to allow the administrative state to devolve into unchecked despotism. Institutional constraints only serve as a check on governmental power if they are enforced. As a result, an engaged judiciary would still be desirable and necessary to maintain a classical liberal governance system. The paper proceeds as follows: section two begins with a description of the Aligica, Boettke, and Tarko’s approach to the ideal system of public administration and a proposal for the role that courts might serve in such a system. Section three will explain current judicial deference to the administrative state and how such doctrines might play out in the ideal system of classical liberal public administration. Section four discusses why a restrained approach to deference and appropriate separation of powers remains important even in the ideal classical liberal administrative state. This paper concludes (section five) that the role of the courts remains important both as a check on the administrative state itself as well as legislative delegation to an administrative state, and that there remains a strong case for reforming certain aspects of administrative law even within ideal administrative institutions.",

(2019) take on the monumental challenge of constructing a distinctly classical liberal approach to public administration and governance. Key foundational insights are found in chapter 6, where they draw heavily on the work of Elinor and Vincent Ostrom to explicate the relationship between value heterogeneity, coproduction of public services and rules, and polycentric governance. They reject the widely-employed approach (both in economics and public administration) of attempting to aggregate heterogeneous values into some overall measure of social welfare or the public good to guide centralized decision-making. Instead, they seek to ascertain what types of governance structures are necessary to accommodate rather than aggregate heterogeneous values (Aligica et al. 2019). A system more likely to be satisfactory to a greater number of people is one that facilitates “a peaceful and inclusive negotiation process between parties with different values and visions” (Aligica et al. 2019: 128). This “peaceful and inclusive negotiation process” necessarily implies coproduction – “a situation in which the consumer’s input is an essential part of the production process” (Aligica et al. 2019: 128). Coproduction requires polycentricity, defined by Ostrom (2005: 283) as “not just one but multiple governing authorities at different scales.” Polycentricity is necessary because “different public goods, social dilemmas, and collective action situations are best managed at different scales,” and “private-public coproduction is necessary for their effective management” (Aligica et al. 2019: 145). Aligica, Boettke, and Tarko also suggest that value heterogeneity itself creates a need for polycentricity. Instead of aggregating values and preferences to arrive at the “one best solution,” polycentricity allows numerous possible solutions that reflect the values and preferences of different communities of interest (Aligica et al. 2019: 149). In short, value heterogeneity, coproduction, and polycentricity go together. The US federal regulatory system presents examples both of coproduction and of polycentric solutions. Federal regulatory agencies often employ strategies that enhance stakeholder participation in the production of rules. In some cases, the federal government also allows somewhat polycentric approaches to solving regulatory problems, such as in certain financial regulatory settings, where state regulators or overseas regulators can serve as substitutes for US federal regulation. It is not clear, however, whether observed instances of stakeholder participation and polycentric approaches are evidence that the US regulatory system behaves systematically in accordance with Ostromian theories of value heterogeneity, coproduction, and polycentrism. Borrowing James Whitcomb Riley’s formulation, the US regulatory system may walk like a duck, but does it also quack and swim like a duck? This paper assesses whether the US federal regulatory system acts in accordance with the system outlined by Aligica et al. (2019) by examining stakeholder participation strategies and the breadth of alternative solutions that agencies considered for a sample of 130 economically significant, prescriptive regulations proposed between 2008 and 2013.Footnote 1 Federal regulatory agencies frequently employ participation strategies that could facilitate coproduction of rules by stakeholders. In many cases, stakeholder participation strategies are more common for social regulations than for economic regulations, where value heterogeneity is likely to be less of a problem. But the types of stakeholder participation strategies that are more frequently used for social regulations do not seem to lead agencies to consider a broader scope of regulatory solutions, which could potentially include polycentric solutions. In addition, the scope of alternatives agencies consider for social regulations is either similar to or narrower than the scope of alternatives considered for economic regulations. In other words, value heterogeneity is associated with some types of coproduction, but neither coproduction nor value heterogeneity have led to polycentrism. For these reasons, the current US regulatory system appears to be far from the polycentric ideal articulated by Aligica et al. (2019).",

Political philosophy from the 1970s to the 2000s was an overwhelmingly left-of center project: most political philosophers understood it to be their task to construct ideals of redistributive, egalitarian liberalism, to guide an enlightened democratic state towards the promise-land of a fully just egalitarian society — indeed a world order — where basic moral disputes have been overcome. This would be a homogeneous “well-ordered society,” (Rawls 1999: §69) where all agree on egalitarian justice and all know they all agree on it. But in the last decade the intelligentsia’s conviction that their constructions express the vox populi has been pretty well shattered: recent voting trends suggest that something between a third and a half of the citizens of western democracies reject the democratic egalitarian project — and indeed, may reject the entire liberal project. Shocked by the populous not following their philosophical discoveries, within the academy some have gained notoriety in loudly rejecting democracy itself. We now confront a dizzying array of non-democratic and anti-democratic proposals: revived arguments for elitism, nationalism, and socialism, Marxism — and even Maoism. In response to all of this the liberal egalitarian repeats her mantra, radicalizing it in the process, seeking to make peace with Marx, becoming ever-more skeptical of capitalism.Footnote 1 The one constant seems to be the supposition that those who think differently from me must be wrong and are my ideological enemies.",

Ebeling,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For three days in that August, from the 19th to the 21st, the fate of a country and an idea were hanging in the balance. Gorbachev had been captured by the hardliners while on vacation in the Crimea. The Soviet military and the KGB were called into service to assure success to the coup-makers in Moscow. Every bridge over the Moscow River was cordoned off by tank units, with Soviet soldiers clustered at major intersections. The plan to kidnap and possibly kill Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the Russian Federation Republic of the U.S.S.R., had failed. He was able to make it to the Russian Federation parliament building near the center of Moscow, and from on top of a tank that was part of a military unit that had refused to obey the coup leaders, Yeltsin appealed to the people of the city to come and defend a hope for and the promise of “democracy” for a new Russia. In fact, most of the nine million of the city’s residents did not respond to Yeltsin’s appeal. It was not that the vast majority wanted a success of the hardliners, but after nearly 75 years of Soviet rule and earlier centuries of absolutist monarchy there had been bred into most people, it seemed, a passive fatalism of simply waiting to see what happened, and hope that the next leader would be a “good czar.” I walked through the city and saw the usual throngs of people with bent shoulders, carrying their mesh shopping bags from one government retail store to another, with downcast expressions on most of their faces. I watched people waiting on long lines in a “people’s” bread store, listening glumly or even indifferently to the store radio to find out who might be next in power to decide and dictate the course of their lives (Ebeling, 2020a). But... there were thousands out of those millions who did respond to Yeltsin’s call to come to the parliament building to prevent its takeover by the army and KGB units that had surrounded the structure waiting for their orders to attack. Many of them were young people, in their teens and twenties, who had experienced a burst of political fresh air and limited market opportunities during the six years of Gorbachev’s reign as Communist Party leader. They did not to want to go back to the social and economic darkness of total dictatorship under which their parents and grandparents had lived and died. The “fake news” of the beautiful socialist paradise had been publicly shattered and much of the detailed truth had started to be revealed about the tens of millions who had been murdered or worked to death in the slave labor camps that stretched from one end of the country to the other. And all in the name of building socialism and the communist utopia to follow (Applebaum, 2003). I listened as little old ladies – babushkas – spoke to the army tank crews threatening to move forward and attack the Russian parliament building, as they asked them whether they were really going to open fire on their own grandmothers, their own people? Medical units from neighborhood clinics and hospitals had come and set up makeshift treatment centers in case the worst were to happen. A small handful did die, when one evening an altercation occurred between some young demonstrators and a group of tanks at one of the underground pedestrian walkway entrances below the main street. Three of them were killed by the tanks. Fortunately, due to the incompetence and disorganization of the coup leaders, the hardline takeover failed. I say fortunately because after the coup it was found out that 500,000 pairs of handcuffs had been issued to the KGB for mass arrests, that orders had been given to reopen some of the Gulag camps for the expected influx of many new inmates, and long lists of names of people from all around the country had been compiled, specifying those who were to be taken into custody and sent back to the past of slave labor camps.",1
34.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,05 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00487-4,Hayek on the essential dispersion of market knowledge,December 2021,Samuel B. Condic,Roger Morefield,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In The Fatal Conceit, Hayek makes the following startling claim: The market is the only known method of providing information enabling individuals to judge comparative advantages of different uses of resources of which they have immediate knowledge and through whose use, whether they so intend or not, they serve the needs of distant unknown individuals. This dispersed knowledge is essentially dispersed, and cannot possibly be gathered together and conveyed to an authority charged with the task of deliberately creating order. (Hayek 1989, 77) The remark occurs in the context of chapter five, in the midst of an extended argument against centrally-managed economic models. His reasoning proceeds in two stages. First, while acknowledging earlier in the chapter that “most tenets, institutions, and practices of traditional morality and of capitalism” fail to meet the “rational requirements”Footnote 1 presumed by socialist thinkers (Hayek 1989, 66), Hayek defends them on the basis that no “moral code” meets the rational requirements embraced by the socialist, including the moral code or codes developed by the socialists themselves: … while it is true that traditional morals, etc., are not rationally justifiable, this is also true of any possible moral code, including any that socialists might ever be able to come up with. Hence no matter what rules we follow, we will not be able to justify them as demanded; so no argument about morals – or science, or law, or language – can legitimately turn on the issue of justification”. (Hayek 1989, 68) Hayek concludes this line of thought by observing that despite its lack of rational justification, the traditional moral code has legitimacy based on its use and efficacy; the code is both routinely employed by economic actors and assists them in their “proliferation” or flourishing (Hayek 1989, 75).Footnote 2 The second stage of the argument is to observe that economic actors in market (viz., non-centrally managed) economies make their decisions not only by means of the traditional moral framework discussed above but also while possessing only partial and fragmentary knowledge of the present economic conditions and the future outcomes of their choices. That is, not only is the framework they use lacking in “scientific” justification, the dataset it analyzes is incomplete. Putting these two (i.e., the “unreasonable” framework and partial knowledge) together, Hayek describes the decision-making process of individual economic actors as a series of “adaptations to the unknown:” “The information that individuals or organisations can use to adapt to the unknown is necessarily partial, and is conveyed by signals (e.g., prices) through long chains of individuals, each person passing on in modified form a combination of streams of abstract market signals”(Hayek 1989, 76).Footnote 3 The net effect of this arrangement, Hayek claims, is an economic order more efficiently organized than any that could be produced through central planning; viz., socialism: To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate [human] arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralising decisions, and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralisation actually leads to more information being taken into account. (Hayek 1989, 76–77) At the very least then, Hayek is making the factual claim that “unscientific” market economies produce more beneficial outcomes than those produced through centralized control. The key question is whether Hayek is doing more than making a simple factual claim. The language in the quote that began this paper is startling because the term “essential” carries significant philosophical importance, and its use suggests Hayek means more than that, as a matter of fact, market economies are more efficient than centrally managed ones. When combined with his comments regarding the partiality of knowledge and the unscientific nature of the moral code, it opens the possibility that Hayek is making the far stronger claim that no other functioning economic arrangement is possible; i.e., that at least some of the knowledge required for economic activity cannot be centrally produced or managed. Hayek’s understanding of the moral code and its lack of scientific character is highly intriguing but beyond our scope. A proper treatment of that question would require an in-depth analysis of the four criteria Hayek lays out for so-called scientific knowledge, an examination of the foundation of these criteria in the philosophical theory known as positivism (including that theory’s shortcomings), and a detailed presentation of an alternative approach, e.g., one based on a philosophy of existential realism and natural law. Instead, we will focus on his claim regarding the essential dispersion of economic knowledge and in what sense may we take the term “essential.” In colloquial speech, “essential” is often a synonym for “very important” or for “for all intents and purposes.” Used in this way “essential” does not denote or connote any sense of necessity. We might say for instance that it is “essential” to stir the gravy constantly in order to ensure its smoothness, thereby meaning that frequent or regular –but not necessarily uninterrupted—stirring is very important. Or we might say that the number of people in Tribeca who voted for Donald Trump in the last election is “essentially” zero, thereby meaning that very few—but not necessarily zero—voters in Tribeca voted thus, nor does it imply that there was something about living in Tribeca that necessarily restricted the choice of candidates. As a last example, we might say that the chances of a hurricane striking Houston, Texas in October are “essentially” zero, thereby meaning that the weather conditions in October are not conducive to such a scenario –which is not the same as saying the possibility is categorically excluded. Accordingly, if we were to take “essentially dispersed” in its colloquial sense, then Hayek’s claim nets out to saying that it would very difficult to implement a socialist system because it would entail the very difficult –but not impossible—task of aggregating the needed data. Understood in this way the problem of dispersion is a practical one that is nevertheless solvable in theory, if not in practice, and socialism remains a possibility as a viable economic system. Prima facie, it is plausible that the colloquial meaning is what Hayek himself has in mind. In his 1945 article The Use of Knowledge in Society, Hayek critiques the view of Joseph Schumpeter, who held that a rational calculation regarding factors of production may be gleaned solely from an observation of consumer demand. Among his reasons for rejecting this thesis, Hayek offers the following: It is evident … that the values of the factors of production do not depend solely on the valuation of the consumers’ goods but also on the conditions of supply of the various factors of production. Only to a mind to which all these facts were simultaneously known would the answer necessarily follow from the facts given to it. The practical problem, however, arises precisely because these facts are never so given to a single mind”. (Hayek 1945, 530, emphasis added) Here at least Hayek’s reasoning is of a purely practical nature, rather than theoretical or “speculative.” As found in this passage, the problem is that the facts are not aggregated into a single mind but not that they couldn’t be. The colloquial usage also appears to be at work in other passages in the same article. Earlier, Hayek remarks that “today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge” and cites knowledge of “the particular circumstances of time and place” as a type of non-scientific knowledge that plays an important role in economic activity (Hayek 1945, 521). As examples of such knowledge, he offers the following: To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or somebody’s skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of surplus stock which can be drawn upon … [or] the shipper who earns his living from using otherwise empty or half-filled journeys of tramp-steamers, or the estate agent whose whole knowledge is almost exclusively one of temporary opportunities, or the arbitrageur who gains from local differences of commodity prices … (Hayek 1945, 522) While in each of the above cases it might be difficult to aggregate and analyze the needed data, there is nothing that necessarily excludes doing so. Hence building a system that centrally manages such factors remains a theoretical possibility and, given certain technological changes, seems less remote than perhaps it did in 1945. Advances in computer technology are driving a revolution in the collection, aggregation, and processing of information, commonly called the “big data” or “analytics” revolution. Tabesh et al. compare big data and analytics to the American gold rush of 1848, noting that: “Today the ability to collect and process massive amounts of data rapidly has created a new gold rush, and many organizations and their analysts have devoted considerable time, money, and effort to obtain profitable insights into the behavioral and structural characteristics of their environments” (Tabesh et al. 2019, 2).Footnote 4 The examples Hayek gives all fit nicely within the scope of big data. Arbitrage is now something managed at the global level, where local knowledge is aggregated into the hands of individuals far removed from the local environment. Machine and other resource utilization data can be readily tracked electronically, quantified, and analyzed centrally. Excess shipping capacity is already carefully monitored and utilized, and it is not difficult to imagine further advances in this area, e.g., a Web-based camera system that visually monitors the amount of space available in a shipping container and transmits the data to a central location where an algorithm processes the data to optimize the utilization. Overall, the ability to gather, transmit, and analyze data is rapidly expanding, and such technology suggests that the problem of local knowledge might be resolvable, if the only barrier is a practical one. Thinking is already moving in this direction. Baban Hasnat for example offers two case studies where data available through Google and SpaceKnow accurately mirror data available from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics regarding unemployment and the PMI index on Chinese manufacturing activity, respectively (Hasnat 2018, 584). While such analyses are not yet at the granular level necessary to resolve Hayek’s local knowledge problem, the ability of independently gathered data to closely mirror official sources suggests that the practical barriers might be overcome in the near term. As Hasnat notes: “Big data increasingly concerns people’s real behavior” and while “posts on social media may or may not represent a person … [they] can reveal an enormous amount about that person” (Hasnat 2018, 582). Others, such as Chinese economists Binbin Wang and Xiaoyan Li make the case more directly, arguing for a “plan-oriented market economy … based on big data and dominated by state-owned enterprises” (Wang and Li 2017, 151). The connection between big data and socialism is also found in the popular press. John Thornhill of the Financial Times quotes Alibaba founder Jack Ma waxing eloquent regarding big data and planned economies: “‘As such, Big Data will make the market smarter and make it possible to plan and predict market forces so as to allow us to finally achieve a planned economy’” (Thornhill 2017).Footnote 5 To some then, big data is making the centralized management of local knowledge highly likely or perhaps even inevitable, though this claim is still debatable at a practical level. Engelhardt, for example, estimates that “even under severe simplifying assumptions, distributing 80,000 heterogeneous consumer goods among six billion heterogeneous consumers requires a calculation that would take at least 10.5 quintillion years—when the Big Bang happened just 14 billion years ago” (Englhardt 2013, 227). The point of the above analysis is not to imply that the centralized management of local knowledge will be possible but only that it might seem plausible.Footnote 6 It then becomes equally plausible to think that the Hayekian objection to socialism can be resolved, since according to this line of thinking Hayek has erected only a practical barrier, one that technology is rapidly removing. Hence how to understand “essential” in “essentially dispersed” is of more than mere academic interest, given that some stand ready to convert “possible” into “plausible,” and “plausible” into “inevitable.”",

Winch 2011, 122).Footnote 3 The biased or reductionist use of the ideas of famous historical figures to support political theories or endeavours is not unusual. But in the case at hand it was also pointed out by writers close to our protagonist, such as Dugald Stewart, who noted that the liberal thought of François Quesnay and Smith, “as commonly happens to prevailing creeds, has been pushed by many of its partisans far beyond the views and intentions of its original authors” (Schneider 1967, 157). But one thing is to stand aside from extreme viewpoints, and another not to have a clear orientation: the thesis of this article is that Adam Smith was in balance a liberal. Section 2 describes his interventionist aspects, and Section 3 contrasts them with the unquestionably liberal Adam Smith. Section 4 places the Scottish thinker and his writings in context to solve the contradictions, and Section 5 sketches a portrait of a moderate liberal. Section 6 concludes.",1

34.0,4.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,18 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00496-3,The Austrian Free Enterprise Ethic: A Mengerian Comment on Kirzner (2019),December 2021,Per L. Bylund,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Kirzner’s critique of Friedman’s universal ethic is, in essence, that it unnecessarily excludes entrepreneurship. Friedman’s ethic is based in cost: it requires any just return to be caused by some input, which means that it necessarily excludes entrepreneurial discovery, which is costless. As Kirzner puts it, “[t]he pure entrepreneur, by definition, contributed nothing (by way of productive service) to the physical emergence of the output” (Kirzner 2019, p. 91; emphasis added). Entrepreneurs instead discover (and, as a result, exploit) errors in the market, which exist because prior entrepreneurship failed to produce the best possible good and therefore left value unrealized. Profit, Kirzner argues, “is the difference between two sets of prices for what is (economically speaking) the same item, the product” (Kirzner 2019, p. 93). But this is, from an Austrian and, specifically, a Mengerian perspective, a curious way of putting it. An economic good is not constituted by the physical composition of it or even the specific combination of inputs used to make it. To Menger, what makes an economic good is the thing’s ability to satisfy a specific want, which is subjectively understood by the consumer. Goods are thus things that both “can be placed in a causal connection with the satisfaction of human needs” and that we “have the power actually to direct” in order to satisfy those wants (Menger [1871] 2007, p. 52). Things are goods by virtue of the consumer’s understanding of their serviceability and his or her choice to use them for the purpose of satisfying a specific want. This means the same physical inputs used in some other way would rarely be “the same item,” as Kirzner claims, especially economically speaking. For example, a piece of red meat combined with labor and the capital goods of a kitchen can be a nice steak or a hamburger patty or even dog food, which could be satisfying (or not) to the consumer in very different ways. Similarly, a set of buildings suitable for lodging surrounded by high walls and with uniformed guards can be a luxurious gated community or a prison—the same inputs, but very different outcomes. In both examples, the good is ‘caused’ (produced) by the same inputs but the goods would be, by most consumers, considered far from “the same.” In fact, they may not even be considered substitutes, which requires that they are, to the consumer, of (sufficiently) equal serviceability toward some specific want. Furthermore, with the subjectively recognized want as starting point and defining element of a good, as in Menger ([1871] 2007), even two goods that are physically the same can be considered different economic goods. For example, a homemade meal offered by one’s loving grandmother and a physically identical meal offered by a stranger, perhaps shady-looking, would not be considered of equal value. Economically speaking, these physically identical items are not the same good as the consumer considers them of different serviceability. What these examples are meant to illustrate is that the Austrian concept of economic good is not about the physical materials, or even the creation of ‘things’. In fact, an economic good is defined by its usefulness, from the point of view of the consumer, toward satisfying some specific (and yet to be satisfied) want. Mises ([1949] 1998, p. 93) put it clearly: “Goods … are not elements of nature; they are elements of human meaning and conduct. He who wants to deal with them must not look at the external world; he must search for them in the meaning of acting men.” From this perspective, then, entrepreneurship aims to profit from facilitating value for consumers through the production of goods. The actual value, however, is unknown and unknowable before consumers choose to purchase and consume the good. The entrepreneur bears this uncertainty by the earning of profits or suffering of losses from the venture (Mises 2008). This is core to Austrian economic theory and has important implications for how we understand and theorize about capital, entrepreneurship, and production. Yet this appears to be distinct from Kirzner’s (1973, 2019) argument that entrepreneurs earn pure profits through ‘discovery’. The difference will be elaborated in the next section. Kirzner’s critique of Friedman hinges on pure profit, which is not caused by an input in the production process—it is “won.” Therefore, it has no ethical justification according to Friedman’s reasoning. Writes Kirzner, Why and how is the pure entrepreneur able to win pure profit?! Not only does there not appear to be any obvious justification for pure profit (as we have seen)—there does not appear to be any obvious economic reason for the emergence of pure profit. (Kirzner 2019, p. 92) This undoubtedly poses a problem for Friedman’s argument, but Kirzner’s discussion is just as problematic from an Austrian perspective. Kirzner illustrates the difference between production (search) and discovery using an analogy of purchasing a house. The seller, Smith, has emptied the house and moved out, and leaves whatever items left behind to the buyer, Jones. In the first scenario, Smith knows that he had a watch that must still be in the house but that he cannot find, and tells Jones about this fact. Jones, wanting to find the watch, hires a search team to find it. It is clear that Jones here has engaged in deliberate search and has dedicated resources to find the watch. Thus, the watch is ‘caused’ by his search cost and justified value according to Friedman’s universal ethic. In the second scenario, Smith cannot recall a watch and therefore cannot tell Jones. However, Jones is an alert person and he eventually happens to see the watch on a windowsill. This, Kirzner (2019, p. 94) notes, is a different situation, since “without any deliberate search project, Jones’s alertness made him the discoverer of the existence of the watch.” Kirzner summarizes this distinction: The central feature of a process of production … is that it is deliberate; the services of the needed factors are deliberately directed towards generating the output. The central feature of discovery, on the other hand, is that an alert individual spontaneously notices an opportunity. (Kirzner 2019, p. 95) Since such costless discovery is core to Kirzner’s conceptualization of the market process (see, e.g., Kirzner 1973, 1979), its omission in Friedman’s argument amounts to a significant flaw: not accounting for pure discovery makes it irrelevant as an ethic for the free enterprise system, in which entrepreneurship is an important part—the “driving force” (Mises [1949] 1998). Yet it is difficult to accept Kirzner’s conceptualization of discovery from a Mengerian perspective. What makes a good valuable (to gain “goods-character”) is the physical good’s quality to be used to satisfy a want—the “causal relationship between a thing and the satisfaction of human needs” (Menger [1871]2007, p. 57). This relationship depends primarily on the want held by the consumer and only contingently on the physical good itself. Menger explains: Suppose that the need for direct human consumption of tobacco should disappear as the result of a change in tastes, and that at the same time all other needs that the tobacco already prepared for human consumption might serve to satisfy should also disappear. In this event, it is certain that all tobacco products already on hand, in the final form suited to human consumption, would immediately lose their goods-character. (Menger [1871] 2007, p. 64) In other words, it is unknown at the time the entrepreneur engages in production whether what is being produced will have goods-character. For this, an item must facilitate want satisfaction when offered to consumers. But if consumers have other and better options, and no longer consider a previously consumed product of value, then it could lose its goods-character. While it is rare that a product completely loses its goods-character (as most things are not perfectly specific to one want, as Menger assumes in the tobacco example), consumers’ appreciation for it may be effectively zero if better options make it, relatively speaking, ‘worthless’. For example, the flip phone practically lost its goods-character in the eyes of hundreds of millions of consumers as the first iPhone was released, because as long as there are smartphones (whether or not the iPhone) these consumers would ‘never’ go back. While there is still market value in the production of flip phones, this market is much smaller because these devices are no longer considered valuable by a multitude of consumers (a result of smartphones being available and recognized as serviceable by consumers). The same is true throughout the production structure, as “[t]he goods-character of goods of higher order is derived from that of the corresponding goods of lower order” (Menger [1871] 2007, p. 63). The watch in Kirzner's analogy, representing the valued outcome, will thus exist only when the good is consumed—it is not until then that value (want satisfaction) is realized. Or, in the case of a higher order good, its exchange value exists by virtue of buying entrepreneurs’ expectation that it will contribute to such value in consumption. From a Mengerian perspective, then, the assumption of the ‘existence’ of a watch in the house is largely without basis. Without consumers, and their unsatisfied wants, there is no value and no entrepreneurship—and also no factor markets. But, more importantly, there is also no Mengerian foundation for the distinction Kirzner makes between production and discovery. The Mengerian analysis of goods is both subjective and relative, as are consumers’ choices. The value of any one good depends both on those (future) consumer wants it can satisfy and the value consumers see in the produced alternatives they are presented with. Thus, the actual existence of the product is of little relevance: if consumers see better options, it may have little or no value. As a result, there cannot be any ‘watches’ for entrepreneurs to ‘find’. Even metaphorically, the value of a product does not exist until after production is complete and the consumer uses it to satisfy a want. Put differently, discovery of the ‘watch’ is not discovery of value but only of potential (imagined) future value—which depends not only on the product’s actual (subjective) serviceability, but its relative such compared to recognized alternatives in consumers’ specific choice situation (Bylund 2019). Even having discovered a previously unknown good, its uses and value remain uncertain. Also, we know from experience that entrepreneurs rarely ‘find’ the ‘watches’ (they believe) that they are searching for. They typically imagine some consumer want, but, often after several pivots, end up facilitating some value that is different from what was initially intended. Part of the reason for this is the difficulty in foreseeing the future wants of consumers, but part is also the unpredictability of the market situation. Whether a physical good will satisfy the intended want can only be imagined, and it cannot be known if what one produces will sufficiently satisfy a want so that it is chosen by consumers before other entrepreneurial offerings. As both demand (basically, the value scales of consumers and their limited purchasing power) and supply (all products offered up for sale by entrepreneurs) are unknown as well as unknowable ex ante, what entrepreneurs do cannot be properly described as search or discovery. Rather, they engage in production efforts aimed to meet consumers’ wants in an imagined future market situation. While Kirzner is correct in stating that production is undertaken deliberately to create some physical good, which requires directing resources toward its creation, Menger shows that this is not the complete picture. More importantly, it is not the relevant economic picture. Production is primarily directed toward providing the means for satisfying some want held by consumers. The exact nature of this want (and whether it will exist) cannot be known when production commences, so in that limited sense the value will be metaphorically ‘discovered’ (by both seller and buyer!). But this does not mean it is not deliberate: entrepreneurs aim their production at satisfying some imagined want so that they get paid a money price. In other words, they deliberately aim to produce economic goods by creating physical products for which they anticipate consumers will be willing to pay money prices in excess of the costs of production.Footnote 1 From a Mengerian perspective, entrepreneurs’ entire production effort is fundamentally a deliberate pursuit to facilitate value (see e.g. Bylund 2016). The actual physical good is only indirectly relevant, since there may be many ways to satisfy any particular want. What truly matters is the value that the good facilitates through want satisfaction in the eyes of and use by the consumer. It is this value, and the money prices consumers might be willing to pay for attaining it, that are the basis for entrepreneurs’ bids for factors—and thus what ultimately determines prices for the goods of higher order (Mises [1920] 1935). Kirzner’s analogy of the house and watch are only in some very narrow sense illustrative of production in the market economy, where producers both deliberately seek to produce goods and may discover other courses of action. But the illustration is superficial and unhelpful because it omits the value dimension. Indeed, Kirzner appears to assume the economic good, or at least the value of it (the ‘watch’), in order to explain entrepreneurship. But this reasoning is backwards, since value is the possible and aimed-for (but not guaranteed) outcome of entrepreneurial efforts, consumers willing, and not the other way around. One cannot explain entrepreneurship from its success, since the undertaking is and must be uncertain. From an economic point of view, at least using Menger, there is no watch to discover or search for. There is only the imagined value (or contribution to it) to be realized in consumption. The watch is, in fact, irrelevant, since what matters is only whether consumers will find sufficiently useful that which is offered to them. The entrepreneurial opportunity exists only ex post. As should be clear from the discussion above, there is no such relationship between cost (input) and valuable output as that which Friedman assumes, and Kirzner, in his critique and supplementation of Friedman, appears to accept. Costs do not ‘cause’ value but are, instead, chosen because they are anticipated to contribute to the final good’s value. The value perspective, which properly takes center stage in Menger’s magnum opus, suggests there are fundamental problems with Friedman’s ethic as well as with Kirzner’s proposed addition of entrepreneurial discovery. The economics of this has been addressed above. What remains is to discuss the implications of this perspective for an ethic of the free enterprise system. First, we can formulate a critique of Friedman’s universal ethic based on the fundamental relationship between cost and value. Friedman adopts the “intuitive appeal” (Kirzner 2019, p. 95) that contribution of input justifies share of the proceeds for the output. From a Mengerian perspective, this is placing the cart before the horse because costs do not cause value. In fact, goods of higher order do not even contribute to value until after the final good has been sold and put in use, and even so they may not be necessary for satisfying the want (as, for example, raisins in bread may not make the bread more serviceable, neither for satiety nor taste, to the consumer). Many inputs can be assumed by entrepreneurs in production that do not actually contribute to the consumer’s satisfaction. As a result, they are not of value in this use: they are cost only. But even if we, for the sake of argument, accept Friedman’s ethic, and forget about Menger’s value theory, the implications are hardly reasonable. Kirzner’s critique points to this, but he does not state it explicitly: if contribution to production justifies share of the outcome, then this should be equally true for profit and loss. But rarely, if at all, does anyone claim that, for example, employed labor should share the burden of losses. Yet, following Friedman’s logic, if workers in a business are paid wages and the business suffers losses, then their remuneration was in excess of contribution and, thus, the workers are to blame to the extent they contributed to this outcome (and should, therefore, bear a proportional share of the burden?). The solution to this conundrum is, of course, Kirzner’s addition of entrepreneurship. It is not only necessary to step out of equilibrium and into the actual free enterprise system, but is also required for profits and losses to appear. This indicates a fundamental contradiction in Friedman’s ethic, where a defense of the cost-based theory of justification lies in profits being fully caused by costs. But those profits are only possible outside of equilibrium—and thus would be, to some extent, uncaused. This validates Kirzner’s critique and supplementation. However, Kirzner’s distinction between the profits ‘caused’ by costs and those purely discovered is incompatible with the Mengerian perspective. As we saw above, there is only one cause of both profits and losses: entrepreneurship. Costs do not cause anything because they do not generate the economic outcome—they are the means of production chosen by entrepreneurs who imagine those means to be the best possible for the intended outcome (a valued economic good). The ultimate causes of the outcome is entrepreneurial imagination and action, and the value of the outcome is determined by consumers choosing between different already produced goods to satisfy their most urgent wants (Mises [1933] 2002). In terms of formulating a free enterprise ethic, this means the approach Friedman (1962) uses, and that Kirzner (2019) supplements, is mistaken. Profits and losses do not appear to be ethical outcomes in themselves, and the same can consequently be said about the costs assumed in production. Since profits and losses are outcomes of actions, and are indicative of the value provided relative the costs chosen, whether one adopts a deontological or consequentialist ethic, the proper analysis would seem to be of the action itself. And if that is the case, then the free enterprise ethic appears to boil down to voluntarism: whether the actions taken were voluntary and exchanges made in good faith (without fraud or deception). Cost is not part of the ethic equation, but is a necessary part of the action that should be.",3

35.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,24 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00489-2,Regulatory ambiguity in the market for bitcoin,March 2022,William J. Luther,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Regulatory ambiguity refers to the uncertainty or inexactness of policies governing a particular action or industry.Footnote 2 It might arise at any phase of the regulatory process. In this section, I describe four sources of ambiguity: dormant, imprecise, conflicting, and selectively-enforced regulation.Footnote 3 Then, I explain how jurisdictional redundancy increases the likelihood of regulatory ambiguity. Somewhat paradoxically, the first source of regulatory ambiguity results in the absence of regulation. Ambiguity arises when (1) it is unclear whether the regulator has the authority to regulate or (2) the regulator has the authority to regulate but fails to indicate whether or to what extent regulations will be drafted in the future. The range of potential regulations can be quite large and difficult to predict when regulators do not credibly signal their intentions. Since these inactive regulations might be activated at any time, I refer to them as dormant regulations. The ambiguity arising from dormant regulation is similar in some respects to regime uncertainty. Higgs (1997, p. 563) defines regime uncertainty as “pervasive uncertainty among investors about the security of their property rights in their capital and its prospective returns.” Regulation—with its corresponding cost of compliance—also affects the prospective return of capital. Hence, the potential for not-as-of-yet-enacted regulation to be adopted amounts to uncertainty in the regulatory regime. Drafting regulation typically reduces the range of potential regulations and, with it, the ambiguity from dormant regulation. Ambiguity might remain, however, if regulations are poorly written. Imprecise regulation denotes a regulation with multiple potentially-acceptable interpretations. Imprecise regulation is, to some extent, unavoidable. It is difficult to anticipate all the ways a regulation might be interpreted. In some cases, however, the lack of precision is intentional. A regulator may introduce ambiguity to accommodate future changes in technology. Alternatively, as Herk (1995, p. 1) explains, a “regulatory authority with broadly defined powers may seek to extract rents for itself by creating superfluous and apparently random loopholes and pitfalls which affect private agents under circumstances which are difficult for the latter to predict, and hence hard to avoid.” Intentional or otherwise, imprecise regulation makes it difficult to forecast how a regulation will be interpreted in practice.Footnote 4 Even when a regulation is clearly written, it might still produce regulatory ambiguity if it conflicts with other regulations on the books. In some cases, a clear precedent resolves the incongruency. In others, it is ambiguous as to which of the regulations will dominate. Such conflicting regulations are a clear source of regulatory ambiguity. The final source of ambiguity comes from selectively-enforced regulations. Selective enforcement might result from a lack of political will to enforce a particular regulation or a desire on the part of the regulator to pick specific winners and losers. It is of little consequence that regulations are clear and congruent if they are enforced in an arbitrary, unpredictable manner. Indeed, there is perhaps no clearer violation of the rule of law. Jurisdictional redundancy results when multiple agencies regulate the same action or industry.Footnote 5 Although jurisdictional redundancy is not a source of ambiguity in and of itself, it tends to promote ambiguity of the four types discussed above. For example, multiple agencies crafting rules for the same industry are more likely to produce conflicting regulations. It also makes it more difficult to predict which agency will enforce a regulation and to what extent enforcement will be carried out. More generally, jurisdictional redundancy increases the costs of compliance, the probability of regulation, and the potential for political opportunism. When a particular action or industry falls under the purview of multiple regulatory agencies, firms operating in that area must consult with each agency to figure out whether and to what extent their efforts run afoul of current regulations or might conflict with future regulations. They must also assess the likelihood that they will be punished and the expected magnitude of that punishment. In general, complying with multiple agencies’ regulations is more costly than when a single regulatory agency presides.Footnote 6 Moreover, as the number of relevant agencies increases, so to does the potential that regulatory ambiguity will result. In especially complex environments, the threshold number of agencies could be quite low. Jurisdictional redundancy also tends to increase the probability of regulation. A simple case serves to illustrate. Let P(i) represent the probability that agency i drafts a regulation, where P(i) = x for all i and 0 < x < 1. Suppose there are two agencies i = [1, 2] with the ability to regulate a particular action or industry. If P(1|2) = P(2|1) = 1, P(1 or 2) = x; otherwise, P(1 or 2) > x. Hence, P(1 or 2) ≥ x. More generally, P(i or i + 1 or i + 2 or ... or i + n) tends to increase with n. In other words, the more agencies that are able to regulate the same action or industry, the more likely it is that some regulation will be put into place. In much the same way, jurisdictional redundancy also increases the potential for political opportunism. The more agencies a firm interacts with, the more likely it is that someone at any one of those agencies abuses her power in order to extract rents. Moreover, oversight of regulators by the executive, legislature, and judiciary is probably less effective as the number of agencies increases since the overseer is stretched thinner and thinner with each additional agency. Taken together, this suggests that more consolidated regulatory regimes will be less prone to political opportunism.",5
35.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,09 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-019-00494-5,"War, money & economy: Inflation and production in the Fed and pre-Fed periods",March 2022,Thomas L. Hogan,Daniel J. Smith,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a growing literature examining whether the Federal Reserve has improved U.S. economic performance. This literature, however, fails to account for the effects of exogenous wartime shocks. Since wars create serious economic turmoil, failing to adjust for these shocks could prevent an accurate comparison of economic performance across these periods. No adjustment is necessary if wars throughout U.S. history are of similar frequency across these periods or if the effects of wartime shocks were dampened by Fed monetary policy. Adjustments are necessary, however, if wartime shocks are exogenous and occurred at dissimilar frequencies in U.S. history. Historical evidence indicates that wartime shocks have, in fact, been exogenous and have occurred at dissimilar frequencies. The Fed does not appear to have damped their effects. Friedman (1952), for example, finds the magnitudes of World Wars I and II were the same magnitude as that of the Civil War. Wartime shocks have also become less frequent under the Fed. For instance, no major wars have occurred in the post–World War II period, often referred to simply as the “postwar period.” Most studies of economic performance focus exclusively on this period precisely because of the absence of wartime disruptions.Footnote 1 Therefore, we must account for exogenous shocks in order to accurately compare the Fed and pre-Fed periods using the full range of available data. This paper builds on the existing literature by comparing economic performance in the Fed and pre-Fed periods after adjusting for wars as exogenous shocks. It also builds on the literature analyzing the impact of exogenous shocks on economic performance (Campbell and Mankiw 1987; Cochrane 1988; Keating and Nye 1998, 1999; Shapiro and Watson 1988). Following the existing literature, we divide the pre-Fed periods into three subperiods according to major changes in the U.S. monetary system; the early American period (1792–1836), the free banking period (1837–1865), and the national banking period (1866–1913). We divide the Fed period into subperiods according to economists’ common perceptions of Fed performance; the early Fed period (1914–1945), the early postwar Fed period (1946–1984), and the Great Moderation (1985–2017).Footnote 2 Separately, we compare the pre-Fed subperiods to the full post-World War II period (1946–2017). To adjust for wartime shocks, we identify U.S. wars as either major or minor based on the magnitude of the increase in U.S. military spending during each war. Controlling for wages as a proxy for productivity, we then compare these historical periods using regression analysis. We run four separate regressions using four common measures of economic performance as dependent variables: the rate of inflation, the volatility of inflation, the growth rate of real GDP, and the volatility of real GDP growth. We find that wars have an important impact on the explanatory power of our regressions as measured by their coefficient estimates and R-squared statistics. After accounting for wars, the pre-Fed periods are the same or better on most criteria relative to the postwar Fed, and the differences between the periods are both statistically and economically significant. The rates of inflation are lower in the pre-Fed periods, although the volatility of inflation is higher in some pre-Fed periods than in the postwar Fed period. The rates of GDP growth in the pre-Fed periods are always the same as or higher than in the postwar Fed period. The volatility of GDP growth is higher in the national banking period than under the Fed, but the volatility of GDP growth is no different in the early American or free banking periods than in the postwar Fed period. The low volatilities of GDP growth in the early American and free banking periods show that studies that only consider the national banking period (1866–1913) and not the period before the Civil War (1790–1865) do not fully capture the available evidence on U.S. economic performance before the Fed. These results hold up to multiple robustness tests. This paper demonstrates that wartime disruptions are an important but previously unconsidered factor in the literature comparing Fed and pre-Fed performance. Thus, it offers an important extension to previous analyses in the literature. There are additional problems in the literature that fall beyond the scope of this paper. For instance, using all the available data on U.S. economic performance back to 1790 does require comparing economies from vastly different periods of U.S. history, as is often the case when studying GDP and inflation over long time periods. Future research might better account for the many factors affecting the U.S. economy over this time period. The finding that performance has not been better under the Fed casts some doubt on the widely-held belief that economic performance has improved under the Fed (Balke and Gordon 1989; Bernanke 2013; Taylor 1986; DeLong and Summers 1986; Zarnowitz 1992). Following the other papers in the literature such as Romer (1986a, b, c) and Davis (2004, 2006), however, this analysis does not attempt to settle the debate on whether the Fed has had a positive or negative causal impact on economic performance. The next section explains our data and methods of analysis. As a base case, Section 3 compares the pre-Fed and the Great Moderation without adjusting for wartime shocks. Section 4 compares economic performance in the pre-Fed subperiods and the Great Moderation after adjusting for wars as defined by their officially designated starting and ending years. Section 5 replicates our regression analysis but compares the pre-Fed periods to the full post-World War II period. Section 6 discusses tests of robustness, and Section 7 concludes.",

While also essential in other sciences, and probably imported into economics from physics (Canard 1801), equilibrium has a distinct meaning in economics that cannot be derived from its meaning in physics. The dissonance between the physical and economic meanings of equilibrium occasioned a long process of explication and clarification, before the concept and its essential role in economic theory came into clear focus. Applying the physical meaning of equilibrium, the classical economists regarded an economic system in equilibrium as analogous to a physical system at rest, movement being either absent or repetitive. But what does it mean for an economic system to be at rest? The classical answer was that quantities and prices of goods produced, exchanged and consumed would not change. If the amount supplied equals the amount demanded in each market, and if no exogenous change (e.g., in population, technology, tastes, etc.) disturbs the system, there would be no reason for prices or quantities to change. But because a large, and causally important, subset of economic activity – saving and investment – is predicated on the assumption that prices and quantities do change, the notion of an economic system at rest seemed unrealistic. Thus, in the works of classical economists, equilibrium was not an achievable state, but simply an end-state toward which economic processes, if allowed to operate without disturbance, were tending. This, not very satisfactory, equilibrium concept of a system at rest was undermined when the neoclassical pioneers, Jevons, Menger and Walras introduced the idea of optimizing decisions by rational decision-making agents. The notion of optimality, later formalized by Pareto, provided the analytical key to transforming the earlier classical equilibrium concept into a more robust and fruitful concept. If each economic agent (household or business firm) is viewed as making optimal decisions, based on given preferences, and subject to constraints imposed by capacities, endowments, technologies, and the legal system, the equilibrium of an economy can be understood as a state of affairs in which each agent is deciding optimally, and every optimal decision is both consistent with, and, directly or indirectly, contingent upon those of all other agents; the decisions of all buyers of how much to buy must be consistent with the decisions of all sellers of how much to sell. But, like every piece in a jig-saw puzzle, all decisions must fit in with all other decisions. If one decision is suboptimal, none of the decisions contingent upon that decision can be optimal.Footnote 1 The idea of an equilibrium as a set of independently conceived, mutually consistent, optimal decisions was latent in the earlier notions of equilibrium, but it could not be coherently articulated without a formal concept of optimality.Footnote 2 The concept of an optimal plan allowed a uniquely economic idea of equilibrium to be formulated, not in terms of stationarity, but in terms of mutually consistent optimal plans. But an optimal plan may encompass not just actions at a moment in time, it may encompass a sequence of actions to be taken over an interval of time. Indeed, the idea of an optimal plan at least implies a future different from the present. So, once grasped, the idea of equilibrium as the mutual consistency of optimal plans, it became possible to extend the idea to encompass change and development over time. But an extended process of intellectual reflection was required before change and development could be incorporated into an equilibrium framework, allowing time to gain significance beyond merely assigning the label “time” to one of the axes in n-dimensional vector space. This paper examines the process by which the concept of equilibrium was transformed from a timeless or static concept into an intertemporal one by focusing on the pathbreaking contribution of F. A. Hayek and its relation to subsequent developments of the idea of intertemporal equilibrium. While the idea of intertemporal equilibrium was articulated more or less contemporaneously with Hayek (1928 [1984]) by Lindahl (1929 [1939]) and Myrdal (1927), all three justly sharing credit for priority, in this paper I am especially interested in Hayek’s subsequent 1937 paper, which clarified the key distinction between perfect and correct foresight. Confusion about the meaning and interpretation of foresight led to Morgenstern’s (1935 [1976]) attack on the idea of equilibrium. Hayek’s 1937 paper, apparently a response to Morgenstern’s attack on equilibrium, displayed a deep understanding of what is and what is not entailed by the concept of intertemporal equilibrium as the consistency of optimal plans extending through time. Beyond explaining Hayek’s articulation of intertemporal equilibrium, I examine four noteworthy, derivative versions of intertemporal equilibrium in the light of Hayek’s articulation: (1) the modern version of a perfect-foresight intertemporal equilibrium embodied in the canonical complete-markets Arrow-Debreu-Mackenzie (ADM) model, (2) Radner’s modern incomplete-markets version of Hayek’s intertemporal equilibrium as an equilibrium of plans, prices, and price expectations, (3) Hick’s incomplete-markets temporary equilibrium, and (4) Lucas’s incomplete-markets rational-expectations equilibrium. Before discussing these versions of intertemporal equilibrium, I summarize in section two Hayek’s 1937 contribution, clarifying the necessary conditions for the existence of intertemporal equilibrium. In section three, I elaborate on Hayek’s distinction between perfect foresight and contingently correct foresight in response to Morgenstern’s attack on equilibrium and the idea of perfect foresight. In section four, I consider Radner’s generalization of the ADM model, which in most respects captures Hayek’s understanding of a correct- (though imperfect-) foresight intertemporal equilibrium. But in proving the existence of an equilibrium of plans, prices and price expectations, Radner departed from Hayek’s philosophically parsimonious view of rationality and knowledge. In section five, I explore how Hicks’s concept of temporary equilibrium, inspired by Hayek, though later credited by Hicks (1965) to Lindahl (1929 [1939]), provides a bridge connecting the hypothetical equilibrium of correct expectations and consistency of plans with the messy real world of disappointed expectations and revised and abandoned plans. The advantage of the temporary-equilibrium approach is to provide the conceptual tools for understanding how financial crises occur and can be propagated and amplified into economic depressions, thereby enabling the kind of business-cycle model that Hayek had tried to create. But while Hicks omitted mention of Hayek’s insights in articulating the temporary-equilibrium approach, Hayek, for his part, failed to grasp that temporary equilibrium could serve as a modeling strategy by which the equilibrium method could be adapted to the reality of the expectational inconsistency among agents that characterizes disequilibrium.Footnote 3 Finally, in section six, I discuss rational expectations in macroeconomic models, mainly to argue that it assumes away the problem of expectational convergence and plan consistency with which Hayek, Hicks, Radner and others who developed the idea of intertemporal equilibrium were so profoundly concerned. Rational expectations thereby became the vehicle by which the complete-markets, virtual-perfect-foresight ADM model could be deployed as a macroeconomic model, even though, as I hope becomes clear in what follows, the ADM model is fundamentally unequipped and unsuited for analyzing macroeconomic fluctuations. I conclude in section seven.",2

One strand of this literature analyzes the evolution of banks’ liabilities during credit booms. Considerable attention is paid to the role of so-called non-core liabilities (e.g. Hahm et al. 2013; IMF 2013) and to the overall leverage of the banking sector (Damar et al. 2013; Dewally and Shao 2013). However, the issue that remains largely overlooked is the changes in the structure of core liabilities. The deposits of non-financial agents are usually perceived as homogeneous positions, irrespective of the fact that they comprise funds deposited in banks for two different economic motives: facilitating transactions and saving. The neglect of this issue may be explained by some practical considerations. Under the fractional-reserve banking system, supported by public deposit insurance, overnight retail deposits are almost as stable a source of funding for banks as time deposits. Moreover, in the real world, there is no clear-cut distinction between deposits that are held due to the transaction motive and those that satisfy the precautionary motive. Although agents usually have the liquidity necessary for upcoming transactions on current accounts, some of their purchases may be financed with less liquid deposits, which pay a higher interest rate, or with credit. Conversely, some savings may be placed on current accounts due to high liquidity preferences or low opportunity costs. However, despite these ambiguities, an analysis of the dynamics of the deposit structure may shed light on some interesting macroeconomic issues. In particular, it may help to assess the impact of fractional-reserve banking on deviations of the market interest rate from the natural level. These deviations may arise if the funding availability for borrowers is not dependent on the availability of savings. While in many segments of the financial system the loanable funds originate from genuine savings, this is not the case for the banking sector. Banks can finance a larger amount of credit than the sum of the savings accumulated in their liabilities. In this paper, I will answer two questions empirically. First, is credit growth influenced by the availability of savings? On the one hand, there is a popular notion, derived from the loanable funds theory, that investment is constrained by the amount of savings or at least related to it (Tsiang 1956; World Bank 2014). Therefore, incentivizing saving is often considered as a way to improve the funding availability for borrowers. On the other hand, it is recognized that technically the banking sector can expand its asset side with no prior increase in domestic or foreign savings. If the latter pattern typically occurred in the real world, the link between the natural and the market interest rates would be weak. Second, are credit booms associated with a smaller share of genuine savings in banks’ liabilities? Credit booms themselves pose many risks to the sustainability and healthiness of economic growth. Some risks, however, might be magnified if savings increase at a slower pace than credit. It is the decision of non-financial agents what to do with newly created money. If they spend additional income, banks can still use related transaction deposits as a source of funding (except for required reserves which are usually very small in developed economies). However, low savings levels would exert upward pressure on the natural interest rate. It is the prediction of the Austrian theory of business cycle that credit booms are characterized by a decreasing share of savings in banks’ liabilities (Hayek 1933; Garrison 2001). Then, the investment financed by money creation represents misallocation of resources. Long-term investment decisions are made as if the relatively low interest rates reflected time preferences of the society, whereas low market interest rates are in fact unsustainable. In the context of the questions formulated above, it is important to distinguish between different notions of saving and savings. In the empirical analyses, the national accounts concept of ex-post saving is most often used. Its main advantage is easy availability of data. However, it is not a measure of voluntary saving, nor does it correspond to the loanable funds that might be transferred to entrepreneurs to be invested. According to the national accounts definition, saving is basically an income that is not consumed during the relevant reporting period. For example, if an employee receives a wage on December 31, he will probably “save” it until the next year. Likewise, profits made by corporations are classified as saving until they are paid out as dividends. Furthermore, the distinction between households’ saving and corporate saving is quite artificial, because part of the latter is included in the wealth of domestic households. Intentions regarding deferred consumption are captured by the concept of ex-ante saving, introduced by Myrdal (1939). It denotes planned saving out of planned income in a given period of time. Such defined saving has an impact on the natural interest rate, because it represents households’ propensity to save. It also influences the market for loanable funds, as savings are supposed to be supplied throughout a period. However, ex-ante saving is not an observable variable. Robertson (1940) defines saving as a portion of disposable income that is not consumed. Importantly, the income comes from production on the previous “day” and is available from the beginning of the “day” under consideration. This interpretation of saving may be operationalized by analyzing the changes in the household’s stock of assets. If the real value of assets at the end of the day is higher than yesterday’s value, it is evidence of positive net saving.Footnote 1 In the real world, however, an increase in the stock of assets in a given period may be related to both the income from the previous date and that from the current period. Thus, an increase in the assets may represent deferred consumption as well as a higher disposable income, which is intended to be consumed. To focus on the former, one may exclude the most liquid forms of money and analyze only those assets that are typically considered as saving instruments. In this paper I follow Robertson’s interpretation of saving and apply it to funds deposited in banks. To the best of my knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt to analyze the dynamics of core deposits during credit booms. This may be an interesting contribution to the existing literature on credit booms. In particular, it adds to the empirical literature testing the Austrian business cycle theory (e.g. Mulligan 2017; Guzelian and Mulligan 2016; Young 2012). The analysis is conducted on an unbalanced panel data set of 20 countries with the time dimension covering the 1961–2015 period. The database merges the Bank for International Settlements data on credit to the private non-financial sector with data on deposits obtained from central banks. An appropriate effort has been made to clear the data set of the noise related to breaks in series or to exchange rate fluctuations. My contribution to the literature also includes the implementation of a new procedure for credit boom identification. It performs better in indicating the timing of booms than the existing methods, which are based on analyses of the deviation of a credit variable from its trend. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 presents the estimation strategy, and section 4 discusses the methodology of credit boom identification. Section 5 describes the data set. Section 6 shows the estimation results, followed by section 7, which contains a robustness analysis. Section 8 discusses the policy implications, paying special attention to full-reserve banking.",1

Evans,Nicolás Cachanosky,Robert Thorpe,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) originated over a century ago, and was developed in a pre-fiat monetary regime. This paper attempts to address some existing critiques, and assess its contemporary relevance. Among the six “problems” that Hummel (1979) identifies with ABCT, he notes the lack of an explanation for the upper turning point of the business cycle, where boom turns to bust. He then goes on to sketch out a brief answer (emphasis added): a constant rate of credit expansion will produce a boom, followed by a period in which the economy is adjusted to the credit expansion. (p.49) Is this right? Does not the Austrian boom inevitably lead to a bust? This article is an attempt to address Hummel’s claim by clarifying the process by which credit expansion takes place.Footnote 1 It is fair to say that Hummel’s challenge has been neglected by a substantial part of the Austrian literature. Contemporary book-length accounts of Austrian monetary theory do not pay detailed attention to Hummel’s scenario (Garrison 2001; Horwitz 2000; Huerta de Soto 1998; O’Driscoll and Rizzo 1985; Selgin 1988; Skousen 1990; White 1984, 1999). In this paper, we tackle Hummel’s concern. In the spirit of Hummel (1979) we pose this question as an attempt to contribute to the Austrian theory of the business cycle. We consider this “problem” an opportunity to enhance our understanding of business cycles. Section 2 retells Hummel’s issue and puts it in the context of Austrian accounts of a credit expansion. Section 3 uses standard macroeconomic textbook analysis to discuss the short run and long run effects of credit expansion. Section 4 suggests how the Austrian approach can be incorporated into such analysis, by introducing capital heterogeneity and the Ricardo effect. Section 5 concludes.",1

Temin (1989) pointed out that the monetary system imposed a deflationary necessity on the world economy, with negative effects on economic activity. He concluded: ‘In fact it was the attempt to preserve the gold standard that produced the Great Depression’ (Temin 1989, p. 38). The situation would have been different, Eichengreen (1992) argued, if countries had coordinated their actions to allow for expansive monetary policies, which were, however, impossible according to the gold standard’s rules. For Bernanke (1995, p. 4), the fate of a country during the crisis depended on its abandoning, or not, the system: ‘To an overwhelming degree’, he writes, ‘the evidence shows that countries that left the gold standard recovered from the Depression more quickly than countries that remained on gold. Indeed, no country exhibited significant economic recovery while remaining on the gold standard’. The gold standard is thus seen to have been an initial cause of the crisis, which was then, according to these authors, aggravated by the lack of adequate public policies, bank runs, or increased protectionism. With the exception of Yeager (1976), who emphasizes the exchange rate cause like pre-Keynesian authors such as Gustav Cassel, other modern takes on the Great Depression either are built on Keynes explanation (Eichengreen and Mitchener 2003; Laidler 2003), or on the Rothbard explanation (Garrison 1999; White 2012;), or in modern syntheses of the monetarist and Austrian views (Horwitz 2012; Selgin 2013). With more or less emphasis, all of them attribute to the general features of the gold standard system of the interwar years some rigidities and weaknesses that would lead to the Great Depression. Gradually, however, an alternative vision has emerged that, rather than accusing the gold standard itself, points towards the Depression as a consequence of the disequilibrium created by the price of gold set by governments, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. This new perspective was developed in Johnson’s (1998) early study, highlighted by Mundell (2000), more recently expanded upon by Mazumder and Wood (2013), and then supplemented by Sumner (2015) and addressed in a blog post by McCulloch (2018). If the chain of causality presented by these authors is correct, the global crisis should not be attributed primarily to issues such as excessive credit expansion, a structural mismatch in economic relations as a result of the Great War, a disruptive transfer of the world financial center from London to New York, aggressive devaluations, or to the gold standard system as a whole, but rather to only one of its constituent elements: the parities of the precious metal determined and sustained by those governments. In general, the case that mismanaged monetary policy story, per the monetarists and the Austrians, argues Mark Toma (2013: 114) may be falsified if it is assumed that the model of central banking in the United States, a central player in these events, was not one “centralized, and discretionary,” but one “competitive” among the different regional reserve banks reacting to broad economic incentives, a line of reasiong that reinforces the need to find a more thight explanation. This paper argues that the convertibility regime applied in Argentina between 1991 and 2001, and its dramatic outcome, had some notable similarities to the gold standard experience in the interwar period. The consideration of the more recent South American process can therefore shed some light on the origins of the global crisis of the 1930s. In illustrating the new hypothesis about one of the causes of the Great Depression, the paper will focus on data of an aggregated group of nations: Britain, the United States, France, Sweden, Italy, Norway, Canada, Holland, Spain, Japan, and Argentina. Among this group, the two countries that played a central role at the time, United Kingdom and the United States, will be given prominence. Other countries could be added to the analysis, but it would be unlikely that the overall picture would vary substantially, since the states included were crucial actors in determining the price of gold and economic activity at the time.",
35.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,06 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-020-00521-w,Competition is (still) a tough weed: A review essay of Thomas Philippon’s The great reversal: How America gave up on free markets,March 2022,Louis Rouanet,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Thomas Philippon’s The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets is a detailed examination of America’s competitiveness in relation to investment, prices, rent-seeking, growth and the distribution of income. The author, relying on empirical research he has recently conducted,Footnote 1 develops three main theses, which can be summarized as follows. First, competition has declined in the U.S. since the 1990s. Second, the relaxation of anti-trust regulation and new barriers to entry are the reason for this decline. Third, the lack of competition has major macroeconomic and distributional consequences (especially a decline in the labor share and the rise in inequality). Philippon’s approach is decisively empirical. We should, he claims “always look at the data first.” (Philippon 2019, p. xi). This approach makes the book instructive with respect to some trends and with respect to the empirical challenges faced by economists in this area of research. It is unlikely that having read The Great Reversal, one would not be at least slightly more worried about the state of competition in the United States. Yet, economics is not statistics (Leeson 2020) and Philippon’s approach fails to convincingly give support to the alleged decline in competition. The reasons for this failure are not only empirical, but also methodological and conceptual. In many ways, Philippon’s book is truly the resuscitation of the still recently near-dead “structure-conduct-performance” (SCP) paradigm. Yet, it is not clear what was responsible for the regained popularity of this paradigm, which was broadly rejected 30 years ago and is still largely rejected today in the field of industrial organization (Berry et al. 2019). The author’s line of research seems to indicate a change in attitude toward competition and how markets work rather than a fundamental change in the available empirical evidence. Many economists have recently come to consider competition as a delicate flower instead of a though weed, to use George Stigler’s analogy. Philippon admits this, and during his research, he discovered “how fragile free-markets are” (2019, p. 287). But the delicate flower view, I will argue, is grounded in a misleading view of what competition actually is and how it operates under alternative economic systems. The rest of this essay is structured as follows. Section 2 explains why the new research on market power, to which Philippon contributes, fails to seriously address the methodological challenges to the SCP approach, which were put forward since the 1950s. In addition to significant limitations faced when trying to measure competition, the current state of the empirical evidence is not such that we can definitely conclude that the U.S. has become less competitive. Recognizing that competition is present on multiple margins leads us to significantly revise the interpretation of the stylized facts given in The Great Reversal. In Section 3, I argue that the emphasis on concentration and markups is misplaced once we consider competition as a dynamic process in which rents are endogenously eroded. What matters is not the level of rents but how fast and at what cost they are being dissipated under alternative institutional arrangements. Section 4 concludes.",

Robert Subrick,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 1944, F.A. Hayek published “The Road to Serfdom” as a warning to the people of Great Britain, and to a lesser extent the United States, about the possible unintended consequences of the expanding political power in the name of economic security. He claimed that the ideas motivating public discourse in England seemed remarkably similar to those he heard growing up in Vienna decades earlier and these ideas helped authoritarian regimes to emerge before the Second World War. In the name of economic stability, citizens gave up rights and allowed unelected officials to interfere with market outcomes so as to accomplish the goals of the officials. If they continued to follow the path of gradual interventionism, they too would erode the foundations of their democratic institutions. Hayek’s argument was simple: regulatory interventions motivated by a belief in the superiority of economic planning would beget more interventions as leaders sought to attain their ideals rather than revise them. When interventions failed to achieve the preferred outcome, due to unforeseen changes and limited information, another one or more would be proposed as a solution. Rarely would the removal of the intervention be considered. Rather than adhere to the rule of law and treat people equally, additional interventions that increase the government’s role in planning the economy would be enacted to protect some and not others. This would lead these countries further and further away from the liberal market-supporting democratic institutions upon which they had been built. Moreover, governments would adapt and promote their ideologies to persuade the citizenry to accept a larger role for government in the economy. This institutional and belief framework, or social infrastructure, would lead to the worst getting on top of the political ladder and, eventually, dictatorships. As Boettke (1995, 12) stated “[t]he complexity of the task implied in rationally planning an economic system would require that planners be granted almost unlimited discretion.” Taking the logic to completion, a totalitarian collectivist state would likely emerge akin to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Critics of Hayek’s prognosis have claimed it lacks empirical support (Rosser 2005; Farrant and McPhail 2014). After all, the post-War welfare states of Great Britain and the United States did not descend into autocracies. In fact, no social welfare state based on the rule of law has evolved into a dictatorial regime in the developed world. In the United States, neither the Democratic nor Republican Party supported large-scale nationalizations or political censorship. So, was Hayek wrong? Perhaps misunderstood? Didn’t Hayek himself not disavow some of his own predictions? (Rosser 2005) The purpose of this paper is to show that Hayek was not wrong to warn the British and the Americans but to remind them that the road to serfdom is not inevitable. The citizens and government officials of Great Britain and the United States did not accept central planning and, thus, prevented the emergence of a totalitarian state. Unfortunately, the same can not be said for Brazil. Brazil offers a natural place to examine the validity of Hayek’s arguments. Following the abolishment of the monarchy in 1889, Brazil adopted a federalist liberal republican government, inspired by the American experiment. The 1891 Constitution protected private property rights and individual liberties, separated church and state, and clearly delineated the division of powers between the federal government and states. These subnational governments had broad control over their local economies, while the federal government had limited powers to intervene in the economy. The 1891 Constitution and the federalist liberal system it created reflected the political bargain between a declining monarchy and the ideology of the time, which was closest to a laissez faire position than at any other time in Brazilian history. Recent research suggests economic changes brought about during this period have had positive long-run effects on the country’s economic development. (Fritscher et al. 2010; Stolz et al. 2013; Leff 1969; Haber 1997). The liberal republican regime of the First Republic (1889–1930) slowly devolved into an autocratic regime. In fewer than twenty years, beginning in the 1910s, gradual interventions coupled with a change in the ideology concerning the role of government in economic planning led Brazil away from democratic institutions down a road to totalitarianism. The liberal laissez faire attitudes of the turn of the century were those which Hayek identifies as liberalism albeit in a different context. When we refer to a “liberal ideology” we mean that which Hayek describes as “[the] attitude to assume that, especially in the economic field, the self-regulating forces of the market will somehow bring about the required adjustments to new conditions.” (Hayek 2011, 522) Further, in his and our conception, “a government which can apply coercion to the individual citizen only in accordance with pre-established long-term general rules but not for specific, temporary ends is not compatible with evert kind of economic order.” (Hayek 2011, 286) In sum, liberalism encompasses a laissez faire, non-interventionist attitudes towards economic activity coupled with the rule of law over the rule of men. By 1930, the political arrangement that sustained the Old Republic had collapsed. Getúlio Vargas, the losing presidential candidate of that year’s earlier elections, overthrew the government and ruled effectively as a dictator until 1945. In 1937 he imposed a new constitution that officially established the creation of an authoritarian dictatorship, centered on his figure, and aimed at controlling the economy and state’s rights. He nationalized the nascent oil industry as well as other industries, such as steel. Vargas censored the press, arrested political adversaries, and restricted the rights of immigrants and Brazilian citizens. Nationalism and other collectivist ideologies had taken over and undermined the previously existing consensus about the role of government intervention in the economy. The rise of a nationalist ideology fit well with the disgruntled military leadership of the time, still longing for the recognition and power that followed Brazil’s victory in the Paraguay War (1864–1870). By demonstrating the existence of other “The Road to Serfdom” events, we offer a contribution to the comparative historical political economy. Only by studying what Boettke, Coyne and Leeson (2013) call the “historical specificity” of the Old Republic, can we begin to understand the political economy and institutional changes that took place during and immediately prior to the Vargas era. We find that theirs (broadly) is Hayek’s (narrowly) framework for understanding the rise of totalitarianism in Brazil (and elsewhere).",

However, very little is known about origins of his liberal outlook because scholars of Mises usually use the 1919 Nation, Economy, and State as a starting point for an analysis of his liberalism (Hülsmann 2007; Kirzner 2001; Rothbard 1988). While such scholars suspect that he developed classical liberal views early on in his career and that the Austrian school played a key role in a development of his liberal outlook, no extant study has yet examined liberalism in his early work (1902–1905). The scholars of Mises suggest that his liberal outlook emerged during his studies at the University of Vienna (Hülsmann 2007; Pallas 2005; Butler 1988; Edwards 1985). Did Mises express a liberal outlook in his early work, before Nation, Economy, and State? If so, what tradition of liberalism did he adhere to? Whereas some scholars highlight the importance of the Philippovich seminar of 1904 in his formative years as a young Austrian scholar and liberal thinker, others view the Grünberg seminar of 1901–1902 as the starting point in his liberalism (Krasnozhon and Bunyk 2018; Hülsmann 2007). Both Philippovich and Grünberg were members of the Verein für Sozialpolitik (Association for Social Policy), founded by the German Historical School in the early 1870s. Did the Austrian School or the German Historical School play a major part in the development of his liberal outlook? What factors were at play that help us understand Mises’s early interest in liberalism? Guido Hülsmann argues in the 2007 Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism that Mises’s first introduction to liberalism occurred when he attended Friedrich von Wieser’s inaugural lecture at the University of Vienna on October 26, 1903. Other scholars of Mises view the Christmas of 1903 as a watershed event in the transformation of his outlook (Pallas 2005; Butler 1988; Edwards 1985). According to his autobiography, the young Mises switched allegiances from the Historical School to the Austrian School after he read Menger’s 1871 Principles of Economics in December 1903 (Mises, [1978] 2009). Grimmer-Solem (2003), however, demonstrates that the divide between the Historical School and the Austrians is quite subtle when one considers their joint work in the Verein für Sozialpolitik. Two recent studies have questioned the purported influence of the Austrian School on the origins of Mises’s liberalism. Dekker (2016) argues that the Viennese social space was a main influence on Mises’s liberal outlook. Slobodian (2019) conjectures that the Habsburg’s socioeconomic reality influenced Mises’s original vision of liberalism. This paper contributes to the literature on European history of economic thought. We examine Mises’s early work, completed during his studies at the University of Vienna, including his very first academic book. This paper traces the origins of his liberal outlook back to the work of Younger Historicist members of the Verein für Sozialpolitik, such as Knapp and Grünberg. First, we show that Mises’s early work (1902–1905) demonstrates a liberal outlook that favors worker protection laws, factory inspection, and freeing peasants from landed estate privilege. Second, we argue that his early work expresses a rationalist liberalism that is associated with the Verein für Sozialpolitik in the late nineteenth century (Levy 2015; Grimmer-Solem 2003). This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses German liberalism in the late nineteenth century within the context of the Verein für Sozialpolitik. Section 3 demonstrates how the Verein research project brought a liberal outlook to Mises’s early work. Section 4 contains the concluding remarks.",1
35.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,02 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-020-00498-6,Self-immolation,June 2022,Vladimir Vladimirovich Maltsev,Andrei Yurievich Yudanov,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Superstitions can be defined as the “objectively false beliefs individuals hold”. Often, these objectively false beliefs can “improve social cooperation and productivity” (Leeson 2012a, pp. 185–186). With the use of rational choice theory framework, it can be shown that these non-scientific views tackle problems of cooperation and governance in the absence of better institutional alternatives. The research paradigm on “law and economics of superstition” was developed in full detail by Peter Leeson. His papers on ordeals (Leeson 2012c), oracles (Leeson 2014b), gypsies (Leeson 2013a), monastic malediction (Leeson 2012b) and vermin trials (Leeson 2013b) provide examples of how superstitions can promote self-governance and lead to efficient socio-economic outcomes. Leeson demonstrates that even in situations where conventional means of securing cooperation and minimizing conflict are absent, individuals unleash their creativity to fill in the corresponding institutional void. In particular, one paper by Leeson (2014a) develops a theory of rational human sacrifice through immolation. In the article, Leeson studies the Konds of Orissa in India and reasons that immolation-based sacrifices minimized conflict in their society by destroying property and making it less beneficial to engage in intergroup plunder. Our paper also seeks to examine the rational use of immolations and superstitions, but from a different angle. Through the examination of Russian history, we advance a hypothesis that superstitions and self-immolations were once used to minimize costs of a bloody civil conflict in the country. The conflict began due to the schism (raskol) in the Russian Church in the second half of the XVII century, when the populace of the country was divided in two. One part agreed with the Church reforms instituted by patriarch Nikon, the other condemned the reforms and refused to adopt the new rituals. The latter part of the populace was labelled as “Old Believers” (Zenkovsky 1963, p. 40). During this period, the Russian State relied heavily on the Church to legitimize its rule. By refusing to adhere to the new tenets of the faith, the Old Believers put themselves under the state of anarchy vis-à-vis the Russian State. The State deployed troops against the Old Believer villages and monasteries to apprehend, torture and publicly execute the rebels by burning them at stake if they refused to recant (Zenkovsky 1957). Some Old Believers responded to State persecution by self-immolation suicide (gar), baptizing themselves in fire. During gar, the Old Believers “locked themselves up [in a house]” and “perished together by setting fire to the building” (Robbins 2000, p. 213). We investigate the possibility that some of these immolations were staged to avoid conflict through the crafty use of superstition. Historically, the mainstream Orthodox Church promulgated the belief that people who committed suicide shunned themselves from God, and as a result, had to be buried in remote locations and forgotten (Paperno 1997). We claim that this superstition was employed to minimize the costs of the civil conflict. In our suggested framework, Old Believers invoked this suicide condemning superstition through the performance of a staged self-immolation. This turned their burnt villages into gravesites to deter a thorough investigation and subsequent chase through the fear of desecrating a burial location. At the same time, the superstition also incentivized the names of the Old Believers to be forgotten and erased from state census records, which prevented further persecutions. The State troops also utilized the superstition to prevent spending resources on investigation, capture, transportation and public execution of the Old Believers. Giving chase to the Old Believers was extremely costly as they used diverse locational mechanisms of state avoidance. At the same time, the Russian state was still recovering from the Time of Troubles and was engaged in various wars, which meant that manpower could not be wasted on pursuing the Old Believers through vast expanses of difficult terrain. Superstition provided the Russian army with an excuse for not pursuing the heretics at the threat of desecrating a gravesite. They could leave the charred remains of a burnt village, report a formal case of suicide and be deployed to more urgent needs. Thus, the superstition, initially devised for an absolutely different purpose, allowed these two groups to significantly minimize losses from the conflict. The theoretical framework utilized for our analysis is decidedly economic. We draw heavily on existing research of superstitions by Peter Leeson (2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2013a, 2013b, 2014a, 2014b). Works by James C. Scott (2009) and Stringham and Miles (2012) provide additional elaboration on the mechanisms of state resistance utilized by the Old Believers. The empirical side of the paper is founded on numerous scholarly works that tackle the history of the Russian schism, self-immolations and the conflict between the new and the old in Russian Christian faith. Works by Pulkin (2013), Sapozhnikov (1891) and Merezhkovskiy (2018) provide an empirical foundation to our hypothesis. Lukianov (2015) supplies a collection of data on self-immolations in the XVII century and beyond. The paper is structured as follows: the first part of the paper provides a brief historical overview of the schism and its resulting hostilities. Second part constructs a simple theoretical approach of how a suicide condemning superstition and staged self-immolations were employed to minimize conflict between the Old Believers and the State army. Part three provides further justification to our approach through historical data and tackles various points of contention to our framework. Part four concludes.",2

Their Methodenstreit, from which the Austrian side emerged the distinct winner, is well known in the literature both on the origins of Austrian economics and on the history of economic thought in general (Schumpeter 1966: 814–815, Taylor 1970: 10–11, Bostaph 1994, Herbener et al. 1998: vii, Yagi 2011: 48–58, Boettke et al. 2016: 201, 206). However, Austrians today are largely unaware that another Prussian-German Economic school is closely associated with the Austrian school, namely the school of business economics (Betriebswirtschaftslehre). Unlike the Historical school, its representatives did not reject the Austrian approach but adopted it fully, realizing how apposite it was for their own scientific subject. Thus, beginning from the early twentieth century, German business economics has derived its findings consistently from the principle of marginal utility, the subjective theory of value, and a strict methodological individualism. The field aims to provide the entrepreneur with means that support both his prospective decision making on the use of scarce resources and his retrospective analysis of how successful his past decisions on such use were. Consequently, Austrian economics and German business economics are siblings. Based on the same intellectual fundament, the former focuses on economic issues, while the attention of the latter is on the decisions of a particular individual entrepreneur. One of the most prominent founding fathers of German business economics is Eugen Schmalenbach, who comprehensively builds his opus on the ideas of the Austrian school. He and his fellow campaigners frankly admit how extensively they derived their findings from the Austrians. As Schmalenbach (1919: 334) puts it: The works of the so-called Viennese school have been of great value for us. Another major German business economist, Fritz Schmidt (1933: 106), states in a discussion also involving Friedrich A. von Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Oskar Morgenstern among others: We must not forget what in value theory we owe to our sister science. In particular, I have to admit gratefully that the value theory of the Marginal Utility school provided our practical work with the greatest support. Austrian economists were equally well aware of the seminal impact they had on German business economists. Mises (1933: 9, 1960 [2003]: 226) notes: Whoever wishes to form some idea of the importance of the theory of marginal utility has only to look at any presentation of the theory of the market in one of the current textbooks on the subject and to try separating out all the ideas contained in it that we owe to the modern subjective theory of value. Let him pick up the leading books on business management—for example, the works of Schmalenbach—and he will understand the contribution that subjectivism has made to this subject. This paper introduces Eugen Schmalenbach and his work to the contemporary Austrian scientific community and, using his oeuvre as a prominent pars pro toto, reveal the close relations between Austrian economics and German business economics. It is structured into five sections. Following an overview of Schmalenbach’s life and work in Section 2, Section 3 presents his approach to retrospective monetary calculation, that is, capital accounting. Schmalenbach was not alone in operationalizing Austrian capital accounting for entrepreneurial use in practice – prominent alternative scholars include Thomas C. Taylor and his seminal doctoral treatise Accounting Theory in the Light of Austrian Economic Analysis published in 1970 –, and we will compare others’ particular findings with those of Schmalenbach to identify similarities and differences. Section 4 serves to expound Schmalenbach’s work in the field of anticipatory monetary calculation, that is, cost accounting. We will present his general approach to appraising scarce resources based on marginal costs and marginal profit both in the field of resource allocation in vertically integrated firms and in the field of entrepreneurial investment appraisal. The paper ends with conclusions drawn in Section 5.",6

Dalton,Andrew J. Logan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The contributions of Joseph Schumpeter to economics and the social sciences remain relevant for both economists and their students. Innovation, entrepreneurship, and creative destruction are central concepts for understanding, among others, market dynamics, technological change, and economic growth and prosperity. Academics recognize Schumpeter’s contributions, as evidenced, for example, by the continued increase in annual citations to his work, which are enough to even outstrip those to John Maynard Keynes (Diamond 2009a; Dalton and Gaeto 2018). Yet innovation, entrepreneurship, and creative destruction remain undertaught (Diamond 2007; Gwartney 2012; Phipps et al. 2012). This paper describes a discussion-based course on the life and economics of Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter’s work still provides an excellent introduction to the study of innovation, entrepreneurship, and creative destruction, along with many other topics including the optimal role of government in the economy, i.e. capitalism versus socialism. We provide an overview of the course, including a syllabus (Online Appendix A.1), as well as detailed discussion about specific course content.Footnote 1 We also provide specific teaching materials for use in the course. These include source information for a recent documentary on Schumpeter, case study materials for examples of creative destruction, a list of over forty discussion questions for use in class (Online Appendix A.2), and a list of aphorisms by, or liked by, Schumpeter (Online Appendix A.3). In short, this paper covers everything necessary to prepare the course and, thus, should dramatically reduce the cost of offering a course on Schumpeter. Why teach a dedicated course on Schumpeter? First, Schumpeter’s work is rich and full of nuance. As we have argued elsewhere (Dalton and Logan 2020) in the case of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (CSD), Francis Bacon’s dictum applies: “Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested...” A full semester dedicated to unraveling Schumpeter’s work allows students to tease out the nuances, the chewing and digesting necessary to absorb the power of his ideas. As an example, the class would have sufficient context to engage in a substantive discussion about whether Schumpeter really was being satirical when discussing the feasibility of socialism in CSD, a discussion we explore in detail in the paper. In our experience of teaching the course, students express appreciation for going in depth into a particular economist’s work, something they rarely, if ever, do in other economics courses. Second, Schumpeter is especially relevant during times of technological change and disruption, such as the ongoing creative destruction in the political sphere caused by social media. Students feel a personal connection to these events, and Schumpeter’s ideas help students understand the changes taking place in society. Of course, our paper will also be of use for those looking to integrate specific topics related to Schumpeter into existing courses, such as on innovation and entrepreneurship, history of economic thought, and Austrian economics. For example, our discussion of Schumpeter’s theory of innovation and entrepreneurship or our case studies of creative destruction could easily be used as modules in another course. As the title of our paper suggests, we choose to organize our discussion of teaching and learning Schumpeter in the form of a dialogue between professor and student. Although our dialogue is fictional, it is inspired by our experience as professor and student in a real-life course on Schumpeter. The dialogue takes place before, during, and after the course. Why did we choose to write the paper as a dialogue? There are a few reasons. First, Schumpeter was one of the earliest economists to place dynamics at the center of his theories about the economy. A dialogue allows us to show how both the professor and students grow and change intellectually through teaching and learning, which is a way to mimic Schumpeter’s central insight about how growth occurs as a result of creative destruction, albeit on the intellectual front. Second, a dialogue allows us to show how the professor and students interact, including during classroom discussions, which provides a sense of what one should expect to get out of a discussion-based course on Schumpeter. It also shows how student discussion creates a synthesis to achieve an understanding of Schumpeter’s ideas. This approach emphasizes the importance of critical thinking in learning and doing economics. Third, a dialogue allows us to simultaneously convey the content of the course to instructors considering teaching Schumpeter while also creating a teaching tool. We think the dialogue itself can be read by students to get an introduction to Schumpeter’s ideas. One of the unintended consequences of structuring the course around discussion, which became apparent throughout the course, was that it forced students to engage with one another about highly contentious topics in an academic setting, e.g. capitalism versus socialism. This is a nontrivial benefit during a time of heightened political polarization and when the public square is becoming fractured through the use of social media. Although the benefits of a discussion-based course would be obvious to colleagues in the humanities, this seems worth pointing out given the emphasis on chalk-and-talk instruction in economics.Footnote 2 Moreover, economics, especially the economics contained in the classics such as those written by Schumpeter, is actually quite well suited for discussion-based courses and, thus, has much to offer students by way of preparing them to deal with contentious topics arising in the public sphere. We think showing that process of back and forth between students in the form of a dialogue is valuable to see for instructors considering a discussion-based course. Before we begin, let us make some brief remarks about the dialogue. Each section of the dialogue begins with stage notes and a statement of the main point of the section. We also make extensive use of footnotes and online appendices in the paper. Although parenthetical to the dialogue, the footnotes throughout the paper contain important information on course content which will be of use for those looking to teach their own course or integrate some of the ideas into existing courses. The same is true of the online appendices. We choose to use footnotes and online appendices so as not to interrupt the natural flow of the dialogue.",4

He was denounced by his critics as ""ignorant"", ""crazy"", ""imbecile"", a flat-earther or ignoring ""the most basic tenets of science."" (Simon, 1996). To some extent, the virulence of the critiques aimed at his work and person shows how successful Simon was as a popularizer of his ideas. But Julian Simon was more than a mere popular writer. His views, and especially his view that limits on economic growth stems from the limits of our imagination, may have provoked the ire of his opponents, but Simon's work above all is grounded in the works of ""mainline"" economists which started with the works of the Scottish enlightenment. In other words, Julian Simon's main argument relies on emphasizing the relevance of the core propositions that have been argued throughout the history of economics as a discipline (Boettke, 2007). As a mainline economist, Julian Simon emphasized the importance of institutions. He did not consider conflict -and especially conflict over resources­ as ineluctable but instead saw markets as a conflict resolution mechanism. Boettke (2007, p.8) summarizes the mainline of economics citing Lord Acton writing that ""It is not the popular movement, but the traveling of the minds of men who sit in the seat of Adam Smith that is really serious and worthy of all attention."" Julian Simon was such a mind. It's fitting that this special issue be placed into The Review of Austrian Economics. First, issue 1, volume 1 of this journal contained a note on Simon's Ultimate Resource, and its relationship to Austrian economics (Sinnett, 1987).Footnote 1 Second, although Simon avoided labeling his economic thought to avoid unnecessary conflict, correspondence with Don Boudreaux makes Simon's sympathies with Austrian economics obvious. In one of Dr. Boudreaux's letter to Simon, he makes the comment, ""if forced to label myself, I call myself a Hayekian"" (Simon, 1997a) to which Simon hand wrote in the margin, ""me too"".",
35.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,10 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-022-00570-3,"Julian Simon, the problem of socio-ecological resilience and the “ultimate resource”: a reinterpretation",September 2022,Paul Dragos Aligica,Robert Gabriel Ciobanu,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The best way to approach Julian Simon’s work on population, environment and technology is to see it as intrinsically defined by his dialogue and debate with the ideas inspiring the rise of Neo-Malthusianism in the second half of the twentieth century, as part of the “limits to growth” movement. This movement – considered by most to be initiated by the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) and fully brought to the mainstream public debate by Paul Ehrlich’s Population Bomb (1968), and the widely acclaimed The Limits to Growth (1972) report of the Club of Rome – was to become a major intellectual, social and political force in the second half of the twentieth century. Julian Simon was one of the key figures that created a critical counter-vision by reacting systematically to what he considered to be the errors of works like The Limits to Growth, Global 2000 (1980), and Beyond the Limits (1992) – works that were crucial in defining the main tenets of the neo-Malthusian revival. The Ultimate Resource (Simon 1981, 1996) and The Resourceful Earth (Simon and Kahn, 1984) were systematic responses to the questions addressed by the “limits to growth” rhetoric. By reflecting on that rhetoric and by responding to it, Simon pushed the debate to new levels: He offered not only a different interpretation to the facts used by the “limits to growth” authors to bolster their arguments, but also he started to articulate the elements of an alternative vision. The objective of our paper is to revisit one of the basic structures of the argument behind this alternative vision. The distinctive contribution of our paper to (the hefty by now) literature feeding on the decades long debate between the competing visions, will come from the fact that our reconstruction of both the “limits to growth” and of Simon’s arguments will go beyond a simple attempt to reexamine the intellectual history of the exchange between the two sides. Our reconstruction will be done in terms based on contemporary developments in the conceptualization and theorizing of the problems and phenomena under debate. More precisely, our approach pivots on the observation that the dispute could be seen as (and translated into) a dispute regarding the nature of Social Ecological Systems (SESs) and their resilience. Hence our first objective in revisiting Simon’s intellectual legacy would be to place this aspect of this legacy in the lineage of the contemporary Social Ecological Systems analysis perspective, a perspective that, at its turn, may be seen in relations with the more familiar (for economists) Comparative Economic Systems framework. In addition to arguing that the debate between the “limits to growth” vision and Julian Simon’s vision was in fact one about SES and their resilience, our second objective is to show how – once we use the SES/CES lenses – we could further elaborate on that basis a nuanced understanding of the issue of resilience. We will be thus in the position to place the distinctive contribution brought to the table by Simon in a new light, and to articulate with more precision some particular aspects of this contribution that make it indeed very special.",1
35.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,29 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-022-00571-2,The economic logic behind the ultimate resource,September 2022,Peter J. Boettke,Christopher J. Coyne,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Julian Simon was a unique intellectual. He never shied away from controversy, but he also never sought it out. Instead, he was willing to follow an argument to its logical conclusion and to examine the relevant empirical evidence with great care. He was in this respect the quintessential thinker who looked out the window at the real world to identify phenomena in need of understanding and explanation. Using economic reasoning, he offered insight into a range of pressing issues including the environment, immigration, and economic development. His study of these issues led him to believe in the power of ordinary people to create and innovate to improve not only their lives, but the lives of others. Simon’s faith in ordinary people was not a naïve faith. Instead, it was grounded in his observation that, even in the most difficult of circumstances, creative and clever human actors can use their imagination to adapt and adjust, to learn and innovate, and, in so doing, solve problems and spur progress. Progress is not the result of giving power to elites who purport to be extraordinary, but instead of empowering people to live their lives and pursue their bold conjectures about the world. Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things, Simon argued, if given the freedom to do so. The main lesson from Simon’s scholarship is that the ultimate resource does not reside under the ground (natural resources), or even in the accumulated wisdom and knowledge in books and scientific journals (human capital), but in the imagination of people. People living their lives and observing the world around them, as well as those yet born who will do the same in the future, think the unthinkable and aspire to achieve the unimaginable. Through their purposeful actions, people turn these thoughts and aspirations into a new reality that enables immense improvements in the human condition. Human progress does not require people to be superhuman to accomplish extraordinary things. The ethical and institutional conditions underpinning individual freedom, though, allow people to accomplish extraordinary things both, for themselves and their fellow human beings. Extraordinariness comes in the things we do, the opportunities we discover, the judicious decisions we make, and the judgment we exercise in weighing the opportunities we see. The process by which ordinary people are enabled to do extraordinary things is the result of contestation within a specific environment. We need diverse and varied eyes looking at problem situations, offering tentative solutions, testing those conjectures against reality, and adjusting or abandoning their vision as necessary. This process of open contestation is in operation in all our human endeavors—the arts, commerce, and science. In contrast to an environment of freedom, institutions of domination over others directs human potential in another direction, one that limits individual and societal flourishing. State institutions that seek to control human behavior through design and oversight curtail the creative powers of ordinary people who are the drivers of economic progress. State control comes in a variety of forms including command over ideas, authority over individual action and interactions between people, and efforts to design society through population control (whether in overall size or in the makeup of those who constitute society). No matter what its specifics form, where “seeing like a state” replaces “seeing like a citizen” the power of people to improve their lives, and the lives of others is restricted (Scott 1999; Boettke 2018; Aligica et al., 1999). As Matt Ridley (2020) recently stated, “Innovation is the child of freedom, and the parent of prosperity” (373). This observation by Ridley is spot on, but the causal element in that story is the ultimate resource—people. It is people, and their unlimited imaginations, that are the source of improvements in the human condition. Thus, the critical part of the story in the progress of humanity is played by ordinary individuals doing extraordinary things because their imaginations enabled them to see what others had previously not seen, and they found enough elbow room to act upon that vision.Footnote 1 In making this argument, Julian Simon articulated in a less abstract, and more empirically grounded way, the core ideas of Mises, Hayek and Kirzner regarding the discovery and use of knowledge in society, and the role of entrepreneurship as the prime mover of progress. Our purpose in this paper is to make this intellectual connection clear. Section 2 revisits the basic economics of development. Section 3 explores the interconnection between ideas, alertness, and development. Section 4 concludes with the relevance of Simon’s key insight for contemporary economics.",3
35.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,21 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-022-00582-z,How Might Econ 101 Change If Julian Simon’s “Ultimate Resource” Idea Were Incorporated into the Analysis?,September 2022,Donald J. Boudreaux,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"I remember well when, in 1986, the Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to James Buchanan. Newspapers soon thereafter were filled with commentary that can be fairly summarized: ‘Really? Buchanan won a Nobel Prize for that?’ The “that,” of course, referred to Buchanan’s insistence that people acting politically are no less self-interested than are people acting privately. Of course, Buchanan did far more than merely insist that scholars and researchers model all human action as self-interested. But even if his contribution were limited to this insistence, at the time he began to make it – the mid-twentieth century – this seemingly indisputable point about reality was in reality too often ignored. Politicians and government administrative officials were often assumed, if usually only implicitly, to be motivated fundamentally differently than are consumers and business people. That which seemed trite in 1986 was a mere 30 years earlier frequently ignored. And the reason that this idea about the universality of self-interest seemed trite in 1986 was due in good measure to Buchanan’s pressing and applying the idea decades earlier, when this ‘trite’ idea was overwhelmingly overlooked or even denied. It’s the curse of many people who successfully offer paradigm-shifting ideas to have those very ideas appear to be trite once the new paradigm becomes widely accepted. The reason, of course, is that acceptance of the paradigm entails an almost subconscious acceptance of the paradigm-shifting idea as a foundational – indeed, obvious – truth. Julian Simon’s idea of the ultimate resource has not yet shifted economists’ paradigm. This fact is unfortunate. But the idea is so filled with potential for new research and rich scholarship that I believe that such a shift might occur. In this short paper, however, I focus on three ways in which Simon’s insight might be usefully incorporated into instruction at the level of Econ 101. I do so because I am in the grip of the perhaps-heretical notion that about three-quarters of what is useful to learn in economics is learned in a skillfully taught Econ 101 course. And so getting the economics ‘right’ at this introductory level is especially important. Many Econ 101 teachers (myself included) relate, near the beginning of the course, the tale told by Leonard Read in his famous essay “I, Pencil” (Read, 1958). In this essay, Read vividly explains that the knowledge and cooperation of literally millions of people – more likely, of hundreds of millions of people – are necessary to produce even a product as mundane as the ordinary, commercial-grade pencil. This knowledge is so vast, so detailed, and so widely dispersed across the globe that no human being or committee of human beings could ever hope to possess it whole. And, as is obvious to even college freshmen, what holds true here for a pencil holds true with greater weight for much more complicated goods such as automobiles, smartphones, and modern housing. Another implication of “I, Pencil” is thus easy to convey: If prosperity is to continue, there is no alternative to relying on the decentralized decision-making and actions of countless specialists operating within the rules of private property and guided by prices set on competitive markets. Only the free markets and its accompanying price system (Hayek 1945) elicit all the knowledge necessary to produce the goods and services that we take for granted in modern society. The importance of the “I, Pencil” thesis – both its content and its ability to grab students’ attention – cannot be overstated. But a Simon perspective reveals an even deeper point. While “I, Pencil” highlights the necessity of relying on countless individual specialists to contribute their unique slivers of knowledge to the production process, the essay begins in midstream. All the tasks required to produce pencils already exist. For example, the necessity of exploring for graphite has been figured out, as have the precise methods for carrying out this exploration. All that’s required is that people who specialize in such exploration be motivated to perform the task. The same is true for each of the millions of other tasks required for making pencils—felling cedar trees; transporting the wood and other inputs to the pencil factory; insuring the factory against fire and theft; operating the machine that produces erasers; finding the dyes to color the paint that will coat the pencils; and on and on and on. Yet each of these productive steps began as a creative spark in someone’s mind. Even the step that seems to us today to be most banal (perhaps making the casing out of wood) required someone, at some time in the past, to see for the first time in human history that wood is useful for human needs. “Seeing” this possibility was an instance of human creativity. This creative person figured out for the first time that a tree is useful if felled and cut into functional pieces. This person turned wood from mere matter into a natural resource. The identity of this great benefactor of humankind is lost in the mists of history. Perhaps if he or she had not had that creative insight, someone else only one hour later would have had it. Or perhaps not. Humans aren’t born with the a priori knowledge that trees can supply useful products. Perhaps this creative insight would never have otherwise happened. Or perhaps it would have happened, but only centuries later than it actually did. We don’t know. All we do know is that it did happen, that we are today still benefiting from this occurrence, and that it was indeed a creative spark. Nor are humans born with the a priori knowledge of how to chop trees down. To fell trees requires the use of a tool that originated as someone’s creative idea. As obvious as is an ax to us today, there was a time in our history when the very idea of an ax had yet to occur to anyone. Someone, somewhere, at some time first conceived of an ax. Without human creativity, axes would never exist. The same truth holds for all the pieces of a pencil and for each of the innumerable tasks necessary to produce them. Each pencil represents more than just the vast knowledge distributed among countless individuals. Each pencil represents countless individuals’ creativity. No matter how simple any one of these tasks or features of a pencil might seem to us today, there was a time when no one had thought of its possibility or of practical means of achieving it. Making marks with graphite; mixing graphite with clay; refining petroleum or linseed oil so that it serves as the base of enamel paint; fastening an eraser to the pencil shaft; producing an electrolysis machine that transforms bauxite and myriad other raw materials into aluminum that can be molded into the ferrule that fastens the eraser to the pencil shaft; making the pencil shaft octagonal so that it’s comfortable to use but will not roll off a table – the list of creative insights represented by even the quotidian pencil is endless. In my Econ 101 course, even before I get to “I, Pencil,” I offer a brief history of human living standards. I want students to be not only aware, but also in awe, of how incredibly prosperous they are compared to any of their pre-industrial-age ancestors. Explaining what the economist Deirdre McCloskey (2010, 2016) calls “the Great Enrichment” – or what the historian Stephen Davies (2019) calls “the wealth explosion” – is inarguably among the most important tasks of economic scholarship. Not insignificant is the fact that modern economics began with Smith (1776) inquiring into the causes of the wealth of nations. Describing modernity’s immense material prosperity from a Simon perspective reveals that it is at every turn the result of an ongoing orgy of innovation – of human creativity devising new goods and services and new methods of production, distribution, marketing, and financing. Simon’s perspective dovetails very nicely here with McCloskey’s thesis that the industrial revolution began because popular attitudes toward innovation became more favorable. These attitudes prompted people not only to accept innovation, but to regard economic innovators as being honorable. And so when, as is common in all Econ 101 courses, economic growth is depicted by shifting the production-possibilities curve rightward, innovation must become a more central part of the account of this shift. This shift is caused by more than capital accumulation, exogenous improvements in technology, and exogenous discoveries of new sources of natural resources. Instead, the ingenuity of human minds creates new techniques of production as well as new resources out of raw materials that in the past were economically useless, thus pushing the production-possibilities curve outward. Unlike in the standard textbook account, new resources are not simply discovered; new resources are created. Likewise, new technologies don’t just happen. They are the natural result – a result that is endogenous to the market process – of countless ultimate resources operating in a culture that dignifies innovators, that tests their ideas against each other in competitive markets, and that rewards innovative efforts largely in proportion to how valuable are their fruits to fellow human beings.Footnote 1 Another familiar exercise in Econ 101 courses is to distinguish changes in supply from changes in quantity supplied. Econ 101 students are taught that a change in the price of some good causes only a change in the quantity supplied of that good and not a change in the supply of that good. Put differently, a change in the price of, say, oranges never causes the supply curve of oranges to shift position; it causes only a movement along a given supply curve of oranges. We economists insist on this distinction – including an identical one between changes in demand and changes in quantity demanded – for good reason. Treating as exogenous most forces that affect prices is necessary to gain an analytically clear focus on the few forces that our judgment tells us are inseparable from that process. Conventionally, production technology is one such exogenous force. Supply curves are drawn on the assumption of given (i.e., “exogenous”) production technologies. If new and better technologies are discovered or learned, the result is an increase in supply, depicted by a rightward shift of the supply curve. Simon’s perspective suggests that, unlike in conventional analysis, production technology be treated as a variable endogenous to the market’s price-setting process. Rising prices for goods and services, at least when these higher prices are perceived as being more than temporary results of fleeting phenomena, do more than incite suppliers to turn to known but hitherto unprofitable production technologies. Instead, suppliers are incited by these higher prices to creatively search for new technologies. Here’s Simon’s summary of the process (Simon, 1996: 12): Greater consumption due to an increase in population and growth of income heightens scarcity and induces price run-ups. A higher price represents an opportunity that leads inventors and businesspeople to seek new ways to satisfy the shortages. Some fail, at cost to themselves. A few succeed, and the final result is that we end up better off than if the original shortage problem had never arisen. If we take Simon’s economics seriously, it follows that when we draw supply curves, production technology should not be treated as an exogenous variable that shifts the curve. Production technology instead is an endogenous market force that is among the central reasons higher prices call forth higher quantities supplied. The implications of this endogeneity of technological improvement to price changes include the following reality that most economists are likely to find to be pedagogically uncomfortable: Increases in the price of a good, by calling forth discoveries of new techniques of production, cause the conventional supply curve itself to shift outward. Consider Fig. 1. Let the initial price be PE1, and then let demand rise from D1 to D2. The true supply curve, at least from the perspective of Simon, is SJS. The new equilibrium price is PE2. Note that if demand were to fall back to D1, the equilibrium price would fall to PE3 – a price lower than the initial equilibrium price of PE1. The reason is that technology, once discovered, is typically not lost. The new supply curve is, thus, α2E2SJS With the assumptions under which a conventional supply curve is drawn – as shown by Sv1 – the rise in demand would raise the equilibrium price from PE1 to PEv. This price increase – larger than the one shown along the “Julian Simon” supply curve SJS – is what would occur were the rise in demand to call forth no new technology breakthroughs. But because such breakthroughs are so common as to be endogenous to the market process, the conventional supply curve does not tell the whole story. Here’s a breakdown of the steps in the process from a Simon perspective: There’s an exogenous increase in demand from D1 to D2. The equilibrium price rises initially from PE1 to PEv. This increase in quantity supplied results from no new technological breakthroughs. The higher price incites innovators into action. Innovative breakthroughs cause supply, as conventionally reckoned, to increase from Sv1 to Sv2. More generally, the Julian Simon supply curve is kinked; it’s more elastic above the kink than it is below the kink. That is, the Julian Simon supply curve is less elastic for price decreases than it is for price increases. Further, the point at which it is kinked occurs at higher and higher quantities as new techniques of production and distribution are endogenously developed in response to rising prices. As shown in Fig. 1, the original Julian Simon supply curve is α1E1SJS. The increase in demand changed the curve to α2E2SJS. Any further demand-induced increases in prices deemed by entrepreneurs to be more than transitory will shift the kink further and further to the right. Even among Econ 101 teachers who find the Julian Simon perspective compelling there will be many who choose not to use the Julian Simon supply curve described here. This curve is pedagogically more complex than is the conventional supply curve. And there is something solid to be said for keeping pedagogical models as simple as possible. But if, as Simon theorized, rising prices regularly do incite many ultimate resources into innovative activity, and if this activity is indeed central to the competitive market process, then economics teachers who purchase pedagogical simplicity with the conventional, straight-line supply curve will do so at the price of missing a key part of the competitive market process.",1

Candela,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Julian Simon self-identified as an unconventional economist (Simon, 2002). His unconventionality rested on his appreciation of long-run economic growth based on the “ultimate resource”, which is “people – skilled, spirited, hopeful people – who will exert their wills and imaginations for their own benefit as well as in a spirit of faith and social concern” (1981 [1996], p. xxxviii). The optimism that Simon holds with regard to the future of economic progress rests on “taking a long view backwards so that we can see the continuity of the trends” (Simon, 1981 [1996], p. 585). Notwithstanding his own autobiographical characterization, Simon also remarks the following about himself: “I think of myself in the great economic tradition of Hume, Smith, Menger, and Hayek” (Simon, 2002, p. 331). Thus, following Simon’s own approach, if we take the long-run view of the history of economic thought, Simon’s ideas about economic growth and its consequences are far more conventional than otherwise perceived, representing a continuity in the mainline of economics.Footnote 1 In its simplest rendition, Julian Simon’s main thesis in The Ultimate Resources is that economic growth is correlated with population growth. Though not incorrect, this oversimplification of Simon’s main thesis does not do full justice to the subtlety and richness of The Ultimate Resource, particularly the inspiration that Simon took from the mainline of economic thought going back to Adam Smith. This being said, in what particular way is Julian Simon situated in the mainline of economic thought? The purpose of this paper is to address this motivating question by developing an implicit and underappreciated relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth in The Ultimate Resource (1981). Combining the insights of F.A. Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Adam Smith, I argue that Julian Simon’s theory of economic development sits firmly in the mainline of economic thought, rooted in the concept that he appropriately refers to as “economies of scope.”Footnote 2 This concept is analogous to Smith’s notion that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market, the expansion of which, according to Simon, is predicated on entrepreneurial discovery. If the institutional foundation of a market is based on the expected ability to exchange, otherwise known as private property, then expansions in the scope of exchange are predicated on entrepreneurial discovery of opportunities to remove existing barriers to trade. Such entrepreneurial discovery is manifested in the erosion of transaction costs associated with delineating, dividing, and (re)combining existing property rights over goods and services. “And thus the certainty of being able to exchange,” Smith writes, that “encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or genius he may possess for that particular species of business” (emphasis added; Smith, 1776 [1981], p. 28). Greater residual claimancy resulting from more secure ownership, in turn, allows for individuals to specialize their acquisition of knowledge and be alert to opportunities to which they would otherwise be precluded in the absence of residual claimancy, resulting in a division of labor. Thus, the erosion of such transaction costsFootnote 3 via entrepreneurial discovery unleashes increasing gains from trade in the form of future entrepreneurial discoveries that would otherwise not be realized. The entrepreneurial insight that Simon adds to the concept of “economies of scope” goes as follows: “Discoveries, like resources, may well be infinite: the more we discover, the more we are able to discover” (emphasis original; Simon, 1981 [1996], p. 82). For example, the introduction of containerization in the 1950s increased the scope of international exchange, and consequently, allowed for increasing returns to finer-grained specialization by fragmenting the production of intermediate components of goods for final output into an international division of labor (Candela et al., 2020; see also Irwin, 2015, p. 18). However, containerization was the result of an entrepreneurial discovery by Malcolm McLean, whose innovation was a result of reshuffling existing technology and resources in intermodal transport, but in a manner that reduced transactions costs associated with defining, enforcing, and exchanging property rights over goods and services. Thus, economic growth is not predicated on increasing returns to scale from finer-grained specialization in a particular productive activity, per se, since all productive processes inevitably face diminishing returns within a given size of a market. Rather, it is based on increasing returns from transaction-cost reducing discoveries, from which new institutional as well as organizational arrangements emerge to extend the scope of exchange and productive specialization, the by-product of which is finer-grained specialization.Footnote 4 Understood in this way, Simon’s rich understanding of economies of scope draws together insights from Smith, Hayek, and Mises to explain the correlation between population growth and economic growth. Increases in the division of labor based on population growth is limited only by the extent of the human mind, and the rules of property that emerge to harness the creative powers of individuals and their collective stock of dispersed, tacit, and inarticulate knowledge. Understood this way, the infinite bound of natural resources, based on a Smithian division of labor, is predicated on a Hayekian division of knowledge. This, in turn, is inherently predicated on a division of private property rights as emphasized by Mises, the exchange of which provides the institutional context for entrepreneurial discovery itself. Reframed in terms of Simon’s concept of “economies of scope,” population growth is understood to be a proximate cause of economic growth, and therefore a by-product of a more fundamental institutional foundation: an ever-increasing scope in the ability of individuals to exchange goods and services. This paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, I explain the concept of economies of scope, tracing its mainline roots back from Adam Smith. The main contribution of this section is to the more recent literature on increasing returns (Acemoglu, 1996; Romer, 1986, 1987), which is related, though distinct from, Simon’s economies of scope that is rooted in Smith and other mainline economists. I juxtapose Simon’s mainline understanding of this concept from a more mainstream interpretation of this concept based on general competitive equilibrium, the latter of which rules out both the institutional and entrepreneurial basis for economies of scope. In Sect. 3, I contribute to the recent literature in Austrian economics on the relationship between institutions, entrepreneurship and economic growth (Benson, 2015; Boettke & Candela, 2017; Boettke & Coyne, 2003; Burns & Fuller, 2020; Coyne & Leeson, 2004; Holcombe, 1998; Leeson & Boettke, 2009; Manne, 2014; Redford, 2020), particularly by illustrating how Simon’s rendition of economies of scope encapsulates the insights of Mises, Hayek and Kirzner as they pertain to economic development. My contribution, in particular, parallels that of Henry Manne (emphasis original; 2014, p. 253), who emphasized the role of the entrepreneur in “recognizing a distinctive kind of productive input – in which one can have some form of property right – not generally considered in the neoclassical market model.” Following this insight, I build on Leeson and Boettke’s notion of two-tiered entrepreneurship (2009), illustrating Simon’s “economies of scope” by drawing from two historical case studies: (1) the discovery of double-entry booking, which contributed to increasing the scope of international commerce beginning in medieval Europe; and (2) the discovery and evolution of private property rights after 1978 in China, unleashing China’s march from socialism to the market. In each case, entrepreneurial discovery, motivated by the lure or profit (and disciplined by potential loss), unintendedly generated an institutional change. Such institutional change, in turn, unlocked potential gains from trade by eroding the transaction costs associated with defining and enforcing property rights, which in turn facilitated more accurate calculation of the relative scarcity of scarce resources through relative pricing.Footnote 5 Such massive economies of scope that were generated by such institutional entrepreneurship allowed for the increases in human population and natural resources that would follow. Section 4 concludes with implications for future research.",2

Julian Simon and Institutions,September 2022,Vincent Geloso,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Julian Simon was an exceptional economist. He was prolific and wrote on a wide-ranging number of subjects. His work was admired by many. Nobelist Friedrich Hayek wrote him an excited letter following the publication of Simon’s Economics of Population Growth (1977) stating that he had “never before written a fan letter to a professional colleague” but that the book had empirically confirmed what had been “a life-time of theoretical speculation” and he felt compelled to share his excitement with Simon (Simon 1996, p. 614). Milton Friedman threw cold water of a point of price theory made by Simon arguing that if he was right, firms would have already done it. Friedman, no novice with regards to price theory, was proven wrong and he publicly relayed that Simon had been correct (Simon 1996, n.p). When Simon died in 1998, the New York Times deemed him important enough to commission a full article that profiled his accomplishments. Few economists would dream of Simon’s popularity. Yet, Simon remains tragically underappreciated. Ironically, he is underappreciated because his main achievement – the infamous wager between himself and biologist Paul Ehrlich – eclipsed everything else. During the 1960 and 1970 s, environmental awareness was increasing, and numerous scares were advanced. The bulk of the scares concerned resource exhaustion of all types: non-renewable energies would run out; metals would become too scarce for the needs of industrial society, the food supply would be outstripped by population growth etc. Simon attempted to rebut many of those individually. His claim was simple enough: more people meant more ideas and more ideas more innovations which would end up stimulating economic growth and lead to improvements in environmental indicators. However, Simon’s initial attempts yielded few concrete results. It was only when Simon essentially taunted the main doomsayer of the time, Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich, to accept a wager with him that his views gained traction. “Ehrlich would choose a $1,000 basket of raw materials that he expected to become less abundant” over the next ten years (Pooley and Tupy 2020, p. 278). If the inflation-adjusted prices ended up being higher than $1,000, then the resources would have become less abundant, and Simon would lose. Otherwise, Simon would win. The price difference would determine the sum to be paid. Over the period from 1980 to 1990, the price of the five resources picked (copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten) ended up falling 36% (Pooley and Tupy 2020, p. 278). Simon won and Ehrlich sent him a cheque.Footnote 1 The outcome of the bet became symbolic of two visions of the world: the dystopian (or Neo-Malthusian) world of the doomsayers and the cornucopian one of Simon and his acolytes.Footnote 2 The bet was even co-opted by people outside academia (Sabin 2013) as conservatives ended up using the bet’s outcome as a talking point against what they deemed to be their ecologist adversaries. The politicization of the bet’s outcome also meant that it became a benchmark to be cleared. Indeed, if one could prove that Simon would have been wrong most of the time, then he was just lucky (Kiel and Matheson 2010). Assigning the outcome to luck would thus revalidate Ehrlich’s viewpoint.Footnote 3 Others pointed to the fact that, in the 1990s, Ehrlich proposed a second bet focusing on broader measures of environmental quality (e.g., carbon dioxide levels, global temperatures, and fish populations) which Simon refused. This is taken by some to be an indication that Simon’s views are not all that strong or well-substantiated (Sabin 2013). The bet’s outcome essentially became all that Julian Simon was turned into a strawman. This, I argue, is a grave error in need of correction. Scholars are best assessed when one considered the different scholarly conversations in which they were engaged during their lifetime (Boettke 2018). The only conversation in which Simon was engaged that is remembered is that of the Cornucopians versus Doomsayers. Yet, Simon was engaged in multiple conversations about economic growth, demographics and institutions. While separate, these conversations did overlap in content with the one Simon is remembered for having participated in. Investigating Simon’s contribution to these conversations show him to hold rich views of economic history, the role of institutions and the interplay between economic growth and environmental indicators. These views have not been exploited to their full potential. In this paper, I first highlight Simon’s insights in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, I discuss how they can relate to debates on the state of the environment. In Sect. 4, I show that Simon’s insights apply to modern environmental debates such as climate change (and others).",2
35.0,3.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,15 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-022-00580-1,Economists versus engineers: Two approaches to environmental problems,September 2022,Peter Jacobsen,Louis Rouanet,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Julian Simon was among the first to confront environmentalists both on empirical and conceptual and theoretical grounds. On empirical grounds, he showed that predictions made by environmentalists were, time and time again, wrong. On conceptual and theoretical grounds, he tried to force them to recognize that the pessimistic view with respect to the environment presupposed omitting the most crucial resource humans have and develop: ingenuity. Despite the obvious success of Simon’s case, many remain unconvinced. In a 2009 interview, Julian Simon’s long time rival, Paul Paul R. Ehrlich (2009), argued that The Population Bomb, in which he predicted irremediable mass starvation in the 1970’s “was a ridiculously optimistic book.” In 2017, in another interview, Paul R. Ehrlich (2017) claimed that “Everywhere we look, things are moving rapidly in the wrong direction. More rapidly than the scientific community originally expected. […] [Our] society is doomed.” To many, natural resources will necessarily run out, population growth will lead to lower living standards, climate change will doom humans to worst living conditions and biodiversity will decline as economic growth continues. To some, degrowth is “an inevitable hypothesis,” (Kallis, 2011) and to others, growth must be made “sustainable” through extensive government involvement in the economy or by limiting economic growth. In this paper, we argue that there are two distinct and irreconcilable ways to think about environmental problems. The first, the engineering approach, is more intuitive to most people and focuses on how limited material inputs translate into limited output. The second, the economic approach, is the most useful approach, but it is not intuitive to the layman. The economic approach focuses on how humans adapt and try to coordinate with each other in a changing world. The engineer assumes a given menu of choice which must be optimally managed. Economists, on the other hand, recognize that there are multiple potential menus of choices faced by individuals, and they will change in the face of new challenges. At first, the difference between engineering and economics may seem obvious: economics deals with individual choice while engineering does not. Yet once a given production function with given technologies and a given utility function are postulated, finding the optimal allocation of resources is no different from the engineer trying to optimize the output of a machine under given parameters and inputs. When all possible rates of technical substitution and preferences are known, coordinating economic activity to maximize utility becomes a trivial task. Economics, however, is not about finding a hypothetical optimal allocation of existing resources. Economics is about analyzing how individuals coordinate their plans with each other and change their environment to foster their own, varied ends.Footnote 1 The importance of focus on adaptation rather than simply allocation was observed by Julian L. Simon (1989b, 472): Crusoe certainly had an economic problem in the sense that the production of goods and services- mainly from natural resources found in a natural state- was of extreme importance to him. But contrary to the portrayal in elementary economic texts, Crusoe did not primarily occupy himself with allocating scarce resources among various competing means to his ends. To be sure, he did make some important allocation decisions. But most of his thought went into the creation and adaptation of technology. The key point is that trade-offs –or rates of substitution– are not given to agents operating in a complex economy. More specifically, they are not invariant to either the natural or the institutional environment within which agents operate. We do not know today what the “marginal rate of substitution” will be between two inputs ten years from now because the future involves adaptation to changing conditions. We do not know what consumer preferences will be in the future because new goods will be invented. Global warming will, for instance, induce entrepreneurs to find not yet known or identified, ways to deal with higher temperatures. More efficient air-conditioning will be created, entrepreneurs will innovate by building more energy efficient construction materials, technologies will be developed to make moving inland cheaper, seeds will be developed to enable crops to resist higher temperatures, etc. Population growth will give extra incentives for entrepreneurs to find new factors of production complementary to labor and thereby make it more productive. The fall in the existing supply of fossil fuel will give extra incentives to find substitutes to fossil fuel and fuel-economizing technologies. Adaptation to new environmental conditions is hard to imagine and predict, especially in the presence of Knightian uncertainty. If it wasn’t, the innovations resulting from them would already be known and would not really be innovations in the first place. Assuming that adaptation will not happen because it is hard to conceptualize precisely what it will be, however, is more unrealistic than providing a convincing explanation of the conditions under which innovation occurs. Analyzing environmental problems requires that both the visible effects and the effects which cannot be directly foreseen be taken into account. Economists are uniquely able to analyze the development of new innovations because they can analyze the incentives pushing humans to innovate without specific and detailed knowledge about the content of each future innovation. The assumption behind environmental pessimism is that adaptation –i.e. substitution of our current productive and consumptive activities by other means mitigating the cost of environmental problems– is difficult and severely limited. This assumption, as we will explain in further detail, has empirical implications which should manifest themselves in the data. If the environmentalists are right, the relative price of natural resources should increase, the share of output used to pay for natural resources should increase and wages should decrease. The data, however, gives credence to the economic approach focusing on the prevalence of adaptation and substitution. The engineering way of thinking about environmental problems is not simply broken conceptually but empirically dubious.",2

Piano,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"“The family may fairly be considered, one would think, an ultimate human institution. Every one would admit that it has been the main cell and central unit of almost all societies hitherto, except, indeed, such societies as that of Lacedaemon, which went in for ‘efficiency,’ and has, therefore, perished...” –G.K. Chesterton Since Bastiat, economists have prided themselves on seeing the “unseen” forces which shape and guide society. This goal, however, is hampered when there are trade barriers within the discipline. The “unseen” which family economics tries to bring to light – exchange within the family – and the “unseen” investigated by public choice – exchange within the state – too often run parallel to one another. A coherent theory of family policy is missing. Anyone can see that these two institutions have an important relationship. State revenues depend on the productivity of families as well as firms. Mandatory spending – in areas tradi- tionally in the purview of families like elderly care and children’s education – amounted to 12.9% of United States GDP in 2019 (CBO). Courts have increasingly defined and regulated familial relationships, a phenomenon Brinig (2000) refers to as the lifting of the “marital veil.” Recent work documents significant “Kuznets facts” for the family throughout the stages of economic development (Greenwood et al., 2021). Still, the relationship between families and states is not well understood. This paper does not offer a complete theory of family policy, but it does suggest a way to begin: an increase in trade between the fields of public choice and family economics. As it stands, much of the work on family policy fails to take public choice insights – such as the potential for unintended consequences, knowledge and incentive problems, and the role of special interests – into account. The canonical textbook that introduces students to the field of public choice, Public Choice III (Mueller, 2003), does not contain an entry for the term “family.” There are, of course, notable exceptions. Foremost amongst them is the work of Julian Simon on population growth. Building upon many of Simon’s insights, I work towards a theory of family policy by focusing on three principles: 1) families produce people, 2) people produce ideas, and 3) familial production occurs privately. State actors exhibit an interest in family policy because their revenues are impacted by population growth and the growth of ideas, though their interests may diverge from family members because of the third principle. I test this approach by applying it to three patterns in family policy: A fertility gap exists across most countries today, indicating that couples are not able to complete their fertility plans. Family policy has historically been very successful at lowering fertility rates, but largely unsuccessful at increasing them. Central planners of economic life tend to be central planners of family life as well. I find that considering the public choice aspects of family policy can help explain these patterns, and hopefully, caution against future proposals for public intervention in family life. As Gary Becker is recognized for his foundational research in family economics, Julian Simon deserves recognition for his work on family and population policy.Footnote 1 I count it as no co- incidence that Simon naturally incorporated public choice insights in his approach to family and population policy, since he was a scholar in the mainline tradition of economics. Because of his lifetime work, those wishing to understand the complex relationship between the family and the state can now look to an example.",2

Hayek’s (1988, 76) famous quote in the Fatal Conceit bears repeating here as we think about our role as economists. “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naïve mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions, and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of an overall order.” It’s curious precisely because it is diametrically opposed to the modern and mainstream teaching of economics. Economics is not engineering; a thriving economy is not the product of someone’s imagination that can be brought to life through technocratic planning. Our task is curious because it’s not the task that people assume economists are here to fulfill, but this is an opportunity for Austrians to change the conversation. We cannot be the scholars we strive to be today without standing on the shoulders of the ones who taught us. The hope for the advancement of the discipline of Austrian economics is that we brazenly and persistently take up the mantle laid before us and become expert practitioners both in our scholarship and in our teaching. The future of the Austrian research program depends upon this as does the broader liberal project which advances human agency within the context of human flourishing. All of this requires free people and adaptive institutions. The events of the past two years remind us that we have much to accomplish. The battle of ideas is far from over. We can even conclude that some American citizens in times of crisis, like attitudes in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the Great Recession, willingly embrace what they view to be “temporary” tyranny in the name of the greater good. Worse, perhaps they don’t view lockdowns, bailouts, business closures, unsustainable expansive monetary policy and stimulus spending, the curtailing of civil liberties, travel, and migration restrictions as tyrannical. We have much to do. Two weeks ago, we celebrated the anniversary of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. A symbol of tyranny and oppression—a wall designed to keep people in, so they were easier to control and manipulate. Perhaps some believed that we could rest easy, that the battle of ideas had been won. We hoped that people understood that freedom, property, and entrepreneurship are the seeds of economic growth and wealth accumulation and that they would fight for those freedoms both culturally and politically. Those who believed that were incorrect; and the free society project which advocates an economic and political liberal cosmopolitanism is in jeopardy as it will always be unless we persistently push back the notion that the institutions of coercive government can save us. In his cogent lecture The Battle of Ideas: Economics and the Better World, Peter Boettke (2007), one of the leading contemporary Austrian thinkers and a mentor to many in this room urges us as economists to realize and live into our true task. We are lowly philosophers rather than high priests; we are students of the world, not its planners. He also rightly urges us to view the state, at best, as a referee, not a player who can move chessmen around at will and achieve desired outcomes and cure crises. These are not ideological arguments; they are economic arguments and have the persuasive power to help us understand how to get a better world. This lecture is required reading in every course I teach. Moreover, much of the struggle for liberal cosmopolitanism comes from either complete ignorance or misunderstanding of the economic way of thinking. We cannot ever quelch human error, greed, or malicious behavior. What we can do is embrace and understand the economic way of thinking and advance it on every margin possible within our scholarship, our op-eds, blog posts, Facebook posts, Twitter exchanges, radio interviews, public lectures, and within the classroom. May we never waste an opportunity to do this well. If we mismanage these, they become distractions from our good work, if managed well they become a powerful force for extending the conversation and inviting people into the beautiful world of economics. If we view it as our life’s work to advance a proper understanding of the economic way of thinking, then we will have done all we can for liberal cosmopolitanism and the free society project. And it will matter, it can turn the tide. As Pete demonstrates to us in his powerful lecture, this is the struggle for a better world. So let us never view it as just another paper, just another revise and resubmit, just another rejection, just another talk, just another student meeting. Rather let us view the minutia of our careers as opportunities. It will always be a struggle, and we must view our role in that struggle as significant. I have the privilege, I think, to have an unorthodox career. Paul Heyne, Peter Boettke, and Tony Carilli, among others, have encouraged us to teach each economics class as if it’s the last one our students will ever take. In both settings where I have the privilege to teach, I am most often teaching the only and last economics class students will ever take. At The Fund for American Studies (TFAS), each semester I am greeted by a classroom full of students, in some cases over one hundred, and perhaps ten percent of them are economics majors and perhaps one percent of them understand, coming into the course, the economic way of thinking. Through TFAS they come to Washington DC excited for internships at think tanks, journalism outlets, and on Capitol Hill. They come with passion, but they aren’t equipped with the intellectual tools that will allow them to apply that passion to make the world a better place. The students each of us teach, just like many citizens, view policy as the solution to all that ails us, and they don’t understand that economics is the foundation for thinking about life’s problems. It is incumbent upon us to convince our students that the economic way of thinking is necessary for their cause. We all face similar challenges regarding the ideological priors our students bring to the classroom. Some are openly hostile to free markets, and some are enthusiastic about free markets, but most haven’t considered markets as a resource allocation mechanism against the alternatives. Like most people, our students have learned to think about these questions in purely political or ideological contexts. Many are suspicious that free markets can coexist with the democratic institutions they deeply desire. We may have only one course to open their eyes to our approach. No matter the class, whether it is focused on foreign policy, international trade, or public policy-which many students are enthusiastic about, I must offer them insights into what the forerunners in Austrian economics discovered and which we continue to pursue both in theory and practice. The immutable truths of human nature must be the starting point for economists. They remain true regardless of one’s gender, race, country of birth, place in history, or wealth. Ludwig von Mises (1949) in Human Action his magnum opus uses Part One as an exegetical approach to understanding the human condition. For Mises this is a prerequisite to understanding the market, interest rates, prices, credit and trade, the requirements for economic calculation, taxation, welfare, etc. The broader context of catallactics cannot be understood without first understanding acting man. Mises (1998:234–235) states: “The subject matter of catallactics is all market phenomena with all their roots, ramifications, and consequences.” He goes on to say: “Economics is mainly concerned with the analysis of the determination of money prices of goods and services exchanged on the market. To accomplish this task, it must start from a comprehensive theory of human action. Moreover, it must study not only the market phenomena, but no less the hypothetical conduct of an isolated man of a socialist community.” Starting with the immutable truths of acting man requires that we understand human nature and take it as given. Without it, we are led directly into scientism by assuming that human nature is fungible and can change to conform to the desires of bureaucrats and lawmakers. But human nature is what it is. Boettke (2006, 12) addresses Smith’s system of “natural liberty” and the requisite institutional backdrop for flourishing to succeed. This system of natural liberty requires a reconciliation of the capacity for human creativity, the ubiquitousness of self-interest, and the reality of human error and finitude. Later in a stunning passage in which Peter Boettke (2006, 13) reflects on F.A. Hayek (1948), who reflects on the Adam Smith project we read the following: “The intellectual projects of Hume and Smith were to discover, through analytical inquiry and historical investigation, the institutional environment that could produce peace and prosperity despite the foibles of man. FA Hayek summed up the Smith project as follows: ‘[T]he main point about which there can be little doubt is that Smith’s chief concern was not so much with what man might occasionally achieve when he was at his best but that he should have as little opportunity as possible to do harm when he was at his worst. It would scarcely be too much to claim that the main merit of the individualism which he and his contemporaries advocated is that it is a system under which bad men can do least harm. It is a social system which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it, or on all men becoming better than they now are, but which makes use of men in all their given variety and complexity, sometimes good and sometimes bad, sometimes intelligent and more often stupid... The chief concern of the great individualist writers was indeed to find a set of institutions by which man could be induced, by his own choice and from the motives which determined his ordinary conduct, to contribute as much as possible to the need of all others; and their discovery was that the system of private property did provide such inducements to a much greater extent than had yet been understood (1948, 11–13).’”. People are sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes smart, and more often stupid. Human nature is what it is; we have both enormous creative capacities and substantial limitations. We can and must use economics grounded in the axiomatic truths of human anthropology to intellectually guide our students in the struggle for a better world. Taking human nature as the first principle in the economic way of thinking means that economics is necessarily a humanitarian pursuit. I urge us to use this as the starting point as teachers and researchers. The puzzles of the world are opportunities to apply this framework repeatedly. Imagine if this were the starting point for thinking about poverty, inequality, economic growth, recessions, trade balances, and monetary policy. These issues must be contextualized in the pursuit of human freedom, agency, and flourishing. Students and citizens alike care little about constrained optimization problems, the technical elements of the laws of supply and demand, trends in GDP growth, or arguments about improved efficiency. But when we start with human beings as the subject matter of economic understanding, which is a true commitment to praxeology, then the Austrian framework and methodology become not just educational but inspirational. The future rests on this. The scholars and expert teachers of tomorrow are the students of today. They both sit in our classrooms and exist out in the world. By relentlessly and effectively opening the eyes of our students to this thinking, we are equipping our students and citizens with the economic way of thinking, and dare I suggest that the fate of the free society depends on this. We can and should teach every class with this in mind.",

Holcombe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Joseph Schumpeter (1947: 82–83) says, “The essential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism we are dealing with an evolutionary process. … Capitalism, then, is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary. … The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates. … This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.” Having described the economic environment of capitalism as an on-going process of creative destruction, Schumpeter (1947: 83–84) continues, “Every piece of business strategy acquires its true significance only against the background of that process and within the situation created by it.” To understand the way that businesses operate, Schumpeter argues, the economist must step outside the static equilibrium framework that has provided the foundation for mainstream neoclassical economics to analyze an economy that never arrives at an equilibrium: it is always evolving. Evolving is a more descriptive term than changing, because the changes in a capitalist economy build on one another. The introduction of a new product makes old products obsolete; the introduction of a less costly production process makes the old process obsolete. Firms must respond to the changes made by other firms or be left behind, victims of creative destruction. The most significant changes that disrupt markets permanently change them. The conditions of the market are continually changing and will never return to the former conditions. In this sense, while the forces of supply and demand lead markets to clear, so that the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, they do not lead markets toward an equilibrium, if equilibrium describes a state of affairs that, if disturbed, tends to return to its former state. As Schumpeter says, capitalism is a method of economic change and never is stationary. Recognizing the ever-changing nature of capitalism, this paper examines how individuals (and their businesses) get ahead, and stay ahead, in this environment of creative destruction. The motivations of those who are trying to get ahead are different from those who are trying to stay ahead, and those different motivations have important implications for political economy.",1

Hayek and the evolutionary strand in Austrian economics",December 2022,Viktor J. Vanberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The label “Austrian School of Economics” comprises a group of scholars who are united more by their common intellectual heritage than, as one might suspect, by a shared paradigm. The school’s genealogy-based identity is indicated not only by the emphasis typically put on the role of Carl Menger as its founder (Vanberg 1998b),Footnote 1 but also by the usual grouping of its members in successive generations.Footnote 2 The fact that all those who associate with the school consider themselves Carl Menger’s intellectual heirs does not mean, though, that they also pursue the same research program. While they all subscribe to what are considered the principal ingredients of Menger’s theoretical outlook, namely his methodological individualism and subjectivism,Footnote 3 there exist significant divisions within the school on how these principles ought to be interpreted.Footnote 4 In fact, the school is plagued by factional fights about which interpretation qualifies as the more adequate theoretical specification and continuation of the Mengerian heritage, fights that are notably stired by the self-declared followers of Ludwig von Mises who claim theirs to be the only “correct Austrian paradigm” (Rothbard 1992: 7), chastising advocates of “competing Austrian paradigms” (ibid.) – like Israel Kirzner and, in particular, Friedrich A. Hayek – for deviating from “Austrian principles” (ibid: 5).Footnote 5 On the divisions among Menger’s heirs Lawrence White (1985: ix) comments in his introduction to Menger’s treatise on methodology: [I]n many respects the School has outgrown or rejected Menger’s methodological outlook, and it cannot be said that current Austrian methodological views derive predominantly from Carl Menger. Much of Menger’s argument has been filtered out, as it were, particularly by the writings of Ludwig von Mises in the midtwentieth century. Taking the Misesian and the Hayekian versions of the “Austrian paradigm” as the principal rivals in today’s Austrian economics,Footnote 6 in what follows I shall argue in support of three claims: Firstly, the claim that the “causal-genetic method”, central to Menger’s work, suggests itself as nucleus of an evolutionary research program. Secondly, the claim that among Menger’s heirs F.A. Hayek is the one who, belatedly, took up most systematically the “evolutionary elements” in the founder’s work and made them a central part of his own research efforts.Footnote 7 Thirdly, the claim that, if Austrian economics aspires to be recognized as an empirical social science – i.e. a science that seeks to explain social phenomena in terms of refutable conjectures –, it is the Mengerian-Hayekian evolutionary paradigm, not Misesian praxeology, that qualifies for this purpose.",3

Futerman,Luciano Villegas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The debate on the economic efficiency and justification of different types of taxes (Gruber 2015; Auerbach and Hines 2002; Bernheim 1981; Ballard et al. 1985; Ramsey 1927) has existed throughout the history of economic theory since its inception. Moreover, it includes different perspectives, from the principles of taxation outlined by Adam Smith (1776, Book V, Chapter II), to taxes suggested as tools of “social justice”, such as the progressive tax or others such as the Tobin Tax (Tobin 1978). Considerations regarding their suitability (Devarajan et al. 1980; Harberger 1962), and the analysis about which agent bears its burden (Kotlikoff and Summers 1987; Fullerton and Metcalf 2002; Browning and Johnson 1979) refer to different approaches. Thus, in the history of tax theory and taxes, there have been promoters and detractors of many different taxes and tax systems. For the case that we must deal with here, indirect taxes,Footnote 1 neoclassical economics resorts to the price elasticity analysis to identify over which agent the tax falls on. The argument affirms, briefly, that the tax falls on the one whose curve is more inelastic (Gruber 2015, Ch. 19–20), i.e. that whose propensity to acquire or produce the good or service in question is less affected by its price variation. In this sense, it is asserted, there are cases where the firm will be able to increase its price in such a proportion that its revenue (and, therefore, profit) does not change, while the tax is absorbed by the consumer completely (Besley and Rosen 1999). Or vice versa (and several possibilities in between). In the present work we object to this approach, which we believe makes an excessive emphasis, implicitly or explicitly, in the price elasticity of demand and supply. Thus, we concentrate on two factors that we consider more relevant: imperfect knowledge under a non-competitive market (Georgantzís and Attanasi 2016, 21–22), and the firm’s total profit elasticity with respect to price. Thus, we intend to demonstrate that, in the imperfectly competitive market, the firm is the agent that always and everywhere absorbs the weight of indirect taxes, regardless of the elasticity of its supply curve (and the price elasticity of demand). In Section 2 we briefly present the profit maximization model under monopolistic competition. Section 3 provides a general review of the concept of elasticity and its application, relevant to our viewpoint. It is in Section 4 that we carry out the analysis of the hypothesis that we intend to corroborate. Finally, the conclusions are found in Section 5.",

A review essay of Janek Wasserman’s The Marginal Revolutionaries: How Austrian Economists Fought the War of Ideas,December 2022,Stefan Kolev,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Janek Wasserman has published an important book, The Marginal Revolutionaries (Wasserman 2019), which is of special relevance for the readers of this journal. Wasserman provides a thought-provoking history of the evolution of the Austrian School, a narrative which spans over 150 years. Starting in the decades ahead of the publication of Carl Menger’s Grundsätze der Volkswirthschaftslehre (Menger 1871), or Principles of Economics, the story ends with the most recent ramifications in the Austrian research program and today’s relevance of the ideas commonly associated with this research program. Wasserman’s endeavor is certainly a bold one, given the innumerable historiographic portrayals of this scholarly community which have been available for almost as long as the community has existed. The book may strike the readers of this journal as a civilized provocation. While certainly written from a critical perspective, Wasserman’s style is much less characterized by the “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Boettke 2019) or the “malevolence assumption” (Kolev 2020), which have become so common in numerous recent books on this history of (neo-) liberal political economy. The book is an invitation to revisit the history of a scholarly tradition with a rather unique longevity, including episodes and protagonists that have been undeservedly forgotten. A number of myths, shared by both friends and foes of this research program, persist and deserve to be challenged. Wasserman is a historian with profound knowledge of Central European history in general and of Vienna as a hotspot of Central European civilization in particular, as already discernible from his earlier book Black Vienna (Wasserman 2014). The Marginal Revolutionaries profits significantly from this expertise, as one can recognize from the substantive, ideological, and lingual breadth of sources he has harnessed. Equally important is Wasserman’s multifaceted approach at what he aims to depict. His narrative about the Austrian School (AS) is about “a family biography; a history of economic thought; a sociology of knowledge; a transnational, political theory; and a history of political ideologies” (Wasserman 2019, p. 5). From the very beginning, he is wary of the usage of the “school” notion, which is often utilized in an inflationary manner, and struggles throughout the book to show carefully the extent to which the notion is applicable to the Austrians. His answer differs from period to period, and allows for the existence of different school-like configurations over time. In these efforts to demarcate the borders of the school, Wasserman consistently reminds the reader that the historiography of this scholarly community, especially when conducted by the Austrians themselves, has suffered from two key types of narrowness, which this review calls a personal and a temporal one. Regarding the personal narrowness, Wasserman’s narrative shows how many other intriguing figures than the “giants” like Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises or Hayek played non-negligible roles in the evolution of the AS. Regarding the temporal narrowness, he correctly identifies another deficiency in the ways some of today’s Austrians think of their history. The reviewer shares Wasserman’s observation that “figures before Mises and Hayek are known but primarily serve a symbolic rather than substantive purpose in current research” (Wasserman 2019, p. 7), whereby the decades before the 1920s are often demoted to a pre-history of what really kicked off with the socialist calculation debates. Let us explore, in a chronological manner, the more and the less successful aspects of the attempt to overcome these two types of narrowness – which is a daunting task, given the constraint to cover more than 150 years on less than 400 pages.",

It could refer to a conceptual space (e.g. the market for books, labor markets, etc.), an actual location (e.g. the local bazaar), or a particular class of choice environments which share (several) features which can be analogized to commercial exchange (the dating ‘market’, the market for votes, etc.). There is a sense in which standard neoclassical economics is preoccupied with the market. To be sure, economic textbooks, articles and monographs are replete with references to market activities (e.g. buying, selling, producing and consuming), market actors (e.g. producers, consumers, owners and entrepreneurs) and market phenomena (e.g. prices, profits and rents). Indeed, much of standard economic theory is ostensibly concerned with explaining market forces and outcomes. The frequent references to market activities, actors and phenomena in economic texts, however, obscures a surprising lack of interest in the market, as an object of study in its own right, within standard neoclassical economics. Interestingly, economists have noticed that the market has not been a central concern for economists. For instance, Stigler (1967: 291, cf. Stigler 1957) observed that “economic theory is concerned with markets much more than with factories or kitchens. It is, therefore, a source of embarrassment that so little attention has been paid to the theory of markets.” Similarly, North (1977: 710) noted that “it is a peculiar fact that the literature on economics…contains so little discussion of the central institution that underlies neo-classical economics – the market.” Also, according to Coase (1988: 7), “although economists claim to study the working of the market, … in the modern textbook, the analysis deals with the determination of market prices, but the discussion of the market itself has entirely disappeared.” Heterodox economists have also noticed the strange absence of the market from economic discourse. “Orthodox [economic] theorists,” argues Jackson (2019:13), “have devoted little effort to explaining what markets are, how they originated, why they endure, how they operate in practice, why they may be diverse and how they relate to the rest of the economy.” The market in economics is not even always the sort of object to which those questions could refer, given that in their default linguistic usage, as Jackson explains (2019:14), “markets are synonymous with trade or exchange, the terms being equivalent – there is no systematic distinction between market and non-market exchange. All rational trading gives rise to a ‘market’.” This minimally-conceptualized notion of markets offers little beyond identifying the sphere of the ‘economic.’ This view has been echoed by non-economists. “It is,” Lie (1997: 342) argued, “curious that the market receives virtually no extended discussion in most works of economic theory or history. … The market, it turns out, is the hollow core at the heart of economics.” And, Swedberg (1994: 257) noted, “astonishingly little work has been done” on the market within economics. Arguably, this backgrounding of the market is a twentieth century phenomenon within orthodox economic thought. From Smith to Marshall, for instance, the market was at the foreground of economic analysis. Additionally, heterodox economists, most especially Austrian economists or market process theorists (MPTs), have consistently foregrounded the market in their economic theorizing and applied efforts. Specifically, since Menger through Mises, Hayek, Kirzner, and Lachmann to the present day, MPTs have conceptualized the market process as being characterized by genuine rivalry, the market order as the never stationary result of the continuous competition and cooperation of a multitude of fallible and uncertain market participants, and market institutions as signposts that guide imperfect and imperfectible market actors. Why have the market process theorists retained the market? Why haven’t they misplaced the market like their cousins in the mainstream? Why didn’t they background the market in the twentieth century like their orthodox counterparts? The answer we believe has to do with ontology (i.e. the nature and properties of social reality). Real-world markets are messy, vibrant colorful spaces populated by diverse characters encumbered by real epistemological limits pursuing competing goals. Standard neoclassical accounts, however, are not principally concerned with genuine market interactions. Rather than abstracting from the souls and sounds of the market, MPTs wish to account for the market as it really is. For MPTs, this has (controversially) tended to mean accounting for the market as individuals observe and experience it. The market is at the forefront of analysis for MPTs and at the background for mainstream theorists because of differences in the ontological commitments of MPTs and mainstream economists. Several scholars have explored the implicit and explicit ontology adopted by MPTs and highlighted the differences between the ontological positions of standard neoclassical economists and MPTs. Maki (1990: 336), for instance, described the Austrian approach to social scientific inquiry as “a combination of ontic subjectivism and ontological objectivism or realism. It is ontic subjectivism in that the fundamental objects of economic theory are claimed to be subjective in nature … It is ontological objectivism or realism in the sense that those subjective entities are maintained to have an objective existence.” Moreover, Maki (ibid.: 338) claims, the “ontological objectivism” combines elements of scientific realism (i.e. the entities that appear in scientific theories actually exist) and common-sense realism (i.e. the objects that individuals encounter in our everyday lives actually exist). Also, Fleetwood (1995: 146) has argued (although not without controversy, see Runde 2001, Zwirn 2007) that Hayek, at least towards the end of his career, adopted a “﻿transformational social ontology” where the focus of his inquiry was on “﻿the resources, mechanisms and deep structures that make socio-economic activity possible.” The earlier Hayek, Fleetwood (ibid.) explained, adopted a social ontology that was primarily concerned with the “fused domains of the empirical and actual” i.e. “a preoccupation with events/actions given in sense experience.” Similarly, Lawson (1997) views MPTs as employing a distinct ontology, but one subject to criticism for an excessively subjective description of social structure. Others have explored the ontology of MPTs (see Lawson 1996 and especially, Lewis 2005, 2008a,b, 2010,2011, 2015, 2016, 2017, Lewis and Runde 2007). Our paper adds to this debate surrounding the social ontology of MPTs by emphasizing how committing themselves to theorizing about and accounting for real markets has led them to consistently foreground the market in their analysis. Our aim here is not to take a strong position on how to characterize the ontological commitments of MPTs nor do we attempt to defend their ontology here. That said, it is our view that MPTs occupy an ontological position somewhere between the critical realists and the empiricists. As such, when it comes to treating the market, most MPTs are concerned with “deep structures” only in so far as that focus helps them to capture the market as individuals actually experience it. Whatever way we characterize their ontological commitments and however defensible or open to criticism, we believe that MPTs retained the market when mainstream economists lost it because MPTs are committed to an ontology that seeks to capture the key features of actually lived and experienced markets. This particular concern – i.e. the foregrounding of the market by MPTs while mainstream economists leave it at the background of their analysis – has not been a central aspect of this debate around the ontology adopted by MPTs but is an important puzzle within the history of economic thought that might be answered by pointing to ontology. This paper explores why MPTs continue to foreground the market as well as how MPTs conceive of and study the market by pointing to their (implicit) ontology of the market. The remainder of this paper is, thus, organized as follows. Section II examines the backgrounding of the market in mainstream economics, i.e. the ontology of the market, such as it is, implicit in standard neoclassical economics. Section III, then, considers how the ontological commitments of market process theorists explain the way they conceive of and study the market. Section IV offers concluding remarks. We should note that both sections II and III are intended primarily as exposition of these two perspectives and their connection to and consequences for ontological considerations, rather than the evaluation of their relative merits. Section II necessarily relies heavily upon critical sources in virtue of having to characterize an omission (i.e. the lack of concern for reality within standard neo-classical economics). Section III is able to primarily operate in terms of the market process tradition’s own self-considerations which are unsurprisingly of a more favorable nature.",

Torquil Mathewson for their comments and corrections. Remaining errors are all mine. The Austrian School of Economics was born in Vienna (at that time, Austrian-Hungarian Empire), in 1871 when Carl Menger published his Principles of Economics. Menger rediscovered the subjective economic analysis that the Spanish Scholastics elucidated in the sixteenth century (J. Huerta de Soto, The Spanish Roots of the Austrian School de Soto Jesús 2009). His main contribution was to refute the objective theory of labour, an amalgam of theories originating from the Classical British School, in which value could be calculated objectively due to cost of production, labour or salaried labour. Thus, Menger laid the groundwork of a school of thought in which marginalism, subjectivism and entrepreneurship roots were to be found in the Spanish Scholastics, most of them Dominicans and Jesuits (Rothbard 1995; Rothbard 2006). The founder of the School of thought was Francisco de Vitoria, who many consider to be the first philosopher of International Law. He concluded that natural law is superior to state law, but without reflecting upon how markets operate. Diego de Covarrubias y Leyva, who became bishop of Segovia, was the first thinker in the School of Salamanca to set forth the subjective theory of value. He stated that “the value of an article does not depend on its essential nature, but on the subjective estimation of men, even if that estimation is foolish” (Andrés et al. 2012). Luis Saravia de la Calle further developed Covarrubias’ concepts and came to the conclusion that costs follow prices, or, in the opposite sense, prices determine costs. That this was determined three centuries before the Classical School mentioned the work-value theory, is remarkable in itself. He further stated that “those who measure the just price by the labour, costs and risks incurred by the person who deals in the merchandise are greatly in error. “The just price is found not by counting the cost but by common estimation” (Saravia de la Calle [1544] de la Calle, Luis 1949). Saravia de la Calle also noted that bankers should be paid by the depositors instead of obtaining their gains by the practise of the fractional reserve. Martín de Azpilcueta can be accurately ascribed to be the first thinker of the School of Salamanca to focus on monetary problems. He sketched out a brief and rudimentary version of the quantitative theory of value when he declared “money is worth more where and when it is lacking than where and when it is in abundance” (Azpilcueta [1556] de Azpilcueta 2011). In addition, he fervently opposed the practise of fractional reserve, arguing that a banker should be “warden, depositor and guarantor of the gold deposited in his strongbox” (Azpilcueta [1556] de Azpilcueta 2011). Finally, Father Juan de Mariana wrote about several different topics, like the centralised rule of the Jesuit Company, monetary theory and the inflation caused by the arrival of metals coming from America. His main contribution, however, was his analysis about inflation caused by governmental debasement of coins, a fact that Juan de Mariana condemned as sheer robbery. This led to his development of a tyrannicide doctrine, according to which any citizen can commit tyrannicide against a ruler that imposes taxes without the consent of the people. As we can observe, most of the topics covered by the Scholastics are still present in the debates of the Austrian School. They were indeed ahead of their time, especially when they began to judge inflation as a monetary phenomenon, to conceive the entrepreneur as a visionary who needs to value future events in order to make necessary expenditures today. These thinkers set the stage for the following generations of Austrian economists including Menger, Eugen Böhm-Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, Ludwig von Mises, and F.A. Hayek. The work of these scholars, and especially the work of Mises served as the foundation for a unique branch of thought within the Austrian School of Economics. It is worth asking why the Austrian School has such dissemination, especially in academia, in Spain? Perhaps because there is a common substrate, that is, the search for scientific truth. There is a chronological order to be understood before one can understand the central role of the Austrian School in Spain. Our path begins in the sixteenth century. In this period, the conquest of the New World had set up the Spanish Empire as the first world power. Therefore, it was that the Spanish universities became the leaders all over the world. In this context is when the School of Salamanca started its path. The authors from the second Scholastic led a reflection about the economic phenomena not in the sense that we conceive today, but in a moral sense. Nevertheless, the main point we have to focus on is that the Western investigation in economics didn’t start in Great Britain in the eighteenth century. In conclusion, the current study of subjectivism actually could be considered a happy return to the leading economic theory. The explanation of economic facts, like the economic cycle, the monetary theory or entrepreneurship belonged to the Spanish scientific heritage five centuries ago. The new challenges launched by a globalised world, like the euro, the deflationary process stopped by the central intervention, or increasing government spending and public debt, relied on the tools provided by the marginal subjectivism. Here is the first cause of its success. Moreover, we cannot underestimate the importance of religion. While historians of economic thought, like Schumpeter, never took into account the religious beliefs of the different authors, others, like Rothbard, Viner or Hayek, placed much importance upon the religious education received by an author to explain his theories. Hence, it is not surprising that the economic subjectivism has travelled between two sociologically Catholic countries like Austria and Spain. The third cause is found during the economic opening after Franco’s autarky. After the worst two decades of economic policies in Spain, the situation reached its limits that required a radical solution. It was precisely the ministers of the Catholic branch of the government who started a new model of economic policy, much more based upon markets than in government intervention. This new economic policy, developed in 1959, was named the Stabilisation Plan. The main political consequence was that Spain ceased its traditional international isolation. In the academic field this opening coincided with the expansion of Austrian ideas thanks to the Reig Albiol brothers. Thus, Spain became the principal bastion of the Austrian School in Western Europe due to, especially, the Reig Albiol brothers. To make a comparison, it would be like a relay race in which the Reig Albiol brothers would have taken the baton from the School of Salamanca. Spain would become one of the scarce meeting points of the subjectivist’s tradition initiated in Vienna, near the end of the nineteenth century, in continental Europe. Little by little, the authors of the Austrian School of Madrid are taking positions in Academia, in order to find the final recognition. The first Austrian seminar in Europe since Mises’s exile was initially a meeting of like-minded friends, debating economic principles and the Spanish economy. Afterwards, the seminar moved to the Law Faculty at Complutense University of Madrid. It is worth noting that Hayek and Popper visited the seminar several times. It is in this context that the generational change within the Austrian Spanish economists took place. For the very first time, even in a small size, the Austrian seminar took an academic aspect. The first lessons based on subjectivism, taken from the School of Salamanca, according to which a creative actor pursues his ends through scarce means, took place in the late 80’s. This is when Professor Huerta de Soto started to build a new branch of the Austrian School. Perhaps the final recognition arrived during the Great Recession (2008). At that time, the Western economies suffered the biggest and most generalised recession in three decades. Mainstream economic theory, which is not able to explain the underlying causes of Western economies sudden episodes of recession after long periods of boom, is additionally unable to provide suitable solutions. Essentially, the mainstream theories have a common substrate, that is, that the economies go into crisis because they do not spend as much as it would be necessary to employ all the economic factors. The multi-stage production or the effects of the savings over the productive structure are totally ignored (Hayek 1931). In essence, this economic theory was unable to understand why an economy required an inevitable correction, especially from the real estate assets, after a long period of credit expansion financed by the central banks. It is here that the economic cycle provided by the Austrian School develops itself forcibly. A whole generation of economists had begun to search for new alternatives to face the traditional economic theories surrounding economic issues. Therefore, the comeback of an economic theory which seemed to be marginalised in academia, little by little started to take a front seat in the academic debate. We can quote some examples about how the Austrian Business Cycle Theory has been mentioned in different academic journals or books, not only in those with an Austrian perspective. In Huerta de Soto, Jesús (1980a, b), Alonso et al. (2013), Rallo (2011), Alonso et al. (2011a, b). All these examples are Austrian perspectives of the recent recession, but published in what we could consider mainstream journals. In fact, the Great Recession had just shown how the Austrian marginalism could be used not only in economic theory, but in many other fields. From the traditional neoclassical synthesis, academia is starting to reflect upon its own failures. This debate could end up in the middle term to a changing paradigm.",4

Do the equi-marginal conditions still apply?,March 2023,Peter Lewin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the mid-nineties Austrians have been contributing to the literature on the nature of the firm.Footnote 1 A constant theme of those contributions is the observation that, unlike the neoclassical firm, real-world firms operate in a situation of disequilibrium. This means that, unlike the neoclassical firm, real-world firms face unavoidable uncertainty (not just probabilistic risk). Competition is not confined to price competition with known costs and technologies. Rather technological innovation is on-going and competition is multi-dimensional in the form of new products, better quality products, new types of business organization, new types of resources, etc. Innovation is key.Footnote 2 In such a world there is room for business strategy. Industry structures are continually changing and end-points are not pre-determined. It is a dynamic, open-ended universe. Austrian views of the business firm have contributed to various strands of the management and economics literatures, including strategic management approaches (the resource-based approach to the firm and the knowledge-based approach to the firm, for example) the New Institutionalist Economics of Oliver Williamson and others (see Williamson, 1985 and Williamson & Winter, 1991) dealing with incentive problems (moral hazard and hold-up), principal-agent knowledge problems (Jenson and Meckling, 1992, using Hayekian insights) and so on. The articles referenced in footnote 1 contain extensive surveys of these contributions citing the voluminous (and still growing) literature. I will not attempt here to summarize this multifaceted literature and the Austrian contributions to it. It will suffice to emphasize that they involve the themes of knowledge, uncertainty, complementarity, specificity, and innovation. Instead, in this paper I want to focus on what is left of neoclassical insights once we leave the static world of neoclassical price competition for the dynamic world of incessant change and innovation. Section 2 following briefly describes the takeaways for students learning the traditional neoclassical theory of the firm, and the working methodology used to defend its relevance. In contrast section 3 describes the real-world relevance of the firm as an institution necessary for the calculation of profit and loss in a world of dynamic change. What are the key differences between a teaching approach based on these two visions? Section 4 then asks the important question, what is left of the important neoclassical insights, namely the equi-marginal conditions. My answer is, a lot, but with a crucial twist in interpretation. A general teaching strategy is suggested. Section 6 concludes.",

So, for instance, the philosophic critic could hold that market corrupt morals, but so too do dictatorships like the North Korean regime. Moreover, philosophic critics might insist that they criticize markets compared to a hypothetical alternative very different from any existing society such as a Rousseauian asocial state of nature or Marxist proletarian communism. Such criticism claims that market societies corrupt compared to a utopia outside of Storr and Choi’s dataset. More concretely, consider the structure of Marxist criticisms of supposed inefficiencies of markets. Marx (2019, 4–5) claims markets increase productivity relative to prior and existing alternatives such as feudalism.Footnote 3 Despite granting that relative efficiency, Marxists condemn markets as inefficient. Specifically, they claim that markets—due to waste in competition or the like—are less efficient than a hypothetical system of communism.Footnote 4 It is worth emphasizing that a Marxist is not even claiming that every planned society will be more efficient than markets, but only that her preferred form of as-yet-untested collective planning would be more efficient. Marxists, then, would not be troubled if market societies won out in comparative data on the productivity of existing societies since Marxists and market defenders alike predict that market societies will be more productive than the existing alternatives. The disagreement regards whether hypothetical nonmarket alternatives would be even better. Parallel to that account of efficiency, Marxists may hold that their moral hypothesis is relative to hypothetical Marxist communism. The claim is not that markets corrupt morals relative to the various existing nonmarket societies of the world, but instead that markets corrupt morals compared to a preferred society for which no direct empirical data is available. Thus, such Marxists would claim that Storr and Choi’s data does not speak to their criticisms of markets. A Marxist may even hold, parallel to the account of productivity, that markets are morally uplifting relative to historic alternatives while still corrupting relative to the utopia. The Marxist case illustrates a general strategy that many may use, though different philosophic critics of markets would specify the details differently. For instance, Rousseau’s central comparison is to a hypothetical, asocial, state of nature in which humans would not engage in the corrupt pride or other vices of modern market or nonmarket societies. The asocial state of nature is not included in Storr and Choi’s social data, so Rousseauians may claim that the data does not answer their criticism.",1
36.0,1.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,12 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-022-00575-y,Do disruptions to the market process corrupt our morals?,March 2023,Rosemarie Fike,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Critics of markets, and even some of their greatest champions, have long been concerned about the impact that commercial life might have on our moral character. Markets, and the extensive division of labor that they create, have been argued to exploit the poor (Marx, 1867 2010), create unintelligent masses (Smith, 1776 1976), discriminate against women and minorities (Folbre, 2009; Nussbaum, 2000), and cultivate a cold, calculating nature that may provide an advantage in market competition. Storr and Choi (2019) in their book, Do Markets Corrupt our Morals, refute the charge that market systems weaken our moral fabric. They argue, instead, that markets produce moral outcomes and should not be characterized as corrupt institutions. They provide plentiful theoretical and empirical evidence to support this claim and conclude that there are, potentially substantial, moral costs to limiting markets (p. 243). This essay poses, and begins to answer, a related question: is it immoral to stand in the way of the market process? Further, it argues that impediments to markets, not markets themselves, are likely to corrupt our moral character. While there are undoubtedly many ways in which inhibiting the market process could lead to moral degradation, this essay discusses only four. First, Storr and Choi (2019) demonstrate a multitude of ways in which market-based societies promote human flourishing. Regardless of the intentions behind market interventions, restricting economic freedom makes it harder for people to improve their lives, and this comes at a great material cost to them and at a moral cost to the interventionist. Second, if, as the Stoics and Aristotelians argue, virtue can be learned and acquired through practice, then the set of institutions that rewards people for behaving morally will encourage them to practice virtuous behavior and become more virtuous as a result (McCloskey, 2006). One of the long-touted benefits of markets is that they provide a set of incentives in which you are required to create value for other members of society, and take their preferences into consideration, in order to accomplish your own self-interested goals (Smith, 1776 1976). If they wish to maintain profitability, producers must establish a trustworthy reputation and cooperate with others under mutually agreeable terms. To stand in the way of the market process often means changing this set of incentives. The political process that is inevitably substituted for the market process tends to systematically reward immoral behavior and encourage man to practice vice instead of virtue. Third, to develop a virtuous character requires possessing the freedom to make dishonorable choices. One cannot truly be said to be virtuous for living a life composed of only moral actions if the option to engage in immoral actions did not exist. By eliminating the choice to engage in certain vices, and by raising the cost of engaging in other immoral activities, paternalistic interventions in the market do not permit individuals to actively participate in the development of their own moral character. Finally, the prevailing view of what is morally acceptable is not fixed. It can, and does, change. A system in which individuals are free to make their own choices allows people to challenge the dominant view of morality. Social institutions, like the market and its accompanying moral order, are spontaneous orders generated from a competitive trial and error process. This better enables us to discover errors in our understanding of morality and helps us to replace behaviors that are revealed to be oppressive or unjust with ones that are more virtuous. Restrictions to economic freedom can prevent people from challenging the status quo and moving social norms in a more tolerant direction. The remainder of this essay further expands on each of these four ways in which interventions into the market process may result in moral corruption.",2

We only affirm and deepen these concerns when we say that amoral markets achieve morally significant ends under worst-case assumptions about agents’ motives (Boettke & Leeson, 2004). So the economist’s standard relegation of (im)morality to the “realm of individual ethics and philosophy” (Friedman, 1962, 12) is for Storr and Choi an unacceptable concession to market critics, as it fails to theorize the myriad ways in which markets serve as “training grounds that support moral improvement” (vi) and, conversely, the ways in which commerce depends upon the ethical integrity of market participants. A stronger case for markets, Storr and Choi contend, emerges from the recognition that markets and morality are not separate spheres but dynamically interconnected elements within a single analytic-normative space: the space of “market society” (9). In contrast to the received view of commerce as “a series of exchanges undertaken by a multitude of atomized individuals ruthlessly competing against each other in pursuit of their own self-interest” (Meadowcroft, 2005, 140), Storr and Choi envision market society as a nexus of interaction among thoroughly socialized human beings. Like McCloskey (2006), they see markets as moralizing spaces in which actors “learn to be virtuous” (226) and where the fruits of exchange include not just prices, quantities, and private net gains but moral capabilities (e.g., virtues of generosity and trustworthiness) and interpersonal bonds (e.g., social connections, trust of strangers). Agents’ virtues for Storr and Choi are not mere ornaments but integral constituents of market processes (193–226). Contrary to critics’ claims, markets and community need not be a zero-sum game, each threatening to corrupt or crowd out the other. Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft can jointly expand and flourish in a Storr/Choi market society, generating higher levels of material well-being and virtue. Storr and Choi’s moral defense of markets is jointly anchored in social theory and an extensive empirical comparison of market and non-market societies. Operationally, they define market society as a society in which “markets are permitted to thrive. .. where property rights are respected, contracts are enforced, and the rule of law exists” (9–10) and use the nation as their principal unit of analysis. A nation’s “marketness” as a discrete variable (1 or 0), with each nation classified as market or nonmarket based on five indices of economic freedom or rule of law. “Market societies” are defined as those nations that score in the top 40% of possible scores on all five indices (40 of the 190 nations in their sample); all other nations are designated as “non-market societies.” The morality of market and non-market societies is then compared along two sets of axes: (1) self-reported levels of virtue, based on the World Values Survey and other sources and (2) estimated levels of material well-being across multiple dimensions, on the premise that markets enable people to improve their own lives and the lives of others and therefore “the potential for material betterment by engaging in market activity. .. is of moral significance” (88). Within this methodological frame, Storr and Choi draw a series of comparisons in support of their claim that market societies are more conducive to moral betterment. To demonstrate that “virtue is more prevalent in market societies than in nonmarket societies and vice is less prevalent in market societies than in nonmarket societies” (77), the authors show comparative data suggesting that “people in market societies will tend to be more altruistic, are less likely to be materialistic and corrupt, and are more likely to be cosmopolitan as well as trusting and trustworthy” (163) – findings buttressed by their experimental demonstration that repeated market interactions among strangers can generate trust, reward virtue, and punish vice (205–212). To demonstrate that people in market societies are better able to improve their lives and the lives of others, Storr and Choi present evidence suggesting that “[p]eople who reside in market societies. .. are wealthier, healthier, live longer, are better educated, and have access to better sanitation, more infrastructure, and more food. .. [and] are better connected than individuals in nonmarket societies” (112) and that market societies are more likely “to improve the lives of the poor. .. to reduce inequality. .. and to increase social mobility” (124). While acknowledging that market processes reduce the well-being of some individuals “due to creative destruction, structural oppression of the poor, victimized buyers, third-party victims of negative externalities, and of course slaves,” Storr and Choi contend that the most salient measure of the market’s moral status lies in the forward-looking fact that “people, even enslaved people, can improve their lives through markets” (87). In all, Storr and Choi seek to shift the burden of moral proof from market champions to critics, offering theoretical and empirical support for their core claim that “morally corrupt behavior and principles are not uniquely linked to the market” (163). Likening themselves to defense attorneys “defending their client against this charge by claiming its innocence” (76), Storr and Choi endeavor to give markets “a full defense,” unmarked by the moral ambiguities they find in other pro-market writers. Moreover, they aspire to alter the intellectual rules of the age-old market/morals debate, insisting that critics look at cross-sectional and time-series data on market and non-market societies before repeating negative stereotypes about markets and their corrupting influence.",

Vanberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"When dealing with Carl Menger, historians of economic thought commonly emphasize three aspects of his work: Menger’s quarrel with the German Historical School, the contrast between his theoretical outlook and that of his co-marginalists, Léon Walras and William Stanley Jevons, and his role in pioneering an evolutionary economics. Focusing on these aspects, the present paper argues in support of the following claims: The noted aspects of Menger’s work have their common root in his understanding of economics as – in today’s language – a life science. This understanding of economics as a life science explains the reverse combination of agreement and disagreement between Menger’s research program and that of the historicists on the one side and his co-marginalists on the other. He agreed with the historicists’ claim that in the social sciences historicity matters, yet he insisted that this does not prevent economics from explaining its subject, as the natural sciences do, in terms of general laws. Reversely, in agreement with his co-marginalists he regarded economics as a nomological science, like the natural sciences, but, in contrast to Walras and Jevons, he insisted on the methodological differences that, due to the historicity of its subject, separate economics from the “exact natural sciences.” This understanding of economics as a life science is inherently linked with his evolutionary approach. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses, in general terms, the methodological implications that follow from conceiving economics as a life science. Section 3 examines the conflict between Menger and the Historical School, the subject of the so-called Methodenstreit. Section 4 takes a closer look at the methodological divide that separates Menger’s version of the “marginalist revolution” from the version advocated by Walras and Jevons. Section 5 details how Menger’s individualist-evolutionary research program exhibits the principal ingredients of a life-science. Section 6 discusses the relation between subjectivism and evolutionism. Section 7 concludes.",

Rizzo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Ludwig von Mises’s (2003 [1928]) criticism of Menger has been highly influential in the subsequent development of Austrian economics in ways that would be shared by the neoclassical mainstream more generally. We begin by focusing on Menger’s concepts of “imaginary needs”, “imaginary goods”, and “non-economic prices.” Menger (1981 [1871], 53–54) claims that people often act upon a false perception of their needs and therefore of the goods that are desirable.Footnote 2 They also can mistake the causal properties of goods as when they buy a drug unsuited to its purpose. These errors result in prices that are not, strictly speaking, “economic.” On the other hand, Mises argues that these distinctions are unjustified from a modern subjectivist viewpoint. This is because the task of economics is to explain market prices and these are determined by the actual valuations of individuals, not those derived from an objective scale of values or even from accurate knowledge of the causal powers of a good to attain its desired end. What people think determines prices. Mises calls Menger’s view a “notorious slip” (2003 [1928], 184) and attributes it to the continuing hold of the objective theory of value. The concept of “non-economic prices” is singled out for special criticism. Here Mises focuses on the motives of the agent. He believes that it is wrong to say that if the consumer does not buy at the lowest price but decides to pay more out of a preference for the seller (e.g., due to nationalism, altruism, or racism) he has paid a non-economic price or acted non-economically. According to Mises, non-pecuniary motives are perfectly consistent with economic behavior. After all, people might buy flags due to nationalist motives. Economists still wish to understand the formation of flag prices and their analysis is perfectly capable of doing so. Now if people are, in addition, willing to pay a premium to buy that flag from a fellow countryman what is the significance? Consumer preferences regarding the seller are no different from consumer preferences regarding the good itself. Mises’s point generalizes to purchasing at a higher price because of “error, ignorance, incapacity, laziness, neglectfulness, or from political, nationalistic or political reasons” (2003 [1928], 187). What especially concerns him is that this characterization of the non-economic gets transformed into a norm: “You should act economically.” (187, emphasis added). No such norm is implied by economic theory according to Mises. However, Mises summary of Menger seems simplified since Menger does not draw direct normative conclusions but highlights that both non-pecuniary motives and mistakes influence choices of economic actors: “For it may be admitted ever so unreservedly that people are governed in economic things neither exclusively by a single definite propensity, in our case by their egoism, nor are uninfluenced by error, ignorance, and external compulsion. It may accordingly be admitted that the results of the realistic orientation of theoretical research in the field of economy cannot exhibit complete rigor.” (Menger, 1985 [1883], 64). And yet he also says in the second edition of Principles: “Rational theory and practical economics will have to enter into the investigations of real wants, i.e., wants which correspond to the objective state of affairs.” (Menger, 1923, 4 as cited in Mises, 2003 [1928], 184, emphasis added). There are two main reasons that Menger believes the assumption of economic action and economic prices is warranted: one is empirical, the other one is linked to what Menger calls “exact laws.” Regarding the former, Menger states: “…people in their economic efforts, even if not exclusively and without exception, nevertheless are predominately and regularly governed by their individual interests and on the whole and regularly recognize the latter correctly, even if not in all cases and absolutely.” (Menger, 1985 [1883], 64). Therefore, the assumptions made in the exact orientation are at least rough approximations to the full empirical reality of behavior. But this is by no means Menger’s sole or even most important defense of his approach. Even when people make significant errors or act on motives that are not purely pecuniary, exact laws are important.Footnote 3",

Boettke,Rosolino A. Candela,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Carl Menger is widely recognized as one of the trio of geniuses whose work led to the Marginalist Revolution in economics and the beginning of neoclassical economics. Menger is also understood to have stood out from his peers Walras and Jevons, both methodologically and analytically. Menger did not make use of mathematics in discussing marginalism, and he tended to stress the subjectivism of value and costs to a greater extent. In fact, it was his subjectivism that was behind his rejection of a mathematical rendering of the marginal analysis to human choice against the constraint of scarcity. More idiosyncratic is Menger’s emphasis on economics processes through time, and the knowledge and learning involved. These are themes that were later developed by his followers in the Austrian school of economics from Bohm-Bawerk to Kirzner, with perhaps the most significant developments coming from Mises and Hayek. But these developments that emanate from Menger’s writings went far beyond the Austrian school per se, and were foundational to the development of the exchange perspective (as opposed to the allocation perspective)Footnote 1 and ultimately to a genuine institutional economics (as opposed to a historicist economics). According to Menger, the objective of his seminal work, Principles of Economics (1871 [1985], p. 49) was “for the purpose of establishing price theory based upon reality and placing all price phenomena (including interest, wages, ground rent, etc.) together under one unified point of view.” Thus, Menger was attempting to understand the organization of production, based on a theory of price formation through time. This raises a question, which motivates our paper: to what extent, if any, can Menger account for production not directly organized by the price mechanism, and therefore a theory of economic organization and its formation through time? We argue that implicit to Menger’s account of price formation is an account not only of institutional formation, but of the organization of economic activity in firms.Footnote 2 Production guided by prices and production guided by entrepreneurs within a firm have a distinct, but related relationship from a Mengerian perspective: they both entail the utilization of “human knowledge of the causal connections between things, and by the extent of human control over things” (1871 [1981], p. 74). Whereas prices extend an individual’s knowledge of the causal connections between individuals in anonymous interaction, economic organization extends knowledge of the causal connection between individuals in their personal interactions, particularly as they take place within firms. Thus, there exists a symbiotic relationship that can be found in Menger between a theory of price formation and a theory of organizational formation, both of which are by-products of an increasing division of labor and an increasing division of knowledge brought about by an increasing scope of market exchange. The underlying basis for our argument, namely the symbiotic nature of market pricing and economic organization, is that Menger focused direct attention on the monitoring (incentives) and metering (knowledge), and the feedback and learning that metering and monitoring engenders, namely the ability of the economic forces at work to coordinate activities among diverse and sometimes distant individuals. Progress in contemporary economics and political economy, one might reasonably argue, will follow from pursuing consistently and persistently two themes that one can read in Menger’s Principles of Economics – (1) context matters and (2) relations before transactions. Consider his discussion of the entrepreneurial market process and in particular entrepreneurial activity (Menger’s emphasis). This activity includes, Menger writes, “(a) obtaining information about the economic situation; (b) economic calculation – all the various computations that must be made if a production process is to be efficient (provided that it is economic in other respects); (c) the act of will by which goods of higher order (or goods in general – under conditions of developed commerce, where any economic good can be exchanged for any other) are assigned to a particular production process; and finally (d) supervision of the execution of the production plan so that it may be carried through as economically as possible” (emphasis in original; Menger, 1871 [1981], p. 160). In this passage alone Menger is foreshadowing developments in economic theory over the course of the 20th century that dug deeper into imperfect information and search, knowledge problems and economic calculation, capital maintenance and the structure of production, and, our particular focus here, the management and organization of economic activity through time. The implication of this is that Menger appears as a precursor of developments in organizational economics, but also the field of New Institutional Economics of which organizational economics is a part. In this respect, Menger sowed the seeds for “a genuine institutional economics,” as James Buchanan puts it, one in which “the derivation of the institutional order itself,” including property rights, law, and economic organization, emerges “from the set of elementary behavioral hypotheses with which he commences” (Buchanan, 1968 [1999], p. 5). Such elementary behavioral hypotheses, going back to Menger, include choice based on subjective marginal utility and the economizing action of individuals in social interaction, each of whom are striving to achieve their ends through productive specialization and exchange in an open-ended world of uncertainty. Our paper builds on a more recent literature that has established the complementarities between Austrian economics and organizational economics, namely the role of metering and monitoring in production, both between and within organizations, and the process of competitive survival in the marketplace (Burns & Fuller, 2020; Piano & Rouanet, 2020; Boettke et al., 2022). The basis for cross-fertilization between these two intellectual traditions, and the case for “an Austrian theory of the firm” (Langlois, 2013; Lewin & Phelan, 2000; Sautet, 2000) has been acknowledged by Ronald Coase, who stated that “a large part of what we think of as economic activity is designed to accomplish what high transaction costs would otherwise prevent or to reduce transaction costs so that individuals can freely negotiate and we can take advantage of that diffused knowledge of which Hayek has told us” (1992, p. 716). It should therefore come as no surprise that economists working in the Austrian tradition, such as Randall Holcombe, have argued that firms serve as “knowledge repositories” (Holcombe, 2013), paralleling what Alchian and Demsetz (emphasis in original; 1972, p. 795) argued: “Conceiving competition as the revelation and exchange of knowledge or information about qualities, potential uses of different inputs in different potential applications indicates that the firm is a device for enhancing competition among sets of input resources as well as a device for more efficiently rewarding the input.” Our particular contribution to this literature is not to sketch a new “Austrian” theory of the firm, per se, but to situate this recent synthesis between the Austrian economics and organizational economics into a broader framework of economic development, as suggested by Menger: “Increasing understanding of the causal connection between things and human welfare, and increasing control of the less proximate conditions responsible for human welfare, have led mankind, therefore, from a state of barbarism and the deepest misery to present stage of civilization and well-being” (Menger, 1871 [1981], p. 74). In this respect, our contribution builds on Langlois (1992), who places the contributions of Alfred Marshall and Frank Knight to the theory of economic organization in the backdrop of a broader context, namely Adam Smith’s notion of economies of scope in the market.Footnote 3 Langlois does so to develop a “capabilities theory” of the firm, in which the decision to coordinate production through market prices or organize production through firms is not just determined by the transaction cost of “discovering what the relevant prices are” (Coase, 1937, p. 390), but as Langlois puts it, “the costs of persuading, negotiating, coordinating and teaching outside suppliers” (1992, p. 113).Footnote 4 Increasing economies of scope in production give rise to market prices to coordinate anonymous exchange between producers and consumers, but economic organization emerges as a means by which producers learn what, how, and to whom to produce as part of an ever-widening scope of exchange. Similarly, our contribution builds on that of Dekker and Kuchař (2022), who situate Menger’s theory of economic development not just as the impetus for other Austrians, such as Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, and Ludwig Lachmann, but as an early neoclassical economist part of a broader Smithian tradition.Footnote 5 By framing Menger in this broader light, an implicit theory of economic organization can be extracted from Menger’s explicit theory of price formation. Thus, Buchanan captures in our headquote the spirit in which we want to see Menger’s work. As we will demonstrate Menger’s economics was an economics that focused on the embedded nature of economic life within a legal setting, within political structures, and within social and cultural context. Menger argued that economic science was constituted by three different categories of knowledge: pure or exact theory (logic of choice), empirical-realistic theory (situational logic of choice and interaction), and historical investigation (guided by the theoretical framework). It is the realm of empirical-realistic theory, where law, politics and society are emphasized as both shaping and being shaped by commercial relations. Critical to the shaping and being shaped is the mechanisms at work in the governing dynamics in social intercourse. Our paper will proceed as follows. Section 2 we will revisit Menger’s discussion in Principles related to choice against constraints, and the fundamental role that property, prices and profit-and-loss play in the coordinating the division of labor. Section 3 will trace out the implications of Menger’s pioneering work in the Austrian tradition with an emphasis on Mises and Hayek.

The question indicates that the social sciences should pay particular attention to those social phenomena or institutions that are the unintended result of individual actions rather than phenomena that arise from deliberate cooperation (133). Generally, Menger’s theoretical approach to economics aims to identify a genetic-causal sequence of events by which “the more complex economic phenomena evolve from their [simplest] elements according to definite principles” (Menger, [1871] 2007, 46–47).Footnote 2 He applies this approach to explaining an unintended social phenomenon with his conjectural history of the origin of money.Footnote 3 As described in the Principles of Economics and subsequent writings, money first came into being without any conscious decision or the help of government (257–285). Menger thus offers what Robert Nozick calls an “invisible hand explanation” of the emergence of money. Menger’s description of the emergence of money has received considerable attention in the literature, not least because he suggested that similar explanations may be given for the formation of institutions such as law, language, and the state (Menger, [1883] 1985, 130). His discussion of money has been labelled a “paradigmatic” example of the spontaneous development of institutions (Caldwell, 2002, 294) and a major contribution of the Austrian economics research program (O’Driscoll & Rizzo, 2015, 40). This paper purports to show that, in addition, Menger’s account of the origin of money is a complete invisible hand explanation in the sense of Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1978). This means that it combines two different kinds of invisible hand explanations, namely an explanation describing how the aggregation of individual actions leads to the emergence of the social phenomenon and an explanation arguing that the social phenomenon performs a valuable function that secures its continued existence. The fact that Menger incorporates both these aspects speaks to the explanatory power of his description. To illustrate this claim, the present paper considers the counterexample of Friedrich Hayek’s theory of cultural evolution, which focuses exclusively on the aspect of social usefulness (e.g., Hayek, [1988] 1989). As will be argued, a major drawback of this focus is that Hayek’s theory cannot account for established institutions that are socially useless or even harmful. The criticism developed here applies only to the theory of cultural evolution. It does not apply to other invisible hand explanations present in Hayek’s works, such as the spontaneous order of the free market (Hayek, 1945) and competition “as a discovery procedure” (Hayek, [1968] 2002). Aside from clarifying what constitutes a successful invisible hand explanation, this paper is motivated by the fact that the notion of money as an emergent phenomenon has recently gained a renewed relevance. For a long time, adjustments to the social institution of money were made primarily by governments, central banks, and heavily regulated financial firms. This changed with the advent of decentralized digital non-fiat currencies.Footnote 4 Motivated by shortcomings of existing sovereign currencies – e.g., with regard to speed, interoperability, and anonymity – these digital currencies have shown that bottom-up changes to the social institution of money are still possible in principle.Footnote 5 Against this background, it is important to reconsider Menger’s description of how money originally came into being, how it developed, and what factors contributed to its persistence.",

Harper,Anthony M. Endres,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Menger’s theory of wantsFootnote 1 and goods is central to his theoretical construction of the economic system as a whole and the foundation for his theory of subjective consumer valuations in particular. This paper investigates the analytical frameworks articulated by German academic economists in the years before 1871 in order to identify the prevailing paradigm of economic inquiry in which Menger was trained and the surrounding intellectual atmosphere from which he drew inspiration in developing his theory of wants and goods. In a comprehensive survey, Streissler (1990) finds that many of the key ideas in Menger’s Principles are “foreshadowed” (p.33) in standard German economics textbooks in the first half of the nineteenth century, from which Menger “amply borrowed” (p. 32). Indeed, a scan of the works cited in Menger’s Principles shows that he cited predominantly German economists, such as Wilhelm Roscher (Leipzig), Friedrich Hermann (Munich), Albert Schäffle (Vienna) and Karl Heinrich Rau (Heidelberg).Footnote 2 German economics in the nineteenth century was a tradition that maintained a rich body of fundamental principles and doctrines, but it was also open to innovation.Footnote 3 Indeed, it was a “primordial brew” (Streissler and Milford 1993/94: 59) bubbling with original ideas, and it became a seedbed for several new developments in economic theory—one of which is the subject of this paper, Menger’s wants-goods approach to consumer behavior. As part of his study of law at the University of Prague (1860–1863), Menger received an extensive education in German subjectivist economic thought which figured prominently in economics teaching of the time (Milford, 2012: 416). From 1867 onwards, Menger then embarked upon self-directed study of economics as preparation for his Principles by reading and critically examining classic works of his German predecessors (including Rau’s textbook) (Yagi, 1993). The German subjective-value tradition molded Menger’s worldview, his vision of economic processes, his fundamental existential postulates about the make-up of economic reality and his normative ideas on how to do economics.Footnote 4 He inherited their “prescientific vision” of economic reality that affected his perception of which phenomena are worthy of scientific inquiry and his recognition of the character of those human activities and patterns that render them economic.Footnote 5 In particular, this vision led Menger, like the German subjective-value theorists before him, to focus upon wants and goods as two fundamental and interrelated categories of economic theorizing that play a real and significant role in everyday economic affairs. “Human needs, their variety, and the means for their satisfaction had become the starting-point from which the principles of economic life were built up” (Tribe, 1988: 149). German economics in the mid-nineteenth century concerned itself with the basic principles of economic analysis that governed how wants emerge and are satisfied (Tribe, 1988: 174). At a very general level, the essential novelty of this tradition was the unequivocal grounding of all economic phenomena in human wants. Wants and goods were conceived not in isolation but in their relation to human actors whose activities initiate and bring about change. At the core of this vision were the “man-in-relation-to-nature” conception of the economic problem and ontological presuppositions about how human beings are related to the external world. The general idea is that human beings act on the external physical world, they reconfigure it, transforming resources given by raw nature into goods, in order to satisfy their wants and to acquire material wealth (Kirzner, 1960: 41–43). Among the German subjective-value economists, Rau provided one of the clearest statements of this general stance emphasizing human mastery over nature as a defining criterion of the nature of the economic: “Economic activities form a distinct field of human endeavor, which sets itself the goal of the appropriation and the conquest of the external natural order, and it achieves ever greater success with advances in our knowledge of the natural world” (Rau, 1863: 2).Footnote 6 Hermann’s (1832: 1–2) distinction between different types of external goods, according to the degree to which they depend upon natural or human energies for their particular form and spatio-temporal location, is another example of the “man vis-á-vis nature” outlook. Accordingly, Menger’s conception of the wants-goods relationship is also grounded on fundamental ideas about the interaction of human beings and nature: “his focus is on how the general dependence of human beings on the external world is instantiated in a series of narrower dependencies [i.e. in each causal relation] in which specific needs can only be satisfied by particular goods” (Yagi, 1993: 705). The very notion of “goods-character” reflects a relationship between acting individuals and particular segments of the external world (“things”) that are suited to their ends (Menger 1976: 52n). Furthermore, this worldview is also evinced by Menger’s notion of the orders of goods (and the transformation of higher- into lower-order goods) and his discussion of the causes of economic progress (Menger, 1871: 7–9, 28–29; 1976: 56–57, 73–74). Menger explains economic development as a process of ever-increasing control of human consciousness over the production of consumption goods. In the course of economic development, consumption goods shift from being the product of the fortuitous confluence of states of nature to increasingly becoming the intended results of human willpower and knowledge. The fundamental idea of Menger’s theory is that “people value goods because they need them” (Schumpeter, 1952: 83). Alternatively stated, it is the simple proposition that “the value of goods is measured by the importance of the want whose satisfaction is dependent upon the possession of the goods” (Böhm-Bawerk, 1891: 363). Now, as we shall see in our historical survey, this fundamental insight was nothing new; the German economic tradition from Hufeland (1807) onwards had long maintained that people value goods from the perspective of the satisfaction of their personal wants. A distinctive feature shared by all the German textbooks is that they contained extensive conceptual analyses of goods, and to a lesser extent of wants, as well as analyses of other fundamental subjective-value notions, such as use-value, exchange-value, prices, and wealth. This analytical method attempts to examine, clarify and sharpen economic concepts and to specify the conditions for their application. Menger himself referred to this abstract conceptual analysis as “the German tendency toward philosophical penetration of economics” (1976: 307; emphasis added). According to Hayek (1976), these speculations of German economists must have seemed “useless excursions into philosophy” (p.14) to British classical economists of the time who had a much more practical and policy-oriented mindset. But there can be no doubt that these conceptual analyses provided a framework for inquiry by highlighting the classes of scientific problems and the research questions to be investigated. The newly minted subjective-value concepts served as “cognitive anchors” (Jackendoff, 1996) that directed the attention and efforts of German academic economists.Footnote 7 A better grasp of these subjective-value concepts is a crucial step towards a better understanding of the basic entities and processes of the economic system. Given the significance of their contribution, one wonders why the German subjectivists were in general neglected by political economists outside the German-speaking world. We suspect that there are several factors to account for this. First, the German subjective-value economists wrote almost exclusively in German and their main academic output comprised neither monographs nor articles but voluminous textbooks targeted at future politicians, lawmakers and bureaucrats rather than economics scholars. Second, the German economists did not put all the pieces together into a coherent economic theory. Third, some Austrian scholars (e.g. Schumpeter and Mises) had political motives of their own to distance themselves from German economics (see Streissler 1990: 40–41). Finally, although the Historical School (led by Schmoller) co-existed for a time with the German subjective-value tradition, it eventually gained ascendancy in Germany, obtaining control over major academic appointments in economics in German universities and displacing the subjectivist tradition.Footnote 8",1

Founding myths have an important function, they provide guidance, coherence and inspiration to later contributors. Above all, they provide a tradition with a clear (often antagonistic) identity. But founding myths are also misleading, they attribute innovations and contributions to the founder, at the expense of their predecessors. They attribute to the founder more distinctiveness from his contemporaries then he had – even more so when the original context of the founder is disregarded, out of conscious neglect or lack of familiarity. This paper sets out to sort out myth from reality in the originality and distinctiveness of the work of Carl Menger and some of the other early contributors of what became known as the Austrian School. Founding myths are often produced much later, as the political theorist Benedict Anderson so wonderfully demonstrated in his Imagined Communities (Anderson, 1991). Part of the founding myth of the Austrian School is that it arose in opposition to German political economy, or more particularly the German Historical School. The famous dispute over methods, the Methodenstreit, pitted Menger, the revolutionary subjective marginalist, against the empirically minded inductivist relativists of the Historical School. This antagonism has helped to bolster the internal identity of the Austrian School and highlights further distinctive features of the new school. But as social scientists we should of course not mistake them for historical truth. Therefore, we will contextualize Menger in the German-speaking political economy of his time. This has the downside of neglecting the slowly advancing internationalization of the field, but has the upside of not buying into that other founding myth, the marginal revolution (Black et al., 1973; Jaffé, 1976; Hollander, 1982). Our contextualization of Menger highlights three central contributions of Menger to German political economy: the synthetic contribution of his Grundsätze (1871), the theoretical innovation of his Untersuchungen (1883) and the social policy agenda of classical political economy (1891). We suggest here that these contributions created continuity between German-speaking political economy of his time and Adam Smith. In this sense Menger is distinctly anti-revolutionary, especially compared with other contemporaneous approaches in German political economy which consciously sought to break with what came before, most notably the Historical School. These warnings against revolutions in economic theory and political practice make Menger a “marginal revolutionary,” only in the most literal sense of the term: a reformer who – despite the progress he strived for – acknowledged the giants in theory and policy whose shoulders he stood upon. And who – despite all the differences to earlier historical contexts – rejected the uniqueness of his own time. Our characterization and contextualization of Menger make him a good representative of Peter Boettke’s thesis of “mainline economics” (Boettke, 2012).",3

On the centenary of Adam Smith’s death Menger ([1891] 2016, p. 474) remarked how classical political economy had come to be considered as “capitalistic, atomistic, abstract, and against the people” in “German science” due to the attacks it had received from figures such as Friedrich List, Ferdinand Lasalle, “scientific opponents of the progressive bourgeoisie” and other “hateful opponents” and “agitators pursuing practical goals”. In this hostile environment, the centenary of Adam Smith’s death was far from the commemoration of the death of this “great master” (Menger, [1981] 2016, p. 473). Menger’s 1891 press article is to be read, as Erwin Dekker and Stefan Kolev (2016) remind us, within the context of a political battle involving the “roll-back of liberalism, even in the noblest sense of the word” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 475). It is clear for Menger that the perceived refutation and dismissal of the “Smithian system”, associated with the “decline of the old, and the victory of the new political economy”, was “a fact of wide-ranging political significance” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 475). The disconnection of the liberal party from political science had meant, according to Menger, the loss of its “footing and leadership in economic matters as well as its belief in its own economic program” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 475). Menger sets out to straighten misunderstandings letting classical political economy speak for itself and avoiding the prevalent confusion between the Smithian system and Manchesterism, asserting that there is not a “substantive contrast between Social-Politik in Germany” and classical political economy (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 475–81). The one-sidedness of Manchesterism that could be associated with the defense of laissez-faire contrasts with Smith’s clear defense of state intervention against legal privileges that “oppress the poor and the weak in favor of the rich and the powerful” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 475). This strong stance is not contrary to Smith’s praise of individual free initiative in economic matters (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 475). On the contrary, a system of natural liberty, that respects individual decisions and allows individuals, in particular, workers to decide where to live and work following their interest and guided by prudence, is the most beneficial arrangement for “the poor and the weak” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 476). Defending high wages and even state intervention that preserves fair income for the laborers or when individual or class interests “contradict the general interest”, according to Menger ([1891] 2016, p. 476, 480, 482–3), shows that Smith’s stance “is sometimes more progressive than that of any modern ‘Social-Politiker’”, contradicting the prevailing view of a “capitalistic” science “against people” or of Smith as “an enemy of labor” or as a “doctrinaire of ‘laissez faire, laissez aller’” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 477, 480). The difference then between classical political economy and the “modern school of Social-Politik” is not related to their concern about the well-being, associated with labor conditions, of wage earners but rather to the level of state intervention needed to counter and dismount existing institutional privileges contrary to this aim (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 482). Moreover, this difference should be traced to the historical context in which each school developed, explaining Smith’s and his disciples’ focus on a “negative” rather than a positive program (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 482–3). A central point, however, that remains true for Menger and shows the superiority of classical political economy over Social-Politik, is its understanding of the causes of well-being of the working classes, in particular, “the progressive accumulation of capital and [on] the entrepreneurial spirit” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 484). Increasing wages depend on “capital accumulation and an increase in productive activities” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 484). The important difference, and where the superiority of classical political economy lies, according to Menger, is that it does not advantage any particular class interest and thus avoids “class struggle that, as seen from the perspective of society as a whole, is unproductive” (Menger, [1891] 2016, p. 487). This neutrality can be associated precisely with the connection between capital accumulation, the advancement of productive processes and the improvement in living conditions and well-being. Menger’s vindication of Smith only focuses on the latter’s concern for the material conditions of the laboring poor. Menger leaves aside the accusation of Smith’s atomism. But it is not only because Smith aims at explaining why market society offers better opportunities and living conditions to wage earners that his theory is not atomistic. It is especially because his theory considers individuals as social beings, beyond being part of a certain social class, that Smith cannot be accused of atomism, even if Menger does not recognize it. The concern Menger recognizes in Smith about the living conditions of all members of society and which he associates with the connection between capital accumulation, production processes, and living conditions can be found in Menger from the foundations of his explanation of economic laws. Living conditions can be improved when more advanced production processes allow satisfying more needs for more people. This is directly based on his theory of value, which establishes a causal connection between the ability of a good to satisfy human needs and its value.",

Considerations out of Carl Menger,June 2023,Erik W. Matson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economics and ethics are difficult to disentangle, most immediately because all people have ethical beliefs about economic phenomena. At a deeper level, the entanglement comes largely from the fact that both economics and ethics reflect on values and deal with various notions of “goods.” In most of its contemporary forms, economics generally considers value-in-exchange and its implication for trade, production, and distribution. Ethics generally considers what people ought to do and want. As a result of their close relation and use of similar terms—e.g. “utility,” “desire,” “benefit,” “good,” “bad,” “welfare,” “consequence”—there is a mutual tendency among economists and ethicists towards imperialism. At least since Hobbes, some philosophers and political economists have instrumentalized ethics as strategies of cooperation to be deconstructed and rationalized through analytical models. Especially in the twentieth century, some economists subsumed ethics within economics on the basis of the observation that the value of so-called “ethical” actions is subject to circumstance and the law of diminishing returns (e.g. Becker, 1981). The desirability of so-called ethical conduct, on some economist’s reckoning, in other words is “incrementally variable” (see discussion in Grassl, 2011, 169). Ethicists, on the other hand, often seem to view economic analysis abstracted from considerations of moral imperatives as degraded and misguided. Even some economists join with the ethicists in claiming that studying economics, as it is often taught, might lead students to inappropriately disregard ethical dimensions of market relations (see, e.g., Frey et al., 1993; Rubinstein, 2006). Economic approaches to ethics and ethical perspectives on economics can be enlightening in their own ways. But they are each incomplete, partially dependent modes of discourse. Certain ethical phenomena cannot be reasonably ignored by economists who seek to understand causal relations in the nexus of exchange and production relations; nor should descriptive economic theory be ignored by ethicists. In the present essay, through reflections on the methodological perspectives of Carl Menger, and drawing on ideas in early modern political economists and some findings from contemporary behavioral economics, I discuss some interpenetrations of economics and ethics. As a response to the ideas of the German historical school, Menger attempts, in his Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences, to advance a universal science of economics, the truths of which are not dependent on historical circumstance (Section 2). An implication of Menger’s methodology is a demarcation between economics and ethics (Section 3). The demarcation between economics and ethics as Menger presents it is problematic for a number of reasons, the main reason being that people are ethical-rule-following beings whose interests depend in part upon learned behavioral norms and situational context (Section 4). The observation of our rule-conforming tendencies has implications for institutional analysis in economics (Section 5). These implications were explored by earlier political economists, including Adam Smith; they have been revisited in contemporary behavioral and experimental economics (Section 6). Two points of significance for contemporary economics emerge from the discussion. We should expect rules—formal and informal—to act not only as constraints but, in some circumstances, to influence individual interests themselves. Second, ethical sensibilities are not just part of the explandum in economic theory but, in certain instances, can be part of the explanation (Section 7).",
36.0,2.0,The Review of Austrian Economics,04 November 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-022-00605-9,"Carl menger on economic policy: “Exact laws,” institutional prerequisites, and economic liberalism",June 2023,Richard Ebeling,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Menger reasoned that value is not intrinsic to a good; it does not result from a quantity of labor that may have done into its manufacture. Value arises out of a human evaluation of the degree of usefulness and importance a good may have under conditions of scarcity. At the same time, goods are not evaluated in terms of categories of goods, e.g., water versus diamonds. Instead, they are judged in terms of discrete or “marginal” amounts of each particular good used and consumed. And, finally, the marginal usefulness or importance of any unit of a particular good acquired in succession is less (or diminishes) with each additional unit used or consumed. Strangely enough, while explaining this idea in clear, if somewhat excruciatingly methodical, detail, Menger gives no name to this concept and theory of decision-making. That was left to Wieser who coined the term grenznutzen, or “marginal utility,” as it generally came to be translated into English. However, given the particular meaning that clearly was in Menger’s (and Wieser’s) mind, a more precise translation consistent with the German word, “grenznutzen” might have been, “marginal use.” For the Austrians, “utility” did not imply infinitely small quantities of “pleasure” that were in any way equated “at the margin” in balancing desired alternative combinations of goods. In Menger’s famous table of wants ([1871] 1968, p. 93; [1871] 1950, p. 127), he assigns numbers of descending importance for each unit within the categories of particular goods. But the explanation of their meaning makes it fairly clear that they reflect orderings of importance within a category and in the complementary orderings between the categories in making marginal decisions for overall satisfaction of the individual’s wants. The “marginal use” was an ordinal ranking of discrete amounts of wanted goods, and not infinitely small amounts of either goods or satisfaction.Footnote 5 In the attention paid to the particular Mengerian approach, several themes are usually emphasized. First, was Menger’s adamant insistence on the necessity to explain social and market phenomena through the methodological individualist method of reducing the complexity of social and market interactions and institutions to their, as he put it, “simplest elements that can still be subjected to accurate observation” and to, then, “investigate the manner in which the more complex economic phenomena evolve from their elements according to definite principles.” ([1871] 1950, pp. 46–47) This meant understanding that man is driven by his “drives” to satisfy his wants. In doing so, individuals pursue the satisfaction of desired ends through the use and application of discovered means. (p. 77) But an individual soon confronts one of three situations: a circumstance in which the means useful and available exceed the ends they might serve; one in which the means are just sufficient to serve the wanted ends; or one in which the means are insufficient in their quantities and qualities to serve and satisfy all the ends for which they might be employed. In the first case, the means are non-economic goods, that is, they do not have to be “economized” since the loss of any given amount does not impede the full satisfaction of the particular ends in question. In the second and third cases, the acting individual must economize – that is, do all that he can to not diminish the quantity or reduce the qualities of the available supply of means, since to do so would mean some end(s) for which they might be utilized will go unsatisfied. (pp. 94–98) This, in turn, requires the acting individual to arrange his ends in a ranking of descending order of importance, with diminishing marginal importance of each additional end satisfied or fulfilled with an additional unit of the means being available. The complementarity of the competing types of ends for which available means might be applied is seen by the fact that (as in Menger’s table of wants) combinations of different wants are satisfied through a weighing of the ranked (marginal) degree of satisfaction in any one type or category of want relative to others. Thus, Menger integrates both the substitutability and the complementarity of different and competing ends for the acting individual to establish an optimal combination, given the available means with their alternative uses. (pp. 122–139) From this, Menger advances to his theory of exchange and gains from trade. Individuals discover that, at the margin, they may, respectively, be holding quantities of goods which they value less highly than some amount of another good in the possession of a potential trading partner. By giving up some amount of their own good in exchange for some amount of a different good in the possession of another, they each improve their personal circumstance with no loss to either one. Indeed, trade ceases when either one or both consider that one more “round” of exchange would make them worse rather than better off. Thus, freedom of exchange is always mutually beneficial. (pp. 181–190) Menger, then, proceeds to explain how such a theory of mutual gains from trade under either one-sided or two-sided competition brings into focus the logic of supply and demand, and the formation of market prices. With either one- or two-sided competition, prices fall within a definable range of the marginal valuations of the buyers to acquire and the marginal willingness of the sellers to part with the good in question. (pp. 197–225)",
