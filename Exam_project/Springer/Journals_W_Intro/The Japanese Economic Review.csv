How robust is that equilibrium? The classical refinements literature (building on Selten 1965, 1975) asks whether that equilibrium may still be played when players “tremble” in their choice of actions. Specifically, does there exist a sequence of full support trembles that justifies the equilibrium play? The normal form refinements literature considers robustness to more complicated action trembles (Myerson 1978) and also robustness to small changes in the game’s payoffs (Kohlberg and Mertens 1986). Kreps (1990) and others have argued that the classical refinements literature is flawed because there is no explanation for the trembles. Rather, we should build “complete” theories in which the trembles are endogenously explained: this at least allows us to have an unambiguous interpretation of the refinement. This viewpoint is embodied in two papers, Fudenberg et al. (1988) and Dekel and Fudenberg (1990), that critique existing refinements. The “higher-order beliefs” literature has considered a related question. In analyzing a complete information game, we implicitly assume that payoffs are common knowledge. Which Nash equilibria are robust to a lack of common knowledge? Specifically, which equilibria have the property that they remain equilibria whenever the common knowledge assumption is weakened a little? Rubinstein (1989) demonstrates that even strict Nash equilibria (which survive all the usual refinements) may not be robust to an (intuitively) small lack of common knowledge. Monderer and Samet (1989) introduce a notion of approximate common knowledge that is sufficient to make strict equilibria robust. Kajii and Morris (1997a) ask which Nash equilibria of a complete information game may be equilibrium play of every incomplete information game where payoffs are almost always given by the original complete information game. Many complete information games have no robust equilibria in this sense. This includes games with a unique Nash equilibrium that is strict. But if a game has a unique correlated equilibrium, it is a robust Nash equilibrium and a many-player many-action generalization of risk dominance is also sufficient for robustness. This paper describes a simple framework for relating together all the above results. Our “canonical elaboration” approach, which builds on Fudenberg et al. (1988), works as follows. Fix a complete information game. A canonical elaboration of that complete information game is an incomplete information game with the same players and action sets for each player. Each type of each player is either a “standard” type, whose payoffs are exactly as in the complete information game, or a “committed” type, who has a dominant strategy to play one of the actions of the original game. Importantly, we allow for a large (possibly infinite) number of standard types: although they do not differ in payoffs, they will typically have different beliefs and higher-order beliefs about others’ payoffs. To see this, consider the following example. There are two actions, a and \(a^{\prime }\). Player 1 has two possible standard types, \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{1}^{\prime }\), and two possible committed types, a and \(a^{\prime }\). Player 2 has only one possible standard type \(t_{2}\), and two possible committed types, a and \(a^{\prime }\). Nature chooses a type profile with assigned probability as shown in the table below. Player 1’s type\player 2’s type \(t_{2}\) a \(a^{\prime }\) \(t_{1}\) \(1-2\varepsilon\) 0 0 \(t_{1}^{\prime }\) \(\varepsilon\) \(\varepsilon\) 0 a 0 0 0 \(a^{\prime }\) 0 0 0 In any case, player 1 is standard with probability 1, thus his payoffs are given by the complete information game. But the two types have different beliefs: if he is of type \(t_{1}\), he is sure that his opponent is standard. But if he is of type \(t_{1}^{\prime }\), he will think that player 2 may be committed to play action a with (conditional) probability 1/2. This in turn implies that type \(t_{1}\) of player 1 is sure that player 2 attaches probability \(\frac{\varepsilon }{1-\varepsilon }\) to player 1 attaching probability \(\frac{1}{2}\) to player 2 being committed to action a. Thus even though type \(t_{1}\) is sure that player 2 is not committed to action a, that possibility is relevant to his higher-order (specifically, second-order) beliefs. An incomplete information game elaboration of the complete information game is then parameterized completely by a probability distribution over type profiles. We are concerned with sequences of canonical elaborations where, in the limit, types are standard with probability one. For instance, we obtain such a sequence by letting \(\varepsilon\) go to zero in the example above. We will look at Bayesian–Nash equilibria of the incomplete information game elaboration, hence we will be assuming that players are always rational and there are no exogenous trembles. A probability distribution over actions (or action distribution) is a limit equilibrium action distribution (for some given complete information game and canonical elaboration sequence) if it represents the limit of the action distributions generated by equilibria of the elaboration sequence. Because each player has many standard types, correlation is possible in the limit of the elaborations. Thus any limit equilibrium action distribution is a correlated equilibrium of the original complete information game. In this framework, we can formalize the generic question we want to ask as follows: Fix a complete information game. Which action distributions are limit equilibrium action distributions of some (all) canonical elaboration sequences satisfying some property in higher -order beliefs? We can understand each of the above literatures by varying the restrictions we put on elaboration sequences and whether we require robustness to some or all such sequences. Our results can be summarized in the following table (a more detailed summary is given in the conclusion). We write NE for Nash equilibria and CE for correlated equilibria.  Class of elaboration Type of robustness Robust to all sequences Justified by some full support sequence No restrictions 1. Not all strict NE 2. Risk dominant NE 3. Unique CE Undominated CE Limit common knowledge Strict NE Undominated CE Limit Independence Strict NE Undominated NE Independence Strictly perfect NE Perfect NE For the left hand column, we ask which behavior is a limiting equilibrium action distribution for all sequences satisfying progressively stronger properties. Since we are requiring robustness to all sequences, we thus weaken the refinement as we impose stronger restrictions. If we impose no extra restrictions on the elaborations (beyond the requirement that standard types are assigned probability one in the limit) then we get the result (in the spirit of Rubinstein 1989) that even strict equilibria may not be robust; a many-person many-action generalization of risk dominance (Harsanyi and Selten 1988) is a sufficient condition (Kajii and Morris 1997a; see also Carlsson and van Damme 1993a). A unique correlated equilibrium is also robust (Kajii and Morris 1997a). Now suppose that we add extra requirements to the elaboration sequence. Limit common knowledge requires that for all \(p<1\), the probability that there is common p beliefFootnote 1 that all types are standard also tends to one. All strict equilibria are robust to limit common knowledge elaborations (Monderer and Samet 1989). Limit independence requires that the probability distribution over types is independent in the limit. Interestingly, limit independence implies limit common knowledge, so strict equilibria are robust also to limit independent elaborations. Independence requires that all elaborations are independent (at the limit and before the limit). Robustness to all independent elaborations is equivalent to strict perfection in the sense of Okada (1981). Strict perfection is equivalent to requiring a singleton strategy profile to be stable (Kohlberg and Mertens 1986). For the right hand column, we ask which behavior is the limiting equilibrium action distribution for some sequence which puts full support (away from the limit) on all committed type profiles and also satisfies the sequence of progressively stronger properties introduced above. Now as we strengthen the restriction on the sequence we strengthen the refinement. If we put no additional restrictions on the elaboration sequence, the full support requirement implies that no dominated actions are played. An argument of Fudenberg et al. (1988) shows that any undominated correlated equilibrium (a correlated equilibrium where dominated strategies are assigned probability zero) is the limit equilibrium action distribution of some full support elaboration sequence. Thus an action distribution is justified by some full support elaboration if and only if it is an undominated correlated equilibrium. Adding the limit common knowledge requirement does not affect this argument. However, requiring limit independence implies that we must have Nash equilibrium in the limit: thus an action distribution is justified by some full support limit independent elaboration if and only if it is an undominated Nash equilibrium. Finally, requiring independence along the sequence makes the canonical elaboration equivalent to the action trembles of Selten (1975). Thus an action distribution is justified by some full support independent elaboration if and only if it is perfect. This paper lays out these arguments in essentially this order. We first introduce our notion of canonical elaborations (Sect. 2) and review some techniques and Lemmas from the higher-order beliefs literature that we will exploit (Sect. 3). We survey results concerning robustness to all elaborations in Sect. 4 and review refinements which are justified by some full support elaboration in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes. Before we start, let us highlight some limitations of our exercise. The “canonical elaborations” we consider are very simple. In particular, it would make sense to allow “standard types” to have a small amount of uncertainty about their own payoffs; similarly, it would make sense to allow types with very different payoffs who are not necessarily committed to a particular action. We allow neither. We consider simple elaborations because they are sufficient to explain the relation between the literatures we survey; put differently, we believe that the issues raised by considering more complicated elaborations are orthogonal to the main conceptual issues in these literatures. Nonetheless, we do not want to claim they are in any sense the “right” elaborations to consider. Papers such as Fudenberg et al. (1988), Dekel and Fudenberg (1990) and the survey paper of Dekel and Gul (1997) consider different classes of elaborations and discuss their justifications. In analyzing our canonical elaborations, we assume that players have common prior beliefs and play according to some (Bayesian) Nash equilibrium. We thus ignore two sets of issues studied in the literature. First, when and how can assumptions on knowledge and higher-order knowledge justify equilibrium assumptions (e.g., Aumann 1987; Brandenburger and Dekel 1987; Aumann and Brandenburger 1995)? Second, which refinements can be justified even before making equilibrium/common prior assumptions (e.g., Börgers 1994; Dekel and Fudenberg 1990; Gul 1996)? This is a survey. We sketch proofs and cite close but not identical proofs in the literature. While our interpretation of results may differ from the literatures we survey, almost all the results are out there even if we do not cite them correctly. We believe that many researchers have thought about “complete theory” issues in refinements but we are not sure of the appropriate citations. In many cases, there are large gaps between the necessary and sufficient conditions we report. In some cases (such as Sect. 4.1) we have tried hard elsewhere to fill these gaps (without success). In other cases (such as Sects. 4.2 and 4.3) there may be existing results or easy arguments that we have missed.",3

Ui (2001) provided a sufficient condition based on the idea of potential games, and Morris and Ui (2005) provided a number of sufficient conditions based on notions of generalized potential games. Since then, a variety of new sufficient conditions for robustness have been developed: examples include Oyama and Tercieux (2009) and Nora and Uno (2014). KM1997 showed that risk dominance was both necessary and sufficient for robustness to incomplete information in two-player two-action games. The literature mentioned above has provided stronger sufficient conditions but not necessary conditions. Oyama and Takahashi (2019) provided necessary and sufficient conditions for robustness in many player, two-action, asymmetric payoff, supermodular games. KM1997 also showed that if there is a unique correlated equilibrium, it must be robust. The logic behind it is completely different from the sufficient conditions mentioned above. Einy et al. (2019) showed that a unique correlated equilibrium is fully characterized by a stronger notion of robustness. The solution concept of KM1997 imposed the requirement that an incomplete information elaboration of a complete information game was close to a complete information game if, with high probability, players know that payoffs are given by the complete information game. If one replaces “know” with “believe with high probability”, similar results reported in the paper hold, and there was a somewhat arbitrary modeling choice. In this sense, the robust equilibrium is continuous with respect to limiting beliefs for fixed payoffs. 
Haimanko and Kajii (2016) showed, however, that it is not continuous in payoffs, i.e., the solution correspondence which maps the complete information game’s payoffs to robust equilibria is not upper hemicontinuous at some games. An equilibrium strategy profile in an incomplete information game is an \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium of any nearby game, and so demanding an equilibrium in each elaboration was too stringent. Haimanko and Kajii (2016) then showed that if the notion is weakened by considering \( \varepsilon \)-equilibria in an incomplete information elaboration for arbitrarily small \(\varepsilon \), then this weaker robust equilibrium is upper hemicontinuous in payoffs. Carmona (2018) examined robust equilibria in an abstract setting from the perspective of generic continuity of the solution correspondence. In KM1997, we examined the robustness of singleton Nash equilibria to incomplete information. It is very natural to look at a set-based notion of robustness: do there exist a set of correlated equilibria of a complete information game with the property that every incomplete information game where payoffs are almost always given by that complete information have an equilibrium where play is in that set of correlated equilibria? The set of all correlated equilibria automatically satisfy this property, but the interesting question is whether there are interesting sufficient conditions for a small set to be robust in this sense. 
Morris and Ui (2005) formally defined a set-based version of robustness and provide a number of sufficient conditions based on notions of generalized potential games. The canonical elaborations studied in our unified survey were invented for a clean exposition of the role of the infection argument and the critical path result in KM1997. Because of the additional structure, the set of canonical elaborations is smaller than that of general elaborations considered in KM1997, thus the robustness in the survey is in principle a weaker concept. While this does not matter for the results reported in the survey, the distinction turned out to be important in later work. For instance, Ui (2001) established that potentially maximizing Nash equilibria of potential games are robust to canonical elaborations, but not for general elaborations. Whether or not the robustness to canonical elaborations is equivalent to the robustness in KM1997 in general then remained an open question for many years. Recently, Pram (2019) gave one answer by showing that for the modified correlated equilibrium version of robustness, there is equivalence. On the other hand, Takahashi (2019) provided an example establishing the failure of equivalence under the original definition, although the counterexample works for the set-valued version of robustness. As we wrote earlier, the survey paper was valuable because of its unified framework. However, the survey was only about normal form games, whereas the majority of the refinements literature is inspired by extensive form games (and thus non-generic normal form games). An important recent paper of Takahashi and Tercieux (2018) studied—in the language of our survey—“robustness to all limit common knowledge elaborations” and developed a number of important tight characterizations of the connection between robustness and classical perturbation refinements in the tradition of Kohlberg and Mertens (1986). In particular, they show (roughly, translated into our language) that hyperstability is sufficient for robustness to all limit independent elaborations, that essentiality is sufficient for robustness to all canonical singleton elaborations and that stability is equivalent to robustness to all canonical, independent, singleton, known own payoff elaborations.",2

Kajii and Morris (1997a) introduce the notion of robustness to all elaborations. They say that an equilibrium of a complete-information game is robust to all elaborations if every nearby incomplete-information game, called an elaboration, admits a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a neighborhood of the equilibrium. In their unpublished paper, Kajii and Morris (1997b) propose other notions of robustness based on various subclasses of elaborations, among which is the class of canonical elaborations. A canonical elaboration is an elaboration where each type has either the same payoff function as in the complete-information game (a “normal” type) or a strictly dominant action (a “commitment” type). Canonical elaborations have played an important role in the literature. In fact, to date, whenever the literature establishes the non-robustness of a given equilibrium to all elaborations, it does so by constructing canonical elaborations with no Bayesian Nash equilibrium near the equilibrium. Examples include Rubinstein (1989), Example 3.1 and Lemma 5.5 in Kajii and Morris (1997a), Oyama and Takahashi (2011), and Section 5.1.2 in Haimanko and Kajii (2016). Subsequently, Ui (2001) shows that if a game admits a potential with a unique maximizer, then the potential maximizer is robust to canonical elaborations. However, he neither proves nor disproves whether the potential maximizer is robust to all elaborations, and leaves open whether robustness to canonical elaborations is a strictly weaker notion than robustness to all elaborations (Ui 2001, footnote 6). Morris and Ui (2005) extend the two notions of robustness—robustness to all elaborations and to canonical elaborations—to the respective set-valued notions, and show that the set of (generalized) potential maximizers is robust to canonical elaborations. Nonetheless, Ui’s problem remains open (Morris and Ui 2005, footnote 9). Recently, Pram (2019) replaces the solution concept used in elaborations, from Bayesian Nash equilibrium to agent-normal-form correlated equilibrium, and shows that the two notions of robustness are equivalent.Footnote 1 In this paper, I show that in a minimal diversity game introduced by Balkenborg and Vermeulen (2016), the set of potential maximizers is robust to canonical elaborations, but not to all elaborations. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first example to demonstrate that the set-valued notion of robustness to canonical elaborations is strictly weaker than the set-valued notion of robustness to all elaborations. This example also implies that Pram’s (2019) equivalence result, at least if it is extended to the respective set-valued robustness notions, relies on the use of correlation devices.",4
71,1,The Japanese Economic Review,03 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-019-00005-y,Robust predictions under finite depth of reasoning,January 2020,Kota Murayama,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Consider a 2/3-guessing game in which participants choose an integer between 0 and 100 and whoever picks the number closest to 2/3 of the group average wins a prize. This game can be solved by iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies, and the unique rationalizable action is to choose 0. However, a number of experiments show that participants typically solve this game using inductive reasoning and choose non-zero numbers such as 66, 33, and 22. One of the most prevalent models that features inductive reasoning is a finite depth of reasoning (FDR) model such as the level-k and cognitive hierarchy models (Stahl and Wilson 1994; Nagel 1995; Camerer et al. 2004). This model makes two distinctive assumptions. First, each player has an anchor behavior and it is commonly known.Footnote 1 Second, each player has a reasoning level as his type, and believes that other players have lower reasoning levels.Footnote 2 Then, we can naturally define an inductive solution for each game: level-1 (L1) types best respond to the anchor, level-2 (L2) types best respond to a combination of the anchor and the best responses of L1 types, and so forth. In the 2/3-guessing game, if the anchor is 50, L1 types choose 33 and L2 types choose 22. Clearly, anchor behavior plays a crucial role in determining players’ behavior in the FDR model. However, many strategic situations do not admit an anchor upon which players can confidently agree. For instance, Burchardi and Penczynski (2014) report that there were subjects who used 50, 66, and 100 as an anchor in the 2/3 guessing game. If there are multiple candidates for the anchor, the common knowledge assumption becomes less compelling, since it implies that players commonly know which anchor to be used. The purpose of this paper is to examine how predictions of the FDR model are sensitive to the violation of the common knowledge assumption. This paper provides a general framework to analyze the robustness of predictions to small uncertainty about an anchor behavior. From the perspective of an analyst, we have the following scenario in mind. An analyst is almost certain that a particular FDR model describes the relevant strategic environment; however, she suspects that players might consider other possibilities of anchor behaviors. Under this situation, if the prediction is known to be robust, any model with uncertainty admits the approximately same prediction (in a probabilistic sense) as long as its anchor is close to the original one with high probability. Our main result gives a sufficient condition for the robustness. We provide an upper bound on beliefs about other players’ reasoning levels that makes a given prediction robust. For instance, consider an FDR model whose underlying game is given by a two-player, two-action game with two strict Nash equilibria. We show that the risk-dominated prediction, in which every type follows the risk-dominated Nash equilibrium, is robust in the cognitive hierarchy model, but not in the level-k model. This result highlights a distinction between the two prominent FDR models in the sensitivity of predictions to the violation of the common knowledge assumption. More formally, an (FDR) model is a combination of a game with anchor behavior (a game for short) in which each player is endowed with an anchor behavior and a set of reasoning levels (or types). An equilibrium of this model is described above. Our robustness test proceeds as follows: fix a model and its equilibrium \(s^{*}\). We embed this model by introducing incomplete information about its anchor behavior. The embedding model is said to be close to the original model if the anchor behavior remains the same and each player knows that with high probability.Footnote 3 We say that \(s^{*}\) is robust if each close embedding model has an equilibrium in which \(s^{*}\) is played with high probability. The first sufficient condition utilizes a relation between the robustness and beliefs about other players’ reasoning levels. We define a \({{\varvec{p}}}=(p_{1}, \ldots , p_{I})\)-dominant equilibrium analogously to the standard \(\mathbf p\)-dominance for the underlying game.Footnote 4 We show that any\(\mathbf p\)-dominant equilibrium is robust if there exists a threshold level \(\bar{c}\), such that any higher level type of players than \(\bar{c}\) puts sufficiently small probability (decreasing in \(\mathbf p\)) on his opponents having levels no lower than \(\bar{c}\). As a corollary, a \(\mathbf p\)-dominant equilibrium in the level-k model is shown to be robust if \(\sum _{i=1, \ldots ,I}p_{i}< 1\), and any \(\mathbf p\)-dominant equilibrium with \(\mathbf p \in [0, 1)^{I}\) is robust in the cognitive hierarchy model for any probability distribution over types. For the second result, we say that a model is dominance solvable if the model yields a unique action for sufficiently high-level types through the iterated deletion of never best responses. We show that a strict equilibrium of the dominance solvable model is robust. Particularly, the level-k model is dominance solvable if and only if its underlying game is dominance solvable in the usual sense. Hence, the level-k model with a dominance solvable game gives a robust prediction generically in payoffs. Our notion of robustness is based on Kajii and Morris (1997), who study the robustness of equilibria to a violation of common knowledge about payoffs (hereafter, KM robustness). The main difference from the present paper is that while they consider a complete information game and introduce payoff uncertainty, we start from the FDR model and introduce uncertainty in anchor behavior. Since beliefs about reasoning levels affect the “contagion” of perturbed anchor behaviors, the sufficient conditions for our robustness are sensitive to how we specify the beliefs. 
Strzalecki (2014) also obtains a similar result in Rubinstein’s (1989) email game. He shows that coordination is achieved after exchanging a finite number of messages if the player’s belief on high-level types is bounded. Our bound works not only for the email game, but also for other underlying games. Thus, the distinction between the level-k and cognitive hierarchy models exists in a much broader context. In addition, the obtained bound is expressed as a function of the “strength” of equilibrium (i.e., \(\mathbf p\)-dominance) and the number of players, and is independent of a particular information structure. As a result, we can show how small \(\mathbf p\) should be to make a \(\mathbf p\)-dominant equilibrium robust for a given type space. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we discuss the relations of this paper to other studies. Section 3 introduces our framework. Section 4 presents a motivating example. In Sects. 5 and 6, we provide the two sufficient conditions. Section 7 discusses some extensions. All proofs are shown in “Appendix”.",
71,1,The Japanese Economic Review,23 August 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-019-00003-0,The Lucas imperfect information model with imperfect common knowledge,January 2020,Takashi Ui,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the Lucas imperfect information model (Lucas 1972, 1973), which formalizes the idea of Phelps (1970), markets are decentralized and agents in each market have only limited information about prices in other markets. As a consequence, output responds to unanticipated monetary shocks; that is, imperfect information about prices generates real effects of money. However, if monetary shocks are anticipated, no real effects arise. This implies that monetary shocks cannot have lasting effects, which is considered to be a serious shortcoming of the Lucas model. This shortcoming is attributed to the assumption that all agents share information about the economy except the prices in their own markets (Townsend 1983; Phelps 1983); that is, the information is common knowledge. Based on this observation, Woodford (2003) introduces a model departing from the Lucas model in three respects: (i) agents have idiosyncratic private information; (ii) they adopt a monopolistically-competitive pricing framework; and (iii) information processing is dynamic. Then, he demonstrates the persisting real effects numerically. In his model, the problem to find a solution is complicated, but the solution can be obtained numerically. In this paper, we introduce a model departing from the Lucas model in one aspect: agents are allowed to have any combination of information as imperfect common knowledge. More specifically, we study the Lucas model with arbitrary Gaussian information structures. Thus, the underlying model is simpler than that of Woodford (2003), but the information structure is more general. Our approach has two advantages. First, we follow the standard formulation of the Lucas model, also appearing in textbooks such as Romer (2019), and thus the role of information in our model is more plainly understood when it is compared to that in the original model. Next, we can provide a closed-form solution for each Gaussian information structure, which enables us to study the role of information analytically. On the other hand, the Lucas model has no dynamics, which is the limitation of our approach. This paper focuses on the impact of imperfect common knowledge on the real effects in one period rather than that on the lasting effects over multiple periods. First, we demonstrate that the real effects consist of the unanticipated shock effect and the (dispersedly) anticipated shock effect. The expected value of the unanticipated shock effect equals zero, but that of the anticipated shock effect does not. Thus, the anticipated shock effect is indeed anticipated, but the expected value differs across different markets. We also show that the anticipated effect is composed of a private information effect, which depends upon the prediction in each market, and an imperfect common knowledge effect, which depends upon the aggregate prediction. Next, we focus on the information structure in which agents receive a combination of a (common) public signal and a (idiosyncratic) private signal. In this case, the private information effect is a linear combination of a private signal and an unobserved monetary shock, and the imperfect common knowledge effect is a linear combination of a public signal and an unobserved monetary shock. The real effects are largest when either signal does not convey any information about monetary shocks, and they disappear when either signal reveals monetary shocks as common knowledge. However, when the precision of private information is fixed, the real effects are small not only when a public signal contains very precise information but also when it contains very imprecise information. Thus, a more precise public signal can amplify the real effects and make the economy more volatile. The intuition behind this result can be understood in terms of the law of large numbers. When a public signal is very imprecise, agents mainly use idiosyncratic private signals in predicting monetary shocks, and thus the aggregate prediction is very precise by the law of large numbers, thereby reducing the aggregate uncertainty and the real effects. In contrast, when a public signal is not so imprecise, agents use a public signal as well, and thus, the aggregate prediction correlated with a public signal is less precise by the failure of the law of large numbers, amplifying the aggregate uncertainty and the real effects. Finally, we show that the predicted aggregate price level in each market in the Lucas model is mathematically equivalent to a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian game studied by Radner (1962). This observation is useful, because the existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium are implied by those in the corresponding Bayesian game. When the number of separated markets is infinite, the corresponding Bayesian game is given by a beauty contest game studied by Morris and Shin (2002). Morris and Shin (2002) also point out a similar connection: they consider a modified version of the Lucas model which requires each separated market to clear and show that the price in each market corresponds to an equilibrium action in a beauty contest game. Thus, our discussion complements the discussion of Morris and Shin (2002) by showing that, in the case of the standard Lucas model which requires the aggregate market to clear, the predicted aggregate price level in each market corresponds to an equilibrium action in a beauty contest game. Note the difference between the predicted aggregate price level in each market and the price in each market: this difference determines the level of supply in each market in the Lucas model. The impact of public information discussed in this paper is also independently found by Hellwig (2002) and Amato and Shin (2003) for the model of Woodford (2003), as noted in Hellwig (2008). It is also related to the main finding of Morris and Shin (2002). Morris and Shin (2002) examine the mean squared error of the equilibrium action of each player from the state as a measure of a welfare loss in a beauty contest game and show that it can increase with the precision of public information. In contrast, we examine the variance of output in the Lucas model as a measure of the real effects, which is shown to be equivalent to the mean squared error of the aggregate equilibrium action from the state in a beauty contest game, and show that it can increase with the precision of public information. The organization of this paper is as follows. We introduce the model in Sect. 2. Assuming symmetric Gaussian information structures, we obtain the market equilibrium in a closed form in Sect. 3. Then, we study the impact of public information on the real effects in Sect. 4. Section 5 is devoted to the connection between the Lucas model and Bayesian games studied by Radner (1962) and Morris and Shin (2002).",

For example, under the “regional cap” policy in Japanese medical residency matching, each region of the country is subject to a regional cap. That is, each region is assigned an upper-bound constraint on the total number of residents placed in the region. This policy was introduced to regulate the geographical distribution of doctors, which was considered to be concentrated too heavily in urban areas at the expense of rural areas. Measures that are mathematically isomorphic to the regional cap policy can be found in a wide range of contexts, such as graduate school admission in China, college admission in several European countries, residency match in the UK, and teacher assignment in Scotland.Footnote 1 Motivated by these real-life examples, Kamada and Kojima (2015) study the design of matching markets under distributional constraints. As standard stability may conflict with distributional constraints, they propose a relaxed stability concept. They show that existing mechanisms result in instability and inefficiency and offer a mechanism that finds a stable and efficient matching and is (group) strategy-proof for doctors while respecting the distributional constraints. A major limitation of that paper, though, is that their stability concept is closely tailored to a particular governmental goal to equalize the numbers of doctors across hospitals beyond target capacities. Although such a goal may be appealing in some contexts as a first-order concern, it may not be appropriate in other applications because hospital capacities in a given region may vary wildly. For example, the maximum and the minimum capacities of hospitals in Tokyo are 69 and 2, respectively (see Fig. 1). For public elementary schools in Boston, the maximum and the minimum capacities of schools are 871 and 165, respectively (see Fig. 2).Footnote 2 In such cases, it may be more appropriate to equalize the ratio between the numbers of doctors (beyond the targets) and the capacities across hospitals. The data are taken from Japan Residency Matching Program (2013) The hospital capacities in Tokyo. The data are taken from Boston Public Schools (2013) The school capacities in public elementary schools in Boston. There may be other reasonable policy goals as well. For instance, the government may wish to give a priority to some hospitals within a region over others for a variety of reasons.Footnote 3 Thus, it is clear from these examples that focusing on a particular policy goal limits the practical applicability of the model of Kamada and Kojima (2015).Footnote 4 To accommodate a wide range of policy goals, we offer a model in which each region is endowed with “regional preferences” over distributions of doctors within the region. The idea behind this modeling approach is to express policy goals as regional preferences, and accommodate different types of policy goals by changing regional preferences.Footnote 5 Then, we define a stability concept that takes the regional preferences into account. A result by Kamada and Kojima (2018) implies that, under some regularity conditions, their flexible deferred acceptance mechanism finds a stable (and efficient) matching and it is group strategy-proof for doctors. This paper offers three sets of results. First, we show that the stability notion of Kamada and Kojima (2015) is a special case of our stability concept. More specifically, their concept is a case of our stability notion in which the regional preferences satisfy a condition called the “Rawlsian” property. Moreover, when the regional preferences are Rawlsian, our flexible deferred acceptance mechanism reduces to the mechanism of Kamada and Kojima (2015). Thus, we establish the main results of Kamada and Kojima (2015) as a special case. Second, we formalize a wide range of policy goals to demonstrate that they can be described by our regional preferences. Consequently, we establish that the corresponding flexible deferred acceptance mechanisms find a stable matching with respect to those regional preferences. Third, we prove several policy-relevant comparative statics results. Among other things, we compare a mechanism currently used in Japan with the flexible deferred acceptance mechanism and establish that all doctors are weakly better off under the latter mechanism. Still, we also establish that all doctors are weakly worse off under the flexible deferred acceptance mechanism than under the unconstrained deferred acceptance mechanism. We note that we obtain all of our comparative statics results as straightforward corollaries of a single new comparative statics result.Footnote 6 The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the model. Section 3 states preliminary result. In Sect. 4, we offer our analysis. Section 5 concludes. Proofs are in the Appendix unless noted otherwise.",1

71,2,The Japanese Economic Review,09 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-019-00021-y,Investment in time preference and long-run distribution,April 2020,Takashi Hayashi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The standard consumption-saving model in which households maximize their discounted lifetime utilities, when put under the natural assumption that they differ in their time preferences, has an uneasy long-run implication—given a time-constant interest rate, households are generically divided into two “classes”, one such that their consumptions and wealths converge to zero or subsistence level, the other such that their consumptions and wealths diverge to infinity; moreover, in the full dynamic general equilibrium environment in which the interest rate lowers over time according to diminishing returns to capital, all but the most patient household economically “perish”, and only the most patient one can “survive”, actually regardless of earnings and initial distribution of capitals. Such “division of society into two classes” has been conjectured by Ramsey in his classic work Ramsey (1928), and later confirmed by Becker (1980) and Bewley (1982) in the discrete-time setting and Mitra and Sorger (2013) in the continuous-time setting. Look at the discounted utility form, written in the continuous-time setting which the current paper adopts: where \(\beta\) denotes the discount rate. When the long-run pure interest rate r is given as fixed, we have to have either: or generically. In the first case, the household saves less, or even borrows, and as this accumulates exponentially over time its consumption/wealth go to zero. In the second case, the household saves more, and as this accumulates exponentially over time its consumption/wealth go to infinity. When the long-run interest rate is flexibly adjusted to diminishing return to capital over time, it is expected to satisfy the condition: but this can never be met when households have different \(\beta\)s. Thus, it has been shown that all but one with the smallest \(\beta\) are pushed away toward zero consumption/wealth or subsistence level in the long run.Footnote 1 There are two kinds of uneasiness here. One is that such long-run state does not look normatively right. There is nothing wrong in terms of the classical concept of welfare applied to “long-lived” households’ preferences over their consumption paths, since such equilibrium path is Pareto-efficient and even “fair” in the sense of envy-freeness if they have equal earnings and initial capital holding. According to this, it is simply that impatient households consume more in earlier periods. It is still problematic in two senses, though. First, since allocations take place over time, welfare criteria applied just to ex-ante evaluation of planned life-courses may be normatively insufficient, and it is ethically a different question whether we should accept resulting ex-post inequalities. Second, when the “long-lived” households are interpreted as families, such that nobody is responsible for in which family and in which generation and with what nature of time preference he or she is born, this extreme long-run inequality is definitely problematic. Second is that such extreme long-run inequality looks simply unrealistic. Although the precise answer depends on how long the “long-run” is, our crude sense tells us that plural and different households are there, while there exist unignorable and perhaps severe inequalities among them due to other reasons. This motivates various positive models to describe and explain that plural and different households can economically survive. Because the extreme long-run inequality result depends critically on the assumption of discounted utility preference, which is additively separable and stationary and seen as a knife-edge case even within the class of “rational (in the sense of dynamic consistency)” preferences, many preference models have been proposed to allow for the roles of non-separability and/or non-stationarity, and it has been investigated whether the extreme long-run inequality result is mildered or still persists. To illustrate, consider that the discount rate at each moment takes the form \(\beta (x)\), where x can be either a decision variable which can be chosen at each moment, such as consumption, or a state variable such as physical capital, or accumulated habit. The idea is that in the long run, the steady-state value of x for each household, denoted \(x^{*}\), can be flexibly adjusted, so that the interior steady-state condition: is met, and this can hold for different \(\beta (\cdot )\) as the steady-state value is flexibly adjusted. This allows us to shift our question from existence of interior steady state, which generically fails, to its stability. There are various existing models of such endogenous time preference. Uzawa (1968) proposes a preference model in which \(\beta\) depends on the current consumption, and it is axiomatized by Epstein (1983) in the discrete-time setting. Its further generalization is provided by Epstein (1987b), which allows non-linear way of discounting continuation lifetime utility, and is seen as a continuous-time counterpart of the classic discrete-time model of recursive utility by Koopmans (1960). Based on those models of recursive utility, a number of studies provide characterizations of the stability condition for economies with heterogenous households, such as Epstein and Hynes (1983), Lucas and Stokey (1984), Epstein (1987a, b), Benhabib et al. (1988).Footnote 2 These stability results assume that discount rate at each moment is increasing in present consumption. On the other hand, Das (2003, 2007), Hirose and Ikeda (2008) consider that discount rate is decreasing in present consumption. This is consistent with the empirically natural observation that the rich (poor) are more (im)patient, which was originally suggested by Fisher (1930). They show that steady state may be unstable, or that there are multiple steady states. Note that the above-noted class is stationary, while weakening additive separability, and there preference over-consumption streams being held at each time is independent of histories of past consumptions, meaning that whatever the history is the consumer’s discounting between the present period and the next period depends only on the present consumption. This is somewhat odd as an explanation of the “Fisherian” story, because it says that regardless of wealth accumulation, a sudden change in the present consumption immediately changes the degree of patience, and also that such effect lasts only for one period. We view that patience should be modeled rather as certain kind of capital. 
Shi and Epstein (1993) incorporate habit formation into time-preference determination, in which \(\beta\) depends on the level of consumption habit and is increasing in it, meaning that higher habit leads to more impatience. There, the habit rises as the household consumes more than the current habit level. This works as a stabilizer, as an over-consumption leads to higher habit, leading to less patience, leading to more current consumption but less in the future, leading to lower habit and more patience, and so on. In the context of growth problem, Schumacher (2009) and Strulik (2012) consider that discount rate at each moment depends on physical capital amount, which goes along the line that rich are more patient, and in general work in the direction to destabilize. They show that there are multiple steady states, so that the lower one is interpreted as a poverty trap. This paper studies a model of endogenous time-preference formation, following Becker and Mulligan (1997), in which households can pay for costly investment to establish and maintain patience, where the degree of patience is now understood to be a capital. Following Doepke and Zilibotti (2005, 2008), we call such capital patience capital. A prominent example of the form of investment in patience capital is education, within or outside family.Footnote 3 We view that investment in patience capital is a natural channel of endogeneity in time-preference determination, and it tells causal effect more directly than the above-noted elements. It captures better the reverse causality that the rich (poor) are more (im)patient, because they are rich (poor), not just the single direction that the rich (poor) are more (im)patient, because they are (im)patient. Effect of education on time-preference determination is documented by experimental studies such as Alan and Ertac (2018) and Perez-Arce (2017). Also, numbers of studies document that time preference is related to socioeconomic status which naturally require inputting wealth for acquisition and maintenance, or to wealth itself (see, for example, Lawrance 1991; Barsky 1997; Tanaka et al. 2010; Dohmen 2015). Although the precise causal effects are yet unclear, it will be fair to say that acquiring and maintaining patience are at least costly. Patience capital may be accumulated over time, while it can depreciate, as well. In the intergenerational interpretation, this means that patience capital is inherited to descendants. Although acquired characteristics are not inherited biologically, in the literature of sociology, numbers of studies have documented that “cultural capital” is reproduced across generations within a family or a class, through cultural inheritance (see, for example, Bourdieu 1973; DiMaggio 1982). After the works by Doepke and Zilibotti (2005, 2008), there is a growing attention to investment in patience capital in the context of endogenous formation of “spirit of capitalism” and its effect on economic development (see, for example, Kawagishi 2014; Haruyama and Park 2017). To our knowledge, though, the implication of investment in patience capital to long-run distribution of consumption and wealth in relation to the rather classic problem as explained above is not known. Does investment in time preference lead to survival and coexistence of heterogenous types, or opposite? Denote the amount of patience capital by \(\pi\), then the endogenous discount rate is given by \(\beta (\pi )\), which is decreasing in \(\pi\), meaning that higher patience leads to less discounting of the future. Unlike physical capital, such patience capital is not transferrable across households after acquired. Evolution of patience capital \(\pi\) at each moment is determined by the amount of investment-like consumption. Precisely, it is given by: where z denotes the amount of investment-like capital, g is the production function, and \(\delta\) denotes the depreciation rate. Investing z requires material cost, and hence, it is in a direct material trade-off with pure consumption. The preference model is seen as a multi-period extension of the model by Becker and Mulligan (1997), where they assume determination of time preference occurs just once in the initial period. It parallels with the discrete-time dynastic model by Doepke and Zilibotti (2005, 2008), while there is a conceptual difference (or trade-off, perhaps) that they consider that each generation can invest on the next generation’s patience level for the latter’s lifetime, but the degree of altruism toward succeeding generation remains constant across all generations, and we consider that both evolve endogenously, but they are described altogether by one variable \(\pi\). First, we will consider linear technology, where interest rate r is time-constant, to isolate the problem of whether investment in time preference has a stabilizing effect for each household or not. In contrary to the previous literature on endogenous time preference, we show that the interior steady-state condition: is unstable in the following sense: per one household, there is a one-dimensional curve lying in the space of the two-dimensional space of state variables \((\pi ,k)\), where k denotes the amount of physical capital, which pass through the interior steady state \((\pi ^{*},k^{*})\) as the only possible stable path leading to it, such that convergence to the steady state occurs only when the vector of initial values \((\pi (0),k(0))\) falls exactly on the curve. Thus, we again see a division of society into two “classes”, where the above-described curve plays the role of border. Households with initial vectors falling in the upper side of the border are to be in the “upper class”, invest more in patience capital, which leads themselves to save more, and hence, the consumption level grows in the long-run. Households with initial vectors falling in the lower side of the border are to be in the “lower class”, opt out from investing in patience capital, leading to a decay of patience level, which leads themselves to save less, and hence, they perish in the long-run. In this sense, the extreme long-run inequality as obtained in the basic discounted utility model is shown to be rather robust and self-confirming. We also show a possibility that there is an expanding swing between the two classes. We then show that this result extends to economies with technologies with diminishing returns to capital, as far as the diminishment is sufficiently small. This shows that the instability result is not a mere knife-edge case.",

As is shown by Pazner and Schmeidler (1974) that efficiency and fairness as absence of envy are incompatible when individuals have unequal skills, we have to make a choice between the two criteria. In this paper, we focus on efficiency. Under linear technology, efficiency alone implies that each individual’s wage per hour is completely determined by his labour productivity, and any distributive concerns must be taken care of by lump-sum transfers. This paper characterizes how strategy-proofness and other axioms put restrictions on such lump-sum transfers. In contrary to other environments such as abstract domain and exchange economy, there is a class of strategy-proof and efficient rules. This is with affinity to the result by Maniquet and Sprumont (1999), which considers a production economy with linear technology. We show that lump-sum transfer to an individual has to be independent of his preference when we impose the strategy-proofness condition that one can never gain by misreporting his preference. We also consider a stronger strategy-proofness condition that one can never gain by misreporting his preference or hiding his skill. This implies that lump-sum transfer to an individual has to be non-decreasing in his skill level as well as independent of his preference. The property that transfer to an individual has to be non-decreasing in his skill is already a stringent one, since it should be typically less skilled people who will need transfers if we insist on certain kind of fairness. This suggests that it is hard to save unskilled people even in the presence of skilled people. We show that under an additional axiom saying that having higher skill should not hurt anybody else the only possibility is a trivial case in which no redistribution is made. The paper proceeds as follows. In the rest of this section, we illustrate how the current work is related to the existing literature. Section 2 presents the model and Sect. 3 presents the axioms. Section 4 presents the main results and Sect. 5 concludes. The most closely related paper is Maniquet and Sprumont (1999), which characterizes the class of strategy-proof and efficient allocation rules in a production economy with linear technology. Because of linear technology, price vector which supports efficient allocation is uniquely determined by technology alone, and the problem reduces to what lump-sum transfers should look like in order to be strategy-proof. This paper is in the same sprit, as we assume linear technology and efficiency implies that an individual’s wage per hour is determined by his labour productivity, and any distributive concerns are taken care of by lump-sum transfers. The results obtained in linear production economies contrast with the classic results in other environments. In the abstract social choice setting, Gibbard (1973) and Satterthwaite (1975) show that a strategy-proof and efficient rule must be dictatorial. In economic environments, Hurwicz (1972), and Zhou (1991) and Serizawa (2002) show that strategy-proofness and efficiency lead to impossibility or dictatorship in exchange economies. 
Pazner and Schmeidler (1974) demonstrate that the requirement of absence of envy is incompatible with efficiency of allocation when nobody. On the other hand, Varian (1974) proposes a notion of envy-freeness in which we adjust labour hours by asking how many hours one needs to work to make the same production as what is made by another. 
Fleurbaey and Maniquet (1996) characterize an efficient allocation rule which satisfies Maskin monotonicity, an implementability condition and also an informational efficiency condition, and a weaker version of envy-freeness stating that it holds only for some fixed reference preference. Despite taking the weaker version of envy-freeness, they obtain that under additional axioms the set-valued solution must include the “trivial” solution which allows no redistribution. We show, too, that it is hard to escape from the “trivial” solution under strategy-proofness and efficiency. It is even more serious here, though, because we say we have to select the trivial solution, and any of the characterizing axioms says nothing explicitly about distributive concerns. 
Fleurbaey and Maniquet (1999) propose an efficient resource allocation rule which satisfies skill monotonicity, an axiom stating that having higher skill hurts nobody. They provide a characterization of a rule satisfying the axiom, together with a distributional axiom stating that nobody should be made worse than the outcome of optimizing based on the lowest skill in the society and some other ones. Note that decentralizability conditions are not considered there, since as it is true in other environment as well decentralizability conditions and solidarity requirements are often in trade-offs, it is true in the current setting as well. In the framework of fair social orderings, Fleurbaey and Maniquet (2006) characterize social orderings over allocations of labour and consumption based on the presumption that nobody is responsible for his skill level. In the framework of axiomatic bargaining, Yoshihara (2003) characterize a class of efficient allocation rules which allow people to be partially responsible for their skill levels. 
Yamada and Yoshihara (2007); Yoshihara and Yamada (2010) provide conditions for allocation rules in production economies with unequal skills which are implementable in Nash equilibria in a type of mechanism in which individuals may exaggerate or hide their skills, while the mechanism is designed so that it does not happen in equilibrium. In contrary, we assume that one cannot exaggerate his skill while he can hide it, because under linear technology the planner can always detect exaggeration ex-post and even partially ex-ante, and because hiding is the only type of information manipulation which can be handled in the framework of strategy-proofness (see “Discussions” after the definition of strategy-proofness).",

71,2,The Japanese Economic Review,01 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-019-00010-1,Does marriage improve subjective health in Japan?,April 2020,Kazuma Sato,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Does marriage make people healthy? In Japan, it is important to answer this question, as it is deeply relevant to the sustainability of Japan’s current society. As the OECD Family DatabaseFootnote 1 reveals, Japan’s marriage rate has decreased rapidly in recent decades. Although the marriage rates in most OECD countries have also declined, cohabitation has been prevalent in some countries.Footnote 2 Since cohabiting couples may have children together, these couples can contribute to offsetting declining birth rates, or even driving them up. However, cohabitation is rare in Japan. Furthermore, as the National Institute of Population and Social Security has revealed,Footnote 3 the declining marriage rate has significant negative impact on the birth rate. Therefore, relative to other countries, it is even more crucial for Japan to address the declining marriage rate so as to prevent a further decrease in birth rate. One countermeasure is to clarify the benefits of marriage. Benefits of marriage with respect to health have been analyzed in countries such as the U.S., and results have been applied in policy decisions (Waite and Gallagher 2000). However, empirical studies on marriage and health are scarce in Japan; therefore, this study attempts to clarify whether marriage can make Japanese people healthy. There are two hypotheses regarding the effect of marriage on health (Wilson and Oswald 2005). The protection effect hypothesis posits that marriage can improve health. The second main hypothesis, known as the selection effect hypothesis, considers that marriage has no positive effect on health. In this hypothesis, a person with better initial health is regarded as being more attractive in the marriage market, and therefore more likely to get married. Therefore, any health improvement following marriage is considered a spurious correlation. Many studies have examined the validity of these competing hypotheses. These studies found that marriage can improve mental health (Horwitz et al. 1996; Simon and Marcussen 1999; Barrett 2000; Simon 2002; Baba et al. 2003), mortality (Gove et al. 1983; Rahman 1993; Hu and Goldman 1995; Johnson et al. 2000; Manor et al. 2000; Gardner and Oswald 2004; Mete 2005), happiness (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Stutzer and Frey 2006; Clark et al. 2008), and subjective health (Guner et al. 2014). The sources of post-marriage health improvements were also investigated and were found to stem from lifestyle improvements, such as decreased smoking and drinking (Horwitz et al. 1996; Ben-Shlomo et al. 1993; Wickrama et al. 1995; Power et al. 1999; Burke et al. 2004), and increased expenditures to maintain health (Guner et al. 2014). Furthermore, studies examining the effects of health improvements by gender indicate that men experience more health improvements than do women (Gove et al. 1983; Horwitz et al. 1996; Kohler et al. 2005). Other studies have investigated the health effects of the marital relationship and marriage mindset. These studies show that health improvements increase when the marital relationship is favorableFootnote 4 and the parties see marriage as vital in their lives (Horwitz et al. 1996; Wickrama et al. 1997; Simon and Marcussen 1999). Most of these analyses were conducted using data from the United States and EuropeFootnote 5; only Baba et al. (2003), Fu and Noguchi (2016), and Fu and Noguchi (2018) examined Japanese cases, revealing that marriage improved health.Footnote 6 Although Baba et al. (2003) offered a valuable contribution, they only studied women and did not consider the individual fixed effect or the selection effect. Fu and Noguchi (2016) compared the impact of marriage on health among couples in Japan, China, and Korea, revealing significant positive effect for older generations in Japan and China. Although this study is interesting in terms of comparing the marriage effect in East Asian countries, the authors could not control for individual fixed effect owing to their use of cross-section data. On the contrary, Fu and Noguchi (2018) considered not only individual fixed effect but also the mutual relation between health and marriage using system generalized method of moments. Although the method was sophisticated, the impact of marriage on all ages was not analyzed because the analyzed samples were of middle-aged and elderly couples. Therefore, the gap exists between studies in the Japanese context and those examining the United States and Europe. This study fills this gap using Keio Household Panel Survey (KHPS) data which provide representative panel data for Japan. This study extends the literature in two ways. First, it is one of few studies involving Japanese data. Second, the matching method is used to control individual heterogeneity between respondents who are married and those who are single. From the analyses, five results are obtained. First, the married sample had better initial health than the unmarried sample. Second, marriage improves subjective health, subjective physical health, and subjective mental health. Third, health improvements following marriage are caused by decreased smoking and the improvement of mental health. Fourth, the effects of health improvements following marriage are larger for men than for women. Fifth, post-marriage health improvements for men and women stem from different sources. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the data, and Sect. 3 explains the empirical strategy. Section 4 discusses the estimation results, and Sect. 5 provides concluding remarks.",3

State control is also significant in Japan, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. In these countries, publicly owned firms are usually organized as state holding corporations (henceforth state corporations), and produce various types of products at various production plants. These products can be substitutes or complements. There is evidence of partial privatization of state corporations that compete with foreign firms. The French government owns a 15% of the shares in the automobile maker Renault. This firm produces two brands of cars (Renault and Dacia), which are substitute goods, at different subsidiaries. In the domestic market, this firm competes with several foreign-owned firms. Similarly, the state of Lower Saxony (Germany) owns a 20% of the shares of the automobile maker Volkswagen. This firm produces several brands of cars. The China FAW Group Corporation (FAW) is another example. FAW is a state-owned corporation that produces several brands of cars. One of these brands is FAW Car, in which the Chinese government owns a stake of 55%.Footnote 1 An example of a public firm that produces complementary goods is the French telecommunications corporation Orange. This corporation provides mobile, landline, and Internet services, and the government of France owns a 13.4% of the shares of Orange. Other example is China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Corp), a Chinese state-owned corporation that has several business lines such as the exploration, production, and transportation of oil and natural gas. In 2014, this corporation partially privatized one of its subsidiaries, Sinopec Marketing, and the Chinese government still has more than 70% of the shares in this subsidiary.Footnote 2 The examples cited above stress the importance of investigating the optimal degree of privatization of state corporations that produce several goods that can be substitute or complements,and that are competing with foreign firms. To fill this gap in the literature, this paper analyzes the decision whether to partially privatize state corporations when private firms are partly foreign-owned. As far as we know, this issue has not been analyzed by the literature on mixed markets. We consider an industry made up by a state corporation and a private sector. The state corporation owns two production plants each of which produces a differentiated good, and those goods may be substitutes or complements. The private sector is partially foreign-owned (foreign penetration) and comprises two private plants each of which produces a differentiated good. Private firms may be organized in two ways: their plants may be owned by different investors (henceforth uniplant firms) or by a single investor (henceforth the multiplant firm).Footnote 3 The government partially privatizes the state corporation by selling a percentage of the ownership of both plants to a single domestic private investor.Footnote 4 The main result obtained in the paper is that the optimal degree of privatization of the state corporation depends on the percentage of shares in private firms that are foreign-owned. We find that when foreign ownership in the private sector is high, there is more privatization with uniplant (multiplant) private firms if goods are substitute (complements). If foreign ownership is low, the government retains a greater (lower) stake with multiplant private firms than with uniplant private firms when goods are complements (substitutes). We have extended the analysis to consider that part of the shares in the partially privatized firm are foreign-owned, as in Lin and Matsumura (2012), and found that the non-monotonicity result holds. The evidence of the privatization of publicly owned firms has encouraged the theoretical analysis on this issue. In this regard, De Fraja and Delbono (1989, 1990) and Corneo and Jeanne (1994) analyze the decision by governments whether to full privatize a single public firm.Footnote 5 Partial ownership in privatized firms is common in most countries, so partial privatization has been extensively discussed in the literature on mixed oligopoly. Matsumura (1998) shows, assuming domestic private firms, that a public firm may be partially privatized in equilibrium under moderate conditions.Footnote 6 As, in many mixed oligopoly markets, publicly owned firms compete with foreign firms, many studies on mixed oligopoly use a partial privatization approach to discuss how competition with foreign private firms affects the optimal degree of privatization.Footnote 7 For example, Lin and Matsumura (2012) and Matsumura and Okamura (2015) analyze how the optimal degree of privatization depends on two factors: the number of private firms and whether these firms are foreign-owned. Cato and Matsumura (2012) analyze a similar issue in free-entry markets. Wang and Chen (2011) consider a mixed oligopoly with multinational firms and show that partial privatization depends on the fraction of foreign ownership of multinational firms. Wang and Tomaru (2015) show that partial privatization is optimal for small extent of foreign penetration and the optimal degree of privatization is not monotonically related to foreign penetration. Wu et al. (2016) developed a simple model of privatization in downstream mixed oligopoly with vertically related markets, and found that as the degree of foreign ownership on private firm increases, the optimal degree of privatization will first decrease and then increase. Xu et al. (2017) investigate the impact of the timing of privatization and liberalization policies on the degree of privatization and number of entering firms in free-entry mixed markets. They show that ex-ante privatization yields a higher (lower) level of privatization and a larger (smaller) equilibrium number of entering private firms when foreign ownership in private firms is high (low). The papers cited above usually assume a mixed market with one public firm that produces a single good at a single production plant. However, in the real world, state corporations comprise firms that produce various types of goods at various production plants (see Kumar, 1992).Footnote 8 As far as we know, little work has been done concerning the privatization of state corporations. Exceptions are the papers by Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2017, 2018b) and Dong et al. (2018a). Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2017) consider a state corporation with two plants that produce differentiated goods and analyze whether the two plants of the state corporation are fully sold to different private investors or to a single investor. Dong et al. (2018a) study partial privatization of a state corporation and find that the stake that the government retains in it depends on two factors: the type of goods produced by the firms, and whether private firms are uniplant or multiplant. Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2018b) analyze merger between two local public firms that produce goods that can be homogeneous, substitutes, or complements. These papers consider that private firms are fully domestic-owned. To better show the contribution of our paper, next, we compare it with two closely related papers, those by Dong et al. (2018a) and Lin and Matsumura (2012). Dong et al. (2018a) assume domestic private firms and find that if goods are complements (substitutes), the government retains a greater (lower) stake in the state corporation when it competes with a multiplant private firm than when it competes with uniplant private firms. We extend this paper by considering foreign penetration in the private sector. We show that their result holds only if foreign penetration is low; if it is high, the opposite result is obtained. Therefore, the stake that the government retains in the state corporation crucially depends on the degree of which private firms are foreign-owned. Lin and Mastumura (2012) consider a mixed oligopoly with uniplant firms that produce a homogenous product. They assume that part of the shares of the partially privatized firm are sold to foreign investors, and that part of the private sector is foreign-owned. They find that an increase in foreign penetration in the public (private) sector increases (reduces) the optimal degree of privatization. We consider a private sector with foreign penetration, but assume that the shares in the state corporation are sold only to domestic investors. We allow firms to produce different products that can be substitute or complements. The state corporation has two productive plants, and the private sector can be organized as two uniplant firms or as a multiplant firm. Only multiplant firms internalize how the output produced by one plant affects that of the other plant. When plants produce substitute goods, they compete with each other. A multiplant firm internalizes market competition by reducing the output of their plants, leading to less production than uniplant firms. With complementary goods, the output of one plant increases with that of the other. The two plants of a multiplant firm cooperate in production, leading to more outputs than two uniplant firms. This is the main difference between our paper and that by Lin and Mastumura (2012), which causes that market competition non-monotonically influences the optimal degree of privatization. We have extended the paper to consider that part of the shares in the privatized firm are foreign-owned, as in Lin and Matsumura (2012), and find that the non-monotonicity result holds.Footnote 9 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 analyzes partial privatization assuming uniplant private firms. Section 4 extends the analysis by considering a multiplant private firm. Section 5 compares the two cases. Section 6 analyzes partial privatization assuming that foreign investors own part of the public and private sectors and Sect. 7 concludes.",11

Yet, many theoretical analyses in economics have assumed that decision makers are equally rational or that these exists a representative rational decision maker. It is true that there have been many attempts in the past to introduce (heterogeneous) boundedly rational decision makers into analyses (see, Conlisk 1996, for a review). However, it is only recently, thanks to developments in behavioral and experimental economics,Footnote 1 that “behavioral” models, which include boundedly rational decision makers, have been proposed and investigated extensively in fields such as game theory (Camerer 2003), industrial organization (Spiegler 2011), and finance (Shleifer 2000). As noted by Thaler (2015), however, macroeconomics has been the field least impacted by the recent behavioral and experimental revolution. Perhaps, the main reason for this is a belief held by many economists that can be summarized by an old statement from Gary Becker: “households may be irrational and yet markets quite rational” (Becker 1962, p. 8). According to this view, because deviations from rational behavior by many boundedly rational individuals cancel out in aggregate, bounded rationality at the individual or household level does not matter at the macro-level. Indeed, the famous zero-intelligence agents model studied by Gode and Sunder (1993, 1997) shows that even the markets consisting of zero-intelligence computer traders can exhibit high allocative efficiency when these traders respect their budget constraints. There are, however, theoretical studies that show the existence of a few boundedly rational decision makers in a large population can have a larger-than-proportional impact on aggregate outcomes. In particular, Haltiwanger and Waldman (1985, 1989, 1991) demonstrate that the behavior of boundedly rational decision makers can have a large influence at the macro-level when the environment is characterized by strategic complementarity rather than strategic substitutability. This is what Hanaki et al. (2019) call the strategic environment effect (SEE). The SEE has been shown experimentally in price setting games (Fehr and Tyran 2008), forecasting games (Heemeijer et al. 2009; Bao et al. 2012), duopoly games (Potters and Suetens 2009), and beauty contest games (Sutan and Willinger 2009; Cooper et al. 2017). In this article, we first show the relationship between participants’ measured cognitive ability and their observed behavior in laboratory experiments including a coordination game (Hanaki et al. 2016) and an asset trading game (Akiyama et al. 2017). These results demonstrate that the main reasons why participants’ behavior deviate from the Nash equilibrium or the rational expectations equilibrium differ depending on their cognitive ability. Such results are consistent with the view behind the level-K (Nagel 1995) or the cognitive hierarchy model (Camerer et al. 2004) that explicitly assume heterogeneity in the depth of strategic thinking among decision makers. We then discuss the strategic environment effect by referring to Hanaki et al. (2019), which shows both theoretically and experimentally that the SEE exists when group size is not too small (and is thus relevant at the macro-level) in beauty contest games. The main theoretical insight of Hanaki et al. (2019) is that the SEE is driven by the existence of heterogeneity in terms of the depth of strategic thinking among decision makers, and therefore, in the presence of strategic complementarity, one must investigate seriously the macroeconomic implications of the interactions among heterogeneous boundedly rational decision makers. We complement the main discussion with some methodological considerations. Cognitive ability of participants varies not only within the pool of participants in each experimental laboratory, but more importantly, across these pools. Paying insufficient attention to such differences across pools of participants can not only impact the replicability of experimental results but also lead to misinterpreting the differences in the experimental results obtained in different countries. We conclude this paper by proposing to complement the database of participants used in each experimental laboratory with information on individual characteristics such as cognitive ability.",1

The financial crises of the past 2 decades have illustrated just how critical the health of this sector can be for achieving financial stability. For example, the recent financial crisis in the United States in its early stages reared its head in the form of the subprime loan problem. Similarly, the financial crises in Japan and Scandinavia in the 1990s were all triggered by the collapse of bubbles in the real estate market. More recently, the rapid rise in real estate prices—often supported by a strong expansion in bank lending—in a number of emerging market economies has become a concern for policymakers. Given these experiences, it is critically important to analyze the relationship between property markets, finance, and financial crisis. One of the most urgent tasks in this respect is the development of methods to detect bubbles in property markets, which is key to making reliable forecasts about future financial crises and/or to mitigating them. Consider the case of residential properties. In real estate economics, the fundamental value of a house is determined as the present discounted value of current and future income flows resulting from renting the house to someone (see, for example, Himmelberg et al. 2005). Normally, house prices remain close to their fundamental value due to price arbitrage. However, in some cases, arbitrage forces are not present and prices deviate substantially from their fundamental value. This is what is called a housing bubble (see, for example, Martin and Ventura 2018). To detect housing bubbles defined in this way requires reliable estimates of the fundamental value of house prices, which in turn requires knowing market participants’ expectations of rental prices in the coming years. However, such expectations are not observable, so that the fundamental value of house prices is quite difficult to estimate. Thus, it is next to impossible for researchers or policymakers to tell when they observe a price hike, whether this is the result of a rise in fundamental values or something else. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to detect real estate bubbles. Specifically, we propose making use of information on the cross-sectional dispersion of real estate prices. It is often believed that all prices rise equally during a bubble period. However, this is not the case. What happens instead is that there are pronounced price rises for certain properties but not for others, so that price inequality across properties increases during a bubble. In other words, the defining characteristic of real estate bubbles is not the rapid price hike itself but an increase in price dispersion.Footnote 1 Given these considerations, the present study addresses the following empirical issues. First, we examine whether the price distribution is close to a normal distribution, as is often assumed in empirical studies on house price indexes, or whether it has fatter tails than a Gaussian distribution. Second, we investigate how the shape of the price distribution is affected by house attributes, including the size and location of a house. Third, we consider how the shape of the distribution changes over time. To examine these three issues, we focus on the housing bubble Japan experienced in the late 1980s and its burst in the early 1990s. This study is closely related to recent research on the cross-sectional distribution of house prices, including the studies by McMillen (2008), Van Nieuwerburgh and Weill (2010), Määttänen and Terviö (2014), Glaeser et al. (2012), Gyourko et al. (2013), and Blackwell (2018). The main interest of Gyourko et al. (2013), Van Nieuwerburgh and Weill (2010), and Määttänen and Terviö (2014) is the relationship between the house price distribution and the income distribution. For example, Määttänen and Terviö (2014) ask whether the recent increases in income inequality in the United States have had any impact on the distribution of house prices. On the other hand, McMillen (2008) focuses on the change in the house price distribution over time and asks whether the change in the price distribution comes from a change in the distribution of house characteristics such as size, location, age, and so on, or from a change in the implicit prices associated with those characteristics. The focus of our paper is closely related to the issues discussed in these studies but differs from them in some important respects. First, this study is the first attempt to specify the shape of the house price distribution, paying particular attention to the tail part of the distribution. Second, this study examines the effect of a housing bubble on the cross-sectional price distribution. While steep increases in the mean of house prices in various countries in recent decades have received substantial attention in the literature, the change in the shape of the cross-sectional price distribution has received much less attention.Footnote 2 In this study, we seek to fill this gap. Another strand of the literature closely related to the present study is research on early warning indicators of financial crises, including the studies by Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), Borio and Lowe (2002), Drehmann and Juselius (2014), and Anundsen et al. (2016). These studies are all based on the idea that financial imbalances, or vulnerabilities, build up over time before crises arise, and that it should be possible to capture the cumulative processes that sow the seeds of the subsequent crisis by carefully monitoring key variables such as the credit to GDP ratio, the debt service ratio, and real estate prices. Specifically, these studies estimate the level of a critical threshold for the deviation of a variable from its trend such that the deviation tends to be above the threshold in crisis periods and below in normal periods. For example, Drehmann and Juselius (2014) employ quarterly time series data for 10 candidate variables from 26 countries and spanning the period 1980–2012 to compare the performance of those variables as early warning indicators for 19 financial crises that occurred during the observation period. They find that the credit to GDP ratio outperforms other measures. The purpose of this study is similar to that of these studies on early warning indicators, but the methodology we employ is quite different. Early warning exercises can be seen as a statistical procedure to detect anomalies in variables like the credit/GDP ratio around crises. Key to this procedure is prior information on crisis dates. However, as often pointed out in previous studies, it is not always easy to obtain precise information on crisis dates, and, more importantly, crises are by their very nature rare events. Given this, it is not necessarily easy to improve the precision of early warning indicators to a sufficiently high level such that policymakers can rely on them to take remedial actions. In this study, we do not seek to characterize how key variables behave in abnormal times. Instead, we focus on the behavior of key variables in normal times. Our strategy is to have a clear idea about how those variables behave in normal times and then to detect deviations from such normal behavior—that is, to detect anomalies that may serve as early warning signals.Footnote 3 Our main findings are as follows. First, the cross-sectional distribution of house prices has a fat upper tail, and the tail part is close to a power-law distribution. This is confirmed by the goodness-of-fit test proposed by Malevergne et al. (2011). On the other hand, the cross-sectional distribution of house sizes, as measured by the floor space, has an upper tail that is less fat than that of the price distribution and is close to an exponential distribution. These two findings suggest a particular functional form of hedonic regression to identify the size effect. We construct size-adjusted prices by subtracting the house size (multiplied by a positive coefficient) from the log price and find that the size-adjusted price follows a lognormal distribution for most of the observation period. An important exception is the period of the housing bubble and its collapse in 1987–1995, during which the price distribution in each year has a power-law tail even after controlling for the size effect. This suggests that the shape of the size-adjusted price distribution, especially the shape of the tail part, may contain information useful for the detection of housing bubbles. Second, we conduct additional analyses to investigate in more detail the mechanism responsible for the deviation of the size-adjusted price distribution from a lognormal distribution during the bubble period. Specifically, we divide the area covered by our sample (Greater Tokyo) into small pixels and find that size-adjusted prices almost follow a lognormal distribution within each of these pixels even during the bubble period, but the means and variances of the distributions are highly dispersed across different pixels. This finding implies that the sharp price hike during the bubble period was concentrated in particular areas, and this spatial heterogeneity is the source of the fat upper tail observed for the bubble period. We interpret this as evidence suggesting that during a bubble period, there is an increase in market segmentation. The rest of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the Japanese housing bubble in the late 1980s. Section 3 then explains the dataset and the empirical strategy we employ. Next, Sects. 4 and 5 present our size- and location-adjustments to house prices. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",6

This dramatic change significantly influenced the labor market. Previous studies (e.g., Arai et al. 2015; Kawaguchi and Mori 2016) found that the increase in the college-educated workers’ share plays a key role in explaining the transition in the Japanese labor market. At the same time, the number of graduate students in Japan has also increased substantially over the past few decades. Figure 1, which presents the number of students enrolled in master’s programs in private and public universities, illustrates this trend: graduate enrollment followed a steady upward trend from the 1970s until the first decade of the twenty-first century, although this trend has declined to a certain extent in recent years reflecting overall population trends. Data source: basic survey of schools Graduate enrollment by undergraduate major and school type. If graduate education imparts useful skills and knowledge to students and increases their productivity, the increase in the number of graduate students should boost technological development and guide economic growth. However, Kucel et al. (2016) note that over-education can be high in Japan. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate by what margin graduate education increases workers’ human capital stock. To address this question, this paper attempts to estimate the returns to graduate education in Japan, taking into account the endogeneity of graduate schooling. Recent studies by Morikawa (2015) and Kakizawa et al. (2014) reveal that the postgraduate wage premium in Japan is positive, significant, and comparable to that in the United States. The study by Morikawa (2015) was the first attempt to estimate the postgraduate wage premium for the nationally representative sample in Japan,Footnote 1 and the estimation results indicate that the expansion of graduate education in Japan could affect the wages of workers with postgraduate degrees. However, these studies do not consider potential self-selection bias due to unobserved ability and business cycles.Footnote 2 As highlighted in the literature on education, focusing on the effect of higher education on wages (see, e.g., Card 1999), it is important not to ignore the possible self-selection bias arising from the association between schooling decisions and unobserved ability: students with higher ability are more likely to go to university and find high-paying jobs after they graduate, not only because of what they learned at university, but also because of their inherent ability. Although previous studies on returns to post-secondary education in the United States have shown that the ability bias is small, there are at least three major reasons why self-selection biases may cause a serious upward bias in the estimates of the returns to graduate education in Japan. First, as seen in Fig. 1, the majority of Japanese graduate students major in science and engineering subjects at public universities, and admission to such majors at public universities are considerably more selective than admission to humanities and social science subjects at private universities, for instance. Second, the percentage of undergraduate students who continue to graduate studies is higher in eminent universities. Therefore, unless the university ranking or measure of individuals’ cognitive skills is considered, ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimates of the postgraduate wage premium may reflect differences in the unobserved abilities. Third, students completing their undergraduate studies during a recession have an incentive to pursue graduate education in the hope that the recession will have ended by the time they graduate. Those who can afford to go to graduate school will have more opportunities of getting high-paying jobs as their first jobs, and the wage differentials between those with master’s degrees and those with only bachelor’s degrees may reflect individuals’ financial backgrounds. To deal with these potential sources of bias, this study utilizes data from the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers (JPSC) conducted by the Institute for Research on Household Economics, the Working Person Survey (WPS) conducted by the Recruit Works Institute, and the Survey of Adult Skills conducted by the National Institute for Educational Policy Research (NIER) as a part of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). The JPSC has the advantage of encompassing a longer period (20 years) than other panel data in Japan and provides more detailed information than the surveys published by the government. The analysis controls for workers’ undergraduate majors and types of university (private or public) by utilizing the extensive information provided by the JPSC to mitigate the ability bias. Although the JPSC contains abundant information about the university from which workers graduated, the number of individuals with master’s degrees is small and the sample representativeness is limited. To overcome this problem, this study utilizes the WPS data. The WPS data do not contain information about the types of university, but more than 1000 individuals have a postgraduate degree. Although undergraduate majors and types of university can be informative about unobserved ability, no explicit measure of the cognitive skills is included in the JPSC and WPS data. To control for the cognitive skills levels, this study uses the PIAAC data containing the scores of three different tests, each of which highlights different cognitive skills. This paper is the first to present estimates of the effect of graduate education in Japan that carefully takes the self-selection bias into consideration.Footnote 3 The results of the OLS estimations with all three data sets suggest that the postgraduate wage premium for men remains positive and significant, ranging from 16.5 to 23.7% for men and 13.5–26.4% for women, even if their undergraduate majors and types of university (private or public), or levels of cognitive skills are controlled for. These factors account for 4.1–10.9% of the postgraduate wage premium for men and 6.3–29.3% for women. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related literature and discusses potential contributions of this study. Section 3 describes the three data sets used for the estimation. The estimation method and procedure are presented in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 presents and discusses the estimation results. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1

Such demographic changes consist of changes in fertility and mortality, and changes in immigration flow. For the former, Japan has experienced consecutive improvements in longevity and declines in fertility during the past half century while for the latter, it has accepted little immigration, resulting in current declines in population. When we turn to other countries, we observe similar trends in fertility and mortality whereas we can find distinct differences in immigration flow. The United States would be the most prominent example showing such similarity and difference. In fact, as shown in Table 1, both Japan and the United States experienced consecutive improvements in longevity and declines in fertility. In contrast to such similar trends in fertility and mortality, we have observed distinct differences in immigration flow between these countries: the United States has absorbed immigrants much more intensively than Japan. Such a difference in immigration flow inevitably results in a difference in population growth, which has become visible in recent years. Until 1980s, both countries experienced population growth with approximately 1% annually. After that, population growth rate in Japan has largely declined and become negative from 2010 while that in the United States has slightly declined but still somewhat below 1%.Footnote 1 What do such similarities and differences imply? This paper aims to answer this question by uncovering the possible linkages among life expectancy, fertility, immigration, and population. In so doing, we focus on the role of market size. The population undoubtedly affects a country’s market size, which in turn, is known to be a major engine that attracts firm activities in a global economy (Fujita et al. 1999; Baldwin et al. 2003; Combes et al. 2008). Hence, if a particular change in demographics increases the market size, firm activities will subsequently rush into the country, resulting in a rise in the country’s welfare. If a change decreases the market size, the opposite holds true and there is a decline in the country’s welfare. This is not the end of the story. If immigration takes place in response to the change, then it will further affect the country’s market size and welfare. In this paper, we develop an overlapping generations model wherein people decide their number of children, i.e., fertility, and their consumption levels of differentiated goods. Differentiated goods are produced under monopolistic competition, implying that a larger market size induces more firms to enter the market and increases the variety of differentiated goods, which increases the people’s utility. Moreover, we assume immigration occurs when the utility becomes higher inside the country than outside the country. By analyzing this framework theoretically, we first examine the effects of improvements in longevity on population size, market size, and welfare. Our analysis shows that improvements in longevity affect the market size through three effects: first, it decreases fertility because parents need to prepare for consumption in their old period. Second, it increases the expected per-capita lifetime consumption.Footnote 2 Finally, it increases immigration, since the improved longevity raises the individual utility. The first effect has negative impacts on the market size and welfare whereas the latter two effects have positive impacts. We next investigate the effects of immigration increases. A change that induces more immigration increases population and market sizes, resulting in a higher welfare. We then calibrate our model to match the Japanese and US data from 1955 to 2015 and conduct counterfactual analyses. We compare these two countries because they have experienced similar trends in fertility and mortality and significantly different trends in immigration flow, giving us a nice contrast to examine quantitative impacts of the factors under our focus. Our first counterfactual analysis examines the effects of improvements in longevity and shows that a higher value of the survival rate results in a smaller market size. This implies that the negative impacts of improvements in longevity dominate the positive ones both in Japan and the United States. Our second counterfactual analysis considers the scenario wherein Japan is as open towards immigration as the United States and the United States is as closed towards immigration as Japan. We then show that under this scenario Japan would have experienced a much higher growth in population and market size whereas the United States would have experienced much lower growth. This result implies that the United States has enjoyed gains from immigration whereas Japan can overcome shrinkages in its market size caused by aging if it accepts more immigrants. Here, we present the related literature. Many existing studies including Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), Lorentzen et al. (2008), and Cervellati and Sunde (2011) provided empirical evidences that longer life expectancy reduces the fertility rate. Several studies have developed frameworks that can explain this stylized fact: Kalemli-Ozcan (2002; 2003) and Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2000) investigated the impact of uncertainty regarding the number of surviving children on fertility and population growth, and showed that if parents are risk averse, they reduce the number of children as the child’s survival rate improves. Ehrlich and Lui (1991), Soares (2005), and Bar and Leukhina (2010) presented models wherein longer life expectancy leads parents to invest more in their children’s education and to have fewer children. Yakita (2001), Zhang and Zhang (2001a; b) and Miyazawa (2006) extended the model of accidental bequest a la Abel (1985) by endogenizing fertility, and showed that longer life expectancy induces people to save more when they are young in preparation for consumption when they are old, which decreases the number of children. In this paper, we also employ the model of the accidental bequest with endogenous fertility and further extend it by incorporating immigration and the market size effect on welfare. Our analysis is also related to the literature on the impact of immigration on the labor markets of host countries that includes Card (2001; 2009), Borjas (2003), Ottaviano and Peri (2012), and Ottaviano et al. (2013), among others. These studies empirically investigated the impact of immigration on wage and employment in the host countries. We examine the immigration impacts in a broader sense by focusing on the market size and welfare. In this sense, our analysis is more closely related to the literature on trade and geography models a la Fujita et al. (1999), Baldwin et al. (2003) and Combes et al. (2008). In a standard trade and geography model, mobile workers are attracted to countries that offer a large variety of goods. Such immigration enlarges the host countries’ market size and induces the entry of firms, which increases the variety of goods and welfare there. We depart from trade and geography models by incorporating the overlapping generations structure, longevity, and fertility. Demographics consist of fertility, mortality, and immigration. The first strand of the related literature focused only on fertility and mortality and the second strand focused only on immigration. Our analysis bridges a gap between the two strands by considering the interlinkages among life expectancy, fertility, immigration, and market size to examine the possible impacts of demographic changes on the social welfare. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the baseline model. Section 3 characterizes equilibrium and Sect. 4 examines the effects of improvements in longevity on the market size and welfare. Section 5 conducts calibration analyses. Section 6 concludes the paper.",2

The annual per capita consumption of rice peaked in 1962, and has exhibited a consistent tendency to decline since that time. Japanese consumed 118 kg per capita on an average in 1962, but this figure had decreased to only 55 kg per capita as of 2014. In addition, domestic consumption exhibited a tendency to decrease. Figure 1 shows the production of and consumption for rice as a staple food from 2004 to 2014. Almost every year, production exceeded consumption, and excess supply has continued. Source: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Situations about Rice, Basic Principles on Demand and Supply of Rice and price Stabilization Production and consumption of rice as a staple food. Given chronic oversupply of rice, the Japanese government has been promoting a shift of crops from production of the staple food, rice, to soybeans and grains, and in addition, a change of crops to the so-called “new demand rice”, which is mainly rice used as animal feed. The “Basic Plan on Food, Agriculture and Rural Areas” issued in 2015 also called for the provision of the support required for achieving an expansion of the production of rice for animal feed and other such uses.Footnote 1 However, even with the shift from rice as a staple food to other crops, if the farmers in charge of producing rice as a staple food are inefficient producers, it would be costlier to produce rice. In fact, it is evident that, from an international perspective, the operation scale of rice cultivation in Japan is small, and its productivity is low. Figure 2 compares the harvests for rice paddy per 10 a (unit of area, 100 a = 1 ha) in three countries, Australia, the United States, and Japan. In 1980, the harvests of Australia and the United States were approximately 500 kg per 10 a, while that of Japan was 412 kg per 10 a; but in 2014, the figures were 1092 kg and 849 kg per 10 a for Australia and the United States, respectively, whereas the harvest for Japan was only 536 kg per 10 a. For rigorous evaluation about the switching policy from rice as a staple food to other crops, it is important to fully grasp the behavioral characteristics of rice producers from the viewpoint of efficiency.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Statistics Yearbook International comparison of harvest for paddy rice: Australia, USA and Japan. The purpose of this study is to use the panel data from the Rice Production Cost Statistics by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and undertake an empirical analysis of the efficiency in production by the rice-producing farm households. Specifically, the stochastic frontier production function, which comprises four production factors (land, labor, capital stock, and materials), is estimated, and the inefficiency indices of production are calculated. Based on the information, the efficient and inefficient rice producers are identified, and the factor demand behavior is compared.Footnote 2 Moreover, from the standpoint of exploitation of agricultural land, a comparative analysis of efficient and inefficient rice producers is conducted concerning the factors that determine the land utilization rate of paddy for rice production. The land utilization rate of paddy for rice production (hereafter, percent area planting rice) is defined as the proportion of the planted area (sakuzuke menseki) of paddy rice to the operated field (owned and borrowed) (keiei menseki) for paddy rice (ta).Footnote 3 Land utilization for rice production has depended heavily on rice production adjustment (seisan chosei) policies.Footnote 4 Our analysis can clarify the differences in the responses to such policies by the efficient and inefficient producers. In addition, our analysis can provide quantitatively useful information for formulating policies to achieve efficient arable land utilization. Now, we preview our main findings. First, the inefficiency indices of production were measured from the stochastic frontier production function, and it was found that the estimated inefficiency was robust, irrespective of the type of production function or the probability distribution of the assumed inefficiency. Based on the median of the measured inefficiency indices, the producers were divided into efficient and inefficient rice producer groups, and we found that the inefficient rice producers had the following characteristics: The number of parcels (a ‘parcel’ refers to a gathering or complex consisting of several neighboring plots) is large. The income per 10 a is low. The land, labor and capital productivity are low. Majority of the farmers own farms with small plots (kukaku), and few farmers own farms with relatively large-scale plots. Percent area planting rice is low. Second, a comparison between the behavior of inefficient and efficient rice producers with respect to the dynamic factor demand revealed that the inefficient rice producers do not respond to a change in wages. Finally, an analysis was conducted on the determinants of the planted area for rice production. It was found that the higher the proportion of small plots, the more likely that the producer would reduce the percent area planting rice; and these effects were larger for the efficient producer. In addition, it was observed that certified farmers reduced the percent area planting rice, and the extent of this reduction was larger for efficient producers. That is, the more efficient a certified farmer was, the more likely it was that the operated paddy field of rice was left fallow. If this situation continues, the productivity of rice production may decline further in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to design an agricultural system that has incentives for efficient rice producers to expand rice planting. This study is organized as follows. The next section describes the data set used for the analysis. In Sect. 3, a model for estimating the inefficiency of production is formulated, and the estimated results thereof are indicated. In Sect. 4, the characteristics of the efficient and inefficient producers, based on the efficiency indices, are compared. In Sect. 5, the dynamic and static factor demand function is estimated, and the differences in factor demand behavior between the efficient and the inefficient rice producers are examined. Section 6 shows the results of an econometric analysis of the determinants of percent area planting rice. Section 7 concludes this study.",2

While a strand of this literature followed Patinkin’s (Patinkin 1947) efficiency concern that the cartel should allocate the collusive outcome to equalize the marginal costs of oligopolists, another strand accepted Bain’s (Bain 1948) criticism that the division of collusion profits must respect the relative bargaining power of the oligopolists obtained from the threat of playing their non-cooperative equilibrium strategies [see, for example, Osborne and Pitchik (1983) and Schmalansee (1987)]. However, studies in both strands of the literature have mainly focused on the types of collusion where the oligopolistic firms compete in prices or in quantities. What these studies were generally missing is the possibility of collusion in supply functions under the threat of supply function competition [introduced by Grossman (1981) and developed by Klemperer and Meyer (1989)]. This is despite the fact that the supply function competition has found a wide application in the last 2 decades in liberalized power (electricity) industries, where this type of competition is believed to model the strategic game played by power generators more adequately than the quantity and price competitions (see, for example, Green and Newbery 1992; and Rudkevich and Duckworth 1998). The popularity of the supply function competition has also social grounds. When industries face a sufficiently high variability in demand, the welfares of both consumers and oligopolistic producers can be higher under the supply function competition than under the quantity competition, as recently shown by Saglam (2018). To the best of our knowledge, the only work integrating collusion and the supply function competition is a recent paper of Ciarreta and Gutiérrez-Hita (2012). Among many findings, Ciarreta and Gutiérrez-Hita (2012) showed that the less efficient firm has no incentive to reach a collusive agreement in either supply functions or in quantities when the cost asymmetry in the duopoly is sufficiently high, because in that case, the expected profits of this firm are higher at the non-cooperative equilibria of these two types of competition. This result of Ciarreta and Gutiérrez-Hita (2012), though quite interesting, may not be general, as it is based on the assumed impossibility of side payments between duopolists. By that assumption, firms in a cartel can share the collusive outcome only according to their cost efficiencies. On the other hand, a case study of Harrington (2006) shows that in the past, many cartels enforced collusion agreements using side payments (compensation schemes in the form of subsidies or penalties) between colluding firms. The theoretical works of Harrington and Skrzypacz (2007, 2011) suggest that the use of side payments within a cartel may be caused by the private information held by each colluding firm about its own price (or both its own price and sales). Clearly, the possibility of side payments between the duopolistic firms in the cartel enables them to freely bargain over collusion profits within the cooperative framework of Nash (1950b). Constructing a bargaining model using this framework, we assume that collusion profits over which the bargaining takes place are always obtained from the joint profit maximization program of the cartel when supply functions are employed as production strategies by which each firm announces for each possible price a quantity to produce, unlike in the Cournot approach where strategy of each firm is a single quantity. The rationale for this assumption, which is also one of the most signifying features of our model, is that the former option (i.e., collusion in supply functions) yields higher expected profits as long as there is any size of demand uncertainty, as earlier shown by Ciarreta and Gutiérrez-Hita (2012). More formally, we introduce a bargaining model where a bargaining set consists of all possible (not necessarily efficient) divisions of the collusion profits obtained from the joint selection of supply functions of the duopolists. Given a bargaining set, we consider potential disagreement payoffs obtained from the non-cooperative equilibrium of either the quantity competition or the supply function competition, and potential bargaining solutions splitting the gains from agreement either equally or proportionally according to the relative disagreement payoffs of the duopolists. Given any of these disagreement payoffs and bargaining solutions, we find that each duopolist has always incentive to join a collusive agreement. On the other hand, irrespective of whether the bargaining solution splits the gains from agreement equally or proportionally respecting the relative disagreement payoffs, the more efficient firm (the less efficient firm) in the cartel always obtains a higher agreement payoff when the disagreement payoffs are obtained from the equilibrium of supply function competition (quantity competition). For the studied disagreement payoffs and bargaining solutions, we also find that bargaining over collusion profits always makes the more efficient firm worse off and the less efficient firm better off in comparison to a collusive agreement equalizing the marginal costs of these two firms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we present some preliminaries, involving the model of Ciarreta and Gutiérrez-Hita (2012) and some of their results relevant for our paper. Using these preliminaries, we construct, in Sect. 3, a bargaining model for collusive duopolists. Sect. 4 contains our results and Sect. 5 concludes. Finally, the Appendix contains the proofs of the results in Sect. 4.",2

71,4,The Japanese Economic Review,31 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00049-5,The use of noncash payment methods for regular payments and the household demand for cash: evidence from Japan,October 2020,Hiroshi Fujiki,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, we examine the use of noncash payment methods with a special attention to regular payments in Japan. To convey to readers the importance of this research, this subsection begins by explaining the area of payment economics and why empirical economists care about the choice of payment method, especially cash and noncash payments. The subsection then explains the policy issues arising concerning the choice of payment methods unique to Japan, and argues why regular payments are a worthwhile direction of inquiry. The subsection ends by briefly summarizing the most important empirical findings in the paper. First, payment economics studies the mechanics of exchange, especially payment systems. The glossary of payments and market infrastructure terminology by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) (2016) classifies payment systems into large-value payment systems (LVPS) and retail payment systems, with LVPS being a funds transfer system that typically handles large-value high-priority payments. Typically, LVPS settles obligations between banks, and, therefore, includes the BOJ-NET in Japan and the Fedwire in the US. In contrast, a retail payment system is a funds transfer system that typically handles a large volume of relatively low-value payments in forms such as checks, credit transfers, direct debits, and card payment transactions, and, thus, includes Zengin-Net in Japan and the Automated Clearing House (ACH) in the US. In studying payment systems, payment economics views the choice of payment methods and the structure of the institutional arrangements that support them as endogenous, as argued in Lacker (2005). In particular, payment economics examines the kinds of financial frictions that lead to a particular payment method and its relationships with financial intermediation and technological advances (see Kahn and Roberds (2009) for details). Reflecting this motivation, as Lacker (2005) has summarized, payments economics lies at the intersection of monetary and banking economics with industrial organization. Theoretical studies on payment economics include search theoretic models and industrial organization models, including models that focus on the US credit card industry. See Nosal and Rocheteau (2011) and Rysman and Wright (2014) and their respective reviews. For the most part, empirical work on retail payment systems economics began by examining the consumer choice of electronic payment methods to understand better the possible reasons behind the puzzling slow adoption of electronic payment methods over cash and checks. Because the US Federal Reserve has been responsible for both check clearing and cash circulation, Federal Reserve economists needed to know the timing of the shift toward newer electronic payments to reduce the resources for check clearing and cash circulation in a timely manner. According to Li et al. (2019), US payment experts have predicted the arrival of the cashless and checkless society for several decades. However, despite the supply of electronic payment services by US financial institutions, including the introduction of credit cards in the 1950s, the ACH in the 1970s and debit cards in the 1980s, the adoption of electronic payment methods has been painfully slow. Since the mid-1990s, the Federal Reserve has begun studying the consumer demand for payment instruments more explicitly, because they believed that the reason for this delayed adoption lay on the consumer side. For instance, an early empirical analysis by Stavins (2002) using the US Survey of Consumer Finances’ data found that younger and more educated consumers with higher incomes were more likely to use electronic payments such as ATM, debit, credit and smart cards, direct deposits, and direct payments. Other empirical studies in several other economies have used point-of-sale data and central bank methods of payment surveys to respond to the policy question on the choice between cash and noncash payment methods after considering any cross-country differences in payment technology and infrastructure. See Stavins (2017) for a review, including cross-country comparisons, and Rysman and Schuh (2017) for a discussion of the role of mobile payments, faster payments, and virtual currencies. Second, Japan shares much the same history as the US of a relatively slow adoption of electronic payment methods, such as credit cards and electronic money, by consumers. However, Japan is somewhat unique in that its consumers successfully adopted bank account transfers or automatic withdrawal (an arrangement where a depositor will grant permission to companies to take payments from the depositor’s bank account automatically and regularly, say once a month) as early as the 1970s (note that unlike the US, the Japanese do not use personal checks). Hence, it is worthwhile for an empirical payment economist to investigate the slow adoption of electronic payment methods (the flipside of the coin is the persistent usage of cash) using Japanese data to facilitate cross-country comparison, not least with the US. Note that in making cross-country comparisons on the recent increase in the cash usage (usually the ratio of the amount of cash in circulation to nominal GDP) in many advanced economies (including Japan), economists reach strikingly different conclusions about whether they explicitly analyze the motivations for cash demand, either for day-to-day payments or for store of value (cash hoarding). They thus reach quite different policy recommendations depending on which motivations behind the cash demand they focus on, as the following three lines of inquiry demonstrate. First, Haasl et al. (2018) have argued that “[i]n Japan, a largely cash-based economy where the use of credit cards and other electronic payments is relatively uncommon, currency demand now stands at nearly 19% of GDP—the highest of any countries for which the Bank for International Settlements collects statistics” (1). They undertook simulations of US cash demand based on three different scenarios for the four key determinants of cash demand: (1) the size of the economy, (2) the adoption of new payment technologies that replace currency, (3) changes in interest rates, and (4) changes in foreign demand. However, they provided no evidence that the usage of credit cards and other electronic payments was relatively uncommon based on Japanese micro survey data, and did not measure Japanese cash usage depending on the four factors. Second, Fujiki and Nakashima (2019) interpret the strong Japanese cash demand by drawing on two different motivations for holding and using cash. They argue that the demand for hoarding in Japan was so strong that it outweighed the negative effect of the substitution toward noncash means of payment for day-to-day payments as follows. To start, Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a) and Fujiki and Nakashima (2019) showed that the determinants of the choice of day-to-day payment methods in Japan were not very different from those shown in the US, the Eurozone, and Canada, because the Japanese used both cash and electronic money for small-value day-to-day transactions, and credit cards for large-value day-to-day transactions. Therefore, in terms of the second factor for cash demand suggested by Haasl et al. (2018), their assertion of Japan as a largely cash-based economy is misleading at least for day-to-day transactions. In addition, Fujiki and Nakashima (2019) demonstrate that the strong cash demand in Japan must be the result of hoarding during the long period of low interest rates given a stable log–log cash demand function from 1995 to 2015, such that 42% of the total cash in circulation in 2017 could result from cash hoarding. These results are consistent with the theoretical predictions based on the third factor for cash demand suggested by Haasl et al. (2018). Finally, regarding the fourth factor for cash demand suggested by Haasl et al. (2018), to our knowledge, there is no estimate of the foreign demand for Japanese banknotes. Third, Khiaonarong and Humphrey (2019) argue that Japan might not actually be a cash-based economy as often asserted. They measure cash usage in 11 countriesFootnote 1 using three additional ratios to the conventional ratio of the amount of cash in circulation to nominal GDP. These are: (1) household consumption minus cash payment substitutes (the residual of household consumption paid by debit, credit card, and electronic money) divided by household consumption, (2) the share of cash withdrawals from ATMs and over the counter in household consumption, and (3) the share of cash withdrawals from ATMs and over the counter in total cash and cash-like payments (card and electronic money transactions). Based on their second measure, Japanese cash usage (82%) is the second highest in the world following Germany (84%). However, based on their third measure, Japanese cash usage (6%) is the lowest among 11 economies along with Norway (7%). Based on their fourth measure, Japanese cash usage (23%) is lower than US cash usage (29%), the fourth-lowest cash usage among the 11 economies. Judging from the consistency of ranking across four measures, Khiaonarong and Humphrey (2019) argue that their preferred measure is (3), and thus maintain that Japan is not a cash-based economy. However, the second and third measures are likely to reflect transaction demand each year and the marginal increase in the demand for hoarding, rather than the stock of cash hoarding. Thus, we should take their results as evidence that Japan is not a cash-based economy with day-to-day payments. Whether we explicitly analyze the motivations for cash demand, either for day-to-day payments or as a store of value (cash hoarding) matters, because these three lines of inquiry offer different possible policy recommendations for the Japanese government and its aim of a cashless economy. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) will subsidize cashless payments in some registered retail shops for nine months following the increase in the consumption tax rate on October 1 2019, and plans to increase the cashless payment ratio from 20 to 40% by 2025. Hence, it is a real-time policy issue. Unfortunately, we cannot obtain useful policy implications for the temporary subsidy of cashless payments from the results in Haasl et al. (2018), because they did not consider why Japanese consumers choose cash over noncash payment methods for day-to-day payments. Alternatively, if we were to rely upon the findings in Fujiki and Nakashima (2019), the temporary subsidy of cashless payments could replace relatively small-value day-to-day cash payments for noncash payments. Hence, its effect on total cash demand (including hoarding) would be small. Importantly, if the Japanese government truly wants to move to a cashless economy by reducing cash hoarding, an increase in the interest rate would be a promising policy recommendation. For example, the estimates in Fujiki and Nakashima (2019) suggest that if Japan were to escape from its liquidity trap (owing to the success of Abenomics and the planned increase in Japanese GDP to 600 trillion yen by 2020) and were the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates by up to 2%, the cash–GDP ratio would be about 8%. This suggests that cash demand in Japan would halve. In contrast, where we to draw upon the preferred measure of cash usage in Khiaonarong and Humphrey (2019), the temporary subsidization of cashless payments would be unnecessary, because Japan is not a cash-based economy, at least as far as day-to-day transactions are concerned. We believe that the more balanced policy implication arises from Fujiki and Nakashima’s (2019) analysis of the demand for cash for both day-to-day payments and as a store of value. Finally, if we were to accept that the choice of payment methods is worth investigating in Japan, why would we specifically care about regular payments? Hereafter, we take regular payments as regularly scheduled payments such as utility bill payments (say, utility bills for gas, electricity, water, and telephone) following the definition of the Survey of Household Finances (SHF) conducted by the Central Council for Financial Services Information, as used in our subsequent analysis. Unfortunately, there are no consistent statistics for regular payments. However, the following data suggest that it could be between 10 and 20% of total household expenditure (or households’ withdrawals from bank accounts). First, according to the 2017 Family Income and Expenditure Survey, utility bills for gas, electricity, water, and telephones account for about 12% of total monthly spending by the typical Japanese family household. Second, according to Mochizuki (2019), between January and June 2018, depositors paid their monthly wage bill in their banking accounts held in one of the three largest Japanese private banks withdrew their deposits in the following way: 45% by cash using ATMs and 55% by bank transfers and automatic withdrawals. Note that regular payments are likely through either credit card payments deducted from the cardholders’ bank accounts or automatic withdrawals from the bank account. Those represent 16% and 2% of the value of withdrawals, respectively, or about 20% of the value of withdrawals together. For an international comparison of Japanese regular payments, we refer to US bill payments (a payment made to a company or person at some date after the company or person has provided goods or services to a consumer, likely to occur at regular frequenciesFootnote 2). According to the 2018 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC) summarized in Foster et al. (2019, Table 7), bill payments represent about 30% of the number of US consumer payments overall. Among these bill payments, 30% are by automatic bill payment,Footnote 3 30% are by online bill paymentFootnote 4, and 40% are by mail, in person or by phone (Foster et al. 2019, Table 10). Having stated the definition and quantitative importance of regular payments, we offer two reasons for our focus on regular payments. First, the choice of payment methods depends on the payment context, say, making payments between persons or making bill payments. As an example, according to the Survey of the Japanese Bankers Association (JBA 2019, p. 92), the Japanese use cash heavily for day-to-day person-to-person transactions and automatic withdrawals for utility bill payments (usually at regular frequencies). More precisely, 73% of cash users, 23% of bank transfer users, and 11% of automatic withdrawal users use these payment methods for day-to-day person-to-person transactions. In contrast, 16% of cash users, 35% of bank transfer users, and 65% of automatic withdrawals users use them for utility bill payments. As a US example, according to the 2018 SCPC, 98%, 78%, 97%, and 80% of consumers (see Table 2 in Foster et al. (2019)) adopt cash, check, card (debit, credit, and prepaid), and electronic (online banking bill and bank account number payments either automatically or online) payments, respectively. The use of cash, check, card, and electronic payments account for 30%, 3%, 64%, and 2% of the number of purchase (including online and retail purchases of goods and servicesFootnote 5) and person-to-person paymentFootnote 6 (see Table 11 in Foster et al. (2019)). In contrast, the use of cash, check, card, and electronic payments accounts for 10%, 7%, 50%, and 29% of the number of bill payments [see Table 10 in Foster et al. (2019)]. In sum, Japanese consumers tend to choose automatic withdrawals more often for bill payments and usually at regular frequencies compared with day-to-day person-to-person payments. Similarly, while most US consumers have adopted card, cash, and electronic payments, they often use cash and card payments for purchases and person-to-person payments, and card and electronic payments for bills. The choice of payment methods then depends on the appropriate context, for example, payments for between persons or bill payments, as pointed out in Koulayev et al. (2016). Therefore, it makes sense to analyze the choice of payment methods in Japan with respect to the context of payment, not only for day-to-day payments as in Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a) but also for regular payments. Second, the choice of regular payment methods in Japan relates to the choice of payment methods for bill payments in the US, and, therefore, is deserving of a cross-country comparison. In the US, using the 2008 SCPC, Koulayev et al. (2016) found that bank account number payments were the most popular method for automatic and online bill payments. They examined the effect of the increase in the cost of using debit cards due to changes in regulation on the use of other payment methods given two payment contexts: bill payments and retail payments.Footnote 7 They found that not credit cards, but rather checks and bank account number payments were close substitutes for debit cards with bill payments. They also found that cash and credit cards were substitutes for debit cards for retail payments. Rysman and Schuh (2017) cited these results and suggested the study of payment methods specific to bill payments as an important area for future work, because Koulayev et al. (2016) showed that bill payments explain the popularity of bank account number payments as an alternative to a debit card. The evidence also suggests that new payment innovations with implications for bill payment may be particularly attractive. However, at the time, Rysman and Schuh (2017) were aware of very few studies focusing on bill payments, or other data sets that would even allow for a detailed study of bill payment behavior. In Japan, the SHF shows that automatic withdrawals are the favorite choice of regular payment method. Regular payments are one of the earliest examples of Japanese consumers adopting electronic payments, mainly through the choice of automatic withdrawals as long ago as the 1970s, and even preceding the widespread use of credit cards and electronic money. However, some may also have begun paying their utility bills by credit card, arguably because many major credit cards offer discounts for their points reward program. If we were to identify a shift from automatic withdrawals to credit cards, it would be possibly unique to Japan. This is because the frequency of the use of cash, card and electronic payments in the US accounts for a mostly stable 10%, 50%, and 25% of bill payments from 2015 to 2019 (see Foster et al. (2019), Table 10). Conversely, if we were to identify a shift from automatic withdrawals to cash, it would be inconsistent with the common understanding of a gradual shift from cash to electronic payments including automatic withdrawals observed in many economies including Japan. The Japanese government should appreciate the reasons behind such a shift, if any, because it is at once at odds with their policy objective of a cashless society. To infer the reasons behind the changes in the choice of regular payment methods, if any, we should examine what demographic variables, such as age, income, gender, or educational attainment, relate to the less frequent use of automatic withdrawals and the more frequent use of credit cards or cash. However, despite strong academic interest, the lack of individual data on regular payments has acted against research in this area. We address this using unique survey data on the choice of payment methods for regular payments from 2007 to 2014 in Japan. The major empirical findings in this paper are as follows. We first show that automatic withdrawals play an important role in regular payments in Japan, as bank account number payments do in US bill payments. We identify a gradual shift from automatic withdrawals to credit cards for regular payments in the family household data, which is unique within the electronic payment methods observed in Japan. We also find that the use of credit cards is associated with younger household heads, and this is consistent with the previous findings in both Japan and abroad. However, in the single-person household data, the popularity of both credit cards and cash surprisingly increased. Regrettably, we do not know to what extent this finding is attributable to our Japanese data set. However, the evidence supporting the increasing choice of cash is a unique and challenging finding. It is well known that the Japanese use cash widely for day-to-day transactions. Less well known is the fact that the Japanese have also used automatic withdrawals (direct debits or Kouza Furikae in Japanese) widely for regular payments since the early 1970s, including the payment of gas, electricity, water, and telephone utility bills, rather than using cash, personal checks, or credit cards.Footnote 8 In most cases, it is not depositors, but the companies that pay the fees for this service to the banks. Automatic withdrawal is one of the primary services included in the financial service packages provided by major Japanese banks since 1972 (so-called Sogo Kouza in Japanese). The others are direct payroll deposits, cash cards for online cash dispensers, and automated teller machines (ATMs), and overdrafts from savings deposits. Because Sogo Kouza are free of charge, the problem of the “unbanked” has not been a major policy issue in Japan. Prior to Sogo Kouza, workers would receive their monthly wage in cash, pay any utility bills or provide for day-to-day spending using cash, and then deposit any remaining cash into the bank branch holding their account. Following the introduction of Sogo Kouza, workers now withdraw the necessary cash using an ATM card from any bank branch and allow the automatic withdrawal service to pay for any utility bills. Where the deposited amount is less than the bill payment, an overdraft from the savings deposit (usually up to 90% of the outstanding amount) enables settlement. Given the time saving from the use of the automatic withdrawal service, it has been the default payment method for regularly scheduled payments until recently. The Japanese tend to pay for their regular payments using not only automatic withdrawals, but also credit cards and cash. The use of credit cards became popular in Japan especially after the 1990s, reflecting the increase in overseas travel and Internet transactions by the Japanese. Regarding the increasing choice of credit cards, the points reward programs offered by some credit card companies for making regular payments with them seem to be the main reason. As evidence, an annual survey conducted by the Japan Credit Bureau (one of the oldest credit card issuers in Japan) shows that the key reason for most Japanese paying by credit card was the ease of accumulating points in credit card points’ reward programs.Footnote 9 To support this hypothesis, in subsection 2.2, we show that if a household chooses credit cards for regular payments, it also tends to choose credit cards to pay for high-value day-to-day transactions when compared with households choosing to pay using automatic withdrawals for regular payments. Note that the use of installment or revolving payments (standard payment methods for US credit cards) is likely not the main advantage for Japanese households choosing credit cards, because about 90% of credit card holders choose to pay using only one-time payments.Footnote 10 Regarding the use of cash for regular payments, the deregulation of the Japanese financial industry, which allows national convenience store chains to accept utility bill payments by cash on behalf of the utility companies, seems to be a primary reason. Behind this deregulation lies the fact that Japanese banks were once very reluctant to accept utility bill payments, because the utility companies and the tax office refused to pay sufficient service charges, and thus banks required their depositors to use instead the automatic withdrawal service.Footnote 11 The acceptance of bill payments by cash on behalf of utility companies in convenience stores began with the acceptance of electronic utility bill payments in the Kanto region in 1987, followed by the acceptance of bill payments for some local taxes and national health insurance premiums in 2003. Payment acceptance service companies, which introduced a unified bar code for bills, are behind these bill payments in convenience stores. This was useful for depositors who prefer not to use credit cards to pay their utility bills, and who would then withdraw cash from ATMs in the convenience store and then submit their utility bills and cash to the cashier in the same store. However, unlike the teller counters in banks and post offices, service in the convenience stores was quick and available on a 24/7/365 basis. Consequently, bill payment by cash seems to be a reasonable choice for households frequently visiting convenience stores. Many Japanese, especially the middle-aged and elderly, have taken Sogo Kouza for granted for some time. Figure 1 illustrates the proportion of the two most-favored methods of payment (including for day-to-day and regular payments) from five options: cash, credit cards, debit cards, automatic withdrawal, and other, from 1991 to 1994, in 2000, and from 2002 to 2006, as reported in the SHF. Figure 1 clearly illustrates the heavy reliance of Japanese consumers on cash and automatic withdrawal, with survey respondents choosing cash (the solid line) and automatic withdrawal (the dashed line) accounting for anywhere between 80–90% and 60–70% of all respondents, respectively.Footnote 12 Source: SHF 1991–1994, 2000, 2002–2006 Choice of payment method in Japan. However, note that Fig. 1 also shows that respondents choosing credit cards (the dotted line) increased to 25% in 2006, suggesting that these circumstances are changing rapidly. Since 2007, the SHF has provided information on the two favorite methods of payment for two types of transactions: day-to-day transactions and regular payments. Regarding the two most-favored methods for regular payments, it asks respondents to select from the five options of “cash (hereafter Cash),” “credit cards (hereafter Card),” “electronic money (including debit cards),” “automatic withdrawal (hereafter AW),” and “other” for samples of family and single-person households. About 98% of the respondents select one of the following six choices, comprising Cash only, Card and Cash (hereafter Card & Cash), Cash and AW (hereafter Cash & AW), Card only, Card & AW (hereafter Card & AW), and AW only. In this paper, we focus on these six choices from 2007 to 2014. The upper panel in Table 1 provides the percentages for the six choices made by the sample family households from 2007 to 2014 and the percentage point changes in the proportions from 2007 to 2014 (the row labeled “Changes from 2007 to 2014”). The table also details the total number of observations from 2007 to 2014, the percentage of this for each of the six choices, and the average cash holdings, standard errors, and medians for each choice. As shown, the favorite choices for family households are AW only (48.2% of all observations), Cash & AW (22.8%), and Card & AW (13.5%), all of which include AW. However, we can also discern the declining choice of AW only and Cash & AW over time. Specifically, the proportion of households choosing AW only and Cash & AW decreased by 7.3 (from 52.9 to 45.6%) and 4.3 (from 24.2 to 19.9%) percentage points, respectively. The number of households choosing Cash only (7.4% of all observations) was slightly decreased by 0.9 percentage points (from 8.2 to 7.3%). In their place, we can see an increase in the number of households making choices involving Card. Specifically, Card & AW (13.5% of all observations), Card only (5.1%), and Card & Cash (3.0%) increased by 5.4 (from 10.2 to 15.6%), 4.7 (from 2.7 to 7.5%, and 2.4 (from 1.8 to 4.2%) percentage points, respectively. Does this trend suggest the decreasing demand for cash as consumers use credit cards to make regular payments? Considering the bottom row, the average cash holdings of those choosing Card only (120.9 thousand yen) and Card & AW (115.7 thousand yen) are lower than for those choosing AW only (147.6 thousand yen) and Cash & AW (140.6 thousand yen). While the average cash holdings of households choosing Card & Cash (157.5 thousand yen) exceeds that for AW only and Cash & AW, it remains a less popular choice. Accordingly, we anticipate that these changes should be associated with the decreasing demand for cash by family households, assuming that our inferences based on the unconditional average cash holdings are correct and noting that the standard errors of cash holding are large and the median cash holdings are relatively small compared with the average cash holdings. For their part, Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a) showed that holding key demographic factors constant, credit card users tend to have smaller cash holdings than cash users for day-to-day transaction values of more than 1000 yen using the same family household data from the SHF from 2007 to 2014 as in this study.Footnote 13 Given the increasing choice of credit cards in day-to-day transactions, we could predict that the frequent choice of Card in regular payments in place of AW is associated with the decreasing demand for cash. The lower panel of Table 1 details the results for single-person households in a similar manner and again demonstrates the declining popularity of choices involving AW. Specifically, the percentage of households choosing AW only (26.2% of all observations), Card & AW (24.9%), and Cash & AW (11.1%) decreased by 10.9 percentage points (from 31.3 to 20.4%), 2.4 percentage points (from 26.5 to 24.1%), and 3.6 percentage points (from 12.7 to 9.2%), respectively. The table also suggests the increasing popularity of choices involving Cash & Card, with the percentage of households choosing Card only (18.1% of all observations) and Card & Cash (8.8%) increasing by 10.2 percentage points (from 12.2 to 22.4%), and 1.3 percentage points (from 7.5 to 8.7%). However, unlike the family household data, the percentages of a household choosing Cash only (11.0% of all observations) increased by 5.4 percentage points (from 9.8 to 15.2%). The bottom row in the table shows that the average cash holdings of households with the two increasingly popular choices, Card only (183.2 thousand yen) and Card & Cash (202.8 thousand yen), are larger than those of three decreasingly popular choices, comprising AW only (174.5 thousand yen), Cash & AW (127.8 thousand yen), and Card & AW (169.7 thousand yen). Therefore, we would not argue that the declining popularity of choices involving AW and the increasing popularity of choices involving Card would necessarily lead to the decreasing demand for cash by single-person households. For their part, Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a) did not examine the single-person household dataset, and thus would have been unable to note the increasing popularity of Cash only. Based on the preliminary findings in Table 1, we pose two questions. First, what household characteristics are associated with choices involving Card and AW in family and single-person households, and Cash only in single-person households? Second, is the decreasing choice of AW and the increasing choice of Card in both family and single-person households and Cash in single-person households associated with the increasing or decreasing demand for cash by Japanese households? To respond to the first question, we estimate a multinomial logit model to identify the key demographic variables distinguishing between households choosing Card, Cash, and AW. We find that households with younger household heads tend to have choices involving Card. We also find that households with more disposable income and financial assets tend to choose Card & AW. In contrast, single-person households choosing Cash only tend to have fewer financial assets, lower financial literacy as measured by knowledge of the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan, less interest in the services provided by banks, are self-employed or part-time workers, and have lower levels of education. For the second question, we compare the cash demands for households with increasingly popular choices (Card & AW, Card only, and Card & Cash in families and Card only, Cash only, and Card & Cash for single persons) and decreasingly popular choices (AW only, Cash & AW, and Cash only in families and AW only, Cash & AW, and Card & AW for single persons). We then compare the demand for cash using the simulated values from the estimates of a conditional demand for cash function and employing two matching techniques. We find that recent changes in the popularity of the choice of regular payments is associated with the decreasing (increasing) demand for cash in family (single-person) households. This paper is an extension of the work by Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a). While we employ the same repeated cross-sectional data sets and statistical methods as in Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a), these authors did not consider the declining choice of AW in regular payments and its effects on the cash usage, nor did they analyze the data for single-person households. For individual Japanese household data, Fujiki and Tanaka (2018b) focused on payment choices for day-to-day transaction values less than 1000 yen, but employed different statistical methods to Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a). Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a) provide a useful survey of other related Japanese literature. Our research also relates to work on the choice of consumer payment methods and their determinants, and the demand for cash in economies other than Japan. Recent studies in the area include Esselink and Hernández (2017) for the Eurozone, Greene et al. (2017), Koulayev et al. (2016), and Schuh and Briglevics (2014) for the US, Henry et al. (2018), Wakamori and Welte (2017) and Chen et al. (2017) for Canada, Jonker et al. (2018) for The Netherlands, and Lippi and Secchi (2009) for Italy. Bagnall et al. (2016) provides an international perspective using surveys of cross-country payment diaries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly explains the statistical model and discusses the data used for the analysis. Section 3 reports the estimation results for the choice of payment method and Sect. 4 details the results for the conditional cash demand function. Section 5 concludes after identifying some of the limitations of the analysis.",8

As innovation is mostly generated from a combination of different types of knowledge (Schumpeter 1934), knowledge diffusion through networks of individuals and organizations is an important driver of innovation (Jackson 2010; Romer 1990). Accordingly, the effect of networks on innovation performance has recently been examined extensively in the literature as surveyed in Phelps et al. (2012). In the literature, a major type of network that conduits knowledge diffusion is a research collaboration among researchers and organizations (Ahuja 2000; Belderbos et al. 2014; Fleming et al. 2007a, b; Forti et al. 2013; Gonzalez-Brambila et al. 2013; Haus-Reve et al. 2019), while some other types, such as supply chains (Fitjar and Rodríguez-Pose 2013; Todo et al. 2016) and interpersonal interactions (Brennecke and Rank 2017; Perry-Smith 2006; Sosa 2011), can also facilitate knowledge diffusion. This paper particularly focuses on the effect of research collaboration among firms in the world economy, because inter-firm knowledge linkages across countries have been strengthened recently due to the expansion of global value chains (Baldwin 2016) and the recognition of the importance of open innovation (Chesbrough 2003). Many existing studies have already examined the effect of inter-firm research collaboration, although the mainstream of the literature has focused on collaboration between scientific researchers and between firms and universities (Chen et al. 2019; Phelps et al. 2012). However, the literature has not reached a consensus or conclusion in the following five aspects, as we will explain in more detail in the next section on the literature review. An important aspect of research collaboration is internationality (Chen et al. 2019). On the one hand, collaboration partners in the same country are geographically and technologically similar to each other. This proximity may facilitate more diffusion of knowledge due to smaller transport and transaction costs and thus more innovation. On the other hand, proximate linkages may also lead to less innovation due to overlapped and redundant knowledge shared among neighbors (Berliant and Fujita 2008; Boschma 2005; Boschma and Frenken 2010). The number of each firm’s collaboration partners can also affect the innovation. The number of partners, or the degree centrality, may be related to the amount of accessible knowledge and thus be positively associated with innovation. However, creating and maintaining many collaboration ties may be too costly in terms of physical transportation, social communication, and administration (Phelps et al. 2012). How densely a firm's collaborators are connected with each other also matters to innovation. On one hand, when the firm's partners also collaborate with each other, the firm and its partners are more likely to trust each other and thus be willing to share knowledge (Coleman 1988), resulting in more innovation. On the other hand, because knowledge of a firm's partners already connected may be overlapped with each other and redundant (Burt 1992), the firm's dense ego-networks may not be able to facilitate innovation. Further, Burt (1992) conceptualizes “structural holes” through which agents are connected directly and indirectly to diverse partners in a network. Although Burt (1992, 2004) argues that brokers that fill structural holes and connect different groups can obtain more knowledge and thus perform better, firms liked with diverse partners may not be able to exchange much knowledge due to lack of strength of ties. Another factor that has mostly been neglected in the literature is whether or not a research collaboration improves the ability of the participant firms and thus the quality of their subsequent innovation without any collaboration. Most of the existing studies examined how research collaboration affects innovation without distinguishing between outcomes achieved by collaborative and individual research activities. Therefore, although some research collaboration is found to improve the quality of innovation achieved by the collaboration, it is still unclear whether or not the collaboration raises the ability of collaboration partners. The present study re-examines these issues, using a comprehensive firm-level panel dataset of 534,569 patent-holding firms in the world for the period 1991–2010.Footnote 1 We identify the global research collaboration network among firms by patent co-ownership or co-patenting. We realize that co-patenting relationships capture only a subset of successful research collaboration (Briggs 2015) due to, for example, firms’ reluctance to disclose the new knowledge to the public through patenting and legal and institutional complication of value appropriation from co-patenting (Belderbos et al. 2014; Hagedoorn 2003; Hagedoorn et al. 2003). However, we use this identification so that we can cover a substantially large number of firms in the world including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developed, emerging, and even some developing countries, thanks to the richness of patent data. Using the dataset, we find that co-patenting with other firms, particularly with foreign firms, leads to substantial improvement in the quality of firms’ innovation. In addition, the structure of the firm’s co-patenting network is found to influence its innovation performance. Most notably, when a firm bridges a larger variety of firms in the global co-patenting network, its performance is higher, suggesting the important role of diverse linkages in innovation. These results are applicable to the effect on the quality of innovation achieved individually without any co-patenting, although the size of the effect on innovation without co-patenting is smaller than that with co-patenting. Hence, there is a possibility that research collaboration raises the collaborating firms' innovative ability. Finally, we find that the co-patenting effect is larger in the 2000s than in the 1990s and varies across countries. We contribute to the empirical literature on the effect of inter-firm research collaboration on innovation performance in the following five aspects. First, we use a large-scale dataset for more than a half-million firms in the world to evaluate how the global research collaboration network of firms affects the quality of their innovation. Existing studies often use smaller samples, typically of several hundred R&D-intensive firms. Although these data may capture research collaboration among firms more accurately than ours, the larger coverage of our data enables us to apply the results to more general settings. Second, we distinguish between the effect of intra- and international research collaboration, finding a substantially larger effect of the latter. This adds to the evidence in the literature supporting a larger effect of distant ties than of proximate ties. Third, we also highlight differences between intra- and international collaboration in the effect of network characteristics, showing that brokerage in the international network can promote more innovation than brokerage in an intra-national network. Fourth, we estimate the effect of collaboration on the quality of innovation achieved individually without collaboration to confirm that innovation capacity is expanded by research collaboration. This examination has not been conducted, to the best of the authors' knowledge. Finally, we carefully investigate cross-country variations in the characteristics of firms' research collaboration and the resulting effect on performance. Based on the examination, we provide practical policy implications in general as well as specific to some countries. The closest works to ours are Belderbos et al. (2014) and Briggs (2015) who also use large-scale patent data to examine the effect of international co-patenting on citations. However, these two works do not incorporate any measure of network structure. The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section provides testable hypotheses based on theoretical considerations in the literature, whereas Sect. 3 describes the data and variables used in the estimation, including cross-country comparison and network structure. Section 4 explains the estimation equation and methodology, and Sect. 5 presents the results. Section 6 summarizes and discusses the results and provides policy implications.",10

Therefore, the economy in Japan should be considerably affected by their travel dynamics. For marketers in the tourism industry, for example, a global view of their travel patterns is expected to be an informative piece of information. Human mobility data are distributed by several organizations, and an analysis of mobility patterns has been an important topic in this regard. During the past decade, in particular, datasets based on records of mobile devices (Hossmann et al. 2011; Isaacman et al. 2012; Ganti et al. 2013) and geo-located tags in social networks (Hawelka et al. 2014; Zagheni et al. 2014; Spyratos et al. 2019) have been actively studied. The target scale ranges from an intramural or urban scale to an international scale (e.g., migration). In this paper, we describe a network analysis of travel pathways by foreign travelers in Japan. The dataset analyzed is a set of travel records of foreign travelers in Japan that is distributed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, called the FF-data (Flow of Foreigners-Data) [7]. In this dataset, the traveler pathways, i.e., the locations the travelers visited in chronological order, are recorded based on survey responses of the travelers themselves. FF-data are separated into yearly datasets; currently, datasets from 2014 through 2017 are available. Although these datasets contain various attributes of foreign visitors, we focus on identifying the macroscopic features of the travel pathways. As an interesting characteristic of such travel pathways, because Japan is surrounded by water and because the FF-data contain only the records of foreign travelers, all pathways start and end at airports or seaports. It is common to characterize travel data as a network (Barbosa et al. 2018). A naive way to characterize travel data as a network is to represent the locations of a departure and destination as nodes and a transition of a traveler between two nodes as a directed edge. The result is typically a multigraph (a graph with multiple edges between a pair of nodes) because numerous travelers travel between the same pairs of locations. However, such a network representation has a crucial limitation as it can only encode pairwise information among the nodes. Although some travelers visit more than one destination during their visit, the pathways are broken down into independent transitions between each pair of locations and are encoded as edges. For example, although the pathway from Tokyo to Osaka, followed by Osaka to Kyoto, is quite popular, presumably for tourists, the transition from Osaka to Kyoto is recorded independent of the transition from Tokyo to Osaka. Representative transitions of foreign travelers in identified modules. The details of this figure are described in Sect. 2.3 We instead conducted an analysis using a higher-order network representation called a memory network (Rosvall et al. 2014; Edler et al. 2017; Lambiotte et al. 2019) that incorporates the information of multiple transitions of each traveler. We identify densely connected components (sets of nodes) in a memory network and denote them as modules. A structure that consists of densely connected components is termed an assortative structure, and a method to identify an assortative structure is termed community detection.Footnote 1 Figure 1 shows a brief overview of the classified elements of traveler pathways. Note that the pathways are basically classified into modules of different regions. For example, however, because Tokyo is a hub for many different destinations, transitions containing Tokyo belong to many different modules. This is therefore an overlapping module structure. Herein, we provide a brief introduction to a memory network; a formal definition of the memory network can be found in  Rosvall et al. (2014) and Edler et al. (2017) and in Appendix A. An mth-order Markov (memory) network consists of state nodes and the directed edges between them. A state node represents the destination as well as its recent \(m-1\) transitions. For example, in a second-order Markov network, when a traveler moves from Osaka to Kyoto, we have a state node that places Kyoto as the destination with the memory of Osaka as the previous location. If the traveler left Tokyo before arriving at Osaka, we also have a state node that has Osaka as the destination with the memory of Tokyo, and these two state nodes are connected by a directed edge. Because many travelers travel along similar pathways, a memory network is typically a multigraph. From the viewpoint of a memory network, a simple network representation is categorized as a first-order Markov network or a memoryless network. The actual locations are referred to as physical nodes in a memory network. The destination of a state node is regarded as a physical node to which a state node belongs. As a community detection algorithm for memory and memoryless networks, we employ the Infomap [12] that optimizes an objective function called the map equation (Rosvall and Bergstrom 2008, 2011) (see Appendix A for a brief introduction of the map equation). Pathway examples (top) and the corresponding network elements in a second-order Markov network (bottom) To better understand the community detection on memory networks, let us consider some specific pathways in second-order Markov networks. We denote a state node corresponding to a transition from location i to location j as \(\overrightarrow{ij}\). If a traveler moves from i to j and he/she moves back to i again (i.e., a backtracking pathway) as shown in Fig. 2a (top), we have a directed edge from \(\overrightarrow{ij}\) to \(\overrightarrow{ji}\) (Fig. 2a (bottom)). In contrast, when we have asymmetric pathways, as shown in Fig. 2b (top), the state nodes of opposite directions are not connected (Fig. 2b (bottom)). Note, however, that even when the backtracking pathway is absent and pathways are asymmetric, \(\overrightarrow{ij}\) and \(\overrightarrow{ji}\) can be (indirectly) connected; the pathways and the corresponding network element shown in Fig. 2c is such an example. When the pathways in Fig. 2a, c are popular, \(\overrightarrow{ij}\) and \(\overrightarrow{ji}\) are likely to belong to the same module. It should be noted that, although representing a dataset using a memoryless network can incur a significant loss of information, it is occasionally sufficient, depending on the dataset and purpose of the analysis. Furthermore, even when a record of multiple transitions is not explicitly encoded in a network, it may be possible to infer similarities among nodes in some sense from such a simple network. For example, when every pair of nodes is connected by a considerably large number of edges within a certain node set, we can trivially conclude that those nodes are similar to each other. Therefore, before moving on to an analysis of a second-order Markov network, we first investigate the basic statistics and a first-order Markov network of the FF-data to determine whether a higher-order network representation is necessary for an extraction of a module structure.",

72,2,The Japanese Economic Review,25 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00054-8,Nominal contracts and the payment system,April 2021,Hajime Tomura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Credit contracts are usually nominal. This is true even for trade credit, in which producers buy inputs from suppliers on credit, and pay money to suppliers at a later date. This use of money is different from the standard theory on the need for money, in which buyers have to pay money to sellers because they cannot be committed to repaying debt. See Samuelson (1958), Townsend (1980), Kiyotaki and Wright (1989), and Lagos and Wright (2005) for examples of seminal papers in the literature. A possible explanation for this observation is that sellers require buyers to repay money even if buyers can be committed to repaying debt, because sellers need to buy goods from third parties due to lack of double coincidence of wants between buyers and sellers. Freeman (1996a) presents such a model to generate nominal debt endogenously. This explanation, however, must assume that sellers cannot pay buyers’ products or IOUs to buy goods from third parties. This paper presents an alternative friction that leads to the use of nominal debt contracts as well as the use of fiat money as a means of payment for goods. This result is not based on lack of double coincidence of wants between buyers and sellers. This paper shows that money is necessary even without this friction, because it is essential for credit. More specifically, this paper introduces into an overlapping generations model the civil court’s inability to distinguish different qualities of goods of the same kind. The underlying assumption is that, unlike quantities, the evaluation of qualities is inevitably subjective, and thus difficult to define objectively enough to be verifiable at the civil court. As a result, the civil court cannot regard it as a breach of contract if producers acquire inputs from suppliers by promising to deliver high-quality goods later, but then deliver low-quality goods instead to save the production cost. Ex ante, the expectation of this moral hazard problem discourages suppliers from entering into a real credit contract to provide trade credit to producers. Otherwise, the model is a standard overlapping generations model with dynamic efficiency, in which money is not essential.Footnote 1 In contrast to goods, fiat money is assumed to be intrinsically useless, but recognizable by the civil court. This assumption reflects the fact that the nominal value of fiat money is just a number, which is easy to recognize. It is also consistent with the fact that even though law in each country usually allows the use of any lawful goods for a medium of exchange, it often designates fiat money issued by the central bank as legal tender in the country.Footnote 2 The definition of legal tender is such that “a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender,” given debt being denominated in the units of legal tender.Footnote 3 Thus, in legal terms, fiat money is characterized as a debt-repayment instrument recognizable by the civil court in practice. This characterization of fiat money can be extended to commodity money such as gold, as stamping metal can produce a coin with a nominal value, regardless of the coin’s metal content. Indeed, minted coins are usually designated as legal tender along with legal-tender notes issued by the central bank in each country. Given the existence of a competitive goods market, the model shows that suppliers can provide trade credit to producers if producers are liable to repay fiat money. On one hand, suppliers do not have to pay fiat money for producers’ products in the goods market, if producers deliver low-quality goods to the market to acquire fiat money. On the other hand, if producers fail to repay fiat money, then the civil court can seize their belongings, as the repayment of fiat money, or lack thereof, is verifiable. In this case, the court can sell the seized belongings for fiat money in the competitive goods market without determining the quality of each belonging it sells, because buyers in the market can distinguish the different qualities of goods, and exploit any arbitrage opportunity unless the pricing of each good is fair in the market. This feature of the model is consistent with the fact that the civil court normally sells foreclosed properties for cash through auctions in practice. It also implies that producers do not gain anything by delivering low-quality goods to the goods market or defaulting on nominal debt contracts. Thus, producers can be committed to selling high-quality goods to suppliers in the goods market, and then repaying their nominal debt by the fiat money acquired in the market. This result is related to the literature on incomplete contracts and collateral, such as Hart and Moore (1994, (1998) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). While these papers analyze the private enforcement of a credit contract without the power of the civil court, this paper highlights the role of fiat money as a remedy to the limited ability of the civil court to make a credit contract enforceable without collateral. This result is also related to the literature on the optimality of nominal contracts for risk sharing, such as Jovanovic and Ueda (1997), Tabellini and Freeman (1998), and Doepke and Schneider (2017). These papers analyze the role of money as a unit of account, without characterizing money as a means of payment. In contrast, this paper focuses on an alternative friction that leads to the use of nominal debt contracts as well as the use of fiat money as a means of payment for goods. Furthermore, this paper shows that suppliers must pay fiat money for goods sold by producers before receiving the repayments of debt in a monetary equilibrium in the model, because otherwise producers would not be able to obtain fiat money to repay debt. This bottleneck in the flow of fiat money can cause a shortage of real money balances for debt repayments, resulting in underproduction by producers. This problem can be resolved if the central bank can lend fiat money to suppliers elastically through a discount window at a zero interest rate within each period. This result is consistent with the existence of a standard liquidity facility offered by the central bank in practice, such as intraday overdrafts of bank reserves for commercial banks. Thus, characterizing fiat money as a debt-repayment instrument recognizable by the civil court can explain both the circulation of fiat money in the economy and the need for a standard central-bank policy in practice. This result adds to the literature that analyzes the need for an elastic money supply in the payment system, such as Freeman (1996a, (1996b, (1999), Zhou (2000), Smith (2002), Fujiki (2003, (2006), Martin (2004), Mills (2006), Antinolfi and Keister (2006), Gu et al. (2011), and Chapman and Martin (2013). This paper contributes to this literature by showing that a bottleneck in the flow of fiat money that leads to the need for an elastic money supply can be derived from a much simpler environment than complex traveling constraints in a spatial economy utilized in the literature. This paper is also related to the paper by Sargent and Wallace (1982), which shows that the central bank’s discount window can nullify the negative effect of legal restriction that prohibits financial intermediaries from issuing small-denomination notes backed by private loans. Other related papers are the works by Hancock and Wilcox (1996) and Afonso and Shin (2011), which analyze the demand and effect of intraday overdrafts in the interbank payment system using U.S. Fedwire data.Footnote 4 This paper adds to these papers by deriving an endogenous need for intraday overdrafts offered by the central bank. In addition, to highlight the limited ability of the civil court, this paper abstracts from asymmetric information among private agents. In related literature, Williamson and Wright (1994) show that introducing universally identifiable fiat money can improve welfare in an exchange economy, if traders can identify the quality of each other’s commodity in bilateral trades only with some probability.Footnote 5 Even though this paper also features universally identifiable fiat money, the focus is on the limited ability of the civil court, rather than asymmetric information among private agents. This approach yields a new finding that the need for two institutional features of the current monetary system—that is, fiat money being legal tender and a discount window offered by the central bank—can stem from the same friction. In addition, Kiyotaki and Moore (2005) characterize fiat money as a liquid substitute for illiquid private securities due to asymmetric information among private agents. Their model does not involve nominal contracts. To clarify, there are many examples in history that commodities and securities of heterogeneous qualities circulated as monies with different purchasing powers simultaneously without having government stamps or legal tender status.Footnote 6 Thus, the need for a debt-repayment instrument recognizable by the civil court does not explain all the needs for money in history. Nonetheless, it is useful to enhance the set of frictions that can explain the circulation of fiat money, because a different friction has a different implication for the future of the monetary system. For example, if the current need for fiat money stems from lack of credit or double coincidence of wants, or asymmetric information among private agents, then a private money, such as a cryptocurrency, may be able to substitute legal currencies, because the existence of a monetary equilibrium is spontaneous. If the underlying friction for the current use of fiat money is the need for a debt-repayment instrument recognizable by the civil court, however, a private money will not substitute legal currencies automatically, because legal tender is set by law in each country. In this case, a private money’s success will hinge on whether it can substitute the role of the civil court in contract enforcement. This prediction is a testable implication of this paper’s analysis. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A baseline model without fiat money is described in Sect. 2. Fiat money and the central bank’s discount window are introduced in Sects 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 concludes this paper.",1

On the contrary, there is a relatively small body of research on changes in consumption distribution in Japan.Footnote 1 Lise et al. (2014) is an exception in that they show the disjuncture between changes in income inequality and changes in consumption inequality using Japanese data.Footnote 2 However, they do not examine the relationship between changes in income and consumption inequality. The purpose of the current study is, thus, to understand the link between changes in income and consumption inequality in Japan by estimating the partial insurance model proposed by Blundell et al. (2008) (hereafter, BPP). The partial insurance model has several advantages over other economic models for studying the relationship between consumption insurance and income shocks. Two seminal hypotheses explain household consumption behavior in the face of income shocks. One is the complete market hypothesis, which assumes that consumption is fully insured against idiosyncratic shocks to income, both transitory and permanent. The other is the permanent income hypothesis (PIH), which assumes that personal saving is the only mechanism available to agents to smooth income shocks. While numerous studies have tested these hypotheses, consensus is lacking.Footnote 3 The partial insurance model is flexible in that it allows consumption to respond to both permanent and transitory income shocks as well as has no predetermined degree of the transmission of income shocks to consumption. BPP show evidence of partial insurance for permanent shocks and almost complete insurance for transitory shocks using US panel data. They use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) together with an imputation procedure based on food demand estimates from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which covers the 1980s. The current study, on the contrary, provides at least four relevant contributions. First, it uses a panel dataset that covers the recessions in the 2000s induced by the bursting of the dot-com bubble and bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers to evaluate the effects of income shocks on economic welfare, measured in terms of consumption, during recession periods. Second, the current study uses a dataset that contains rich expenditure items to alleviate fears about a measurement error in consumption, especially in comparison with BPP, who use imputed non-durable expenditure.Footnote 4 Casado (2011) shows that imputed data can cause downward bias when estimating partial insurance parameters. Third, the current study provides sensitivity checks to outliers in the consumption and income data. As discussed by previous income dynamics studies such as Meghir and Pistaferri (2011) and the references therein, it is difficult to separately estimate the variance in transitory income shocks from the variance in the measurement error in income. Therefore, the partial insurance parameter of transitory income shocks could be sensitive to income outliers. The current study conducts some robustness checks by omitting consumption and income outliers to check the stability of the partial insurance parameters. Finally, public and private insurance mechanisms vary among countries, and there is no estimation of the partial insurance model for Asian countries. The accumulation of international evidence on the degree of the transmission of income shocks to consumption would be helpful to assess the optimal policy for mitigating income shocks, and the current study provides such evidence for the Japanese context. This study uses the non-durable expenditure and disposable income surveyed monthly and available once per year to estimate the partial insurance model, whereas BPP use yearly data. I show that using monthly data allows me to identify the partial insurance parameters. The results of estimating the partial insurance model show that the partial insurance parameter of permanent income shocks is 0.488. This finding indicates that the impact of permanent income shocks on consumption is mitigated by half because of an insurance mechanism. The partial insurance parameter of transitory income shocks is 0.103, and this rejects the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero at the 1% significance level. This finding implies that the insurance mechanism does not fully work against transitory income shocks. The magnitudes of the partial insurance parameters are the same as those in BPP’s study. The estimation results of the variances in income shocks indicate that permanent income shocks statistically did not change over this period, while transitory income shocks did. This finding does not contradict observational changes in consumption and income inequality. Furthermore, I estimate the partial insurance model by eliminating outliers in the consumption and income data. The results show that the partial insurance parameter of permanent income shocks is robust against outliers, while that of transitory income shocks decreases if the sample in the tails of the income distribution is dropped. I also use other consumption measures and find that the partial insurance parameters remain unchanged for the definition of non-durable expenditure. Finally, I split the sample by financial wealth and educational attainment separately to check the prediction of the partial insurance model. In line with the prediction, the partial insurance parameters of permanent income shocks are higher for households with higher wealth and whose male head is highly educated. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the evolution of consumption and income inequality and presents the panel data used herein. Section 3 introduces the partial insurance model suggested by BPP, which can identify the degree of insurance against permanent and transitory income shocks, and shows that using monthly data can identify the partial insurance parameters. Section 4 presents the empirical results on the estimates of the insurance parameters and variances in permanent and transitory income shocks. Section 5 concludes.",1

Responses to repeated nudge-based messages for preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection,July 2021,Shusaku Sasaki,Hirofumi Kurokawa,Fumio Ohtake,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has posed a global health threat. Until effective vaccination is completed for a sufficient number of people and herd immunity is acquired, controlling the spread of the infection is crucial. Staying home, reducing contact with other people, practicing social distancing, frequent and proper handwashing, disinfecting hands, and wearing a mask have been reported to be effective strategies for preventing the spread of the infection (World Health Organization, 2020). Hence, it is essential to ascertain which types of intervention encourage individuals to take preventive measures. Urban lockdowns have been enforced in most countries, restricting individuals from going out and operating businesses with potential penalties. Governments aim to reduce social contact and visits to places with a high risk of infection. However, some countries, including Japan, have been unable to enforce compulsory interventions under their current laws. Such countries have implemented non-compulsory interventions (e.g., requests/guidance), urging people to voluntarily take preventive measures. Others also have lifted previously implemented lockdowns and switched to non-compulsory interventions to encourage voluntary preventive behaviors, simultaneously resuming economic activity. Therefore, understanding which non-compulsory interventions effectively promote voluntary preventive behaviors is crucial. In the field of behavioral economics, “nudge” is generally known as a method to guide people’s behavior toward a socially desirable direction while maintaining their freedom of choice (Thaler & Sunstein, 2009). It has been reported that nudge-based interventions can promote positive behaviors in the medical and health fields (Patel et al., 2018; Vallgårda, 2012). In the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and medical practitioners have developed messages that contain elements and wording based on nudges and use nudge-based messages to encourage people to take preventive measures. Through social media and television broadcasting, altruistic messages have been spread, emphasizing that taking such steps will save the lives of others (British Broadcasting Corporation News, 2020; New Zealand Police, 2020).Footnote 1 An increasing number of studies have experimentally evaluated the impact of nudge-based messages on people’s perceptions and intentions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For example, Lunn et al. (2020) find that messages emphasizing that people could cause the exponential spread of the infection are more effective in fostering the intention to take preventive measures than those that instruct them to maintain a social distance of two meters. Utych and Fowler (2020) show that people residing in an outbreak region are likely to recognize the risks of COVID-19 when exposed to a message emphasizing how COVID-19 poses a danger to both elderly and young people. Luttrell and Petty (2020) find that people consider messages that focus on others as more persuasive than self-focused messages, especially those who perceive public health as a moral issue. As mentioned above, some studies have found that altruistic messages focusing on others have the desired impact on people’s perceptions and intentions for infection-prevention. However, Jordan et al. (2020) report that self-interested, public-interested, and self- and public-interested messages are similarly effective. Barari et al. (2020) find that nudge-based messages do not have an additional stimulatory effect on those who are already complying with preventive instruction. Favero and Pedersen (2020) also find no promoting effect of such messages. Thus, the results are mixed. When setting behaviors as the dependent variable rather than intentions, very few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of nudge-based messages. Falco and Zaccagni (2020) find that a message that emphasizes taking preventive measures benefits “you and your family” increases the intention to engage in such actions while having no observable effect on behaviors. Barari et al. (2020) and Everett et al. (2020) also find no behavioral change following such messages. However, Moriwaki et al. (2020) use information on smartphones’ GPS and Japanese users’ spatial movements and show that nudge-based messages promote their avoidance of closed spaces, crowded spaces, and close contact during weekends. Krpan et al. (2021) use self-reported behaviors and show the possibility that the nudge for information provision promotes contact avoidance in those who recently embraced avoidance, while such an intervention has the backfire effect of reducing the frequency of avoidance in those who previously avoided contact. This study adds to the literature another evidence on the effects of nudge-based messages on people’s adherence to behavioral measures to control the spread of COVID-19. In particular, we conduct a four-wave online survey experiment on residents in Japan and examine how the impact of nudge-based messages is affected by multiple exposures. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has examined the effects of repeatedly displaying messages for the same individual in this context; therefore, this study provides unique insights. The COVID-19 pandemic has already lasted for over a year, and governments have repeatedly used messages calling for contact-avoidance and infection-prevention. Therefore, whether the same messages will continue to be effective is crucial from a policy perspective. The survey experiment comprises four waves over three months, from the end of April to the beginning of August 2020. In the first wave, we present nudge-based messages as a randomized controlled trial and ask survey participants about their intentions to refrain from going out, avoid contact with others, and prevent infection. In the second wave, we ascertain the extent to which they adhere to those behaviors since the first wave and present the same nudge-based message and again ask for participants’ intentions. For the third and fourth waves, we repeat the same structure as the second wave. This study uses five nudge-based messages: (1) Gain-framed altruistic message: “By avoiding contact with others and taking measures to prevent infection, you can protect the lives of people close to you;” (2) Loss-framed altruistic message: “If you do not take such measures, you will expose people close to you to danger;” (3) Selfish message: “By taking such measures, you can protect your own life;” (4) Altruistic and selfish message: “By taking such measures, you can protect your own life and the lives of people close to you;” and (5) Simple message: “Stay home.” These nudge-based messages have three primary characteristics. First, we compare the message that emphasizes the interests of others (message 1) with the one that emphasizes self-interest (message 3). Previous behavioral economics studies have found that many people act not only in their interest but also in the interest of others, as in the case of charitable giving (Andreoni, 1990) and other cooperative behaviors (Fehr & Gachter, 2000). Recent studies have suggested that people’s prosociality is related to their preventive behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic (Campos-Mercade et al., 2021; Müller & Rau, 2021). The selfish message that one can self-protect from infection through contact-avoidance and infection-prevention behavior promotes compliance in those who do not want to be infected due to selfish motives. However, it does not promote avoidance behavior in those who are not afraid of being infected. An altruistic message that explains how to avoid infecting others through one’s actions and emphasizes prosocial motives can draw the attention of such individuals to the benefit of others, making them more willing to engage in contact-avoidance and infection-prevention measures. For instance, some studies have shown that messages emphasizing social interests enhance people’s willingness to receive influenza vaccines (Betsch et al., 2017). Message (4) emphasizes both sets of interests. Since this message should reach both those who care about their own interests and those who focus on the interests of others, we expect it to strengthen people’s intentions to avoid contagion and promote their infection-prevention behavior. However, simultaneously promoting both sets of interests may “crowd out” the altruistic motivation in those attempting to behave in the interests of others, thus impeding their actions (Gneezy & Rustichini, 2000). Second, we compare message (1), emphasizing the interests of others by framing it in terms of “gain,” and message (2), framed in terms of “loss.” The prospect theory of Tversky and Kahneman (1981) states that people’s choices depend on whether they are framed in terms of “gain” or “loss,” even if their substance is essentially equivalent. A loss-framed message is expected to be more effective for behavioral changes than a gain-framed message. However, in practice, which frame is more effective seems to depend on the context. For example, in the health and medical fields, “gain frames” are particularly effective in promoting behaviors aimed at preventing the onset of diseases, including the use of sunscreen (Detweiler et al., 1999) and quitting smoking (Toll et al., 2007). In contrast, for promoting disease-discovery behaviors, including mammography tests (Schneider et al., 2001), “loss” frames are more effective (Rothman et al., 2006). Therefore, in the COVID-19 pandemic context, the gain-framed message may be more effective in promoting contact-avoidance and infection-prevention behavior. Third, we set as another reference message (5), which simply urges a specific action. It is generally known that simple expressions are easier to understand (Behavioural Insights Team, 2014; Sunstein, 2014). The simplification of actionable instructions has long been the subject of debate in public health (Zarcadoolas, 2011). The message “Stay Home” has also been used through social media and online campaigns worldwide. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the study’s experimental design. Section 3 reports the primary results, and Sect. 4 details the supplementary results. Section 5 discusses the findings and their practical implications and concludes, noting the study’s limitations.",16

 This paper describes how the Japanese labor market was affected by COVID-19 through June 2020. We provide basic facts based on the Labor Force Survey (LFS) using employment status as the outcome measure. The LFS is a monthly household survey conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and has a similar design to the Current Population Survey (CPS) in the United States. The LFS includes approximately 40 thousand households and contains information on individuals’ demographics as well as on the work and education status of those 15 years or older. The large sample size allows us to use data-driven subsample analysis to identify the heterogeneity of the impacts of COVID-19.
 Our main interest is the difference of the employment probability in a month and that of the same month in the previous year, conditional on respondents’ background characteristics and working status in the previous month. To avoid misspecification problems, causal machine learning techniques are used, which are useful for estimating not only the average difference but also heterogeneity in terms of background characteristics. First, the difference in the conditional probabilities is estimated by a causal machine learning technique (Wager and Athey 2018; Athey et al. 2019). The result is used to estimate the percentiles of the conditional probabilities. This is used in turn to define the most affected group. We then characterize the most affected group by comparing the difference in the means of various covariates for those among the most affected group and those not among the most affected group. See (Athey et al. 2019; Chernozhukov et al. 2018b). Our findings are as follows: (1) because of the seasonality in employment status at monthly level, whether we use January as the base month for comparison, as done in most of the studies or whether we use the same month last year as the base comparison group makes a large difference;Footnote 1 (2) whether we include those who are absent from work among the employed or not makes a large difference in the measure of the impact of COVID-19 and its changes; (3) if we use the employment measure which does not include those who are absent from work among the employed, 25–30% among the employed are adversely affected and that 10% of the employed experienced more than 10% decline in employment probability in April, 2020; (4) those who are the most affected by the COVID-19 are those who are unemployed or work part-time in the hotel and restaurant industry and service occupations; (5) in addition, younger and female respondents are more affected than are older and male respondents; and (6) we observe no clear differences in the impacts of COVID-19 with respect to living location, education status, and firm size among the most affected. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews what we know so far about the impacts of COVID-19 on labor markets in Japan and other countries. Section 3 explains the data and shows the overall impacts of COVID-19 through June 2020 by the difference between the observed and predicted employment dynamics. Section 4 introduces our empirical framework to discover the heterogeneous effects of COVID-19, and Sect. 5 reports the estimation results. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",9

During school closures, governments attempted to minimize the adverse effects. For instance, in at least 34 states in the US, local entities such as school districts and state departments of education partnered with public television stations to support online learning for students and teachers.Footnote 2 The severity of the educational disruption, including whether government attempts to alleviate it were successful, has not yet been examined in detail.Footnote 3 To contribute toward this gap in the literature, in this paper, we document how an online learning service enabled students to study during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The Japanese government began a nationwide school closure on March 2, 2020, which continued for 3 months until the end of May 2020. There is evidence that the school closure was unexpected and that many schools were unprepared for online learning. In this paper, we estimate the effect of school closure due to COVID-19 on the utilization of an online learning service by comparing user logs in 2020 with those from 2019. Our findings assist in understanding how an online learning service could make up the lost studying time during COVID-19. For these analyses, we have access to the data on user logs of the online education service, SuRaLa, in Japan. Although the service offers variety of materials for students in wide range of grades, in this study, we focus on user logs of lecture materials and management functions for junior high school and high school students. Important feature of our dataset is that it includes students and their teacher who subscribed the service on a school basis. In other words, schools, rather than students and parents, made a final decision, upon introducing the service. This may imply that, conditional on being a student of a school in our sample, we do not expect household-level selection into adopting the service. We find that the school closure during COVID-19 increased the study time of students using the online learning service, with the effect being strongest at the beginning of the school closure period. It decreased gradually and disappeared in June 2020, when most schools reopened. This result suggests that the online learning service enabled students to study online and compensated for the missed classes during the closure period. In addition, we find a positive effect on teachers’ effort levels, measured by messages sent from teachers to students via the online learning service. Interestingly, the effect on teachers’ effort is positively correlated with the effect on study time. The contribution of this paper is to provide further evidence for the effects of online learning during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A few studies have investigated education under COVID-19, mostly with a focus on online learning (Bacher-Hicks et al., 2020; Chetty et al., 2020). Our study is most closely related to Chetty et al. (2020), in that both describe the utilization of an online education platform. Given that Figlio et al. (2013) find that online learning is a reasonable substitute for face-to-face learning, our results suggest that online learning services have mitigated the negative consequences of COVID-19 on education. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we discuss the related literature. Section 3 outlines the institutional background and the online learning service. In Sect. 4, we describe our data and Sect. 5 presents and discusses our results. Section 6 offers concluding remarks.",6

At the time of writing this article, Japan’s countermeasures against COVID-19 were able to contain several waves of the disease with a low death toll. The analysis and proposal of the Expert Committee have been influential in conducting the measures. However, epidemiology does not have models that consider the economic damages caused by prevention measures. If the policy advice is derived solely from such a model, it will have to ignore the economy. The economic losses caused by COVID-19 and countermeasures against it were huge, surpassing the swine flu epidemic that began in 1918. Moreover, it is deemed to be the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression. In policy responses to financial crises and natural disasters, we consider mitigating unwanted shocks. However, war and epidemics are different from other economic shocks in that they voluntarily sacrifice the economy for other purposes. When the survival of a country is at stake in a war, there may be no room for economic considerations. However, in the case of COVID-19, the trade-off between health and economy becomes a serious concern for policymakers. Even if economists are faithful to their professions, they will not propose a solution that neglects health. Economics sets individual preferences as a criterion for policy evaluation; thus, if an individual values both health and economy, then both will be considered in policy evaluation criteria. Then, we can consider the advantageous choice in the trade-off between health and economy with the model, which can describe the relationship between infectious disease epidemics and economic activities. This paper aims to explain such a framework. This paper summarizes the findings of recent studies that expressed the trade-off between health and economy by combining the simplest possible macroeconomic model and the SIR (susceptible–infected–recovered) model (Kermack & McKendrick, 1927) that describes infectious disease epidemics in epidemiology. This paper discusses the relationship between epidemics and economy through the following two pathways. First, in epidemiological models, the spread of infectious disease is related to the contact opportunities of people,Footnote 1 and by relating these contact opportunities to economic activities, we can also link the epidemic of infectious diseases and economic activities.Footnote 2 Second, from the dynamic optimization problem of a representative individual, we derive that the impact of infectious diseases and countermeasures against it includes the impact of economic and fatality losses. Thus, the countermeasure is described as a policy that restrains the economic activity from deterring the spread and reducing the impacts on the health of population. This paper focuses on how to design desirable countermeasures against infectious diseases from the viewpoint of the trade-off between health and economy. It also builds a model that can express this viewpoint and presents the selected findings of recent research. Therefore, the research described here is limited to a small portion of the economic analysis that has appeared surprisingly in a short period since the emergence of COVID-19.Footnote 3,Footnote 4 Even within this narrow focus, several simplifying assumptions are made to avoid undue complexity. One of the most important assumptions is the use of representative individuals to evaluate welfare. This ignores the differences in instantaneous utility between infectious and non-infectious individuals, and the fact that in reality, economic shocks are skewed toward the vulnerable. The model implicitly assumed that income redistribution policies are implemented to smooth these heterogeneous burdens. In other words, the infectious disease control measures discussed in this paper implicitly include such income redistribution policies. Regarding the trade-off between health and economy in infectious disease control, the qualitative structure of the model has been well established. However, even though research has progressed rapidly, quantitative implications have not yet been stabilized. The present paper reviews the two streams of studies on lockdown conducted in 2021. The first is an early attempt of simulation analysis that inquires the optimal form of lockdown. Many parameters cannot be based on actual experiences; hence, determining the appropriate number of weeks for lockdown is difficult. We focus on the qualitative implications. Some simulation analysis results will also be presented, but quantitative information should not be interpreted as definitive. However, it should be viewed with a wide margin of error. The second is ex post cost–benefit analyses, which do not have to pinpoint the optimal policy but ask whether the actual actions brought a net benefit to the society. Although their parameter setting can utilize actual experiences, some parameters have a wide range among studies, thereby producing mixed results on welfare consequences. Particularly, the monetization of effect (reduction of death toll) is far from stabilized. The first type of infectious disease countermeasure to be examined is a lockdown or stay-at-home order that uniformly restricts economic activity. Next, we examine the cost-effectiveness of measures that are not uniform and are targeted at specific groups. The policies examined here are those that aim to isolate infected people through testing, protect high-risk populations, and impose industry-specific restrictions. Comparisons of measures with widely varying costs have yielded somewhat robust results, even with uncertainties in quantifying benefits and costs. This means that rather than uniformly restricting economic activity to control the infection, focusing on the most effective targets and applying restrictions are preferred. The remainder of this article is organized as follows to demonstrate this point. Section 2 presents an SIR model that describes infectious disease epidemics, but does not specify economic activity. Section 3 starts with a macroeconomic model that does not consider infectious disease and formulates the relation between economic activity and infectious disease. Section 4 explains the analytical framework needed to analyze the welfare of countermeasures. Section 5 discusses the lockdown properties as a solution to the optimization problem and reviews some earlier simulation results related to the lockdown against the first wave of COVID-19. Section 6 reviews ex post evaluations of lockdown in 2020. Sections 7 and 8 examine some infection control targeting specific populations. In particular, Sect. 7 examines two types of testing and isolation strategies: uniform testing and contact tracing. Uniform testing is more efficient than lockdown, whereas contact tracing, which is a kind of targeted testing, is more efficient than uniform testing. Section 8 considers measures to impose activity restrictions based on observable attributes without testing. To represent such measures, we use a multidimensional SIR model describing a society that is composed of heterogeneous individuals. The measures discussed here are those that protect high-risk elderly people and do not restrict the activities of younger people, and those that impose different activity restrictions based on the risk of each industry.",2

One of the most celebrated epidemic models is the susceptible–infective–removed (SIR) model, which was developed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) to simulate the epidemic dynamics in a closed population. Against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many epidemic models have been constructed to predict the epidemic curve and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions (Abdullah et al., 2021; Acuña-Zegarra et al., 2020; Bhadauria et al., 2021; Buhat et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Kuniya & Inaba, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Mandal et al., 2020; Wang, 2020; Zeb et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). Most of these models are related to the original SIR model. Through COVID-19, epidemic models have attracted much attention from researchers in many fields, not limited to mathematical epidemiology. In particular, as COVID-19 has given huge impacts on the global economy, many economists have become interested in the application of epidemic models to the economic considerations (Avery et al., 2020). Before COVID-19, the possibility of the cross-discipline collaboration between economics and mathematical epidemiology was explored by Klein et al. (2007). They raised the following criticisms toward typical epidemic models from the viewpoint of economists: Most models regard that hosts in epidemics are freely mixing and the contact rate is incapable of change. Few models address the problem of rational behavior at the individual level. Behavior of agents in the context of externalities is often ignored. 
Klein et al. (2007) insisted that behavioral choices should be incorporated into epidemic models to improve the accuracy of estimations and develop appropriate policies. Similar issues were addressed by Philipson (2000) from the viewpoint of economic epidemiology. However, to our knowledge, the majority of epidemic models has disregarded these issues even in the time of COVID-19. The purpose of this paper is to review the previous studies on epidemic models in mathematical epidemiology and to indicate possible directions to improve epidemic models for further applications in economics. In mathematical epidemiology, some epidemic models have taken into account the behavior change of individuals by introducing the additional nonlinearity into incidence rates. For instance, Capasso and Serio (1978) generalized the incidence rate in the SIR model to the saturated or non-monotone one to capture the situation where individuals reduce the opportunity of contacts when the number of infective individuals becomes large. As such saturation or psychological effects would be a key idea to answer the aforementioned problems, we will review it and related studies in this paper. Moreover, as the heterogeneity of population would also be a key idea to consider the individual’s rational behavior, we will review the previous studies on structured epidemic models including multi-group models and age-structured models. We will also review the concepts of reproduction numbers (basic, effective, type and control reproduction numbers) because they play important roles in evaluating the effectiveness and impact of intervention policies. The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the basic epidemic models (without intervention) including SIR, SEIR, SIS and SIRS models. We review how to incorporate the multi-group structure into them, and how to define the basic and effective reproduction numbers for them. In Sect. 3, we review how to take into account the effects of intervention policies in epidemic models. We also review the concepts of control and type reproduction numbers that play important roles in determining the target values of intervention policies to curb the epidemic. In Sect. 4, we review the previous results on the people’s behavior changes in epidemic models. We review some types of nonlinear incidence rates and show a simulation result in which the time delay and the sensitivity of the behavior change play essential roles in the occurrence of the recurrent epidemic waves. In Sect. 5, we review advanced epidemic models in the forms of PDEs or non-autonomous systems. They includes the age structure, seasonality, spatial diffusion, mutation and reinfection, and the theory of reproduction numbers can be generalized to them. Finally, Sect. 6 is devoted to the discussion.",2
72,4,The Japanese Economic Review,22 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00098-4,COVID-19 and output in Japan,October 2021,Daisuke Fujii,Taisuke Nakata,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, many countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as stay-at-home orders and city-wide lockdowns to control the spread of coronavirus. Japan is no exception. As shown in Fig. 1, Japan has experienced four epidemic waves, and is in the middle of the fifth wave as of early August in 2021. To abate the spread of infection, the Japanese government has declared the state of emergency (SOE) four times: April 7th–May 25th in 2020 (all prefectures), January 8th–March 21st in 2021 (11 prefectures), April 25th–June 20th in 2021 (10 prefectures), and July 12th–August 31st (6 prefectures). Compared to strict lockdowns employed in many countries, social and economic restrictions of SOE are weaker (Watanabe & Yabu, 2021). Nonetheless, they had a significant impact on economy and seem to have been effective in containing the spread of infection. These experiences sparked social debate on how much we should suppress social and economic activities to control infection. Source: Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (2020). As of August 8th The weekly number of new COVID-19 cases in Japan. Shaded regions indicate the periods of SOE in Tokyo. We build a tractable SIR-macro-model with time-varying parameters and quantify the relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and output in Japan. We then apply the framework to explore various policy questions such as when to lift the state of emergency (SOE) and how to accelerate economic activity. An earlier departure from the SOE results in smaller output loss and more deaths in the short run. However, if the SOE is lifted too early, the number of new cases will surge and another SOE may need to be issued in the future, resulting in more deaths and larger output loss. That is, the tradeoff between output and infection that exists in the short run does not necessarily exist in the long run. We also investigate the consequences of the spread of more contagious coronavirus variants and faster vaccine rollout. A faster increase in the ratio of a more transmissive variant, be it the Alpha or Delta variant, would lead to a faster increase in the number of new cases, necessitating an earlier invocation of the SOE and larger economic loss. A faster vaccine rollout is associated with smaller economic loss and deaths. If we compare 0.6 M/day and 1.2 M/day, the difference in economic loss is 1.8 trillion yen and that of cumulative deaths is around 400. These numbers are only for Tokyo; they are larger at the national level. Finally, we extend our framework to a multi-group SIR model to incorporate age heterogeneity, and show simple parameter adjustment of the single-group SIR model allows it to replicate the aggregate dynamics of the multi-group SIR model. More specifically, when vaccines are distributed to elderlies before non-elderlies, an AR(1) adjustment on the transmission rate and a declining path of a mortality rate—that depends on the rate of vaccine rollout—can generate aggregate dynamics that are quantitatively similar to those of a multi-group SIR model with age heterogeneity. Because of data limitation as well as the practical need for frequent assessments of the outlook, we argue that our single-group SIR-macro-model is a viable tool for real-time policy analyses. The purpose of our project is to provide policy-oriented research in a timely manner. Given unpredictable nature of the evolution of COVID-19, policymakers and the public need to frequently reassess their policies and behaviors in coming weeks and months. To provide a timely analysis on a wide range of policy questions, we deliberately made the baseline model as simple as possible, so as to be able to flexibly accommodate many pragmatic extensions. In particular, our model abstracts from individuals’ optimization problem and welfare analysis, unlike most of the SIR-macro models (e.g., Alvarez et al., 2020; Eichenbaum et al., 2021; Farboodi et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020). As discussed in Sect. 2, we have updated our model-based projections every week since mid-January 2021 and have conducted a diverse set of policy analyses using our model. Our analyses have been presented to the Cabinet Office, Prime Minister’s Office, Advisory Board of Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (henceforth, MHLW-AB) (2020), and key policymakers on many occasions. Our analyses have also been conveyed to the Japanese public through a number of newspaper articles and TV news. In terms of the theoretical framework, our model resembles that of Acemoglu et al. (2021) They also construct a multi-group SIR model without individual’s optimization problem and trace the tradeoff curve between economic loss and deaths from infection. Their focus is to study the optimal targeted lockdown policies which shift the tradeoff curve. Unlike their model, we consider time-varying parameters, and fit past data to obtain reasonable estimates of parameters for future projections. Also, we allow realistic vaccine rollout to different age groups and examine its effect on the reduction in mortality. Our analysis on the second SOE in Tokyo complements that of Kubota (2021) based on a SIR-macro-model which embeds economic agents’ optimizations. His model can decompose the effects of government’s containment policies and individuals’ behaviors, and translate the degree of soft lockdown to a consumption tax. His results on the SOE in Tokyo are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to our results on the same issue. Our work is different from his work in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the model, the estimation method, and the range of policy experiments considered. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 elaborates how our analyses contributed to the policy discussions on COVID-19 in Japan. Section 3 describes our model and data. Section 4 illustrates conditional projections of COVID-19 and the relationship between economy and infection. Section 5 presents various applications of our framework such as the examination of an exit strategy of the SOE and different vaccine rollout scenarios. Section 6 considers age heterogeneity by extending our model to a multi-group SIR and describes the differences from a single-group SIR model. Section 7 concludes. Unlike a standard academic paper, we describe the history of our real-time policy analyses in what follows. Retrospectively, some of the results are outdated since our specifications have been constantly evolving to reflect fast-moving situation of COVID-19 such as the spread of mutant strains. We believe that it is worthwhile to record the entire history of our analyses including how the model specifications have evolved. For each projection or application, we specify when it was done to clarify the timeline.",10

72,4,The Japanese Economic Review,25 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00092-w,Trade-off between job losses and the spread of COVID-19 in Japan,October 2021,Kisho Hoshi,Hiroyuki Kasahara,Satoshi Tanaka,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Containment policies, such as the declaration of a state of emergency, are the primary policy instruments to fight against the spread of COVID-19. While the declaration of a state of emergency and semi-emergency spread prevention measures help reducing coronavirus transmission, it may be accompanied by economic damage such as bankruptcies and increased unemployment, especially in the restaurant, retail and tourism industries. Managing the trade-off between the spread of infection and economic costs is one of the most hotly debated policy issues in this pandemic. However, existing empirical studies that quantitatively estimate this trade-off using the Japanese micro-level data are limited. This paper empirically analyzes a trade-off relationship between job losses and the number of infections by considering a version of the susceptible, infected, recovered, and deaths (SIRD) model in which people’s movement determines both job losses and the spread of COVID-19. To highlight the essence of the trade-off between job losses and the spread of COVID-19, we consider the optimization problem of a social planner who maximizes the sum of discounted utilities given the technological and resource constraint on consumption and mortality by choosing the sequence of people’s mobilities. In the model, if people’s mobility increases, the growth rate of infections will increase, and the number of unemployed workers will decrease. We quantitatively analyze this trade-off relationship in Japan by examining how the growth rate of confirmed cases and the number of involuntary job losses change as people’s mobility goes up and down using the Japanese prefecture-level panel data. The time-series association of people’s mobility with the case growth rate and job losses is apparent in the data. Figure 1 shows the evolution of weekly confirmed case growths and the weekly mobility index from Google Mobility Reports for Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka, Saitama, and Tokyo, where the solid and dotted lines show the confirmed case growth and the 2-weeks lagged mobility index, respectively. Both the case growth and the lagged mobility index simultaneously dropped in May and June, leading to a positive time-series correlation. Figure 2 shows the movement of year-over-year log differences of job losses for 47 prefectures during the time of the COVID-19 spread in Japan, where the solid colored lines represent the 5, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percentile values. The numbers of involuntary job losses have started rising gradually from March 2020, and then peaked around May or June 2020, which coincides with the timing of a significant drop in people’s mobility. Sections 4.1 and 5.1 discuss the construction of the variables in the details. The weekly case growth and the mobility index for Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka, Saitama, and Tokyo. The solid lines show the weekly case growth rates while the dotted line shows the mobility index defined by the weekly average of four Google mobility measures lagged by 14 days. Different colours represent different prefectures, where the red is for Chiba, the dark green is for Kanagawa, the light green is for Osaka, the blue is for Saitama, and the purple is for Tokyo The involuntary job separations, Jan 2020–August 2020. The above figure shows year-over-year log difference in the number of job losses due to employer reasons for 47 prefectures in Japan. We use the number of “involuntary job separations due to employer” from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s Monthly Report on the Employment Insurance Programs (Koyou-Hoken-Jigyou-Geppou) In our analysis, we derive an empirical specification from the social planner’s resource constraint and estimate how job losses are related to people’s mobility using the monthly panel data across prefectures, where we incorporate the difference in the occupation/industry structures across prefectures using the measures of teleworkability. We also derive an empirical specification from the SIRD model on how the case growth is affected by people’s mobility and past confirmed cases and estimate the impact of people’s mobility on the case growth using the daily panel data on case growth and people’s mobility. Combining these two estimates, we quantify the trade-off between job losses and the number of cases as the social planner changes the mobility level. The constructed trade-off from the estimated regressions can be interpreted as an empirical analog of the resource constraint in the social planner’s problem. The main empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, our panel data regression analysis indicates that a decrease in mobility is associated with an increase in involuntary job separations, but the teleworkability can mitigate the negative effect of decreased mobility on job losses in a high-teleworkable prefecture (e.g., Tokyo). This result suggests that teleworkability played an important role in protecting jobs in Tokyo. Using the containment policy index as an instrument for the mobility index, the instrumental variable regression finds similar results. Furthermore, when we use the containment policy index in place of the mobility measure, we find that containment policies increase job losses, but the teleworkability mitigates such a negative impact. Second, estimating how the case growth is related to people’s mobility and past cases, we find that increasing people’s mobility increases the growth rate of confirmed cases with two weeks lag. We also find that the case growth rates are negatively associated with the past cases. These findings are consistent with those from the existing studies (e.g., Chernozhukov et al. 2021b). An increase in mobility increases the contact rate among people, leading to a higher transmission rate of SARS-Cov-2. The negative estimate of past cases suggests that people take more preventive actions (e.g., voluntary social distancing, mask-wearing, and handwashing) to respond to the new information on increasing transmission risks, which decreases the infection probability conditional on meeting with infectious people. Third, using the estimated result on the job loss regression and the case growth regression, we provide a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between job losses and the number of confirmed cases, holding other conditions constant. Taking Tokyo in July 2020 as a benchmark, we find that the cost of saving 1 job loss per month is 2.3 more confirmed cases within a month in the short run of one month. However, when we consider a longer-run trade-off for three months from July to September 2020, the trade-off becomes worse substantially: on average over three months, protecting 1 job per month requires 6.6 more confirmed cases per month in the longer run of three months. Our analysis indicates that keeping low job losses for a more extended period requires a more significant number of cumulative cases because of the exponential case growth. Furthermore, in a counterfactual situation where the number of weekly cases at the beginning of July 2020 were 2520—the highest number of weekly cases recorded in January of 2021 in Tokyo—instead of the actual number of weekly cases, 67, protecting 1 job requires 134 confirmed cases. Therefore, protecting jobs is quite costly when the number of cases is very high. We also find that the trade-off in Tokyo is much better than in other prefectures such as Aichi because the job losses caused by a drop in mobility are much less in Tokyo than in other prefectures given that many jobs in Tokyo are teleworkable from home. This paper is related to the recent literature that presents theoretical frameworks for the economic and health trade-offs. Atkeson (2020) is one of the early papers that extends the SIR model of Kermack and McKendrick (1927), and analyzes economic losses after the new COVID-19 outbreak. Eichenbaum et al. (2020) combine the SIRD model with a standard macroeconomic model to study the trade-offs between economic losses and COVID-19 cases. They derive an optimal non-pharmaceutical policy, which sacrifices economic activities to maximize social welfare, reducing the damage from infection. Other studies that have used the SIRD-macro model to study the economic and health trade-offs include Krueger et al. (2020), Jones et al. (2020), and Kaplan et al. (2020). While several papers have developed theoretical macroeconomic frameworks on the economic-health trade-off, few existing papers have analyzed the trade-off empirically using the micro-level data. Indeed, the empirical literature on the factors contributing to COVID-19 case growth and COVID-19’s economic impact has developed separately and is disconnected from each other. In the former literature, several papers have examined the association between non-pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing behavior and COVID-19 cases (Hsiang et al. 2020; Courtemanche et al. 2020; Abouk and Heydari 2021; Gupta et al. 2020; Maloney and Taskin 2020; Andersen 2020; Pei et al. 2020; Chernozhukov et al. 2021b). Among those studies, Chernozhukov et al. (2021b) is closest to our paper, as they estimate the impact of various policies adopted by US states on the growth rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths, as well as social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports. The latter literature analyzes the effect of COVID-19 on labor markets. Using the Current Population Survey in the US, several papers show that the negative impact of COVID-19 on employment was large for people who could not work from home, those in high-physical-proximity jobs, Hispanic, younger workers, those with high school degrees and some college, females, and workers in “non-essential” industries (Gupta et al. 2020a; Mongey et al. 2020; Montenovo et al. 2020; Albanesi and Kim 2021; Lee et al. 2021). Similar patterns are observed in different countries, such as Guven et al. (2020) for Australia and Casarico and Lattanzio (2020)) for Italy.Footnote 1 This paper contributes to the literature by providing a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between job losses and the number of confirmed cases by connecting the results of the job loss regression and the case growth regression. Finally, our paper is also related to the studies on the COVID-19 effect in Japan. For example, Kikuchi et al. (2021), Kawata (2020), Fukai et al. (2021), and Hoshi et al. (2021) analyze the effect of COVID-19 on labor markets. Our paper differs from these papers by focusing on a trade-off relationship between job losses and the number of infections. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a social planner’s dynamic decision problem. Section 3 derives empirical specifications from the social planner’s resource constraint. Sections 4 and 5 estimate the effect of policy-driven mobility changes on job losses and the growth of newly confirmed cases. Section 6 analyzes the empirical trade-off between job losses and confirmed cases in Japan. Section 7 concludes.",4

73,1,The Japanese Economic Review,23 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00090-y,Why macroeconomics needs experimental evidence,January 2022,John Duffy,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economists were late to adopt experimental methods, perhaps due to a healthy skepticism that they could use controlled laboratory methods on human subjects to address economic questions. But following the pioneering contributions of Nobel Laureates and experimenters Vernon Smith, Reinhard Selten, Elinor Ostrom, Alvin Roth, Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, the use of controlled, experimental methods has undoubtedly strengthened our understanding of microeconomic theory, game theory and development, see, e.g., Falk & Heckman, (2009). There is now a growing awareness that experimental evidence can be useful to macroeconomists as well. In this paper, I make the case for conducting “macroeconomic experiments” by pointing to a number of recent experimental studies that have shed light upon questions of relevance to macroeconomists and policymakers. Research in Macroeconomics is currently dominated by the use of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, the hallmarks of which are explicit microfoundations involving optimizing agents, continuous market clearing and rational expectations. The use of DSGE models is often advocated on the grounds that experiments with humans subjects are not possible. For instance, Christiano et al., (2017) p. 2 in their defense of DSGE modeling write: “Macroeconomic policy questions involve trade-offs between competing forces in the economy. The problem is how to assess the strength of those forces for the particular policy question at hand. One strategy is to perform experiments on actual economies. This strategy is not available to social scientists. As Lucas (1980) pointed out roughly forty years ago, the only place that we can do experiments is in our models. No amount of a priori theorizing or regressions on micro data can be a substitute for those experiments.” Indeed, the dismissal of using any kind of experimental evidence for macroeconomic policy evaluation comes originally from Robert E. Lucas Jr. who was an early advocate for the DSGE approach. For instance, in Lucas, (1980), p. 710 he writes: “People interested in the way groups of monkeys solve problems of allocating scarce resources satisfy their curiosity by assembling groups of monkeys and tossing them scarce resources. I have taken it as given that we economists cannot proceed in this way, yet the allocation of scarce resources is something we are admired for being experts at.” Lucas advocates instead for “fully articulated, artificial economic systems that can serve as laboratories in which policies that would be prohibitively expensive to experiment with in actual economies can be tested out at much lower cost.” (Lucas, 1980, p. 696). In the 40 years that have followed, “experiments” using DSGE models have exploded in popularity. These experiments consist mainly of “counterfactual” estimation or simulation exercises, where the researcher departs from the baseline set-up in some dimension in order to explore the impact of different policy interventions or some change in the underlying mechanism or modeling assumptions.Footnote 1 While the use of structural DSGE models avoids the “Lucas critique” of counterfactual policy evaluation that arises from using reduced form analyses, the counterfactual analysis of DSGE modelers is only valid to the extent that the micro-founded structural model and its assumptions are correctly specified in the first place! Indeed, there are good reasons to think that model misspecification remains an important issue, since DSGE models fail to satisfactorily explain a number of important macroeconomic phenomena, including the celebrated equity premium puzzle, the sources of aggregate fluctuations, and the effects of money, credit and banking for real economic activity. Even when DSGE models can account for movements in certain macroeconomic time series, there are often multiple modeling approaches that yield similarly good fits to the data. For instance, both real business cycle models with fully flexible prices and New Keynesian models with sticky prices, the two main variants of DSGE models, can explain observed co-movements in output, consumption and investment in the data rather well, but the two modeling approaches have very different implications for the effectiveness of monetary policy in smoothing aggregate fluctuations. Toward the goal of building better models, I have advocated for and continue to promote the use of experimental laboratories as low-cost laboratories for macroeconomic research.Footnote 2 In encouraging this research agenda, I am not advocating against the DSGE modeling approach; that approach is, and remains, an important means by which macroeconomists communicate their ideas with one another. Instead, I see experimental evidence as an important complementary resource, along with other micro-level evidence to be used for evaluating and building better models, resolving indeterminacies and thinking about reactions to policy interventions. For instance, experimental evidence can be brought to bear on the reasonableness of DSGE modeling assumptions such as rational expectations and intertemporal optimization. More recent generations of DSGE models have exploited increased computing power to relax the assumptions of representative agents and rational expectations thereby allowing for a richer heterogeneity of outcomes. Experimental evidence can be useful in characterizing the nature and extent of this heterogeneity, whether it may lie in agents’ preferences or in their degrees of bounded rationality, see, e.g. Arifovic & Duffy, (2018), and I will provide several examples here. Further, in models with multiple equilibria, e.g., those pertaining to the financial sector, experimental evidence can point to which of the various equilibria are more attractive to subjects and thus more empirically relevant for policy consideration. Finally, policy considerations, e.g., the effectiveness of different types of monetary policies, can be evaluated on a small scale using controlled experimental methods before being implemented in the field. In addition to the changes that have occurred in computing power over past 40 years, so too has our knowledge of experimental methods, which has expanded to the point that experiments with human subjects that are relevant to macroeconomists can and have been conducted, and at relatively low cost as well. In this paper, I point to several macro assumptions and policy questions that experiments can and have helped to address. I conclude with some suggestions for the conduct of further macroeconomic experiments.",1

73,1,The Japanese Economic Review,24 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00087-7,"Watching, being watched, and human interactions: evidence from trust games",January 2022,Kiyotaka Yageta,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Trust is key for making important decisions with others and affects human purchase actions (Gefen, 2000). For instance, people do not lend money to unfamiliar people, and companies do not purchase from untrusted salespersons. Trust is more likely to increase under face-to-face communication than under electronic contexts (Rocco 1998) and depends on with whom you are interacting (Glaeser et al., 2000; Wilson & Eckel, 2006). Given technological breakthroughs and the COVID-19 pandemic, however, our decisions are now predominantly made online instead of face-to-face. In the COVID-19 situation, for example, since many companies have been forced to introduce work from home policies, important decision-making meetings are conducted online instead of in person. In these online human interactions, two situations arise: you are being watched if other peoples’ faces cannot be seen, but yours can; and you are watching if other peoples’ faces can be seen, but yours cannot. Although several papers have discussed the importance of face-to-face communication, which component of face-to-face communication is the most important has not received attention. In other words, clarity about the relationships among watching, being watched, and face-to-face is lacking. In this paper, I separately measure the effects of both watching and being watched on human interactions using a trust game. First, I introduce a theoretical framework to capture the effects of watching and being watched on human trust and reciprocity. Second, I derive optimal behaviors for the trust game. Over 150 trust games have been conducted around the world (Johnson & Mislin, 2011), but there is no established theoretical framework deriving new equilibria that consider the prevailing patterns of deviation from the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium where players send/return nothing to/from each other. Therefore, this paper also introduces a theoretical framework and derives optimal behaviors for trust games. Finally, I empirically validate the two effects through a controlled experiment. To interpret the effects of both watching and being watched, I develop a theory based on the utility function developed by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and the social pressure term proposed by Bursztyn and Jensen (2017). From the theory, I derive that receivers choose from two options: equalizing the profits with their partner or returning nothing. Specifically, receivers equalize the profits with their partner if they are a reciprocator, and if their partner sends more than one-quarter of their first endowment. Otherwise, they return nothing to their partner. Considering receivers’ behaviors, this paper indicates that senders give 100%, 25%, or 0% of their first endowment to their partner, depending on with whom are interacting and whether they are being watched by their partner. This result is unchanged even though senders can distinguish whether their partner is a reciprocator or not. Since the utility function of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) is a linear function for the sender’s amount sent and the receiver’s amount returned, the main theory considers only corner solutions for the optimal behaviors. To achieve inner solutions, I introduce another theory using the equity, reciprocity, and competition (ERC) model (Bolton & Ockenfels, 2000) described in the Appendix. This theory shows similar results to those of the main theory. In a laboratory experiment, participants are randomly assigned to four groups: Control group, Watching group, Being watched group, and Face-to-Face group. The differences among the four groups are generated by each computer device’s camera. Participants in the Control group play a trust game with both their and their partner’s cameras are switched off. On the contrary, in the Face-to-Face group, both cameras are switched on. Participants in the Watching group are paired with those in the Being watched group, and the former can watch the latter’s face. Those in the Being watched group know that they are being watched by their partner, but they cannot see their partner’s face. Through the controlled experiment, I find that nearly 60% of receivers follow the optimal behaviors: they equalize profits or return nothing. As for senders, although they can choose from 1001 options (0–1000 yen), 50% of them choose 0 yen, 250 yen, or 1000 yen, which are the optimal behaviors that I derived for senders. Specifically, the sender sending the entire first endowment and the receiver equalizing profits is most frequently observed (21.3%). In terms of treatment effects, there are both watching and being watched effects on the sender’s trust and the receiver’s reciprocity. In particular, compared with the Control group, the Face-to-Face group has double the proportion of receivers who equalize the profits with their partner, and of senders who give all of their first endowment. However, the synergy effect of the Face-to-Face group is not observed, which means that the impact of the face-to-face treatment is almost equal to the sum of that of the Watching and the Being watched groups. Furthermore, compared with men, I find the women in the experiment are more likely to equalize profits when they are being watched by their partner. From the theory, I can identify that it comes from a social pressure that women should be reciprocators. This paper finds that when senders watch their partner, their trust is greater in a pair of the opposite gender than in a pair of the same gender. As this result is observed for neither receivers nor in the being watched environment, this paper concludes that the impact is from senders’ beliefs that the opposite gender reciprocates more than the same gender does, not from their preference toward the opposite gender. My results indicate that face-to-face communication is important for human trust and reciprocity. This paper suggests that we should switch on our camera in the workplace during a decision-making process, even if the interaction is online. In addition, this paper provides evidence for both the watching and the being watched effects being different between genders and dependent on the people with whom we are interacting from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.",

A field and laboratory comparison of the impact of social group membership on cooperation,January 2022,Yohei Mitani,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Social interactions and social norms play a central role in decision-making in favor of cooperation and coordination. Lifelong, frequent interactions with community members remind that full cooperation can be supported in the equilibrium of infinitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma games. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence to support full cooperation in a well-controlled experimental game. Can local norms of cooperation be replicated in an experiment if subjects bring their shared experience and beliefs into the experiment? Understanding the connection between experimental behavior and the elements of everyday economic life still remains an open question (Henrich et al., 2001). In this paper, I report the first experimental evidence of full cooperation among Japanese rural villagers in a prisoner’s dilemma game. The rural areas of Japan have a number of small and cohesive closed communities, in which neighboring villagers share behavioral norms and expectations over generations. Villagers repeatedly interact over time, coordinate almost every day, and take collective action each season. Most local communities seem to have institutional features that meet the requirements of a possible full cooperation outcome that can be supported in an infinitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma game. A growing experimental literature has shown that cooperation only emerges with experience even when games are consistent with equilibrium, risk dominant, and sufficiently incentive compatible (Dal Bó & Fréchette, 2011, 2018). Villagers play super games with their community members since their birth, share the lifelong history of those games, and expect certain interactions for the rest of their life. Combined with experimental evidence summarized by Dal Bó and Fréchette (2018), these features lead us to expect that high cooperation can be observed in those communities. Can pre-existing, shared experiences facilitate coordination on the efficient equilibrium in a prisoner’s dilemma experiment? How high can we expect cooperation rates to be? I conduct a door-to-door field experiment in a Japanese rural village to capture a moment of everyday interactions among villagers as a stage game of super games. Group identity can affect individual behavior toward cooperation and coordination (Efferson et al., 2008; Solow & Kirkwood, 2002). Using minimal groups induced in a laboratory, a series of experimental studies show that subjects behave more pro-social with in-group members and can use a salient group identity to coordinate with in-group members on the better equilibrium in a coordination game (Chen & Chen, 2011; Chen & Li, 2009). In real social groups, their members share a set of beliefs and behavioral norms formed through mutually experienced interactions. Social group identity gives more than just a label but shared expectations based on the history of group members. Bernhard et al. (2006) use several native tribes in Papua New Guinea as social groups and show that in-group favoritism regulates altruistic norm enforcement. Goette et al., (2006, 2012) utilize a randomly assigned social group and find that subjects are more likely to cooperate when they are paired with in-group members. In this paper, I explore how strongly local norms and shared beliefs from everyday interactions among neighboring villagers affect experimental behavior. I do this by comparing the cooperative behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma game when they play with their community members and when they play with out-community members. A growing body of literature addresses the external validity of laboratory experiments with university student subjects (Snowberg & Yariv, 2021). The question of whether the results from a university-student sample can be generalized to other populations remains a fundamental methodological issue in the field of experimental economics. To test the external validity of the laboratory findings, a series of experimental studies compare the behavior of standard subjects with other subject pools. Some of these studies simply compare experimental measures like cooperation rates between different subject pools (Anderson et al., 2013; Bigoni et al., 2013; Burks et al., 2009). Additionally, few compare the difference of experimental treatment effects, for example, of having an opportunity of punishment between different subject pools (Alm et al., 2015; Bortolotti et al., 2015). For example, the literature suggests that university students are less prosocial compared to non-student subjects (Anderson et al., 2013; Bortolotti et al., 2015; Burks et al., 2009). I report a counterpart laboratory experiment with university student participants, which share the same procedures as the field experiment with villagers. I test the external validity of the experimental treatment effect as well as cooperation rates in both experiments. I conduct a door-to-door field experiment where 120 villagers were selected from 23 communities in a Japanese rural village to play a simultaneous prisoner’s dilemma game. To examine whether experiences shared through lifelong, everyday interactions among community members affect experimental behavior, I compare villagers’ behavior under in-community and out-community random matching protocols. I also report a counterpart laboratory experiment with 72 university student subjects to address the external validity of laboratory experiments, or the question of whether the results from a university student sample can be generalized to other populations. The findings are three-fold. First, almost full cooperation is achieved when villagers play a prisoner’s dilemma game with their anonymous community members. Second, cooperation is significantly higher in the in-community compared to the out-community treatment in the field experiment with villagers, even though a very high cooperation rate is still observed in the out-community treatment. Third, regarding the external validity, a significant treatment effect of social group membership is preserved in both laboratory and field experiment. Although, a big difference in average cooperation rates is observed.",

The global cost of mental health problems is estimated to be approximately $2.5 trillion per year in poor health and reduced productivity (The Lancet Global Health, 2020). The burden of mental health problems affects both individual patients and also society. For most of us, work is a significant aspect in our lives. Working conditions can serve as important determinants of workers’ mental health. The relationship between working conditions and workers’ mental health has been explored in a number of studies. Most of these studies find that poor working conditions, such as high job burden (e.g., Cottini & Lucifora, 2013; Oshio et al., 2018), long working hours (e.g., Sato et al., 2020), low decision authority (Cottini & Lucifora, 2013; Hanson et al., 2009), and poor interpersonal relationships in the workplace (e.g., Hanson et al., 2009; Kuroda & Yamamoto, 2018; Oshio et al., 2018), deteriorate workers’ mental health. On the other hand, some studies show that working conditions, such as decision authority (Oshio et al., 2018) and interpersonal relationships (Cottini & Lucifora, 2013), have no significant effects on workers’ mental health. Some jobs pose a higher risk due to the nature of the work. Careers in human services, such as counsellors in job-matching institutions, have been recognised as an occupation that faces high occupational stress. However, existing studies present competing evidence on how working condition affects human service professionals’ mental health. Several early studies suggest that working in human services deteriorates workers’ mental health (Adams et al., 2008; Conrad & Kellar-Guenther, 2006; Craig & Sprang, 2010; Giordano et al., 2021). This is because the hours devoted to listening to clients’ distress can be stressful for workers (Fligey, 1995). In contrast, other studies suggest that working in human services improves workers’ perceptions of compassion satisfaction and therefore improves mental health outcomes (Conrad & Kellar-Guenther, 2006; Sodeke-Gregson et al., 2013). Motivated by these mixed empirical results, this study re-examines the potential causal effect of workloads and job stress on workers’ mental health, focusing on job counsellors’ workplace. A re-examination of causal impact is important for research to bring new findings focusing on gaining insights into real causality. It also offers important implications advocating the advancement of the welfare of human service workers and the inherent need for stress-relief policies and devices. There are two challenges in causal examinations. The first challenge is the existence of an endogeneity problem. In a real workplace, heavy workloads and thus job stress are likely assigned to counsellors in good mental health condition. It is also possible that counsellors’ time-invariant factors, such as counsellors’ personal capacities and stress resistance, are associated with both job stress and mental health outcomes. However, only a few studies consider this problem of endogeneity when examining the effect of working conditions on human service professionals’ mental health. This study conducts a field experiment at a public employment support institution in Japan. In the experiment, we randomly assign counsellors to jobseekers, with varying levels of difficulty in finding a job, who are making their first counselling appointment. In this way, we can assess the effect of randomised counsellors’ workloads and job stress led by job seekers on counsellors’ mental health. To address the remaining possibility of endogeneity problem, we also collect counsellors’ daily records on mental health for 4 consecutive weeks, constructing a daily panel data set and applying a counsellor’s fixed-effects model. This is an approach taken by several researchers in the previous literature to control for individual time-invariant factors producing an endogeneity problem (Kuroda & Yamamoto, 2018; Oshio et al., 2018; Sato et al., 2020). Another challenge is the existence of a measurement error problem when engaging mental health indicators. Measuring the precise condition of individual mental health is customarily a difficult challenge. A growing amount of research discusses problems of ambiguity in subjective indicators of health outcomes (Bago d’Uva et al., 2008; Burgard & Chen, 2014; Johnston et al., 2009; Moullan & Jusot, 2014). However, objective indicators are hardly obtained particularly in real workplaces. A few studies employ objective indicators. This study successfully collects counsellors’ records on objective mental health measures of two biomarkers of stress: blood pressure and pulse. These indicators are used as general biomarkers of stress in the existing studies (Mani et al., 2013; Perrewé et al., 2004; Steptoe & Wardle, 2005). These biomarkers are used as objective indicators of mental health in addition to subjective indicator measured by self-reported perceptions of mental health. It must be noted here that several other objective mental health indicators are used in medical studies, such as saliva components (e.g., Holleman et al., 2012); however, it is not possible to collect these indicators every day in a real work environment. Blood pressure and pulse are used as feasible and ideal objective indicators for this empirical investigation. Our findings first indicate that job stress exerts no significant effect on subjective mental health. In contrast, job stress is demonstrated to indeed affect objective mental health for counsellors. The increase in job stress induced by jobseekers with difficulties in finding a job deteriorates objective mental health for counsellors who manage difficult cases. Note that these findings are obtained after randomising counsellors’ job stress and controlling for counsellors’ observed and unobserved heterogeneities. We conclude that there is a real causal effect of job stress at least in terms of the objective mental health of counsellors. This study contributes to the literature in multiple ways. First, conducting a field experiment in a real workplace makes it possible to assign counsellors a random shock of workloads and job stress. Second, information on counsellors’ mental health after work is merged with information on jobseekers’ difficulties prior to counselling. The latter information is also unknown to counsellors prior to the counselling. This makes it possible to assess the effect of unexpected objective job burdens on counsellors’ mental health following the counselling. Third, we collect a daily record of counsellors’ mental health, making it possible to conduct fixed-effects estimation, controlling for counsellors’ time-invariant characteristics. Fourth, this study measures mental health using blood pressure and pulse as objective indicators along with survey questionnaire responses as subjective indicator. Our results compensate for the existing studies using only subjective indicators of mental health. Finally, this study focuses on human service professionals’ mental health, which has largely been ignored for a long time, partly because they are professionals working in a field that encounters mental health problems. The rising occurrence of mental illness among the workers in professional fields and their absence from work has become serious issues. Our results add new approaches and empirical insights to the existing literature.",1
73,1,The Japanese Economic Review,16 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00085-9,An experimental comparison of rebate and matching in charitable giving: The case of Japan,January 2022,Shusaku Sasaki,Hirofumi Kurokawa,Fumio Ohtake,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Non-profit organizations are essential for social stability, since they provide complementary services in fields where public services are not sufficiently provided by governments (Salamon, 1994). The NPOs depend on donations from individuals and corporations to continue their operations. Thus, the question of how to effectively collect those donations is an important social issue, and it has been explored both practically and academically (Sargeant & Shang, 2017). A number of countries have adopted rebate as a major scheme with the aim of encouraging monetary donations from individuals (Giving Japan White Paper Research Society, 2017). Under this scheme, individuals’ income tax is deducted by a certain amount, when they report the monetary donations they made in the year when declaring their income for that year. Policymakers expect the scheme to have a positive effect on individuals’ donation behavior, because it lowers the price of donation. For example, assume one donates 10,000 Japanese yen (JPY, hereafter) to a charity and receives a tax reduction of 5000 JPY; this implies that one can donate 10,000 JPY to the charity by spending only 5000 JPY, and the price of 1 JPY donation is 0.5 JPY. However, rebate may not induce as much donation behavior as policymakers expect. Institutional and procedural hurdles can impede donors’ use of the scheme. For example, the US tax system allows taxpayers to select either a standard deduction or an itemized deduction, the latter of which is an actual deduction. Only if they select the latter, they can have access to the rebate scheme. In practice, high-income taxpayers usually choose the itemized deduction, while about 70% of taxpayers choose the standard one. Thus, many US donors do not enjoy the benefits of the rebate scheme (Kato, 2010). Matching is another major scheme used to lower the price of donation, similar to rebate. Previous experimental economic studies have suggested that matching encourages individuals’ donation behavior more effectively than rebate. When one donates 5000 JPY to a charity under a 1:1 matching treatment, a third party, for example a corporation or foundation, matches the amount of this donation, and consequently 10,000 JPY is donated to the charity. In other words, one needs to spend only 5000 JPY to donate 10,000 JPY to the charity, and the price of 1 JPY donation is 0.5 JPY in a 1:1 matching. This is the same as when one donates 10,000 JPY under the rebate scheme and receives a refund of 5000 JPY in the form of a tax reduction. However, even when controlling for the donation price and other factors, laboratory experiments have found that the matching framing increases donation rates and average donation expenditures more than the rebate framing (Eckel & Grossman, 2003, 2006). This tendency has been confirmed in field experiments (Bekkers, 2015; Eckel & Grossman, 2008, 2009, 2017). Based on this evidence, the matching scheme is now being employed in fundraising activities by NPOs around the world. This study is the first to experimentally compare the rebate and matching schemes in Japan, and to test whether matching is more effective in driving individuals’ donations in this country. We are now conducting the investigation in Japan even though there is evidence from other countries, because there are background and environmental factors at play that suggest that the rebate scheme might not be effective in promoting donation behavior in Japan either. In other words, there is a great need to explore another measure that can more effectively encourage Japanese people’s donation behavior. First, although the Japanese government has made efforts to improve the rebate scheme, its utilization rate remains low, and the level of individual donations in Japan is also low on an international scale. The Japanese government introduced rebate as a tax incentive in 1962, with this scheme in force since over than half a century. The 2011 tax reforms enabled individual donors to select “exemption and deduction from income” or “tax credit,” which are called “shotoku-kojyo” and “zeigaku-kojyo” in Japanese, respectively (Cabinet Office, 2019a). When the former is selected, 2000 JPY is deducted from one’s donation amount, and that amount is then deducted from one’s income. The income after the deduction is multiplied by an income tax rate to calculate one’s income tax. Japan’s income tax rates follow a progressive system, and therefore the tax reduction for the same donation amount is larger for higher income groups. In contrast, when the latter is selected, 2000 JPY is deducted from one’s donation amount, that amount is multiplied by 40%, and then the amount after multiplication is directly deducted from one’s income tax, regardless of income groups. Therefore, low- and middle-income groups can receive a larger tax reduction by selecting the tax credit option over exemption and deduction from income.Footnote 1 Countries offering both systems are rare, and, in this sense, Japan’s rebate scheme is progressive on an international scale. However, the proportion of Japanese donors using the rebate remains low and was recorded at 16.7% in 2018 (Cabinet Office, 2019b). Furthermore, as is widely known, the level of individual donations in Japan is much lower than in other countries. Specifically, the total value of individual donations in Japan stood at 0.14% as a share of nominal GDP in 2016. This is only about one-tenth of the US donations (1.44%), about one-quarter of that of the UK (0.54%), and about one-quarter of that of South Korea (0.50%), which is also an East Asian nation (Giving Japan White Paper Research Society, 2017). This raises the concern that the past improvements to the rebate scheme have not had enough impact on promoting Japanese people’s donation behavior. Second, the cost of using the rebate in Japan could be as high as or higher than in other countries. In Japan, individual income tax is withheld at source, and the income taxes of employed income earners are recalculated in December by their employers to correct any excess or deficiency. Thus, many Japanese workers usually do not need to file tax returns; however, they would need to do so to make use of the rebate scheme. Using the scheme would impose a psychological cost on people because of performing an unfamiliar task, in addition to procedural costs. These costs could discourage people from making donations by using the rebate scheme.Footnote 2 Matching increases the amount donated to a charity by combining the donation amounts of donors with that of a third party. Since the charities or the third party are usually responsible for the add-on donation process, donors’ procedural and psychological costs will be smaller when using matching than when using rebate. Thus, if matching is confirmed through experiments to be more effective than rebate in Japan, there is a potential to substantially increase donations made by Japanese people, by implementing the matching scheme into the society. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no experimental studies directly comparing matching and rebate in Japan.Footnote 3 This study is quite important from both an academic and a policy perspective in that it is the first to conduct such an experimental comparison in this country. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. ""Literature review on rebate versus matching"" reviews experimental studies in economics that have compared rebate and matching schemes. ""Experimental design"" describes the experimental design in this study. Following basic results in ""Basic analysis"", we conduct and present further analysis in ""Further analysis"". ""Discussion, limitations and conclusions"" discusses the results and their practical implications and concludes while noting some limitations.",1

To promote evacuation, disaster prevention education has traditionally been used to educate residents on evacuation sites and routes among other aspects. However, even if disaster prevention knowledge increases, many people do not evacuate in the event of an actual disaster. In this context, it is difficult to make evacuation compulsory, because governments cannot fully grasp the location of the residents and it is not realistic to prescribe penalties. Thus, there is a need for policy interventions that can bridge the gap between knowledge and action. A similar thing is happening in the field of infectious disease control. In 2020, COVID-19 caused many infections worldwide and the behavioral restrictions put in place for infection control had a massive negative impact on the global economy. The requirements involved getting people to avoid going to places with a high risk of infection in addition to basic infection control measures, such as hand washing and wearing masks. In some countries, masks were made compulsory and fines were levied for people who did not wear them, especially when restrictions were in place during severe COVID-19 spreading. Similarly, many countries also imposed restrictions on the operation of restaurants. However, in Japan, even if a state of emergency is declared, based on the Influenza Special Measures Law, businesses can only be requested to close and the general public can only be urged to take infection control measures. Therefore, in this context, it is necessary to have policies that encourage people to take preventive actions against infection in addition to providing knowledge on infection control measures. In other words, if we can create policies that increase the number of people who take desirable actions in situations where direct regulations are not available, such as during disasters or the spread of infectious diseases, we will be able to save people’s lives. As a potential solution, nudges can bring about behavioral changes in situations where regulations and financial incentives are not available. The application of behavioral economics to public policy is done through these nudges, which Thaler and Sunstein (2008) defined as follows: “A nudge […] is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives” (p. 6). These policy applications of behavioral economics are advancing and are not limited to applications for disaster evacuation behaviors and infectious disease control. Furthermore, Thaler (2018) distinguished between nudge and sludge, the latter being applicable if it makes the person take an undesirable action or an action that is not in their best interest. Ultimately, the purpose is to design a conscientious choice that allows the person to make decisions that they judge to be better. In particular, Thaler and Sunstein (2008), and Thaler (2018) being awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2017 was a major catalyst. In the UK, behavioral insights teams were established in 2014 for policy applications, while Japan established the Japanese version of the Nudge Unit (BEST) in April 2017. The results of a series of field studies in behavioral economics, such as Madrian and Shea (2001), who found that defaulting on participation in corporate pension plans increased participation, have been incorporated into government policy in the UK private pension system, NEST (Department for Work and Pensions, 2018; Thaler and Benartzi 2004). Scholars have also conducted nudge with messages intervention studies, the most famous and earliest being the Message UK nudge unit field RCT that sent nudge messages in reminder letters to people who had filed returns, but not paid taxes (Hallsworth et al. 2017). In this study, the social norm message that many people pay their taxes on time and those who do not are in the minority was effective. As a result, a variety of nudges are now being adopted as policy tools in countries worldwide, including Japan (OECD 2017). In another field RCT, conducted in one municipality, Fukuyoshi (2018) examined messages recommending colorectal cancer screening. The one emphasizing that if the patient did not undergo the screening this year, the test kit would not be sent next year increased the screening uptake by 7 percentage points more than a gain-framed message declaring that the test kit would be sent next year if the patient took the screening this year. As another field RCT example that examined one particular municipality, using social comparisons when displaying electricity consumption in the Japanese version of the Nudge Unit (Behavioral Science Team) proved to promote energy-saving behavior (Behavioral Science Team (2018)). Overall, some nudges work and others do not. Some nudges are effective in the short-term, but lose their long-term effectiveness due to habituation. For instance, regarding energy-saving behaviors, Ferraro et al. (2011), and Allcott and Rogers (2014) found that social comparisons have long-term effects, but Ito et al. (2018) discovered that in Japan, nudge messages, reflecting moral calls to save electricity, rapidly lose their effectiveness. However, there is no such effect loss when using financial incentives through dynamic pricing. Moreover, Sunstein (2015) presented the following eight criticisms of nudges: (1) nudges steer people's choices in certain directions, (2) changing decisions by default is problematic, (3) using anchoring is problematic, (4) people’s preferences are diverse, (5) nudges deprive people of learning opportunities, (6) biases and prejudices exist in governments and bureaucracies that use nudges, (7) nudges distort market competition, as those that favor only certain products have a negative impact on free market competition and reduce people’s incentive to develop new products and services, and (8) warmongering causes people to lose their independence. However, Sunstein (2015) also addressed these criticisms as follows: (1) nudges are assumed to ensure freedom of choice and people’s actions are called slights when they are aimed toward a particular company’s profit gains (Thaler 2018), (2) many choices already use defaults in the form of opt-ins (e.g., the application-based system in receiving social security benefits and the willingness to donate organs), (3) one particular choice will inevitably come first, no matter the display method, justifying the process of devising a way to make choosing the better option easier; (4) nudges are based on the premise that freedom of choice is guaranteed, but this freedom may not necessarily lead to greater satisfaction for the individual, as in the case of bias and excessive choices; (5) there is anyway little opportunity for learning when making new decisions (e.g., those that are not made many times in life) and some nudges can provide opportunities for learning, (6) imposing transparency and accountability on governments and bureaucracies that use nudges can address their bias and prejudice, (7) nudges should be used to promote market competition when markets fail, due to externalities or monopolies; and (8) people do not make informed and independent decisions on everything, but following rules and habits saves time and energy, and thinking about more important issues allows for independent decision-making. Thus, based on Sunstein (2015), we can discuss the pros and cons of using nudges to promote evacuation in heavy rainfall disasters and prevent infections. In both cases, at least under Japanese law, it is impossible to enforce measures with penaltiesFootnote 1. As it is difficult to accurately identify the target population, it is also difficult to use economic incentives, such as penalties for those who do not evacuate or take infection control measures, or subsidies for those who do comply. In addition, it is difficult to make calm judgments in times of disaster or infectious disease epidemics, making it necessary to provide information that takes such factors into account. In the case of infectious diseases, people may consider the risk of their own infection, but they do not completely consider the risk of infecting others through their actions. Similarly, during a disaster, one’s own evacuation behavior influences the actions of the people around them (Ohtake et al. 2020). The existence of such externalities provides a rational reason for using nudges. Furthermore, evacuation and infection control encompass life-threatening situations that are difficult to solve by simply experiencing them repeatedly and improving them through learning, justifying the use of nudges in related policies. Overall, the question that remains is whether there are nudge messages that can induce behavioral changes. In this paper, we present our empirical research on the effectiveness of nudge messages in these fields. Specifically, I assess whether nudge messages can promote evacuation behavior during disasters and preventive behavior against infectious diseases. In Sect. 2, I present Ohtake et al.’s (2020) study results on evacuation facilitation nudges during heavy rainfall disasters. Sect. 3 offers a series of studies on effective nudge messages for behavioral changes and encouraging vaccination against novel coronavirus infections (Sasaki et al. 2021; Sasaki, Saito, and Ohtake 2021a, 2021b). Finally, Sect. 4 discusses the conclusions and policy implications.",2

In school, people learn not just cognitive skills, but non-cognitive ones as well, through the formation of preferences, beliefs, and norms. Such preferences and beliefs transmitted subconsciously or unintentionally to students are collectively referred to as the “hidden curriculum,” in contrast to the official (academic) curriculum that aims to develop students’ cognitive skills—literacy and numeracy (Giroux and Purpel 1983; Kelly 2009). In the literature, as reviewed in the next section, several studies have focused on the qualitative aspect of education, and demonstrated that specific educational content/practices have an influence on the formation of preferences and beliefs. This paper also aims to explore the link between the school curriculum and the formation of preferences using Japanese data. However, we add to the literature by focusing on the long-term consequences of educational content/practices during elementary education. Most existing studies have primarily investigated the contemporaneous effect of an educational content/practice using the sample of students. But no study has addressed whether the effect of a specific content/practice may be long-lasting, enduring even after the adolescence period ends. Whether, and to what extent, the impact on preference formation persists is especially significant with regard to discussions about policy effectiveness, and for understanding the mechanism of cultural transmission. We shed light on the beliefs and preferences people hold years or decades after their education is complete, using a sample of people between 20 and 60 years old. This study further contributes to the literature in two ways. First, the outcomes presented here cover a broad range of preferences, from economics and politics to social capital components such as beliefs in trust, cooperation, and reciprocity. In addition, the hidden (non-academic) curriculum we explore includes a variety of educational content/practices: we examine educational content related to politics, economy, ethics, character and peace as well as learning practices such as participatory and non-competitive learning. It is likely that the subject matter in a curriculum is designed to be complementary to and implemented simultaneously with other educational content. If this is the case, focusing exclusively on specific educational content with non-experimental data may confound the influence of other similar content. To our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the long-term influences of multiple educational content/practices on the formation of several social and economic preferences. Second, we focus on educational content/practices during elementary education. Recently, non-cognitive skills have gained recognition in empirical human capital theory, and some researchers emphasize the importance of childhood in the formation of such skills.Footnote 1 Thus, accumulating empirical findings on elementary education, which could play a decisive role as an early stage of socialization, is important in its own right. At the same time, however, it would be remiss not to discuss the weaknesses of this study. As will be discussed in Sect. 3.3, our identification strategy relies on the assumption that variations in the hidden curriculum in Japanese elementary schools are exogenous to pupils (at least before the 2000s). Thus, a strong claim about causality cannot be made in the absence of an experimental setting, such as the random assignment of school placement or policy implementation. However, various checks show that our identification strategy is relatively plausible in the context of elementary education before the 2000s in Japan. We believe that our approach—exploring the prolonged effects of the hidden curriculum based on the assumption—is one of the most reliable approaches available with observational data. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we review the literature on the impact of school education on preference formation and describe educational content/practices in Japan. Section 3 presents the empirical framework, i.e., the data and empirical specification used in the analysis. Section 4 reports the estimation results, and Sect. 5 discusses the validity of our identification assumption. The estimation results show that people who experienced participatory and cooperative learning practices during their elementary education are more likely to be altruistic, cooperative with others, reciprocal, and have national pride after they grew up. In contrast, education emphasizing anti-competitive practices is negatively associated with these attributes. Such contrasts can also be seen in other preferences regarding government policies and the market economy. The findings imply that elementary school education, as a place for early socialization, plays an important role in the formation of life-long social preferences. Various checks show that the findings are robust after eliminating possible confounding factors or potential reverse causality. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",12
73,2,The Japanese Economic Review,20 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00041-z,Forecasting the Japanese macroeconomy using high-dimensional data,April 2022,Yoshiki Nakajima,Naoya Sueishi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The increased availability of large-scale data in recent years has enabled us to incorporate rich information to forecast macroeconomic series. However, forecasting based on the vector autoregression (VAR) model, which is the traditional and commonly used method of forecasting, has two problems related to high-dimensional data. One is the curse of dimensionality; that is, the number of parameters in VAR models can be much larger than the time series sample size. The other problem is the high correlation among predictors. Macroeconomic data tend to comprise sets of highly correlated variables, which may make ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation unstable. Since the end of the twentieth century, a number of methods have been proposed to circumvent problems with high-dimensional data in conventional econometric methods. The idea is to reduce the dimensionality of the original data with the least possible loss of information. These methods are broadly classified into two approaches. The first approach is to reduce the number of predictors in high-dimensional VAR models by penalized least squares estimation. Tibshirani (1996) introduced an \(L_1\)-penalized least squares method called “lasso” (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and some variants of lasso were subsequently proposed by Zou and Hastie (2005) and Yuan and Lin (2006). These methods make some coefficients of the VAR model exactly zero and, hence, can achieve estimation and variable selection simultaneously. Although lasso-type methods were originally introduced to analyze cross-section data, they can also be applied for time series data. Applications in macroeconomics are relatively new and most are limited to analyses of U.S. data. See, for example, Song and Bickel (2011), Li and Chen (2014), and Callot and Kock (2014) for forecasting of monthly macroeconomics indicators. Marsilli (2014) and Uematsu and Tanaka (2019) obtained short-term forecasting (nowcasting) using mixed-frequency data. The second approach is to use dynamic factor models to exploit a small number of latent variables that may affect a large number of macroeconomic variables. Burns and Mitchell (1946) defined the business cycle as a type of fluctuation found in aggregate economic activity; thus, the idea that a few unobservable common factors have an impact on a large set of observable variables is well rooted in economics. Since the seminal work by Stock and Watson (2002a), dynamic factor models have been widely used in macroeconomics, not only for forecasting (Stock and Watson 2002a, b; Artis et al. 2005; Banerjee et al. 2008) but also for other purposes such as the evaluation of monetary policy (Bernanke et al. 2005; Yamamoto 2019), estimation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (Boivin and Giannoni 2006), development of real-time economic indicators (Altissimo et al. 2010), and nowcasting (Giannone et al. 2008). Applications using Japanese data include those of Shintani (2005), Shibamoto (2007), Hayakawa and Kobayashi (2011), and Chikamatsu et al. (2018). This paper makes three contributions to the literature of macroeconomic forecasting. First, we apply various high-dimensional models to the Japanese economy to forecast important macroeconomic indicators. Making an accurate prediction of the macroeconomy is crucial to better understand the country’s economic structure on which policymakers and businesses make decisions; however, few studies have explored high-dimensional macroeconomic data in Japan. Although Shintani (2005) showed the benefit of exploiting high-dimensional data for forecasting, he only used a diffusion index (DI) model. Recently, the simulation of Smeekes and Wijler (2018) has shown that penalized least squares methods are robust to model misspecification and perform well even when the underlying data generating process follows a factor model. Our attempt is the first to compare the forecasting performances of the DI model and the high-dimensional VAR model by using Japanese data. Second, we propose two forecast-oriented methods to select the number of factors in the DI model. Our DI model consists of two equations. The first equation is a factor model used to extract common factors from high-dimensional data. The second equation is a factor-augmented AR model used to predict a series of interests. Because the number of factors is unknown to researchers, it has to be determined in a data-dependent manner. Selection methods of Bai and Ng (2002), Onatski (2010), and Ahn and Horenstein (2013) are commonly used. However, these methods are designed to find the true number of factors in the factor model and do not consider the forecasting performance of the factor-augmented AR model. We propose two cross-validation-based methods, called DICV and DILASSO, to select the number of factors to minimize the mean squared forecasting error (MSFE). Third, we consider an \(R^2\)-based approach to investigate the relationship between latent common factors and observable macroeconomic series. One of the problems of factor models is the interpretability of latent factors, because they are given by linear combinations of several observable series. Stock and Watson (2002b) and Ludvigson and Ng (2009) studied the economic interpretations of factors by looking into \(R^2\)s while regressing each macroeconomic variable on each estimated factor. Our method is different from theirs in that we investigate \(R^2\)s while regressing each variable on all factors relevant for forecasting a particular variable. Variables with high \(R^2\) capture the information exploited by the DI model for forecasting. We have conducted an empirical analysis to investigate the forecasting performances of several high-dimensional models using 127 monthly Japanese macroeconomic data from April 2003 to June 2018. Our main findings are threefold. (1) Incorporating abundant information using high-dimensional data contributes to improvements in the accuracy of forecasting. Moreover, the benefit of using high-dimensional data is larger for longer foresting horizons, although the extent of improvement is relatively small when forecasting leading indicators. (2) DILASSO outperforms existing selection methods in terms of forecasting performance especially when the forecast horizon is long. (3) Our \(R^2\)-based approach indicates that the DI model and the high-dimensional VAR model exploit information from similar groups of variables for forecasting if factors of the DI model and variables in the VAR model are selected by our proposed methods. Although informative groups of variables are different depending on the variables to be forecast, they are similar between the DI and VAR models. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces high-dimensional VAR and DI models and their estimation methods. Section 3 reports the result of the empirical study, and Sect. 4 concludes.",3
73,2,The Japanese Economic Review,16 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00047-7,Abatement innovation in a Cournot oligopoly: emission versus output tax incentives,April 2022,Naoto Aoyama,Emilson C. D. Silva,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines an environmental tax as one “whose tax base is a physical unit (or a proxy of it) that has a proven specific negative impact on the environment. Four subsets of environmental taxes are distinguished: energy taxes, transport taxes, pollution taxes and resources taxes. Taxes should not be confounded neither with payments of rent nor with purchase of an environmental protection service.”Footnote 1 In a later report, the OECD (2010) categorizes various forms of environmental innovations: (i) use inputs of the same type that are less emission intensive; (ii) use inputs of different types that are less emission intensive; (iii) reduce pollution intensity per unit of input without modifying inputs; (iv) reduce input use per unit of output, and (v) use end-of-pipe technology. If an environmental tax is levied on pollution, firms may have incentives to promote all these types of innovation. However, an indirect tax on pollution is more limiting: it can provide incentives for innovations only for types (i), (iii), and (iv). In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of environmental taxation in promoting the adoption of an advanced abatement technology. We study two types of taxes: one that taxes emissions (i.e., a direct tax on pollution) and another that taxes output (i.e., an indirect tax on pollution). One of the important findings of this study is that the effectiveness of a direct tax relative to an indirect tax depends on the shape of the multiproduct technology. Firms may produce two outputs: a final consumption good, whose production causes pollution, and an abatement product, which reduces pollution. The direct tax is more effective if the multiproduct technology features diseconomies of scope. However, the indirect tax is more effective if the multiproduct technology features economies of scope provided the degree of complementarity between the two products is large. According to Cremer and Gahvari (2002): “In most textbook models of externality, the question of the choice between emission and output taxes does not arise: they are equivalent. Yet this is an important policy question. The equivalence of the tax instruments in these models is an artifact of an assumed one-to-one relationship between emissions and polluting good. This is an unrealistic assumption. Input substitution, employing different technologies and abatement imply that a given level of output may result in different levels of emissions. Allowing for these possibilities breaks up the equivalence of output and emission taxes and allows one to study the role of these and other tax instruments in implementing different public policy objectives.” (Cremer and Gahvari 2002, pp. 385–386). Schmutzler and Goulder (1997) and Cremer and Gahvari (2001) review the related literature and highlight the typical assumption of studies in this strand of the literature. They assume that a direct tax is one on emissions of certain pollutants and that an indirect tax is one on the output of a firm for which production entails emissions of certain pollutants. Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas (1996) examine optimal emission taxes under perfect competition, monopoly, and oligopoly. They show that the optimal emission tax depends on the marginal pollution damage and on the distortion produced by market power. In our model, the firms are oligopolistic. The industry is composed of \(n \ge 2\) firms. Each firm produces an amount of a homogeneous consumption good, which we call “energy.” Energy production leads to the emission of a pollutant (e.g., carbon dioxide). Each firm may reduce its emission level by producing abatement. If the firm produces abatement, it can also exert effort in the production of green research and development (R&D) to reduce the cost of producing abatement. Each firm has two types of abatement technology available. One, which we call “standard,” can be utilized without incurring any fixed cost. The other, which we call “advanced,” requires a fixed cost of adoption. The advanced technology is more efficient than the standard technology, since the total and marginal costs of producing abatement under the advanced technology are lower than those under the standard technology. The standard and advanced technologies are multiproduct technologies. The multiproduct technologies may feature diseconomies of scope (absence of cost complementarity) or economies of scope (presence of cost complementarity). The government has a mandate to set environmental policy to control pollution. Environmental policy takes one of two forms: an energy tax or a tax on emissions. In the status quo, the government does not intervene. In this setting, the firms play a two-stage game. In the first stage, each firm decides whether to innovate, taking the actions of all other firms as given. Prior to the beginning of the second stage, each firm observes the technological choices made by all other firms. In the second stage, each firm chooses R&D effort and energy and abatement output levels, taking all other firms’ choices as given. The subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for this game provides us with a benchmark for future comparisons. When the government intervenes, either by setting an energy tax rate or by setting an emission tax rate, the game played by the government and firms has three stages. In the first stage, the government sets the tax rate. In the second and third stages, the firms make choices as in the benchmark game. We later compare all subgame perfect equilibria to find the circumstances under which environmental policy is effective in promoting incentives for innovation. Few studies have compared an emission tax with an output tax. Schmutzler and Goulder (1997) examine an emission tax and an output tax to improve environmental quality under uncertain circumstances. In a perfect monitoring case, the regulator can achieve the first-best allocation using a pure emission tax. With imperfect monitoring, pure emission taxes are not optimal with monitoring costs. Starting from this point, Schmutzler and Goulder (1997) characterize the optimal conditions for an output tax. With sufficiently high monitoring costs, sufficiently limited options of emission reduction other than output reduction, and sufficiently high substitutability of the output, the output tax is more desirable than the emission tax. Cremer and Gahvari (2001) examine the optimality of output taxes, emission taxes, and mixed taxes. Under full information, the first-best Pigouvian rule requires that the marginal private benefit of emissions in production equal the marginal social damage by emissions. Under limited information, the modified Pigouvian rule requires that the marginal emission tax equal the marginal social damage of emissions plus an adjustment term. The term reflects the impact of marginal emissions on the incentive compatibility constraint. Many studies have examined how environmental policies may promote the adoption of advanced technology for the control of pollution emissions (e.g., Downing and White 1986; Milliman and Prince 1989; Jung et al. 1996; Jaffe et al. 2002; Fowlie 2010; Acemoglu et al. 2012). Typically, the theoretical analysis considers situations in which all firms adopt the new technology. Requate and Unold (2003) extend the works of Milliman and Prince (1989) and Jung et al. (1996) to consider a case in which the number of firms that adopt an advanced technology is determined endogenously through equilibrium considerations. Requate and Unold (2003) assess how many firms will invest in and adopt a new technology in equilibrium under taxes, subsidies, auctioned permits, grandfathering permits, and command and control. If the regulator does not anticipate the new technology, then taxes and subsidies on abatement provide higher incentives than the other policy instruments. If the regulator does anticipate the new technology, then when firms move first and the regulator moves second, taxes and all permit regimes are superior to standards. Alternatively, when the regulator moves first and firms move second, only permits succeed in achieving the first-best allocation. Recently, Fowlie (2010) empirically shows that environmental regulations have been crucial motivators for the adoption of advanced, cleaner, technologies in the electricity sector in the United States. Acemoglu et al. (2012) consider a growth model with environmental constraints and endogenous and directed technical change. They show that the optimal intertemporal policy must use a tax on dirty input production to control carbon emissions and a subsidy on clean R&D to influence the type of research activity. Schmutzler and Goulder (1997) and Cremer and Gahvari (2001) devote attention to the choice problem between emission and output taxes, but they do not consider the impact of these taxes on promotion of an advanced abatement technology. Milliman and Prince (1989), Jung et al. (1996), and Requate and Unold (2003) consider rankings among emission taxes, subsidies, permits and command and control to promote an advanced abatement technology, but they do not consider the effects of energy taxes. Unlike these studies, we consider the effectiveness of energy and emission taxes in the adoption of an advanced abatement technology. We consider multiproduct technologies that feature economies or diseconomies of scope. Panzar and Willig (1981) formalize the concept of economies of scope. If there are economies of scope, the firm can produce two or more goods at a lower cost than that of producing these goods separately, and thus, economies of scope arise if there is a sharable input. According to Bailey and Friedlaender (1982), some cases in which economies of scope are present are networking, reuse of an input, and sharing of intangible assets, among others. Some authors have noted the existence of economies of scope in abatement production as well as in the joint production of output and abatement. Hartman et al. (1997) provide examples of economies of scope in abatement production. “Even where separate equipment is called for, there may be common use of skilled and unskilled labor, materials and energy. Generally then, abatement can be characterized as a multiple-output process whose costs are affected by diminishing returns, pollutant-specific technology requirements, scale economies, and diseconomies associated with diversity of emissions sources.” (Hartman et al. 1997, p. 761). Johnstone et al. (2008) focus on economies of scope between production of conventional output and abatement of pollution. “CPP is considered to reflect a production process in which abatement and production of the conventional output are integrated, allowing for the complementary use of inputs in both abatement and production; that is, the realization of economies of scope. As such, factors that encourage (or allow for) the realization of economies of scope between the two processes will be reflected in a greater propensity for a given facility to undertake CPP.” (Johnstone et al. 2008, p. 146). These works motivate us to consider how the existence of economies or diseconomies of scope influence environmental policy and vice versa. We contribute to the literature on the utilization of multiproduct technologies by considering how the type of environmental tax (emission or output) affects the adoption of an advanced technology in a Cournot oligopoly. We organize the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model in which we derive the optimal values for the benchmark game without taxation. In Sect. 3, we examine a three-stage game in which the government chooses the energy tax rate. In Sect. 4, we consider another three-stage game in which the government chooses the emission tax rate. Section 5 combines the results and discusses the circumstances under which each type of tax is more effective in promoting innovation. Section 6 concludes.",2

An analysis for multiple service combinations,April 2022,Shinya Sugawara,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Most developed countries are facing the dual problem of an aging population and increasing long-term care costs. Many governments subsidize the formal institutional care sector, which includes nursing homes. However, because institutional care is costly, many countries are seeking alternative care options. A conventional substitute for institutional care is informal at-home careFootnote 1 provided by family members (Chiswick 1976; van Houtven and Norton 2004; Charles and Sevak 2005; Bolin et al. 2008; Hanaoka and Norton 2008; Bonsang 2009; Balia and Brau 2014). However, this option has negative effects on family caregivers in terms of factors such as labor supply (Wolf and Soldo 1994; Van Houtven et al. 2013; Sugawara and Nakamura 2014; Fu et al. 2017), health status (Coe and Van Houtven 2009), and subjective well-being (Van den Berg and Ferrer-i Carbonell 2007; Niimi 2016). Formal at-home care is now considered a reasonable substitute for institutional care. Even in cases where no market for formal at-home care exists, several researchers have considered the advantages of such a system (Carmichael and Charles 2003; Heitmueller and Inglis 2007; Heitmueller 2007; Carmichael and Charles 1998). Several countries have begun providing formal at-home care. As an empirical example, De Meijer et al. (2015) analyzed the Netherlands, where a social insurance program covers formal at-home care. The authors found that a shift in formal at-home care is the main reason for a decline in institutional care. A distinct characteristic of at-home care is that the sector includes many small and complementary services. This is unlike medical care services provided by a hospital or institutional long-term care, both of which provide a single integrated care service. Instead, at-home care provides an appropriate combination of services based on the characteristics of the user, such as their health, economic status, and family structure. Thus, an analysis of multiple service combinations has rich implications in the context of home care. The conventional approach to an analysis of the relationship between the use of combined services and health status is regression analysis with cross-dummies that correspond to the combinations as explanatory variables. However, the high dimensionality of the combinations creates difficulty in identifying the regression coefficients. When a combination of services is seldom used, the lack of degrees of freedom means that the coefficient for the corresponding cross-dummy variable is not strongly identified. Because there are many combinations, it is burdensome to check the identifiability of wach combination. To solve this identification problem, I present a simple econometric method to handle the high-dimensionality problem of combinations. My method incorporates an itemset mining approach for dimension reduction. This step selects itemsets that are often used jointly via basket analysis. I construct cross-dummies that correspond to the obtained baskets and then apply regression analysis. This approach, which I call a basket regression, allows the analysis of all combinations used by a sufficient number of people. I apply this method to large claims data for Japan. In 2000, with the world’s most rapidly aging population, the country established Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI), a mandatory social insurance program specific to long-term care. Of the countries that implement social long-term care insurance, Japan provides broader coverage for lighter disabilities, as summarized in Campbell et al. (2009). To supply care to the elderly with moderate disabilities, the Japanese LTCI provides generous coverage for at-home care. As a result, the country has formal markets for many at-home care services where the elderly choose the service combination. The combination is called a care plan by the Japanese LTCI system, and the appropriate construction of care plans represent a social issue. My empirical study analyzes 14 services within long-term at-home care services. As an outcome variable, I use the transitions of care-need levels after using care services to reflect users’ health status. The empirical results show that of the \(2^{14}=16,384\) possible combinations of 14 services, only 200 care plans are adopted by more than 0.03% of LTCI users. The results of the basket regression show that among several care plans that include a medical services, especially rehabilitation services, have a strong positive correlation with the health status of the elderly. However, the use of rehabilitation services may be limited owing to regional disparities in accessibility. The proposed method contributes to an emerging body of literature that attempts to unify econometrics and machine learning. Machine learning provides various approaches to the handling of high-dimensional data. As more high-dimensional data become available in economics, adaptations of machine-learning methods are gaining popularity in econometrics, as surveyed by Mullainathan and Spiess (2017). The novel aspect of this research is that I concentrate on high-dimensional data composed of multiple variable combinations. For analysis of high-dimensional combination data, there is a literature body on machine learning from the perspective of multiple testing. Terada et al. (2013) proposed a method that jointly operates itemset mining and multiple testing and applied their method to high-dimensional genetic data. Sugiyama et al. (2015) combined a graph mining approach with multiple testing. The novelty of my analysis is that the data are not obtained from experiments but instead from the actual purchase of care services. This data property requires us to eliminate spurious correlations. Then, I use a regression approach to examine the conditional relationships given the observable factors. A directly related study is that of Sugawara et al. (2018), who combined a basket analysis and an econometric analysis in two-part models of medical expenditures. In their model, multiple service combinations appear as dependent variables. On the other hand, in this research, combined services appear as explanatory variables. For regressions on high-dimensional data, there are two methodologies closely related to the analysis presented here. First, a reduced-rank regression (Izenman 1975) is a pioneering approach that considers grouped explanatory variables and their combined effects in the context of the regression. However, the scope of this approach differs from that of this current study because the reduced-rank regression handles a multivariate dependent variable. Second, the group lasso (Yuan and Lin 2006) is an approach used to estimate the shrinkage of grouped variables. However, as I discuss in a later section, the group lasso method has a different purpose compared with the method employed here. To obtain empirical interpretation from the estimation results, my method is more informative for my research purposes. An analysis of long-term care service combinations in Japan is important in its own right as an empirical study. For Japanese LTCI, the existence of agency problems by gatekeepers has been reported by Sugawara and Nakamura (2016) and Iizuka et al. (2017). Here, providing accurate information on the correlation between services and health status can help to reduce information gaps between gatekeepers and consumers. Furthermore, although the coverage for many services is a distinct property of Japanese LTCI, previous studies on the demand for long-term care have focused on specific services (Noguchi and Shimizutani 2009; Sugawara 2017) or on aggregate demand (Hashimoto et al. 2010; Hanaoka and Norton 2008). On the other hand, this study considers detailed care plans, which have broad implications in terms of providing feasible and effective long-term care in Japan.",1
73,2,The Japanese Economic Review,20 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00053-9,"Corporate social responsibility, vertical product differentiation, and privatization policy",April 2022,Xingtang Wang,Leonard F. S. Wang,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the literature on mixed oligopolies, De Fraja and Delbono (1989) showed that the privatization of welfare-maximizing public firms may improve social welfare, while Matsumura (1998) explicitly considered the possibility of partial privatization and Fujiwara (2007) looked at this issue under product differentiation. Tomaru and Wang (2018) showed that the optimal policy is partial privatization when the technical improvement is small: subsidization adjusts the production allocation, and privatization plays an auxiliary role in enhancing welfare by further adjusting the production allocation and improving the technology of the privatized firm. Liu et al. (2019) recently in vertical-related markets showed that the optimal policy toward the semi-public firm is full nationalization in a more differentiated product market; as the product tends to be homogenized, however, full privatization can be socially optimal. Bárcena-Ruiz et al. (2020) found that the stake that the government retains in the state corporation depends on whether goods are substitutes or complements, whether private firms are uniplant or multiplant, and the percentage of foreign ownership in private firms. Many public firms have been fully or partially privatized since a world-wide wave of economic liberalization in the 1980s. It opens a new and interesting field: mixed oligopolistic markets, in which there are a mix of competitors, including public and semi-public firms as well as domestic and foreign private firms. Over the past few decades, proliferated theoretical literature has involved the exploration of privatization (Kalashnikov et al. 2011; Lee and Tomaru 2017; Gil-Moltó et al. 2019). There is another trend in organization and ownership structure gaining attention and has become a mainstream activity for firms in today’s globalized market environment. Firms are engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility (henceforth CSR) activities in order to create a “socially friendly image” for their products. Economic literature on CSR have been confined to an examination of CSR on a voluntary basis.Footnote 1 In particular, Manasakis et al. (2013) investigated the impacts of alternative certifying institutions on firms’ incentives to undertake CSR activities and their relative market and societal implications. Chen et al. (2016) showed that under different pricing rules, the impacts of a higher upstream firms' concern over CSR on market equilibrium outcomes either with symmetric case (two consumer-friendly upstream firms) or asymmetric case (one consumer-friendly upstream firm) are different. Calveras and Ganuza (2018) showed that the existence of complementarity between internal and external CSR (they mutually reinforce each other) through product quality.Footnote 2 Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2020) found that an incumbent monopolist can use CSR as an entry deterrent, and CSR levels decrease as the degree of product heterogeneity increases in Cournot competition and are zero in Bertrand Competition. Many existing industries comprise socially concerned and private, profit-maximizing firms. Goering (2007) incorporated CSR into a mixed oligopoly, where in private not-for-profit organizations (NPOs) is considered to be maximizing an objective function that takes into account their own profits as well as a share of consumer surplus.Footnote 3 Kopel and Brand (2012) extended this framework, working the endogenous hiring decisions of socially responsible firms into it. Kopel (2015) further showed that market equilibria, welfare. and profit rankings depending on the particular combination of the level of social concern and the degree of product differentiation. CSR behavior of manufacturers may affect consumers' willingness to pay (Arora and Gangopadhyay 1995). In a duopoly model of vertical differentiation, García-Gallego and Georgantzís (2009) found that in most cases, if the market structure is left unchanged, increases in the consumers' social consciousness yield higher profits to socially responsible firms and may lead to higher levels of social welfare. However, when an increase in the consumer's social consciousness changes the market structure, welfare may fall, while the duopolists' profits rise. Doni and Ricchiuti (2013) analyzed how the interaction between green consumers and responsible firms affects the market equilibrium and found that a higher degree of responsibility of consumers and/or firms may both increase and decrease the total abatement and the social welfare. There have been several other contributions to various aspects of issues in CSR under mixed oligopoly: for example, in horizontal models (Goering, 2008, 2012; Matsumura and Ogawa 2014; Ouattara 2017), in vertical models (Goering 2012, 2014; Brand and Grothe 2015), and in open economies (Wang et al. 2012; Chang et al. 2014; Chao et al. 2016; Manasakis et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019).Footnote 4 To see how the adoption of CSR by private firms influences the privatization policy of the government, Ouattara (2017) examined the impact of CSR on privatization in a mixed duopoly consisting of one public firm and one CSR firm that could either be owned by domestic private investors or owned by foreign private investors. It showed that government should decrease the degree of privatization if the level of CSR increases. Furthermore, if the level of CSR is high enough, the optimal degree of privatization in an international mixed duopoly is higher than that obtained in a domestic mixed duopoly. Kim et al. (2019) formulated a mixed oligopoly in which a public firm competes with two private firms that may adopt CSR and investigated the relationship between CSR and the optimal privatization policy. They found that, depending on CSR level and cost differences among firms, either nationalization or full privatization can be optimal. For identical cost functions, they showed that the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing with the level of CSR if private firms are homogeneous, while it is non-monotone with the CSR level in a significant heterogeneity of objectives among the firms. In real world-scenario, we can easily find that there are certain quality differences between the products or services provided by public firms and private firms. For example, in China, S.F. Express is a private logistics firm, while EMS is a public logistics firm, and the service quality of S.F. Express is obviously higher than that of EMS. In terms of air conditioning manufacturing, GREE GROUP's air conditioning quality is higher than Midea Group. S.F. Express and Midea Group serve the society by donating to schools and helping the poor every year, so as to promote corporate social responsibility. How will the social responsibility of the private firm affect the government's privatization policy towards the public firm under the background that the public firm and the private firm produce different quality products? In this paper, we use the framework of Benassi et al. (2016) to analyze the privatization policy for public firm and the relationship between the optimal degree of privatization and the CSR degree of private firm if the marginal cost of producing high-quality product is higher.Footnote 5 In Benassi et al. (2016), privatization policy and CSR behavior of private firm were not considered, but these two issues are important in a mixed market (Matsumura 1998; Fujiwara 2007; Tomaru and Wang 2018; Kim et al. 2019). We find that if the public firm produces low-quality products with lower cost (we define this case as Regime \(ll\)), the government should adopt a privatization policy, and the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing (increasing) in the CSR degree of private firm if the cost difference is sufficiently small (large). If the public firm produces high-quality products with higher cost (we define this case as Regime \(hh\)) and the cost difference between public firm and private is relatively large (small), the government should (not) adopt privatization policy. If the government adopts privatization policy, the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing (increasing) in the CSR degree of private firm if the cost difference is sufficiently small (large). In the extension, we assume that the marginal cost function with respect to its quantity, and analyze the endogenous selection of product quality between public firm and private firm, and find that if the quality gap between high-quality products and low-quality products is sufficiently large, both firms will choose produce high-quality products. If the product quality gap is medium-intensity then the public firm chooses to produce low-quality products, and the private firm chooses to produce high-quality products. However, if the product quality gap is sufficiently small, then there is no existence of Nash equilibrium. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 formulates our basic model. In Sect. 3, we extend the basic model considering the endogenous selection of product quality between public firm and private firm, Sect. 4 concludes this paper.",4

73,3,The Japanese Economic Review,18 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-022-00113-2,Economics of the community mechanism,July 2022,Masao Ogaki,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There are three major mechanisms at work in the economic system. These are the market mechanism (comprising the price mechanism and the competition mechanism), the power mechanism (a mechanism that can, for example, coerce people to pay taxes because of the power of the legal system), and the community mechanism (a mechanism in which at least one person proposes voluntary cooperation and is not rejected). We discuss the definition of the community mechanism in detail in Sect. 3. A few key points to start. First, the community mechanism is intended to be distinct from the remaining two mechanisms, even though it can be combined with both or one of the two other mechanisms. Second, its main use is in what might be called the community sector of families and nonprofit organizations, but it is also used in the market sector of profit organizations, and the public sector of state and local public bodies. As an example, consider the Japanese Economic Association (JEA). This paper is based on the presidential address given at the Fall Meeting of the JEA in 2021, which was the first hybrid conference of the JEA given the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of both online and face-to-face meetings and building upon the JEA’s Spring Meeting in 2020, which was its first online conference. COVID-19 produced many challenges never experienced before by the JEA as an academic association, but the chairs of the steering and program committees and the directors in charge of the conference, and many other association members volunteered their time and efforts to address these and proceed with the conference. This shows the community mechanism at work. In addition, without the administrative work of the JEA office workers who are not association members, activities such as the conference would not be possible. So, the market mechanism in the form of the labor market is also at work here. Lastly, in the poster session for the online conference, there is always the possibility that the presenter and the audience will be one-on-one, and it then becomes more important to prevent harassment in this situation. So, there are many activities relating to the law, such as the appointment of the first Anti-Harassment Committee at the 2020 Fall Conference, and the appointment of the new committee in charge of legal affairs in May 2021. This shows the power mechanism at work. We typically consider that the three main sectors of the economy, being the market, public, and community sectors, correspond in turn to the market, power, and community mechanisms in the sense that it is in only one of each that one of the three mechanisms is at work. At first, this seems to hold for the JEA, which is neither a for-profit company in the market sector nor a government agency in the public sector but lies in the community sector and is based on the workings of the community mechanism by many volunteers. However, the association not only uses the community mechanism, but also mixes the market and power mechanisms with it to carry out projects for the purpose of the association. For-profit corporations in the market sector and national and local governments in the public sector also use a mixture of the three mechanisms, so it is necessary to distinguish between the three sectors and the three mechanisms. In this paper, I discuss how any group of two or more persons can use a mixture of the three mechanisms and how these mechanisms are and should be combined. The market mechanism, the power mechanism, and the community mechanism are all tools in their own right and can be used for good or evil. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the importance of the community mechanism and its relationship with the stage of economic development. In low-income countries, the community mechanism plays an important role, but as economic development progresses, the community mechanism loses its importance. However, as economic development progresses further, periods of crisis arising from environmental problems and a declining birthrate and aging population will occur. Even in high-income countries, it will be difficult to respond to these challenges with the market and power mechanisms alone, and the community mechanism will once again become important. Section 3 defines the community mechanism using the story of Robinson Crusoe and Friday. A definition of the community mechanism is proposed as a mechanism in which at least one person proposes voluntary cooperation that is not rejected. Sections 4 and 5 provide examples of how this community mechanism can be captured in traditional economics, which assumes selfish and rational economic agents (homo economicus), and in behavioral economics, which does not. The following sections consider the relationship between the community mechanism and various concepts: virtue and eudaimonia in Sect. 6, endogenous preferences and trust in Sect. 7, leadership in Sect. 8, and perspective taking and community mechanisms in Sect. 9. Together, these sections provide the background for normative economics, which explores how scarce resources should be allocated, as opposed to positive economics, which explores how scarce resources are allocated. Section 10 then presents an analytical framework that introduces virtue ethics, an ethical approach that emphasizes virtue, which can play a major role in the development of the community mechanism into normative economics. It also presents an application of normative economics to the problem of childcare outsourcing. Finally, Sect. 11 presents the conclusion and future research direction.",

For a parent of small children, hunt for a slot in a nursery school/daycare may be a daunting matching problem. Assignment of medical resources such as vaccines is a large-scale and high-stake matching problem that is attracting a lot of attention in the face of global pandemic. Matching theory is a study of how to match different entities in desirable manners, e.g., individuals with individuals, individuals with institutions, and individuals with goods or services. By now the field has a long tradition with numerous contributions, with its origin dating back to at least the seminal theoretical contribution by Galeand Shapley (1962) and its economic application by Roth (1984). A notable feature of this field is that researchers not only study matching problems in the abstract, but also put theory in practice. In the early years of the field, several prominent implementation efforts have been quite successful, e.g., medical matching and related labor markets (Roth and Peranson 1999; Roth 2002), school choice (Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez 2003), course allocation in education (Sönmez and Ünver 2010; Budish and Cantillon 2012), and transplantable organ allocation (Roth et al. 2004, 2005, 2007), just to name a few examples. The field came to be known as “market design,” with its emphasis on design of actual matching mechanisms in the field and academic questions posed by design experience. This paper describes several topics of interest in matching theory and market design. In doing so, we follow the tradition of matching theory and market design by emphasizing the interplay between research and practice. In particular, we will not only describe some prominent implementation efforts known in the field but also describe our own efforts, old and new. Our work in this domain is very much in progress, hence the title “a progress report.” The rest of this paper goes as follows. Section 2 presents the basic matching model and classical results. Section 3 introduces UTMD, the institution at the core of our ongoing effort. Section 4 describe UTMD’s projects to apply matching theory to practical problems. Section 5 concludes.",1

73,3,The Japanese Economic Review,24 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00110-x,High-frequency identification of monetary policy shocks in Japan,July 2022,Hiroyuki Kubota,Mototsugu Shintani,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As a result of a decreasing trend in the natural rate of interest, controlling the short-term interest rate as a policy instrument is more likely to be constrained by the zero lower bound (ZLB) in many advanced countries. When there is no room to lower the policy rate in response to large negative shocks in the economy, such as the global financial crisis in 2008 or the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, central banks have no choice but to rely on unconventional policy instruments, including government bond purchases and forward guidance. Among central banks in such an environment, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is notable in having conducted a series of unconventional monetary policies for nearly 2 decades, since the time the zero-interest rate policy was first introduced in 1999. One of the main channels of unconventional monetary policy is to change the expectations on the future path of interest rates without using the short-term rate as the policy instrument. In this paper, we investigate the effect of monetary policy on the financial market during the unconventional monetary policy period in Japan using information from the high-frequency data on interest rate futures, which reflects the future expectations of the market participants. Our identification strategy closely follows that of Gürkaynak et al. (2005), who measured monetary policy surprises in the US, using changes in federal fund futures and 3-month Eurodollar futures in a sufficiently narrow window of time around the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press releases. Likewise, we measure monetary policy surprises in Japan, using changes in 3-month Euroyen futures and 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures, around the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) press releases between 1999 and 2020.Footnote 1 Using the changes in asset prices in a corresponding time interval, the market responses to monetary policy shocks can be appropriately evaluated, because the effects of other macroeconomic news are likely to be excluded.Footnote 2 Gürkaynak et al. (2005) also claim that monetary policy surprises can be characterized by two factors with a structural interpretation: the “target” factor, which mainly affects the current short-term rates, and the “path” factor, which affects the expected path of future short rates. In a similar vein, we consider the possibility that monetary policy surprises can be summarized by a small number of common factors in Japan. For robustness, we also extend the analysis of Gürkaynak et al. (2005) by extracting factors from the surprises around other monetary policy events, such as the press conferences. Our findings from the estimated responses of the stock prices and the government bond yields to the monetary policy surprises can be summarized as follows. First, two factors are found to be useful in describing market surprises in Japan, even in the low-interest environment. In response to both the target and path factors of the surprise monetary tightening, the government bond yields increase and the stock prices decline. The directions of these responses are consistent with the standard theoretical predictions and the coefficients are statistically significant. These results for Japan are similar to those for the US, as obtained by Gürkaynak et al. (2005) and Swanson (2021). Second, the responses to both factors tend to be larger for the longer term government bond yields and smaller for the shorter term government bond yields. In particular, among the longer term government bond yields, the size of the responses is largest for the 10-year JGB yield, which has effectively been considered as the policy target in the last 2 decades by the BOJ. This finding is in contrast with the previous studies using the data from the conventional monetary policy period by Gürkaynak et al. (2005) for the US and by Honda and Kuroki (2006) for Japan, who find that the response of government bond yields to a monetary policy shock is smaller for the longer maturities. At the same time, our results are in line with responses to factors that represent the unconventional monetary policy channels, estimated by Swanson (2021) for the US. We conjecture that this difference between the conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods comes from the ZLB, which imposes a stronger restriction on the variation in yields with shorter maturities. Our results imply that the BOJ has been successful in controlling the long-run expectations on the interest rates through monetary policy announcements. Honda and Kuroki (2006) is one of the first analyses to employ the identification methodology of Kuttner (2001) and measure monetary policy surprises for the conventional monetary policy period in Japan, based on the daily data of Euroyen futures rates. For the unconventional monetary policy period in Japan, Arai (2017) identifies the monetary policy shocks using the daily changes in the JGB spot yields. Furthermore, Nakashima et al. (2020) use the the multiple common factors extracted from daily surprises in Euroyen futures rates and other financial series to identify the various types of the unconventional monetary policy shocks. There are also several studies that employ high-frequency data of futures interest rates to identify the monetary policy shocks in Japan. For example, using the monetary policy surprises obtained from the intraday data of JGB futures, Rogers et al. (2014) evaluate the effects of the unconventional monetary policy, while Cieslak and Schrimpf (2019) investigate the central bank communication channel. Nakamura et al. (2021) follow Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) in identifying monetary policy shocks using a single factor from the intraday data of Euroyen futures and discuss the importance of a tight window. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, the policy surprises around the press releases are measured using high-frequency data for interest rate futures. The event study regression results, which are based on the policy surprises in each futures rate, are reported in Sect. 3. The regression results based on the multiple common factors among the Euroyen futures surprises are reported in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, the robustness analyses of the baseline results by incorporating monetary policy events other than the press releases, and by adding the JGB futures surprises in extracting factors, are conducted. Concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 6.",4

The related literature traces back to the seminal contributions of Ronnen (1991) and Crampes and Hollander (1995) who assume that the demand side is described by a continuum of consumers differing by the value that they assign to quality, and the supply side is given by two firms each offering one single quality. Both firms share the same technology where costs depend on quality. Under the assumption of quality competition in the first stage and price competition in the second stage, the authors show that an appropriately fixed MQS can increase welfare since it intensifies price competition by limiting product differentiation. Subsequently, this model has been modified and extended in several ways. For a detailed overview see Michaelis and Ziesemer (2017, pp. 620). In contrast to the advanced theoretical topics dealt with in the recent MQS-literature,Footnote 1 we are concerned with the more basic question of how to fix an appropriate MQS in practical policies. Of course, in a first-best world, it should be fixed in such a way that it maximizes welfare. In practice, however, any such attempt would be hardly feasible due to the regulator’s limited information about preferences and technologies. Therefore, we will analyze an alternative approach that relies on a simple benchmarking procedure. We borrowed this idea from the Japanese Top Runner Program (JTRP) which aims at enhancing the energy-efficiency of energy-consuming goods. The JTRP covers 31 products and obliges their producers to establish the currently highest efficiency level for the respective good by a certain target year (see, e.g., Kimura 2014, METI 2015). Applied to the topic of our paper, this mechanism can be described by a two-period model where the regulator introduces an MQS in period \(t = 2\) which is based on the qualities offered in period \(t = 1\). We consider two different cases: Under strict regulation, which is perfectly in line with the JTRP, the MQS is fixed according to the quality chosen by the high-quality firm in \(t = 1\). Under average regulation, which is a softened variant of the JTRP, the MQS is fixed according to the average quality offered in \(t = 1\). The complete time sequence of our model is shown in Fig. 1. Time sequence of the model If we consider only the first period in Fig. 1, the MQS to be introduced in the second period is irrelevant. In this case, our approach corresponds to the standard set-up of a differentiated duopoly with Bertrand competition (e.g., Shaked and Sutton 1982). If we consider only the second period, the MQS is exogenously fixed and our approach resembles the standard set-up used for analyzing the impacts of an MQS in a differentiated duopoly with Bertrand competition (e.g., Crampes and Hollander, 1995). With both periods taken together, however, the MQS becomes endogenous and depends on the firms’ decisions in the first period. In contrast to this, the models employed in the literature usually assume that the MQS either is completely exogenous or results from welfare maximization by a social planner. In virtually none of these models are the firms able to influence the MQS by their choice of quality since the regulator is the first mover and the firms only react to the standard imposed. The only exception is a paper by Lutz et al. (2000) where the high-quality firm moves first and makes a sunk investment in quality which influences the standard resulting from welfare maximization by the regulator. Hence, our model is related to Lutz et al. (2000) but we replace the demanding procedure of welfare maximization by a simple benchmarking approach which can be implemented in practice more easily.Footnote 2 The economic rationale behind the timing of regulation in our model results from the observation that practical policies often involve a considerable delay between the legal adoption and the actual implementation of a new standard (for empirical evidence see Lutz et al. 2000). Normally, in this transition period the firms are no longer able to influence the forthcoming regulation. In contrast, within a benchmarking approach according to the JTRP, the firms have ample time to shape the impending standard by altering the qualities supplied. This, of course, gives rise to strategic decision-making. In particular, there is an incentive to lower quality in \(t = 1\) to dampen the standard to be introduced in \(t = 2\). Nevertheless, the following analysis shows that a benchmarking approach based on average regulation can increase welfare in both periods. The underlying effects are an increase in consumers’ utility that always outweighs the decrease in firms’ profits. In contrast, under strict regulation the forthcoming standard is too severe such that the gains in welfare are smaller or even negative depending on the discount factor applied by the firms. For the case of more than two firms, we find in line with the basic literature on the effects of an MQS in oligopoly (Scarpa 1998; Pezzino 2010) that welfare will decrease under both regulatory schemes. The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the model and in Sect. 3, we calculate the unregulated equilibrium. In Sect. 4, we derive the regulated equilibria for two different benchmarking approaches. In Sect. 5, we analyze the resulting welfare effects and compare them to the outcome obtained from applying the optimal MQS. In Sect. 6, we briefly consider the case of more than two firms, and finally in Sect. 7 we discuss our main conclusions.",2
73,3,The Japanese Economic Review,02 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00067-3,Clearance sales and new product introduction,July 2022,Atsuo Utaka,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, I analyze monopolist sales strategies using a durable-goods model with demand uncertainty. My focus is clearance sales strategy generally held to clear inventories of unsold goods at a discounted price. In the fashion industry, for example, last season’s garments are sold at a reduced price to make room for the next season’s garments. Consumers can purchase clothes more cheaply if they wait a few months, but they may find that there is nothing left to buy because of the limited amount of this stock. The electrical appliance industry works a little differently. Manufacturers constantly upgrade products such as televisions and personal computers, and once a new version with improved functions is introduced, consumers lose interest in the older model. Firms then sell old products at a highly discounted price. In this situation, the introduction of new products plays a crucial role in the decreased price of the old model. (For instance, Sony sells the older version of its products through Sony Outlet Stores. In the web site, clearance products are defined as “new, unopened products that are discounted because they are being discontinued or replaced by new models”.) This study focuses on how the introduction of new products affects clearance strategies by considering the firm’s strategic behaviors in terms of inventory and product launches. In this analysis, it is assumed that the demand for a product is uncertain, and the monopolist determines the quantity of products without knowing the real demand state. Then, if the demand is smaller than expected, the monopolist determined whether to keep the unsold goods in inventory and sell them in the next period or to sell all products at a lower price during that period. If the monopolist invests in R&D, it introduces a new version with higher quality, which leads to a decrease in the value of the older version. Two types of consumers (with high and low valuations) observe the price and decide whether to buy the products. Under these settings, I investigate sales strategies, especially a clearance sales strategy. First, it is shown that without the introduction of new versions of products, clearance sales never occur, because the monopolist always prefers to scrap the unsold goods rather than keep them in stock. If the monopolist engages in R&D and releases a new version, on the contrary, clearance sales strategy can be employed. If a new version is introduced, the higher type consumers trade their first-period products in for new units, thus, in any case consumers can obtain first-period products at a lower price. Without the introduction of new versions of products, on the contrary, the price of a first-period product depends on whether clearance products are sold. Consequently, in cases where the amount of unsold goods is not so large, the monopolist decides to scrap them to limit the availability of older products in the second period, which leads to a higher price of the first-period product. Lazear (1986), Pashigian (1988) and van Praag and Bode (1992) have dealt with clearance sales policies from a standpoint of economics. Relatively recently, Nocke and Peitz (2007), using a model in which a monopolist chooses the production capacity and price path under demand uncertainty, showed that clearance sales can be a profit-maximizing strategy for the monopolist.Footnote 1 Moreover, Möller and Watanabe (2010) showed that clearance sales can be optimal by considering buyer’s heterogeneity and their demand uncertainty. These studies emphasized the effect of rationing, that is, consumers eager for the product tend to buy it at a high price rather than wait for a lower price to avoid the risk of not getting it. This effect is important in sales of seasonal goods such as clothes. For durable consumer goods such as televisions and personal computers, however, rather than the shortage of the supply, the effect of the release of a new model has a greater impact on consumer behavior. Former studies concerning clearance sales have not analyzed this aspect, since the introduction of new versions of products was not considered.Footnote 2 Many researchers have investigated the strategic behavior of durable-goods producers concerning new product introduction. (Waldman (2003) surveyed durable goods analysis.)Footnote 3 However, these studies have emphasized pricing strategy (or R&D decisions) and do not analyze quantity decisions, especially the decision process when there is demand uncertainty.Footnote 4 Therefore, it never occurs that the monopolist faces a part of the products remaining unsold because of the unexpected short demand. By taking the demand uncertainty into account, I embed the firm’s inventory behavior in the framework of the durable-goods model.Footnote 5",

In the framework of standard economics, the answer depends on whether a player’s net benefit increases when the outcome meets others’ expectations. That is, a player is motivated if his or her benefits from meeting expectations exceed his or her cost. In other words, a player is not motivated if the benefit is the same regardless of others’ expectations. Meanwhile, in reality, a player is likely to increase his or her motivation to win when cheers of encouragement are heard from spectators. If so, that support could improve the performance of players. However, economic researchers have yet to examine this notion. Hence, this paper aims to explore whether encouragement from spectators improves player performance using novel data under the quasi-experimental setting of speedboat races. Players of professional sports possibly become popular not only through their performance but also through their appearance. More physically attractive players are thought to be more popular than other players, even when performance is equal. Accordingly, good-looking players bear on their shoulders the expectations of others. The present study aimed to examine the effect of varying relative attractiveness on individual performance by considering the incentives to meet others’ expectations. Further, we compared the effects of men’s attractiveness with those of women’s. This work is the first to analyse bettors’ expectations based on the perceived effects of facial attractiveness on performance and the related gender difference. Japan speedboat races provide a setting for a natural experiment for comparing men’s behaviour with women’s under the same condition (Booth and Yamamura 2018). We intended to analyse unique performance data of speedboat races, in which men and women racers compete in a highly competitive environment. Our data were in panel form; we gathered information on each racer’s place in races and recorded time across all races in which they competed. We analysed a total of over 35,000 women race observations and over 400,000 men race observations during the period 2015–2017. Professional speedboat racers in Japan number approximately 1600, including both women and men. Each race had different competitors. Using the racers’ photographs that were officially open to the public, we measured the attractiveness and the order of such attractiveness among six racers participating in a race. In this way, this study determined the relative attractiveness effect, which varies according to the situation. Then, we analysed how the relative attractiveness influences the racers’ performance and compared the case between men and women racers. In the boat race, the rewards depend on the grade of the race and one’s place in the race, but do not differ according to popularity among fans. Thus, we could investigate how individual racers have an incentive to meet the expectations of others, dictated by racers’ relative physical attractiveness, even when economic return and racers’ skills are controlled. Our empirical strategy was as follows: we assumed that racers’ physical attractiveness can influence popularity among bettors’, but not the racers’ performance in the race. Hence, attractiveness was used as an excluded instrumental variable (IV) to control for the endogeneity bias of popularity in the estimation of the effect of racers’ popularity on performance. The strategy revealed the following. (1) In the first stage of IV estimation, racers who were more attractive than other competitors tended to be more popular, as reflected in betting odds, even after controlling for various variables that captured racer’s ability. (2) In the second stage of IV estimation, the more popular racers recorded better race times. (3) More popular men finished with a higher place in races, even though popularity had nothing to do with their gains. Meanwhile, such tendency was not observed for women. The third finding above is of particular interest. Men have a great incentive to improve their performance in response to expectation from fans even though the return is constant, whereas women do not have such an incentive. The remainder of the paper is constructed as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews related literature and describes the setting of speedboat racing in Japan. Section 3 presents the construction of data. Section 4 provides the analytical framework of our hypotheses and explains the estimation model. Section 5 gives the estimation results and our interpretation of the major findings. Section 6 provides our conclusions and implications for future research.",2

Regional labor markets are geographically demarcated areas within national labor market, and inter-regional labor mobility determines the level of local labor markets integration. The relation between unemployment and available job openings can be captured through a “matching function”, a function that takes unemployment and vacancies as input and returns the number of matches formed per unit of time. A substantial body of literature explores the matching function at an aggregate level (Pissarides 2000; Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001). However, the job-creation process takes place at a more disaggregated level. In fact, Manning and Petrongolo (2017) argue that labor markets, where the creation of employment takes place, are “quite local”. The job-matching process is influenced by the local number of job seekers and openings within a specific region. In addition, as a result of increasing labor mobility, the number of job matches is also influenced by the situation in neighboring regions (Burda and Profit 1996; Burgess and Profit 2001; Fahr and Sunde 2006). Burda and Profit (1996) introduce a job-searching model that empirically examines the matching function by accounting for certain external factors. This model includes the number of “foreign” vacancies and unemployment numbers, and they show that the Czech Republic’s local labor markets are affected by neighboring districts’ labor markets condition. Although Boeri and Scarpetta (1996) argue that the instability in the matching process is due to the heterogeneity of the industrial structure, Burda and Profit (1996) provide a spatial interpretation. They maintain that there are also inter-regional effects that require to be considered in determining the stability of the job-matching process. Moreover, Haller and Heuermann (2016) explore the regional matching function in Germany using nine spatial weight matrices and report significant spillover effects of unemployment and vacancies on the number of matches, which have taken place as a result of labor market reforms. Regional labor markets in Japan are receiving increased attention in job-matching research. For example, Kano and Ohta (2005), basing their estimates on prefectural level data, document significant disparities of the matching efficiency across regions. Kondo (2015), using Japanese municipal datasets, finds that high unemployment rates stimulate labor migration. Kondo and Okubo (2015) examine the relationship between inter-regional labor migration and real wages based on a multi-region economic geography model. They find that labor migrants respond to real wage disparities between regions. Higashi (2018) examines the spillover effects on the regional matching function using a contiguity weight matrix at both prefecture and PESO control levels. Following the examples as provided in the existing literature, this paper estimates the matching function in the Japanese labor markets at the prefecture level. This paper also considers spillover caused by labor mobility and job openings on the matching function after controlling for prefecture-specific and time fixed effects. Moreover, it shows to what extent the regional matching function’s estimates hinge on the definition of the local labor markets’ integration using different spatial weight matrices. This is of key importance in capturing and interpreting the spillover effects in the matching function. Furthermore, this enables policy-makers to understand the inter-regional dependence mechanisms that influence job creation. Also, this paper accounts for the working age population as a proxy for the degree of agglomeration. This serves as an essential determinant, as job matching is likely to rise as a result of reduced costs in the job-searching process (Lottman 2012; Haller and Heuermann 2016). Kano and Ohta (2005) posit that there are negative effects of a prefecture’s population density on job-matching efficiency in Japan. This is due to the poor coordination between firms and job seekers as a result of heterogeneous labor demand and supply functions. In either case, the effects that the degree of agglomeration exerts on the matching function need to further understood. In order to create an accurate picture of this issue, this study covers the period from 1987 to 2013, allowing for a proper assessment of the structural changes in the number of job matches over a lengthy timeframe. Our spatial diagnostics by means of Moran’s I, Lagrangian and robust Lagrangian multipliers reveal that the regional matching function is susceptible to significant spatial interactions within the Japanese labor market. A spatial econometric estimation of several models also indicates significant spillover effects in the explanatory variables and spatial correlation coefficient in the dependent variable (Spatial Durbin Model, or SDM), or in the error term (Spatial Durbin Error Model, or SDEM) on job matching. The former spatial model advocates that the spillover effects are of a global nature where changes in one explanatory variable affect the number of matches, not only in own prefecture, but also in neighboring prefectures, with feedback effects. The latter model suggests that the spillover effects are local in nature and are confined within prefectures, having non-null entries in the spatial weight matrix. We find that the local nature of spatial spillovers dominates in the Japanese labor market context and that the contiguity weight matrix best captures these effects. In other words, job seekers are willing to extend their job search radius to include prefectures sharing borders with their own prefectures. The estimation results reveal that the number of matches rises significantly when considering unemployment and vacancies (as stocks) within, and across, prefectures. Importantly, the estimates of the matching function in different periods, as provided below, indicate that job seekers have significantly altered their search radius over time. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, the empirical models are developed; in Sect. 3 a description of the data and different weight matrices are given; in Sect. 4, a report and interpretation of the estimation results are given. A discussion is set forth in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1
73,4,The Japanese Economic Review,04 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00051-x,Asymmetric volatility transmission in Japanese stock market in the presence of structural breaks,October 2022,Dimitrios Kartsonakis-Mademlis,Nikolaos Dritsakis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The financial world is characterized by uncertainty and therefore modelling financial time series becomes a complicated process. This complexity results not only from the various financial products in the market (exchange rate, interest rate, etc.) but also by the existence of political events that generate a lot of volatility in the financial series, making it difficult for stochastic models to incorporate them. Moreover, crude oil prices make use of financial instruments, including futures contracts and other financial derivatives, and their dynamics are broadly related to economic growth, inflation, price movements of other energy futures contracts and of other financial assets. 
Mandelbrot (1997) stated that volatility clustering and leptokurtosis are common characteristics of financial time series. Another commonly observed phenomenon is the “leverage effect” (Black 1976), which occurs when stock or oil prices are negatively correlated with changes in volatility. Therefore, to consider such characteristics, the literature has used several variance models to estimate and forecast the volatility. The generalization of the ARCH model of Engle (1982) proposed by Bollerslev (1986) was able to capture volatility clustering and leptokurtosis, but as its distribution is symmetric, it is not capable to model the leverage effects. To overcome this problem many asymmetric models have been proposed, such as the so-called GJR model of Glosten et al. (1993) and the Exponential GARCH model of Nelson (1991). Pagan and Schwert (1990) compared several symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models and highlighted the importance of non-linearities in stock return behaviour that are not captured by the symmetric ones. Loudon et al. (2000) attempted to forecast conditional variance with asymmetric GARCH models and concluded that the optimal choice of a model is period-specific. Another extension of the GARCH models was proposed by the Aggarwal et al. (1999) who add an extra set of dummy variables in the GARCH model to take into account structural changes. With the increasing integration of developed financial markets, it is also of crucial importance to understand how information transmits from one market to another. An understanding of volatility spillovers may result in beneficial opportunities for asset allocation and portfolio construction. Changings in volatility uncover the arrival of information, its assessment and degree of disagreement among financial market participants concerning the news’ impact on asset prices (Ross 1989). There are a lot of studies examining volatility transmission across major stock markets. Hamao et al. (1990) examined volatility spillover effects amongst the UK, Japanese and the US stock markets and found one-way causalities from the US to Japan, the US to the UK and the UK to Japan. Booth et al. (1997) examined volatility spillovers between the UK, the US and Japan stock futures using a VAR model and concluded that the UK and the US were influenced by the other two markets while the Japanese market appeared more invulnerable. Moreover, they provided evidence from a Multivariate GARCH model supporting some of their previous findings. However, as we mentioned before, political, economic or social events are able to produce a lot of volatility and thus, failing to take account of structural changes in volatility existing in the financial series may cause several distortions in the empirical results (Lamoureux and Lastrapes 1990; Ewing and Malik 2005). Moreover, stock market prices and oil prices are intrinsically linked with the economy and one should expect to find a strong relation between changes in the prices and/or volatilities of stock and oil markets (see Jones and Kaul 1996; Malik and Hammoudeh 2007). This paper studies the asymmetric volatility dynamics using daily closing prices for three developed stock markets (Japanese, American, and English) and crude oil prices from 20th October 1997 until 31st May 2017. We use modified iterated cumulative sums of squares (MICSS) algorithm to identify structural breaks in volatility of the indices. These detected sudden changes are then introduced into asymmetric GJR-GARCH models to accurately estimate how unexpected good and bad news affects the volatility of the indices. In addition, we examine the volatility transmission process between the Japanese stock market with the UK and US stock markets as well as with the Brent oil market utilizing the cross-correlation function (CCF). Moreover, to increase the power of the tests regarding the volatility transmission, we employ bivariate asymmetric BEKK-GARCH models with and without structural breaks. Contrariwise with other studies, our objective is to examine whether the volatility linkages obtained from the model incorporating structural changes are different from the parsimonious (neglecting structural breaks) one. This study focuses on the Japanese stock market for two reasons. First, the Japanese stock market is the world’s second-largest behind the American. However, the US stock market has been thoroughly examined by the literature and thus, the stock market of Japan is the best alternative given that not so much attention has been paid to it. Second, according to http://worldstopexports.com in 2017, Japan accounted for 7.3% of total crude oil imports making the country the world’s third-biggest importer of crude oil. This paper fills a void in the literature by modelling asymmetric stock and oil prices by accounting endogenously for structural breaks in variance and by examining the volatility transmission mechanism between the Japanese stock market and other major stock markets as well as the oil market. The results from the univariate context show that controlling for sudden changes within asymmetric GJR-GARCH models reduces both volatility persistence and the impact of good news on volatility. Moreover, we find that bad news has less effect on Nikkei225 volatility, yet significantly more impact on the volatility of the remaining indices. Our findings further support the incorporation of sudden changes in the variance process to gauge more precisely how new information in the markets is introduced into volatility estimates with an exception of the Japanese stock index. Finally, we show that there is a feedback causality-in-variance between the Japanese and the rest of the markets as well as that incorporating structural breaks may distort the results but not to the extent of producing different directions of causality. Under the multivariate scheme, the inclusion of structural breaks in variance equations is supported for all cases. In contrary to the CCF, the asymmetric BEKK models identified fewer interactions among the markets while most of them accounted for shock transmissions rather than volatility spillovers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief literature review. Section 3 describes the theoretical background. Section 4 outlines data and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the empirical approach and finally, the last section concludes the text with some concluding remarks.",
73,4,The Japanese Economic Review,31 December 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-020-00063-7,Competition among coalitions in a cournot industry: a validation of the porter hypothesis,October 2022,Luca Lambertini,Giuseppe Pignataro,Alessandro Tampieri,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last two and a half centuries, since the very beginning of the industrial revolution, the bulk of industrial activities and the associated growth of the world economy have relied on brown energy delivered by the intensive exploitation of nonrenewable fossil fuels. It is now widely recognised that, should the economic system continue to go the brown way, the planet would run out of nonrenewable polluting resources in a matter of generations; exactly how many is a matter of opinions and estimates, but compared to the farthest future, it is certainly too small a number. For instance, Meadows et al. (1972) posited the existence of biophysical limits to growth, by predicting, with no changes to historical growth trends at that time, a “sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity” by 2072.Footnote 1 Additionally, future generations would inherit a planet which would be not only depleted of its pristine stock of resource, but heavily and perhaps even irreparably transfigured for the worse by climate change. Therefore, the question is whether a mix of private incentives and public policies may avoid the realization of this scenario. In this paper, we model this interplay to show that there may exist a way of combining profit incentives and policy tools to open up a green production path. The key question is: will a number of energy-intensive industries, or even the whole world economy put itself on a sustainable growth path?Footnote 2 Is there any hope that large populations of profit-seeking corporations will indeed turn themselves “green” as a reaction to a changing landscape, by positively responding to the introduction of new regulatory instruments building up binding limits to the environmental impact of firms’ activities? According to the Porter hypothesis (Porter 1991), we may expect profit-seeking firms to behave like that, expecting to be better off if they do so, under appropriate policy stimuli. Over more than 2 decades, the Porter hypothesis (PH, hereafter)Footnote 3 has generated a lively trend of thought about the existence of promising links between public environmental concern and firms’ green strategies (or the lack thereof). The foundation of this debate asserts the possible existence of positive private returns to pollution control investment, possibly large enough to more than offset the cost of compliance. If this is true, then a win–win solution triggered by environmental regulation and driven by firms’ reaction to it is in fact within reach. The essence of the PH boils down to the idea that strict but flexible environmental regulation encourages innovations enhancing competitiveness and contributing to make firms more profitable, and therefore happy to deliver a socially efficient outcome such as a clean (or at least cleaner) environment, as a by-product of their own private incentives. Porter and van der Linde (1995a, b), in particular, claim that pollution is often a waste of resources. Under certain conditions, reducing the latter may drive an increase in firms’ productivity and profits. Regulations therefore may ultimately help firms by unlocking unexpected profit opportunities.Footnote 4 With this in mind, Porter and van der Linde’s (1995a, b) view privileges market-based instruments (like emission taxes and the costly allocation of pollution rights) rather than command-and-control instruments (like environmental standards). The stream of research generated by Porter and van der Linde (1995a, b) has investigated two different versions of the PH. The weak one claims that firms do respond to environmental regulation by investing in R&D for green (either abatement or replacement) technologies, which in turn may not lead to higher profits. The strong version of the PH says instead that one of the consequences of environmental policy is indeed that of increasing firms’ profit perspectives.Footnote 5 Obviously, the strong version has generated a debate which would not have stemmed out of the weak alternative formulation, the reason being that conventional wisdom has it that, in general, limiting firms’ freedom should ultimately compromise their performance (cf. Palmer et al. 1995). Hence, one could say that, in a way, the effective merit of Porter and van der Linde’s (1995a, b) papers has been that of convincing businessmen (among whom the PH is receiving a growing amount of attention) as well as policy makers about the potentially proficuous nature of environmental regulation. If put into being, the virtuous mechanism embodied in the strong version of the hypothesis would produce a win–win outcome in which both a cleaner environment and a higher financial performance would go hand in hand, as a result of the reciprocal alignment of private (profit) incentives and social (welfare) incentives. A distinctive feature of the PH is that it does not necessarily require any consumers’ environmental awareness, relying primarily on pure profit incentives towards green innovations to neutralise environmental regulation.Footnote 6 The PH is seemingly easier to implement if green consumption is in place. This is crucial to justify the trade-off between costs and benefits rendering the policy acceptable. Interestingly, Constantatos and Herrmann (2011) for instance propose a duopoly model where consumers recognise the green quality of the products only with a time lag. Thus, if regulation does not impose a simultaneous adoption of the eco-friendly technology among companies, a firm unilaterally may lose profits due to higher costs (which represents a direct effect) and reduce market share due to higher product prices (which is a strategic effect). Unlike much of the current literature on environmental issues, including the PH, the present analysis sets aside the assumption of environmental awareness. Our intention is to emphasize the possibility to obtain beneficial impacts from regulation simply due to the spontaneous firms’s reaction to an environmental policy, the latter being not amplified or accompanied by any environmental consciousness on the part of consumers. No variations in demands or information of green technology adoption are needed, and we will assume that the representative consumer is characterised by a concave utility function where there is no room for the environmental impact of either consumption or production. Our point simply rests on the streamlined background idea that competitive pressure intensified by regulation pushes innovation and the resulting mechanism yields a Pareto efficient outcome for firms and society alike.Footnote 7 The extant debate on the PH mostly relies on duopoly models (Ambec and Barla 2006; André et al. 2009; Constantatos and Herrmann 2011; Lambertini and Tampieri 2012; inter alia).Footnote 8 We instead model an oligopolistic Cournot sector in partial equilibrium, where firms individually decide whether to be brown or green and then compete in quantities.Footnote 9 Brown firms are subject to a tax rate on polluting emissions. On the other hand, green firms do not bear any taxes, but incur both a cost of investment in clean technology and a higher marginal production cost. To characterise firms’ choices concerning the nature of their production technology, we resort to a tool borrowed from coalition theory (cf. d’Aspremont et al. 1983; Donsimoni 1985; Donsimoni et al. 1986; Thoron 1998). Using the concepts of internal and external stability of a coalition and assessing the welfare properties of the oligopoly under consideration, we identify the conditions on the two key parameters of the model, the emission tax and the exogenous R&D cost of obtaining the green technology, such that the grand green coalition (1) is stable and (2) generates a win–win solution, thereby yielding a theoretical vindication of the PH in its strong formulation. Additionally, and most importantly, we show that the ex ante socially efficient tax rate is an appropriate incentive for firms to produce the win–win solution when the externality is strong enough. From an empirical perspective, the possibility of systematically testing the emergence of the PH may be limited by several problems affecting the nature of the data as well as their availability. Indeed, regulatory compliance expenditures do not provide a truly exogenous measure of regulatory burden, since the amount of these costs also depends on the adaptability to regulation of an industry. In light of this, Jaffe and Palmer (1997) show the existence of a positive link between R&D expenditures and pollution-abatement costs, as a proxy for the stringency of environmental regulation. Popp (2005) examine the presence of the PH by calibrating a model of induced R&D when the outcome of innovation is uncertain. The strong version of the PH is here supported in some cases. Lanoie et al. (2011) test the significance of the PH using data on environmental policy, research and development, environmental performance, and economic performance. They find strong support for the weak version but no support for the strong version. In a recent work, Rexhäuser and Rammer (2014) show that only innovation processes influencing the resource efficiency of firms have a positive net return. Hence, the PH in its strong version does not hold in general, its emergence depending on the type of environmental innovation applied. This caveat notwithstanding, empirical analysis, and case studies seem to confirm that accurate design of regulatory measures, possibly in a flexible form, may indeed be conducive to win–win solutions (see Majumdar and Marcus 2001; Partzsch 2009; Costa and Ferrao 2010; Costa et al. 2010). The paper also relies on the literature that focusses on the incentives in investing in technological change of pollution abatement (Milliman and Prince 1989).Footnote 10 In particular, Requate and Unold (2003) analyse different policy instruments (taxes, auctioned permits, grandfathering, and emission standards) determining whether one of them gives more incentives to firms to adopt a pollution-abatement technology. Like the present analysis, Requate and Unold (2003) evaluates the conditions under which all firms or no firms will adopt the new technology. The main difference with the present paper is the focus on a competitive market rather than an oligopoly. This allows to ignore market competition and the strategic effect of adopting an environmental friendly technology. In turn, the stability analysis is not necessary, and the proportion of green or brown firms is determined by a comparison of costs which, in case of emission permits, depends on the number of brown firms. Finally, the paper is indirectly related to the debate on international environmental agreements (IEAs), and in particular on its formulation in terms of non-cooperative game-theoretical models.Footnote 11 This literature analyses the stability conditions for countries to be part of the IEA. Even if the context is clearly different, the link is both on the similarity of the theoretical analysis and on the same purpose of finding the conditions for a sustainable economy. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The outline of the setup is in Sect. 2. Section 3 contains the analysis of coalition stability. Section 4 illustrates the necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong formulation of the PH to emerge at equilibrium. Different extensions of the basic setting are proposed in Sect. 5. Concluding remarks follow in Sect. 6.",

They drive technological innovation and create positive economic spillovers (Jaffe 1989; Kantor and Whalley 2014). The demand for a more productive form of university governance exists at any time in any country. In Japan, national universities’ political independence and financial autonomy have been recognized as essential for maintaining academic freedom and effective knowledge creation, since the Empire of Japan established the Imperial UniversitiesFootnote 1 as a vital national institution in the late 19th century. Since then, national universities’ privatization has been repeatedly discussed (Amano 2008). In 2004, all Japanese national universities were partially privatized (incorporated, or Dokuritsu Gyosei Hojinka in Japanese) under the National University Corporation Law and acquired the status of national university corporations.Footnote 2 Therefore, since university reform is economically policy-relevant and historically important for Japan, it is useful to provide a quantitative assessment of whether partial privatization since 2004 was favorable. However, there has been no concerted empirical attempt to investigate the impact of this reform in the literature. The previous literature provides mixed predictions of the direction of this reform’s impact on national universities’ research performance. Aghion et al. (2010) argue that autonomy and competition improve a university’s performance. They also find a positive correlation of university-level autonomy and competition index with performance. As I discuss qualitatively at the crude level in the next section, based on Aghion et al. (2010)’s criteria, partial privatization might have intensified at least some aspects of national universities’ autonomous function. Therefore, Aghion et al. (2010) suggest that this reform could positively impact the national universities’ performance. However, McCormack et al. (2014) predict no significant impact. They highlight a positive correlation between performance and university department-level management scores based on Bloom and Van Reenen (2007)’s interview tool, which considers each department’s use of incentives, target setting, and performance monitoring processes in detail. Since this reform was at the university level and did not consider each department’s unique characteristics and incentives, it might not have directly changed the department-level management index based on the criteria used in McCormack et al. (2014). This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of partial privatization on national university research outcomes, which are aggregated and disaggregated across research fields. Japanese private universities can be viewed as counterfactuals not targeted by such systematic reform for the same period that provides within-country variations in governance/managerial change. Therefore, an identification strategy that utilizes private universities as a control group can be used. Another advantage of this event is that the reform is plausibly considered as an exogenous structural change in national universities. While the privatization of national universities was discussed regularly as a distinct topic, Amano (2008) notes that it is undeniable that the 2004 reform was a by-product of the Koizumi administration’s structural reform, which primarily aimed to privatize public organizations, such as the postal service. The difference-in-differences specifications suggest that partial privatization leads to a deterioration of 16–18% point in the quality and quantity of national universities’ research output, as constructed using publication records in the fields of medical science, biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and economics from 1999 to 2009. The fixed-effect specification, which estimates the effect separately for these six fields, suggests that only medical science is significantly negatively affected. To address identification challenges (i.e., whether this analysis can capture the impact of partial privatization), I conduct several robustness checks and find that the adverse effects are due to the partial privatization. This study’s primary contribution to the literature is that it provides the first evaluation of this reform using an identification strategy based on a quasi-experiment. Since this was the most significant reform in higher education policy after World War II in Japan, quantitatively delineating its consequences on research activity is particularly important for Japanese science policymakers and researchers. This study’s secondary contribution is that it analyzes the relationship between university governance/managerial style change and research performance disaggregated across research fields. A few recent studies, such as Aghion et al. (2010) and McCormack et al. (2014), find positive cross-sectional correlations between university or department-level management/governance and performance in the EU and the UK. These studies do not explore heterogeneity in the correlation among research fields. This study uncovers the heterogeneous impacts across research fields and departments. Therefore, this study provides insight into the interaction between management/governance style change and each research field’s unique characteristics and associated incentives, particularly in medical science. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on the university system in Japan and provides details on the partial privatization of national universities. Section 3 presents the data construction process and identification strategies. Section 4 presents the results of the main analysis and the robustness checks. Section 5 considers potential explanations of the negative effects identified for medical science research. The final section concludes.",2
74,1,The Japanese Economic Review,24 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00083-x,An analysis of altruistic and selfish motivations underlying hometown tax donations in Japan,January 2023,Eiji Yamamura,Yoshiro Tsutsui,Fumio Ohtake,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In Japan, the system of Hometown Tax Donation (hereafter HTD), also known as Furusato Nozei in Japanese, was established in 2008 to revitalize regional economies that were facing the challenges of depopulation and aging. The HTD system was implemented as a means for people to receive tax deductions in return for payment to municipalities and prefectures of their choice. As the name suggests, the HTD program was initially launched bearing in mind people’s attachment toward and nostalgia for their hometowns, and, therefore, it can be considered a large-scale field experiment planned formally as an economic policy. HTD has increasingly permeated throughout Japanese society as can been seen in the data drawn from the Statistical Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication (hereafter MIC), wherein HTD payment totaled approximately 8 billion yen in 2008 and reached 160 billion yen in 2015, showing a 20-fold increase in eight years. Donors can transfer their HTD payments to areas in which they have never resided, and many local governments offer gifts to donors for their donations. However, in reality, instead of financially supporting their local governments, people tend to make donations to pursue self-interested motives (Sato, 2017). Consequently, the HTD has worsened the public finances of many local governments (Hagami, 2017a). There have been extensive arguments about the effective ness of the HTD system by policymakers and researchers (e.g., Bessho, 2017; Hagami, 2017a, 2017b; Sato, 2016a, 2016b). The HTD system enables taxpayers to direct a portion of their taxable income toward a local government of their choice, rather than pay their residential and income taxes directly to the local government of the area in which they reside. In other words, people can send the HTD payment to municipalities other than the ones in which they reside and can receive a tax deduction through this “HTD payment.” Although the HTD functions as a selection system for the payment destination of local tax, the HTD payment amount has little influence on the aggregate revenue of the 1741 local governments. Furthermore, contributors receive local gifts in exchange for their HTD payment. The system incentivizes urban residents to promote income redistribution toward financially poor rural areas and reduce the urban–rural economic inequality. In addition to factors reflecting self-interest, such as tax deductions and gifts, social values and norms are also considered key to enhancing the redistribution policy (e.g., Klor & Shayo, 2010; Luttmer, 2001; Luttmer & Singhal, 2011). After the Great East Japan earthquake (GEJE) of 2011, donating money to the affected areas through the HTD program was viewed as an effective way to help victims of natural disasters. Subsequently, HTD payments toward municipalities that were severely affected by the disaster showed a marked increase (Japan Times 2016; Otake, 2016). This is consistent with Ishino et al. (2012), who claimed that the GEJE prompted an increase in altruism that spurred people to give to charity and in turn to feel happy.Footnote 1 Such altruistic behavior seems more pervasive among those who feel a sense of nostalgia toward these ravaged areas.Footnote 2 Even under ordinary circumstances, altruism is an incentive for the rich to redistribute their wealth to the poor (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Fong, 2001). Various dimensions of social capital, such as social ties, may encourage high-income earners to support income redistribution (Yamamura, 2012). Altruism and social capital are expected to make the HTD system effective. However, the dramatic increase in the popularity of the system during the years does not appear to be driven by a sense of altruism among the citizens toward people living in the remote countryside. Belying the name and the ostensible purpose of the HTD, the system enabled citizens to send money anywhere, much of it directed toward municipalities that offer lavish gifts in return for the donation (Nohara, 2017). Under the HTD system, contributors can purchase gifts at prices lower than the market rates. Thus, the institutional failure of the HTD lies in how it induces a moral hazard. Consequently, the HTD system abuses the culture of charity and, contrary to its initial purpose, may instead deteriorate social capital and interfere with the charitable behavior of supporting an individual’s “hometown” (Sato, 2016a, 2017). GEJE-focused research in behavioral economics has demonstrated that experiencing the disaster affected and altered people’s preferences, such as time discounting, risk aversion, and altruism. Indeed, Hanaoka et al. (2018) found that only people who had experienced the earthquake with a greater intensity became more risk tolerant. Akesaka (2018) found that the present bias tendency increased, although the change in the time discount rate was not statistically significant for those affected by the tsunami. Yamamura et al. (2015) found that the positive correlation between trust and happiness was strengthened among residents in areas affected by the GEJE. Despite increasing policy debates, researchers have not examined the influence of GEJE on the value of payments under the HTD system.Footnote 3 Furthermore, it is unknown how gifts received in return for the HTD payments reduce the payments driven by altruistic motives. Thus, this study attempts to address these issues by examining panel data and cross-section data. The major findings are as follows: the GEJE led to an increase in the amount of money made as payments through the HTD system to local governments of areas that were affected by the disaster. Offering gifts to donors led to a remarkable reduction in altruistically motivated HTD payments, and this detrimental effect was greater in areas in which disaster victims lived. These findings imply that offering gifts changes the norms of altruistic behavior related to the HTD payments. This is consistent with the argument that norms change as a consequence of monetary incentives, which is not in line with the original purpose of the system in encouraging altruistic behavior (Gneezy & Rustichini, 2000a, 2000b). In recent times, tax issues have been analyzed from the perspective of behavioral economics (e.g., Blumenthal et al., 2012; Null, 2010; Slemrod, 2010), and the phenomenon of warm-glow and charitable giving have been analyzed in various experimental settings (e.g., Andreoni, 1989, 1990; Crumpler & Philip, 2008; Eckel & Philip, 2003, 2006). However, systems like the HTD wherein contributors can receive reciprocal gifts have not been introduced in other countries. So far, tax systems accompanied by deductions and gifts have not been analyzed through statistical methods, although a large number of empirical works have dealt with issues relating to tax and charity (e.g., Ackerman & Auten, 2011; Allgood, 2009; Auten et al., 2002; Bakija & Heim, 2011; Cordes, 2012; Duquette, 1999; Greene & McClelland, 2001; Scharf & Smith, 2015; Slemrod, 1989; Tiehen, 2001). Furthermore, except for Brooks (2002) and Ishino et al. (2012), studies analyzing charity and tax issues are limited in countries other than those in the West. This study aims to offer important findings from the perspective of behavioral economics for improving tax policies relating to payment toward Japan's novel HTD system motivated by altruism. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of Japan's HTD system. Section 3 proposes the testable hypotheses. Section 4 explains the data and empirical method used. Section 5 presents the estimation results and their interpretation. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the study.",2

74,1,The Japanese Economic Review,18 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-021-00106-7,Attributes needed for Japan’s central bank digital currency,January 2023,Hiroshi Fujiki,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many central banks, including the Bank of Japan, have begun research on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) following Facebook’s plan in June 2019 to issue a multi-currency coin, which is a digital token linked to a basket of sovereign currencies. The Bank of Japan (2020a) published its approach to CBDC and began Proof of Concept Phase 1 on April 5, 2021, based on Bank of Japan (2020b), which pointed out two technical conditions that make the function of CBDCs similar to cash: universal access and resilience.Footnote 1 To achieve universal access, the terminals for a CBDC should be used by various users. To achieve resilience, a CBDC should have an offline payment function with an upper limit of spending to be resistant to communication and power interruptions, given the high frequency of natural disasters in Japan. The Japanese government also said that it would study CBDCs in cooperation with other countries in its official economic plan (“Honebuto Plan”) on July 17, 2020. One might argue that a CBDC would be widely accepted if these technical issues were resolved. However, consumers and merchants will adopt this means of payment only if it is convenient for them; therefore, the attributes of CBDCs must be compared with cash and other privately issued digital means of payment. Consumers may not use CBDCs too frequently because they do not provide a consumer discount or reward program, unlike credit cards or debit cards. Consumers may not use CBDCs if they involve longer transaction times compared with the other privately issued digital means of payment, because Japanese consumers have been accustomed to contactless prepaid cards, which require only 0.5 s to complete a transaction. Shops may be reluctant to invest in a new terminal that accepts CBDCs, as Japanese banks were reluctant to invest in new ATMs that could accept new bills with a value of 2000 JPY, which were issued to celebrate the G8 summit in Okinawa, Japan in July 2000. Reflecting these negative responses to the 2000 JPY bills by the Japanese banks, these bills are rarely in circulation because they can only be withdrawn from a select number of ATMs. Assuming that shops have the incentive to introduce new terminals that have access to Japanese CBDCs, will Japanese CBDCs prevail in the market, inciting frequent, daily use? A similar question is posed by marketing economists: How can we find a new product that prevails in the market? To answer these questions, marketing economists use a characteristics approach, rather than estimating billions of demand functions for new products, possibly considering the substitutions between the products (see Ackerberg et al., 2007 for details). The characteristics approach first classifies new products by their attributes, such as price, fuel cost, top speed, and the number of seats in the case of a car. This approach is then used to identify the attributes that attract consumers, and finally, to forecast the best-selling product as having many of these attributes without analyzing the demand functions for billions of new products. We follow the characteristics approach and ask the following question: “Which types of attributes should a CBDC have to be widely accepted in Japan?” In the area of payment economics, two studies investigating the attributes of payment methods related to this question have been conducted. First, Borzekowski and Kiser (2008) considered a structural model to analyze the ranking of the use of four payment methods—debit cards, cash, credit cards, and checks—incorporating three product attributes (i.e., the valuation of time, preferences for electronic payment, and the utility of liquid instruments) and consumer demographics, such as age, gender, family structure, and region. They used US data and examined the effects of a decrease in the time needed to complete a debit card transaction on the adoption of debit cards by US citizens as a counterfactual simulation of the introduction of contactless debit cards in the US economy and found that such innovation in debit cards would increase their market share from 21 to 27%. Second, Huynh et al. (2020) considered a structural model to analyze the use of a combination of three payment methods (debit cards, cash, and credit cards) for point of sale (POS) payments by type of transaction (e.g., groceries, gasoline) that incorporates four product attributes (ease of use, affordability of use, security, and transaction costs) together with consumer demographics, such as age, gender, family structure, and region. The authors used Canadian methods of payment survey data to estimate their model and conducted counterfactual simulations of the adoption of CBDCs that had similar characteristics to cash and debit cards, including all of their attractive attributes. They found that CBDCs could be used at the POS with probabilities ranging from 0.19 to 0.25 and that consumer welfare could be improved by 0.60–1.63 CAD per person with significant variation across demographic groups. However, to the best of the present author’s knowledge, no study has been conducted on payment methods based on a characteristics approach such as that used by Borzekowski and Kiser (2008), or its application to the adoption of CBDCs in Japan, as conducted by Huynh et al. (2020). The present paper provides a case study on the adoption of CBDCs in Japan by counterfactual simulations based on a model of ranking the frequency of the use of five payment methods—cash, credit cards, contactless prepaid cards (hereafter referred to as electronic money following the Japanese nickname), branded debit cards, and mobile payments—using smartphone applications (including prepaid or postpaid, quick response (QR) code-based, or mobile wallets for credit cards, debit cards, or electronic money, hereafter referred to as mobile payments) using data from the 2019 Financial Literacy Survey (FLS) that was administered to 25,000 individuals aged 18–79 years in Japan from March 1 to March 20, 2019. Following Borzekowski and Kiser (2008), in addition to consumer demographics, such as income, financial asset holdings, age, gender, educational attainment, occupation, and region, the following four product attributes were incorporated: preference for mobile payments, the utility of credit cards, preference for banknotes, and valuation of time. A ranking of five payment methods was obtained from each respondent based on the frequency of use (“Almost every day,” “About once a week,” “About once a month,” “Scarcely or never,” and “Do not use them”). Many respondents indicated using cash “Almost every day” or “About once a week,” and hence, the top-ranked product was cash, followed by credit cards, electronic money, mobile payments, and debit cards. To investigate the potential adoption of CBDCs, the effect of innovative noncash payment methods, such as contactless electronic money on a mobile phone, was simulated. This involved estimating a rank-ordered logit (ROL) model, a restricted ROL model that used decision weights based on the most preferred alternatives only (top-ranked (TR) model), and a latent class conditional logit model (LCL model) to explain the ranking of the five payment methods conditional on the four attributes and demographic variables. The estimates of these three models are similar and showed that Japanese respondents value shorter payment time, mobile payments, and credit cards and banknotes. The counterfactual simulations using these three model estimates showed that a hypothetical mobile version of noncash payment methods that requires a short transaction time would be highly ranked if it were introduced; however, the adoption of these hypothetical products is not frequent when compared in a sample of all households with zero financial asset holdings as Borzekowski and Kiser (2008) and Huynh et al. (2020) found, and those with experience of financial troubles, such as a bank transfer fraud or multiple debts. In contrast, the adoption of these hypothetical products is frequent when compared in a sample of all households with employment at a public company and with the educational attainment of graduate school. Based on these results, if the Bank of Japan wanted to issue a CBDC that would be used almost every day as a replacement for cash, policy tools should be utilized to encourage its use by households with zero financial asset holdings and those with experience of financial troubles as well. This paper relates to the literature on the choice of payment methods in Japan and abroad. First, regarding Japanese studies on the choice of payment methods using the 2019 FLS, Fujiki (2020a) estimated the demand for crypto assets and crypto asset owners’ demand for other payment methods; however, he did not examine the ranking of the use of payment methods. Fujiki and Tanaka (2018a, 2018b), Fujiki (2019), and Fujiki (2020b) used the two most favored payment methods for day-to-day transactions and a favored payment method for regularly scheduled payments using data from the Survey of Household Finances. These studies focused on the use of cash, credit cards, electronic money, and automatic withdrawals from bank accounts; however, they did not examine the use of branded debit cards or mobile payments. Second, recent studies in foreign economies on the choice of payment methods include Esselink and Hernández (2017) for the Eurozone, Trütsch (2020), Hayashi and Toh (2020), Greene et al. (2017), Koulayev et al. (2016), Schuh and Briglevics (2014), and Borzekowski et al. (2008) for the USA, Huynh et al. (2020), Henry et al. (2018), Wakamori and Welte (2017), and Chen et al. (2017) for Canada, Brown et al. (2020) for Switzerland, and Jonker et al. (2018) for the Netherlands. However, the literature on the choice of payment methods using the characteristics approach since Hirschman’s (1982) study is relatively small, except for Borzekowski and Kiser (2008) and Huynh et al. (2020). While this study is closely related to Borzekowski and Kiser (2008), there are three limitations because of data availability compared with Huynh et al. (2020). First, we could not estimate the ranking of the use of payment methods based on the types and values of transactions conditional on the adoption of the payment methods by merchants because our data only provide the frequency of consumer’s use of five payment methods. Second, we did not examine the use of payment methods conditional on the choice of sets of payment methods because there were numerous combinations of payment methods that could be analyzed. Huynh et al. (2020) focused on three combinations—cash, cash and debit cards, and cash, debit cards, and credit cards. However, we need to consider many combinations of choice of payment methods chosen from the five payment methods to be analyzed. Third, while Huynh et al. (2020) showed that the adoption of a central bank currency depends critically on its adoption by merchants, this paper cannot address this point because the FLS does not provide any information on the use of payment methods by merchants. Apart from the three limitations related to data availability, this paper focuses on the consumers’ adoption of CBDCs and puts aside other important policy issues related to the issuance of CBDCs for merchants and financial service providers. Amamiya (2020) pointed out that while the issuance of CBDCs could contribute to interlinking various types of private digital money, it could also present the risk of crowding out existing private services, such as bank fund transfers, and of suppressing the innovations of private businesses. Moreover, the widespread use of CBDCs could also affect banks’ funding and the function of financial intermediation, including bank lending and relevant transaction information that flows into the central bank. Pichler et al. (2020) also argued that cash cannot be digitalized without being deprived of its characteristics as an inclusive, crisis-proof, and anonymous means of payment. These important issues are not addressed in this paper. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and methodology. Section 3 reports the results of the estimation. Section 4 reports the results of the counterfactual simulations. Section 5 reports the results using other computational methods to estimate the ROL model and the TR model, and the effects of changing the time needed to make payment by cash. Section 6 concludes.",1

Due to the lockdown policy, also known as “stay-at-home orders,” people have not been permitted to leave the house with the exception of getting daily exercise, going grocery shopping, and making “essential” trips. Thus, to do their shopping while avoiding possible COVID-19 infection, consumers started to purchase items online. As a result, the EC market has been growing dramatically all over the world. For example, in Japan in 2020, sales in the three largest EC markets (Rakuten, Amazon, and Yahoo) rose by 7% in January, 13% in February, and 14% in March from the same month the preceding year, according to a report by Nint, Inc. Specifically, EC sales of medical products (e.g., masks) have exploded. This explosive growth of EC markets can be observed globally. According to eMarketer, while worldwide retail sales are expected to decrease by 3% in 2020, retail EC sales are predicted to increase by 28%. EC business is expected to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on international trade. Online shopping is not limited to domestic transactions. It is also possible in international transactions, known as cross-border EC. While staying at home, consumers can order various products including imported items. Therefore, if the EC market develops in a country, the negative impact of COVID-19 on import demand will decrease in that country. In addition, EC enables firms to conduct business-to-business (B2B) transactions online and search for new suppliers and customers despite supply chain disruption. Thus, without traveling abroad or attending international business exhibitions, firms may discover new business partners online. This B2B EC scheme is expected to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on export supply. In short, EC business will play a key role in international trade during this pandemic period. This study aims to empirically investigate the role of EC on the trade impacts of COVID-19. Due to a lack of reliable data on international transactions via EC, we examine how the harmful effects of COVID-19 on trade differ depending on the availability of EC. To this end, we estimate gravity equations for bilateral trade among 34 reporting countries and their 145 partner countries during the period of January–August in 2019 and 2020. We introduce two kinds of variables in our estimation. One captures the extent of COVID-19’s damage (e.g., the number of deaths) in exporting and importing countries. The estimated coefficient for this variable indicates the average effect of COVID-19’s damage on international trade. The other is an interaction term of the COVID-19 variable with the variable indicating the development of EC business in the respective country. For the latter variable, we use the readiness of EC business, which indicates how prepared an economy is to support online shopping. The coefficient for this interaction term shows how such EC business readiness in each country changes the effect of COVID-19’s damage on trade. Our major findings can be summarized as follows. A higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths in both importing and exporting countries significantly decrease international trade. However, we found that EC development mitigates this negative effect of COVID-19 on trade in importing countries while it does not do so in exporting countries. These results are robust for our use of multiple measures of EC development. The insignificant contribution of exporters’ EC may indicate that exporters have not adopted EC business and that it may take some time before they can use EC for international transactions. This contrast between exporting and importing countries may indicate that cross-border business-to-consumer (B2C) EC business is more developed and widely used than cross-border B2B EC business. The number of studies on EC is growing in not only the management science literature but also in the field of economics. Anson et al. (2019) investigated exchange rate pass-through in online shopping. The influence of distance or virtual proximity on cross-border EC has been examined by Hortaçsu et al. (2009), Gomez-Herrera et al. (2014), Hellmanzik et al. (2015), and Lendle et al. (2016).Footnote 1 These studies consistently found that geographical distance mattered not only in offline transactions but also in online transactions. Chang and Meyerhoefer (2021) examined the effect of COVID-19 on online food shopping in Taiwan. They discovered that an additional confirmed case of COVID-19 increased online sales by 5.7% and the number of online customers by 4.9%. This finding indirectly supports our expectation that online shopping mitigates the negative effect of COVID-19 on international trade. Our study is also related to the literature on the international trade–COVID-19 nexus. Fuchs et al. (2020) empirically investigated whether previous economic linkages established through trade and investment as well as political relations were associated with China’s export pattern of critical medical goods. Hayakawa and Mukunoki (2021a, 2021b, 2021c) investigated the effects of COVID-19 on worldwide trade. Like Chang and Meyerhoefer (2021), Hayakawa and Mukunoki (2021a, 2021c) examined how the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in addition to that of COVID-19 deaths affected international trade or global value chains. Hayakawa and Mukunoki (2021b) also investigated if the existence of lockdown policies, such as stay-at-home and workplace-closing orders, reduced international trade by employing monthly trade data. These studies established the negative effects of COVID-19, particularly in exporting countries. Against this backdrop, we empirically investigate how EC businesses change such negative effects of COVID-19. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes our conceptual framework regarding the relationship between COVID-19’s effects on trade and EC. After explaining the empirical framework used to examine this relationship in Sect. 3, we report our estimation results in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",11

The gains from business transactions, both domestic and international, and employment relationships are generated and divided among relevant parties by voluntary agreements. Why do trading parties need a contract? The main economic “rationale for contracting is to lock in a commitment ex ante that one or both parties would otherwise not wish to honor ex post... The use of a contract to establish such commitment is undermined,..., if the contract will not be enforced in the way the parties anticipate (Hermalin, Katz, & Craswell, 2007, p. 99).” And the definition in the dictionary given above suggests that the enforcement of contracts is usually expected to be provided by courts. As Djankov et al., (2003, p. 454) argue and convincingly show, economists “have been generally most optimistic about courts as the institution securing property and enforcing contracts.” Textbook economic theories of contracts assume that (i) legal enforcement is all-or-nothing—while contractual terms contingent on verifiable states and actions are perfectly enforced by courts, those contingent on unverifiable states or actions are never enforced by courts; and (ii) the verifiability of actions or states is exogenously given. Although research based on these assumptions has contributed to our understanding of optimal contracts, they are also extreme. Judicial enforcement depends on contract law and courts’ discretion (they fill gaps, interpret terms, supply default remedies, replace contractual terms with their terms, and so on), the parties’ ex post costly action (e.g., submit evidence), and parties’ ex ante costly contracting (e.g., costs of thinking of future contingencies and specifying events, actions, transfers, and other terms into written documents) Past years economists in the field of contracts and organizations attempted to relax the standard but extreme assumptions and incorporated some of these features into formal analysis. For example, Krasa & Villamil (2000), Ishiguro (2002), and Bull & Watson (2004) study ex post costly verification and obtain conditions for state-contingent transfers or actions to be implemented along with appropriate evidence disclosure. Shavell (2006), Anderlini et al. (2007, 2013), and Schwartz & Watson (2013) study active courts who may decide when to uphold a contract and when to void it, as well as interpret the contract and change the parties’ obligations. These papers have shown that the courts’ expertise and behavior significantly affect the contracting parities’ ex ante behavior as well as their welfare. The economic literature on costly contracting has introduced ex ante costs of either thinking ahead about contingencies (Bolton & Faure-Grimaud, 2010; Tirole, 2009) or writing contracts (Dye, 1985; Anderlini & Felli, 1994, 1999; Battigalli & Maggi, 2002; Schwartz & Watson, 2004). While increasing ex ante costs raises the likelihood of learning states, contingencies, obligations, and legal enforcement, the optimal contract is typically incomplete (endogenous incomplete contracts). Contracts can be enforced not only by judicial ordering but also by private ordering, such as relational contracting under long-term, ongoing relationships. The parties abide by the agreements voluntarily if a certain condition (the self-enforcing condition or the dynamic enforcement condition) is satisfied.Footnote 2 Such an informal enforcement mechanism is important in developing or transition economies where legal protections are limited or unreliable (Dixit, 2004), but it is also prevalent in economies with well-developed legal systems (Djankov et al., 2003; Macaulay, 1963). A classic paper Macaulay (1963, p. 60) argues that even in the US, “the opportunity for good faith disputes during the life of the exchange relationship often is present.” Hence law suits are rare and disputes are frequently settled without reference to the written documents. “The upshot is that private ordering is central to the performance of an economy whatever the conditions of lawfulness (Williamson 2005, p. 2).” Formal contracts (in the sense of those judicially enforced) still play a role when informal relational enforcement mechanisms are at work. Baker et al. (1994), Schmidt & Schnitzer (1995), Pearce & Stacchetti (1998), Bernheim & Whinston (1998), and Itoh & Morita (2015) analyze under what conditions formal contracts and relational contracts become complements in the sense that the self-enforcing condition is easier to satisfy along with formal contracts than without them. While in these studies writing a formal contract is costless and hence its legal enforceability is exogenously determined, Sobel (2006), Battigalli & Maggi (2008), and Kvaløy & Olsen (2009) have demonstrated that formal contracts and relational contracts can co-exist when more costly contracts are more detailed and more likely to be legally enforced. What if costly contracts are not legally enforceable? Is there any reason to write such a contract? The focus of this paper is to explore the potential functions of ex ante costly contracting beyond the realm of legal enforcement. An influential article by a legal scholar Llewellyn (1931) in fact argues that “official aid on the contract side consists most commonly not in what we know as enforcement but rather in an official declaration—or merely official recognition...—that an obligation is owed and forfeit (p. 711).” According to him, the main role of legal contracts is to provide an adjustable framework that “almost never accurately indicates real working relations, but which affords a rough indication around which such relations vary, an occasional guide in cases of doubt, and a norm of ultimate appeal when the relations cease in fact to work (p. 737).” Writing a contract that is not legally enforceable is not an unrealistic possibility. In fact, Macaulay (1963, p. 60) highlights several instances where parties have written contracts that are not legally enforceable, despite his emphasis on non-contractual business relationships: ..., it is likely that businessmen are least concerned about planning their transactions so that they are legally enforceable contracts. For example, in Wisconsin requirements contracts—contracts to supply a firm’s requirements of an item rather than a definite quantity—probably are not legally enforceable. Seven people interviewed reported that their firms regularly used requirements contracts...None thought that the lack of legal sanction made any difference...Three of these people were house counsel who know the Wisconsin law before being interviewed. Another example of a lack of desire for legal sanctions is found in the relationship between automobile manufacturers and their suppliers of parts. The manufacturers draft a carefully planned agreement, but one which is so designed that the supplier will have only minimal, if any, legal rights against the manufacturers. The standard contract used by manufacturers of paper to sell to magazine publishers has a pricing clause which is probably sufficiently vague to make the contract legally unenforceable. The house counsel of one of the largest paper producers said that everyone in the industry is aware of this because of a leading New York case concerning the contract, but that no one cares. Goldberg (2008) argues that the manufacturing agreement in the 1919 contract between Fisher Body and General Motors, which is one of the best-known contractual provisions in the field of organizational economics (Klein et al., 1978; Klein, 1988), was legally unenforceable. Nothing precluded Fisher from selling some, or all, of its body production to Ford (p. 1076). ... That is, if Fisher is free not to supply auto bodies if it so decides, then GM, despite the specific promises made in the contract, has no obligations; it is free to buy auto bodies from other suppliers (p. 1078). 
Goldberg (2008) further points out that their counsel should have known when drafting the agreement that it would not be enforceable. He concludes by suggesting that “the unenforceable agreements can be effective...If, as I suspect, such agreements are fairly common, any serious theory of the organization of economic activity will have to take this mechanism into account. (p. 1082)” While I find no quantitative study of legally unenforceable contracts beyond specific case studies, Ryall & Sampson (2009, p. 923) state, based on their analysis of a sample of more than fifty joint technology development contracts in telecommunications and microelectronics industries that “some contracts are entirely unenforceable in a court of law because the partners waive their rights to court adjudication of disputes.” Why write contracts that are not legally enforceable is an important question because recent legal studies literature shows a trend towards more detailed ex ante contracts, whose roles are somewhat independent of legal enforcement. They propose new concepts such as scaffolding (Bozovic & Hadfield, 2016), managerial contract provisions (Bernstein & Peterson, 2022), and formal relational contracts (Frydlinger et al., 2019, 2021; Frydlinger & Hart, 2022).Footnote 3 The common thread running through these concepts corresponds to the statement made by Ryall & Sampson (2009, p. 923): “partners who deal with each other repeatedly may find it worthwhile to write a detailed agreement,..., not due to their usefulness in court, but instead, their usefulness in maintaining a smoothly functioning relational contract.” In Sect. 2, I explain three concepts and demonstrate that all three indicate the importance of initial contracts in mitigating the clarity problem identified by Gibbons & Henderson (2012). The clarity problem refers to the need for parties in a long-term relationship to establish a shared understanding of the terms of the relational contract, in addition to making promises credible, to build and refine effective relational contracts. The three concepts also suggest that ex ante contracting reduces ex post renegotiation costs, or that the more detailed the initial contract is, the more aligned the parties’ interests become. Motivated by these studies, in Sect. 3, I present a simple two-period model of costly ex ante contracting based on the “moral hazard in teams” model of communication by Dewatripont & Tirole (2005).Footnote 4 The parties exert costly efforts that jointly determine the probability that they will succeed in incorporating detailed terms (scaffolding, managerial provisions, or formal relational contracting process) into an initial contract. I study three roles that the contract plays ex post, namely improvement in clarity, improvement in congruence of interests, and reduction in renegotiation costs, at the time when problems arise. I show that the parties’ efforts for ex ante contracting are not monotonic in their alignment of interests. When their interests are not sufficiently congruent, they are motivated to write a contract to avoid unconditional termination of the relationship. However, if their alignment of interests is beyond a threshold, they no longer bother to spend resources on ex ante contracting. This result holds even if the alignment itself rises or the cost of ex post renegotiation is reduced by an increase in effort for ex ante contracting. The model and analysis are preliminary because I take a reduced-form approach and ignore the enforcement issue of the contract. Note, however, that costly ex ante contracting in my model is independent of court enforceability and hence can be distinguished from existing literature analyzing the effects of writing costs on relational contracts (Sobel, 2006; Battigalli & Maggi, 2008; Kvaløy & Olsen, 2009). The literature on costly contracting that studies the costs of thinking ahead about contingencies (Bolton & Faure-Grimaud, 2010; Tirole, 2009) is more related because, in their models as well as in mine, spending more resources ex ante increases the likelihood of learning the true state when there occurs an irregular event. However, their focuses are different from mine. The main focus of Bolton & Faure-Grimaud (2010) is satisficing contracts where the parties do not waste time resolving all future contingencies and instead leave many decisions to be determined later, and their dynamics toward more detailed contracts. In their model, there is no cognitive effort, and the only cost of thinking arises from the discount factor. Tirole (2009) mainly studies ex ante planning and ex post holdup due to asymmetric information. Neither of them features the “moral hazard in teams” problem in contracting. In Sect. 4, I discuss the contracting practices of Japanese manufacturers. Since the seminal works by Asanuma (1989, 1992), the long-term relationships between Japanese manufacturers and their suppliers in the electronics and automobile industries have been extensively studied. A remarkable feature of these relationships is that their contracts are simple and highly incomplete, and this feature appears to persist to this day. In this section, I provide several reasons for the limited changes in contracting practices, particularly the equilibrium explanation based on my analysis. Section 5 concludes the paper.",

Then how can an analyst predict strategic behavior when he is almost certain about players’ payoff functions? Kajii and Morris (1997) formalized this question and proposed the notion of robust equilibrium as an equilibrium of a complete information game such that every “nearby” incomplete information game has at least one equilibrium that induces an action distribution close to the original equilibrium. In this definition, a “nearby” incomplete information game refers to a game where with high probability, all players know that their own payoff functions are given by those of the complete information game. Kajii and Morris (1997) showed that if a complete information game has a unique correlated equilibrium or a \(\textbf{p}\)-dominant equilibrium with \(\sum _{i\in I} p_i < 1\), then it is robust. Subsequent papers provided sufficient conditions for robustness in terms of potential maximizer (Ui, 2001) and generalized/monotone potential maximizer (Morris and Ui, 2005); Oyama and Takahashi (2020) showed the converse of the latter result in generic binary-action supermodular games.Footnote 1 In this paper, we propose the notion of strict robustness by adopting a larger class of “nearby” incomplete information games than Kajii and Morris (1997), where with high probability, all players believe that their payoffs are close to, but may be different from, those of the complete information game.Footnote 2 This class of incomplete information games arises naturally if the analyst assigns high probability on a given profile of payoff functions, but he allows for the possibility that players may not know their own payoff functions exactly. We then establish strict counterparts of the existing results on robustness (with appropriate modifications whenever necessary). More specifically, we show that if the complete information game has a unique correlated equilibrium, it is the unique strictly robust equilibrium; a strict monotone potential maximizer is strictly robust if either the game or the associated strict monotone potential is supermodular; and finally, a strictly robust equilibrium must be a strict monotone potential maximizer in all binary-action supermodular games. Our results for strict robustness are closely analogous to those for robustness in the sense of Kajii and Morris (1997). We think that strict robustness may be more natural than Kajii-Morris’ robustness. However, our main reason for pursuing the results in this paper is that the strict robustness notion connects more cleanly with other work. Indeed, the present study stemmed from our previous study (Morris et al., 2022) on (smallest equilibrium or full) implementation by information design in games, which built in part on the literature on higher order beliefs in general and incomplete information robustness in particular. The robustness question has a metaphorical interpretation, that behind the scene, there is an “adversarial” information designer that tries to design an information structure such that all the equilibrium outcomes thereof are bounded away from the analyst’s prediction about the players’ behavior; loosely speaking, the prediction is strictly robust only if the information designer is unable to design such an information structure. In the Appendix, we formalize this argument and, more generally, document the implications of the results in Morris et al. (2022) to strict robustness. In the context of information design, it is natural to allow the information designer to construct information structures in which players do not necessarily know their own payoffs; thus, our definitions of “nearby” incomplete information games and hence of strict robustness are compatible with information design problems.",

74,3,The Japanese Economic Review,02 June 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42973-023-00133-6,Overcoming problems of coordination and freeriding in a game with multiple public goods: dynamic contribution with information provision,July 2023,Ai Takeuchi,Erika Seki,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Many social services and individual contributions to them can be modeled as a game with multiple public goods with diminishing marginal returns. Motivating examples include volunteer service, charitable giving, and crowdfunding. When a serious natural disaster occurs, many volunteers are solicited to assist victims in different locations. Often, in such cases, too many volunteers gather at the same time in one location, hindering effective volunteer activities. Additionally, the excess supply of volunteers in one location may cause a shortage of volunteers in another location that also needs support. This example illustrates that when there are various services that require a sufficient number of contributions, it is important not only to have enough contributions in total but also to allocate them according to the needs of each service. This example also illustrates that when each service faces diminishing marginal returns from contributions there are twin problems of coordination failure and freeriding. Coordination failure results in wasting valuable contributions, as excess volunteers may end up being redundant and inactive when they could otherwise be effective in other locations that have insufficient volunteers. This possibility and the experience of having their contributions wasted may discourage prosocial individuals from contributing in future. Thus, it is important to overcome the problem of coordination failure to make the best use of prosocial behavior in providing various services. Hitherto, among numerous studies on public goods games (see, for example, Ledyard, 1995, Croson, 2010), only a few studies have analyzed cases of multiple public goods. Cherry and Dickinson (2008), Bernasconi et al. (2009), and Chan and Wolk (2020) considered a game with multiple linear public goods and found that individuals contribute more in total when there are multiple linear public goods than when there is only a single linear public good. In the multiple linear public goods game they studied, only freeriding problems can arise. The closest studies to our research that examine coordination failure and freeriding are Corazzini et al. (2015; 2020). They used a multiple threshold public goods game and studied how to enhance efficiency by improving coordination. In the multiple threshold public goods game, the possibility of both freeriding and coordination failure is inherent. However, the type of coordination required is different from that in our motivating examples. In the game studied in Corazzini et al. (2015; 2020), the endowments of individuals were limited, so for the efficient provision of public goods, individuals were required to coordinate and concentrate their contribution in one public good to reach its threshold. In their study and other studies on coordination games (e.g.,Van Huyck et al., 1990), coordination requires players to choose the same action to achieve social efficiency. In contrast, in the motivating examples we consider, coordination requires individuals to distribute their contributions among different public goods.Footnote 1 The coordination issue of this study resembles the choice of different routes by commuters studied in Selten et al. (2007). The present study aims to investigate systems of information provision that will facilitate coordination and enhance contributions in multiple public goods game with diminishing marginal returns. Takeuchi and Seki (2023) considered the same problem, focusing on the fact that information about needs—what level of contribution is needed—is often not provided in motivating example cases, and analyzed whether the provision of information on needs improves efficiency. They found that providing information on needs improves coordination but exacerbates the freeriding problem, especially when the needs are small. They argued that this could be due to fear of wasting one’s contribution by contributing beyond what is needed. To reduce the fear of wasting one’s contribution and to increase contributions, the experiment in the current study provides additional information about the contributions made by others by allowing for dynamic contributions with real-time updates. With respect to the dynamic system of giving, inspired by Schelling (1960)’s suggestion of a dynamic system of soliciting donations,Footnote 2 there are a growing number of experimental studies on voluntary contribution mechanisms (VCMs) with decision making in sequential or dynamic (real-time) settings (see Vesterlund, 2015 for a comprehensive survey of the theoretical and experimental literature). A study by Bracha et al. (2011) suggested that allowing for dynamic contributions may enhance coordination. Bracha et al. (2011) compared a single threshold public good game in sequential and simultaneous protocols, varying the size of the threshold value. In addition, they used a piecewise linear cost function that yields the interior Nash equilibrium and interior Pareto optimal outcome even when the threshold is zero (i.e., there is no threshold). When the threshold is high so that no one is willing to contribute up to the threshold alone and the contributions must be made simultaneously, coordination is required to contribute beyond the threshold. They found that in such cases, average public good provision is higher with sequential protocols than with simultaneous protocols. They suggested that the sequential protocol reduces strategic uncertainty about whether other members will cover the rest of the threshold, thereby facilitating coordination (p. 421). Additionally, Deck and Nikiforakis (2012) found, using the minimum-effort game, that the real-time decision-making protocol in which all participants’ chosen actions are monitored yields high efficiency, as it removes strategic uncertainty and enhances coordination. Studies using public goods games with real-time decision-making protocols suggest that dynamic contribution increases cooperation. In these games, there is a given time interval in which individuals can modify their contribution while observing how the other group members are contributing. The final contribution made when the time limit is reached determines the final outcome of the game.Footnote 3 Dorsey (1992) studied different forms of payoff functions and contribution-modification rules to see how these affect contribution behavior. Kurzban et al. (2001) used a single linear public goods game with a real-time decision-making protocol and found two factors that enhanced the average contribution: allowing individuals to make only upward revisions of their contributions during the time interval and providing only the lowest individual contribution in the group as real-time feedback information. Ishii and Kurzban (2008) found similar evidence using a student sample in Japan. Goren et al. (2003) studied the real-time provision of a single public good with a threshold for its provision. Based on the analysis of contribution timings in each period, they found that the timings of public good provision remained the same across periods without a tendency of delay. They concluded that the real-time protocol prevented the decaying trend of the average contribution usually observed in other studies with simultaneous protocols. Given these findings, we adopt a dynamic contribution scheme with a real-time protocol as in Kurzban et al. (2001) and Goren et al. (2003): each player makes irrevocable contribution decisions during a given time interval and receives real-time updates on the contribution decisions made by the other group members. We study whether, under this scheme, the provision of information about needs will enhance coordination and contributions in the multiple public goods game with diminishing marginal return. To be able to analyze the effects of providing information on needs, this study employs, with small modifications, the model of Takeuchi and Seki (2023), which introduces a threshold of effective contribution for each public good. Any contribution equal to or below the threshold is “effective”, returning a constant marginal return for each unit contributed, while any contribution above the threshold is wasteful, returning a marginal return of zero. The threshold resembles the needs of the number of volunteers in the motivating example. We manipulate the information of the needs by making the value of the threshold unknown to the individuals (henceforth, the partial information condition) or known to the individuals (henceforth, the full information condition).Footnote 4 To provide benchmark predictions for the experiment, we analyze the game as a static game under three assumptions regarding the preferences of the players: all players are selfish, maximizing their own payoffs; all players are prosocial, maximizing the sum of the payoffs of all the players; some members are selfish and others are prosocial, and the preference types of the members are known. When all players are selfish, the two information conditions yield the same outcome, as freeriding is a Nash equilibrium strategy. In the other two cases, the sum of contributions in the equilibrium will be equal or higher in the partial information condition, but the efficiency will be higher in the full information condition. The summary of the experimental results is as follows. First, the prediction regarding the sum of contributions was not rejected: The average contribution rates that were unconditional on the values of the thresholds were not significantly different between the two information conditions. The prediction of efficiency was supported. Individuals in the full information condition increased their contribution levels with the values of the thresholds, yielding higher efficiency. However, an anomaly was observed in the full information treatment when the sum of the thresholds of the public goods was low. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and theoretical predictions. Section 3 describes the experimental design and procedures. Section 4 analyzes the contribution rates and efficiency under the two information conditions and discusses the possible interpretations of subjects’ behavior under the full information condition. Section 5 includes the discussion and conclusion of the paper. The Appendix includes full proofs of the propositions and additional tables.",

Since activists in the Western countries began to raise concerns about working conditions in developing countries, many multinational retailers have requested manufacturers in the developing to comply with international labor standards (Locke, 2013; Elliot & Richard, 2003). Empirical evidence suggests that some manufacturers follow these requests when they trade with global buyers, making substantial changes in working conditions and welfare of workers (Harrison & Scorse, 2010; Boudreau, 2021; Tanaka, 2020; Alfaro et al., 2022). For these manufacturers, achieving high labor standards and maintaining cost competitiveness in global markets may be considered as a tradeoff if they are not rewarded for pursuing better labor conditions. However, our understanding of the extent to which they are rewarded is limited because of a scarcity of data combining firms’ labor standards and trade transactions. In this study, I empirically investigate whether and how exporting manufacturers in a developing country are rewarded for providing workers with better working conditions. I combine data on apparel manufacturers in Myanmar from two sources. The first is primary survey data on firms’ working conditions, which measures the degree of compliance with international labor standards on fire safety, occupational health practices, and the freedom of association as well as wages and working hours. The second is Myanmar customs data on the export and import transactions of apparel manufacturers. Matching the two datasets by firm names, I examine whether a firm’s working conditions are associated with its export prices, revenue in the destination, and revenue share across destinations. To guide my empirical analysis, I propose a simple model of a firm’s exporting and output decisions based on its working conditions. The model predicts that firms with better working conditions sell products at higher prices due to their higher marginal costs. The model also predicts that if consumers in the foreign country highly value working conditions in production, firms with better working conditions are more likely to earn higher revenue from that market than firms that export to the same market with worse working conditions, thereby they are more likely to choose to export to that market. I find three sets of empirical results consistent with the theoretical predictions. First, export prices are positively correlated with working conditions even after controlling for detailed commodity fixed effects, input prices, and firms’ characteristics including management practices, foreign ownership, and employment size. Second, firms providing better working conditions on average earn higher revenue from exporting to a country in Europe, North America, and Oceania (Western countries hereafter) than other firms exporting to those markets.Footnote 1 However, no such relationship is observed for exporting to Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea, suggesting that rewards for complying with labor standards differ across markets. This evidence is consistent with the corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature that firms in Western countries tend to conduct more CSR practices than those in Asian countries, for potentially various reasons including differences in consumers’ attitudes (Kane et al., 2017; Chambers et al., 2003). It is also consistent with the view that anti-sweatshop movements at the grassroots level are more prevalent in Western countries than in Asia. Third, firms with better working conditions tend to have a higher proportion of sales from exports to Western countries than other firms. This study is built on three strands of the literature. First, it is related to the body of research on why companies engage in CSR, particularly the enforcement of labor standards in developing countries. The key mechanism considered in the literature is enforcement through global supply chains in contrast to governments’ enforcement through laws and regulations. Here, consumers and investors pressure retailers to monitor labor standards in supplier factories in developing countries. This mechanism is called “private voluntary regulation” (Locke, 2013). Several recent studies document cases in which a form of private voluntary regulation actually improves working conditions in developing countries (Harrison & Scorse, 2010; Boudreau, 2021; Oka, 2010; Alfaro et al., 2022). One key assumption for private voluntary regulation to work is that consumers’ demand is affected by information on labor standards in production (Locke, 2013). Several empirical studies in the CSR literature show that consumers’ demand is indeed affected by labels indicating ethical production. Hainmueller et al. (2015) conduct an experiment to study the effect of the fair trade labeling of coffee products in U.S. grocery chains and find that such labeling increases sales. Hiscox et al. (2011) study the effect of information on certified fair labor standards in factories making polo shirts in the eBay marketplace and find a significant positive effect on bidding. Elfenbein et al. (2012) also examine the eBay marketplace and find that young and inexperienced sellers benefit from donating to charity, implying that such an action provides a degree of quality assurance to consumers. In the present study, instead of exploring how consumers react to ethical production, I examine the extent to which the demand of retailers and wholesalers in the supply chain is determined by the ethical production of their suppliers using information on prices and trade transactions in the customs data. In brief, this study investigates whether the benefits of socially responsible practices accrued by sellers are passed down to the suppliers in local factories that mostly incurred the cost of such practices. Second, this study is built on the social science and management literature that examines whether CSR improves firm performance.Footnote 2 Based on a meta-analysis of empirical studies that examine the link between CSR and firm performance, Margolis et al. (2009) report that the correlation between CSR and firms’ financial performance is positive but small. Flammer (2015) uses a regression discontinuity design exploiting proposals that marginally passed or failed the shareholder vote and finds that such close-call CSR proposals increase financial performance. A recent study by Alfaro et al. (2022) finds that multinationals’ enforcement of responsible sourcing standards reduced their suppliers’ sales and employment, due to increased labor-related costs.Footnote 3 Most closely related to this study, Distelhorst and Locke (2018) use panel data on transactions between retailers in developed countries and suppliers in developing countries and show that improving compliance increases annual purchasing, implying that retailers reward suppliers for complying with labor standards. They also find that this effect principally arises in the apparel industry, which has been the target of the anti-sweatshop movement. The present study contributes to this stream of the literature by providing new evidence from trade data in Myanmar. In particular, it shows that the link between compliance with labor standards and manufacturers’ export revenue is positive only for exports to Western regions, but not for exports to Asia. This finding suggests that the rewards from complying with labor standards can differ between destination markets. In addition, this study shows the relationship between export prices and working conditions and provides a trade model supporting these results. Third, this study is related to international trade studies of the quality differentiation across firms and destinations. These studies typically consider models featuring complementarity between input quality and firm productivity or capacity, which is the only source of exogenous firm heterogeneity (Verhoogen, 2008; Kugler & Verhoogen, 2012; Manova & Zhang, 2012; Johson, 2012). In such models, high productivity firms sort themselves into producing high-quality products for consumers who value such products. These studies examine the model predictions and find consistent correlations between input prices (material prices and labor costs), export performance (export revenue and prices), and sorting across markets. Most closely related to this study, Verhoogen (2008) considers a model with an efficiency wage in which more productive firms pay higher wages to produce higher quality goods to be sold in high-income countries and finds consistent evidence using data on Mexican manufacturers. This strand of the literature is related to this study if input quality is affected by the labor standards or working conditions in the factory, as implied by efficiency wage theory. In this study, I similarly present a trade model and empirically examine the relationships between working conditions and export performance and destinations.Footnote 4 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model that guides my empirical analysis. Section 3 explains the data and Sect. 4 describes the empirical results. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Sect. 5.",

Akerlof (1970) points out that, even if there exist positive gains of trade, no trade may occur in equilibrium; Samuelson (1984) shows that such a no-trade outcome is the only incentive-feasible allocation (under certain parameter conditions). However, there is accumulating evidence that some buyers are behavioral in that they may make suboptimal decisions.Footnote 1 In the context of adverse selection, such behavioral agents may improve social surplus. Consider an environment in which an informed seller trades with an uninformed buyer (Akerlof, 1970; Samuelson, 1984). Eyster and Rabin (2005) develop the model in which the uninformed buyer exhibits a particular kind of inferential naivety (called “cursedness”) — a “cursed” player fails to correctly infer other players’ private information from their actions. Even when the no-trade outcome is the only incentive-feasible allocation in the classical model, Eyster and Rabin (2005) show that the seller can potentially trade with the cursed buyer. While the trade generates positive surplus, the cursed buyer himself makes a loss (in terms of his “actual” payoff). Murooka and Yamashita (2022) extend this setting by allowing the buyer to be either the cursed type or the standard Bayesian-rational type, and show that both types may be able to trade (even though the rational buyer never trades in the absence of the cursed buyer). By definition, the rational type enjoys a non-negative expected payoff, while, as in Eyster and Rabin (2005), the cursed type makes a loss. This paper investigates whether the above phenomenon is specific to a particular type of naivety (i.e., cursedness) or it is applicable to broader settings. To answer this question, we consider adverse selection with general types of behavioral biases. The only assumption is that some buyer types may take actions that do not necessarily optimize their actual payoffs; this encompasses virtually any type of bias including subjective probability, framing effects, model misspecification, random errors, and inferential naivety. Our main result is as follows. Consider an adverse-selection environment where only the no-trade outcome is possible for rational agents. We show that, if any non-trivial trade is made under a mechanism that is incentive compatible for the informed seller, then the buyer’s ex-ante expected payoff (i.e., the buyer’s expected payoff before realizing his own type) must be negative, no matter how the buyer behaves in the mechanism. As a corollary, because rational buyers always earn non-negative expected payoffs, some behavioral buyers necessarily make negative expected payoffs in the mechanism. On the one hand, this is an impossibility result: In the adverse-selection environment, even though some trade may occur with behavioral types, it must be at the cost of their losses. In other words, only a no-trade mechanism yields a non-negative expected payoff for every type of buyer. On the other hand, in some situations, society may be tolerant of some losses of buyer (as long as it is not too large), if it is associated with a larger social surplus. Indeed, even under severe adverse selection, Murooka and Yamashita (2022) obtain incentive-feasible mechanisms where both rational and naive buyers trade, attaining a strictly higher social surplus under certain conditions. Thus, our result highlights a new trade-off between the social surplus and the payoff losses of behavioral buyers.",
