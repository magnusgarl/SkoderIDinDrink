The standards for diesel trucks under the regulation were more relaxed than those for gasoline vehicles, and the tax rate for diesel fuel was lower than that for gasoline (Hibiki and Arimura 2005). Furthermore, a lack of sufficient transportation infrastructure due to urbanization and motorization also made it hard to attain the recommended environmental air quality at road-side air pollution stations in metropolitan areas. As a result, in the 1990s, strong emphasis was placed on reducing concentrations of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM)Footnote 2 in these areas. In response to the situation, the government of Japan and some municipality governments separately introduced different countermeasures against NOx and PM. In July 1992, the government of Japan introduced a new unique regulation titled the “Automobile NOx Law”, which restricted the use of old dirty diesel trucks in the Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan areas (this category of regulation is called “vehicle-type regulation” or VTR). The VTR requires use of dirty old vehicles to cease earlier than usual, setting terminal years.Footnote 3 However, it was pointed out that the effect of the regulation was limited, and in July 2001 the law was amended into the “Automobile NOx-PM Law” to make the regulation more effective (Sano 2008). The amended law regulated more areas and vehicles than the previous law, but still used the same regulatory method. After 2000, several municipality governments around Tokyo began to address the issue of air pollution from automobiles independently from the government of Japan. Initially, the “Tokyo Metropolitan Environmental Security Ordinance”, which mitigated PM concentration, was approved at the council of Tokyo municipality in December 2000. The ordinance required old diesel trucks to use diesel particulate filters (DPFs), a new emission control technology (Lopez et al. 2009). Trucks without DPFs installed were prohibited from operating in the Tokyo municipality. This category of regulation is known as “operational regulation” (OR). Following the example of the Tokyo municipality, the same regulations were approved for the Tokyo region, that is, the neighboring municipalities (Saitama, Kanagawa, and Chiba), between 2001 and 2002. Consequently, the OR started simultaneously in these municipalities in October 2003. Regulators have several feasible policy options to reduce air pollution from automobiles, including command-and-control or taxes on dirty fuel and vehicles (subsidies on clean ones). Policies such as the famous corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)Footnote 4 in the United States and the VUR in Japan are traditionally implemented to promote technologies for pollution control or fuel efficiency control for new vehicles. Therefore, many studies examine the effects of the CAFE. For example, Goldberg (1998) shows that the CAFE standard in 1989 generated a US$201 million loss on automakers and saved 400 million gallons because of incentives to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. From a long-term point of view, Kleit (2004) and Austin and Dinan (2005) revealed that increases in the CAFE standards were less cost effective than increases in the gasoline tax. On the contrary, there are few policies to control emissions from old existing vehicles around the world. Because old vehicles are dirtier than new vehicles thanks to technological innovation, it is important for regulators to pay attention to not only new vehicles but also to old ones. The Japanese VTR and OR are examples of ways of addressing the air pollution problem arising from old vehicles. Dill (2004) showed that the accelerated vehicle retirement program introduced in California reduced air pollution. Lumbreras et al. (2008) estimated emissions including NOx and PM in Madrid from 2004 to 2010 under several scenarios, and they concluded that the fleet renewal scenario is more efficient than others. These studies may show the effectiveness of VTR-type regulation. Although the methods of the VTR and OR are unique, the government of Japan and municipality governments did not conduct any ex ante policy evaluations on their regulations before passing the legislation. Arimura and Iwata (2008) conducted a cost–benefit analysis on the VTR and showed that the VTR generated a positive net benefit to the order of 51.7 billion yen. Iwata and Arimura (2009) expanded on the evaluation model of Arimura and Iwata (2008) and also concluded that the VTR is a valid policy for improving social welfare because the net benefit is positive. In addition, in solving an optimal problem to maximize the social net benefit, they revealed that the net benefit can increase by 104% if the regulator chooses optimal terminal years. As for the OR, there is no evidence from a cost–benefit analysis, similar to that of Arimura and Iwata (2008) and Iwata and Arimura (2009). Therefore, it has not been proven that the benefit of the OR would be more than the cost. Using cost–benefit analysis from an economic perspective, the goals of this article are to quantitatively reveal both the costs and benefits of the regulation and to examine whether it is a valid clean-air environmental policy. In addition, we present implications for future policymaking against air pollution from automobiles to obtain further social welfare with comparisons between cost efficiencies of the VTR and OR. The organization of this article is as follows: Sect. 2 explains in detail the differences between the OR and VTR. Sections 3 and 4 provide the models for calculating the cost and benefit of the OR, respectively. Section 5 presents the result of the cost–benefit analysis. A robustness check of the result is examined in Sect. 6, and Sect. 7 presents the conclusions.",2

Regmi,Shinya Hanaoka,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The recent frequent occurrence of extreme weather events in Asia provides some evidence of increased intensity and frequency of climate events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report predicts that Asia will experience rises in temperature, longer summer heat spells, more intense and more frequent precipitation, increased extreme rainfall, a higher number of extreme tropical cyclones, and rises in sea levels (Christensen et al. 2007). Road transport will be affected by these climate events. Increases in temperature and precipitation, rises in sea levels, and storm surges will have significant impacts on planning, design, construction and maintenance, and operation of road transport (Wooller 2003). Road transport is not only affected by these climate events, but also contributes to global warming through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from road vehicles. Road transport contributes about 75% of GHG emissions that originate from transport operations (IPCC 2007). The transport sector accounts for 23% of global CO2 emissions. Asia accounted for 19% of total transport sector CO2 emissions in 2006, and is expected to increase to 31% by 2030 [International Energy Agency (IEA) 2008a]. Road transport consumed 79% of the total fuel used in the transport sector within the Asia and Pacific region in 2006 (IEA 2008b). In 2007, the transport sector in Asia and the Pacific emitted 1642 million tons of CO2, with 1323 million tons coming from road use, compared with 1972 million tons in North America and 1050 million tons in Europe. The 2007 CO2 emissions of the transport sector grew by about 4.4% in Asia and the Pacific compared with 2006 (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 2010). Road transport is the predominant mode of transport in Asia and carries a substantial share of freight and passenger volume. There are many initiatives in place to reduce road transport emissions such as a modal shift from road transport to less emission-intensive railway transport, innovations in vehicle design, use of new nonfossil fuels, and promotion of public transport. Despite these efforts, it is predicted that road transport will continue to play a major role in transportation (Savelsberg 2008). The amount of fuel consumed per vehicle kilometer travelled largely depends on the geometry and condition of the road surface. Good road and pavement surfaces help to impart uniform speed and improve the efficiency of vehicle operation. In contrast, bad or rough road surfaces make road transport more difficult, uncomfortable, and inefficient and also lead to higher fuel consumption per vehicle kilometer and more emissions. A study in China has shown decreased fuel efficiency with increased pavement roughness [Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Ministry of Transport 2009]. Therefore, well-planned and well-designed roads with good infrastructure and pavement surfaces would improve the efficiency of road transport operations and contribute toward a reduction in overall vehicle emissions. In moving toward this goal, robust road infrastructure that can withstand the anticipated impacts of climate events should be developed. Policymakers and designers should consider planning, designing, and constructing roads carefully and give priority to adaptation measures. Despite the recent uninspiring Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, the issue of climate change remains high on the global and national agendas.Footnote 1 Countries are continuing voluntarily to hold discussions on policy options to reduce emissions and limit the increase in global temperature to <2°C. Most climate change studies focus on mitigation and discuss ways to reduce GHG and CO2 emissions (Collantes and Gallagher 2009; Dalkmann and Brannigan 2007; Schipper et al. 2009). However, limited studies are available in the area of climate change and adaptation in the transport sector in Asia. Therefore, there is a need to study the potential impacts of climate change on road transport and to integrate climate change considerations in national transport policies and research and development (IPCC 2007). This study addresses this need. The adaptation policies and measures to be implemented depend on the intensity and frequency of climate events, the scale of impacts, and location and topography. Asian counties are vulnerable to different types of climate impacts in accordance with their geographic locations. The coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia, and the Pacific are vulnerable to sea level rises, cyclones, and storms. Mitigation and adaptation should go hand in hand. Despite global efforts to reduce GHG emissions, climate change events are inevitable and will continue to impact on the transport system. Adaptation should be linked to initiatives for disaster risk reduction and management. Adaptation is very important because many Asian countries are still developing their transport infrastructure. It is easier to introduce and consider climate impacts at the planning stage rather than after the system is complete. Some of the climate events and their impacts are sudden and localized, so risk analysis and vulnerability analyses are necessary to develop adaptation strategies. Current environmental impact-assessment (EIA) guidelines only consider the impacts of project activities on the environment, whereas the reverse analysis of the impact of the environment and climate change on project infrastructure receives little attention [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2005]. In this context, this study assesses the impacts of climate change on road transport in Asia through a review of literature and a survey of the perceptions of policymakers. Various road infrastructure components that are vulnerable to climate events are identified and adaptation strategies to plan, design, and develop sustainable and more resilient road infrastructure are outlined.",24
13.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,08 January 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-010-0003-x,Emission quota versus emission tax in a mixed duopoly,January 2011,Kazuhiko Kato,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Confronted with environmental problems, governments often use taxes, standards, and quotas to restrict emission, which is regarded as an unpaid factor in Meade (1952). As Pigou (1920) points out, by using taxes that equalize marginal social cost, social optimal allocation can be realized. Until the 1980s, many works, for example, Barnett (1980) and Baumol and Oates (1988), investigated the effects of environmental regulations in a competitive market and a monopoly. Since then, these have been analyzed in an imperfect competitive market.Footnote 1
 The research focus so far has been on the following two types of environmental regulations: command-and-control regulations, such as emission standards and emission quotas, and market-based instruments, such as the emission tax and tradable emission permits. These investigations have tried to establish which type of regulation is desirable in terms of social welfare. With regard to these comparisons in a closed economy, the earlier works are of two types. One involves the uncertainty associated with the marginal abatement cost and the marginal environmental damage, which is analyzed by Weitzman (1974), Adar and Griffin (1976), Fishelson (1976), and Stavins (1996). The other focuses on the market structures with certainty.Footnote 2 Our study follows the latter type. First, we mention the results of some earlier works under a competitive market. Spulber (1985) examines the emission tax and emission standards in a long-run equilibrium setting and shows that the social optimum is not realized with emission standards, while the emission tax does lead to it. Kiyono and Okuno-Fujiwara (2003) compare the three environmental regulations—the emission tax, emission quota, and tax-equivalent emission standards—and show that the social optimum is realized with the emission tax and quota but not with tax-equivalent emission standards. Next, we mention the results of previous works on oligopoly markets with a quantity competition.Footnote 3 Lahiri and Ono (2007) investigate relative emission standards and the emission tax in an oligopoly and show that a relative emission standard is superior to an emission-equivalent emission tax in terms of social welfare when the number of firms is fixed, and that the results can be opposite when free entry and exit are considered.Footnote 4 As shown in these earlier works, whether the command-and-control regulation is superior to market-based instruments depends on the situation. The 21st century has witnessed studies on environmental regulations in a new situation—mixed oligopoly, where a public firm whose objective is to maximize social welfare competes with private firms whose objectives are to maximize its profits in the same market. Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2006) and Beladi and Chao (2006) consider the emission tax in the domestic market, while Ohori (2006a, b) consider the same in the international market. Kato (2006) investigates tradable emission permits and Naito and Ogawa (2009) compare emission standards with the emission tax. Wang and Wang (2009) examine whether privatization worsens welfare in a duopoly with product differentiation under the emission tax. The emergence of these works is linked to the fact that the concerns with regard to the environmental problems have been growing in both developed and developing countries, where mixed oligopoly is quite common.Footnote 5
 This study investigates welfare comparisons under command-and-control regulations and market-based instruments, especially the emission tax and emission quotas in a mixed duopoly and those in a pure duopoly, which refers to a case in which the public firm is privatized. Furthermore, we consider two cases under each environmental regulation: a differentiated and uniform regulation level. The following situation is considered. Both firms produce a homogeneous product and have the same production and abatement technology. Emissions are generated in the production process. When the game starts, the government chooses the level of regulation. Following this, each firm simultaneously chooses its levels of output and abatement. We show that welfare is greatest under differentiated emission quotas and that the superiority of the emission tax over a uniform emission quota depends on the parameters of the cost functions. We also show that privatization always worsens welfare. The work most related to this article is Naito and Ogawa (2009). They examine the effects of an emission tax and an emission standard in a mixed duopoly. In the emission standard considered in their study, the government sets a uniform abatement effort for each firm.Footnote 6 They show that welfare under the emission standard is larger than that under an emission tax, regardless of the degree of partial privatization. This paper is organized as follows. The next section describes our model. Sections 3 and 4 derive the equilibrium outcome under an emission tax and an emission quota in a mixed duopoly, and in Sect. 5, in a pure duopoly. Section 6 compares the equilibrium outcomes of these environmental regulations. Section 7 discusses the model and results of this study and compares them with those of previous studies. Section 8 concludes the main text. The appendix provides the proofs of the propositions.",20

With an increase in the number of multinational enterprises (MNEs), governments have implemented trade policies, such as export subsidies and import tariffs, as well as foreign investment policies such as foreign direct investment (FDI). At the same time, there has been a huge concern that developing countries will enact weak environmental regulations to attract “dirty” foreign investments and increase their competitive advantage in the world economy (the pollution haven hypothesis). Due to the influx of dirty firms, some governments might impose restrictions on foreign-invested firms to preserve the environment.
Footnote 1 The main purpose of this study is to consider the relationship between market-opening and environmental policies. There is a vast body of literature on the relationship between market-opening and environmental policies. Most of the earlier studies assumed no strategic interaction between firms and focused on market-opening policies such as export subsidies and import tariffs.
Footnote 2 In the 1990s, however, the research focus shifted to the strategic relationship between firms or governments, location decisions of MNEs, and FDI. The following is a selection of related theoretical studies. Motta and Thisse (1994) and Rauscher (1995) analyzed location decisions and the stringency of environmental policies. They found that the optimal environmental policy is one that is less stringent, implying that strategic environmental policies lead to a “race to the bottom”. De Santis and Stähler (2008) considered the relationship between FDI and strategic environmental taxes for two countries with trade costs. Kayalica and Lahiri (2005) suggested that lax standards might be called for under the free entry and exit of foreign firms. After comparison of the results of the above-mentioned theoretical literature, it seems very difficult to find empirical evidence on this subject. Eskeland and Harrison (2003) and Levinson (1996) found that the results of the interaction between location choice and environmental regulations in host countries are not robust. List and Co (2000) analyzed the effects of environmental policy on FDI in US jurisdictions. They found evidence indicating that stringent environmental policies decrease FDI inflows. Waldkirch and Gopinath (2008) demonstrated a positive relationship between FDI and sulfur dioxide emissions in Mexico. After accounting for the host country corruption, Smarzynska Javorcik and Wei (2004) showed that there is no correlation between weaker environmental policies and FDI in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union. Cole et al. (2006) studied the effects of FDI on environmental policy, taking into account the corruptibility of local governments. They found that FDI resulted in more stringent environmental policies when local governments were less corruptible. Dean et al. (2009) investigated the stringency of environmental regulations and FDI in China. They found that while investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were attracted by weak environmental regulations, some foreign investors from high-income countries were not. Most research on FDI and the environment involves capital mobility at trade flows and the relocation patterns of plants. However, it is broadly viewed that MNEs often form joint ventures with local firms and control them when entering markets in a host country. In response to the increasing trend of “globalization”, the governments of some countries, such as Belarus, China, Malaysia, and Russia, have not allowed MNEs to have their own subsidiaries, and they set upper limits for foreign ownership.
Footnote 3 Interestingly, regulations on foreign ownership have been imposed on highly polluting industries such as the automobile, chemical, energy, mining, and steel industries. Such regulation of foreign ownership can affect the environment directly or indirectly. Therefore, regulation of foreign ownership is relevant to the stringency in environmental policy. This study examines the interaction between foreign ownership regulation and environmental policy when the product market is characterized by imperfect competition. In other words, the study examines whether weaker environmental policies can be used as instruments to increase domestic welfare when considering the foreign ownership restrictions on domestic firms. We also compare the effects of environmental standards and taxes under imperfect competition in the presence or absence of foreign ownership regulation. Thus, the present study aims to determine the most desirable combination of foreign ownership and environmental policy measures. Developing countries that introduce foreign ownership regulations establish environmental standards instead of taxes although economists prefer market-based instruments to command and control.
Footnote 4 Furthermore, industries that emit enormous amounts of pollutants are often imperfectly competitive. Therefore, it is meaningful to consider the effects of different pollution control instruments under imperfect competition while taking into account the regulation of foreign ownership. In order to address this question, we build a simple model of an oligopolistic market characterized by local independent and partner firms. The results derived in this study are as follows: first, complete foreign ownership decreases welfare under both types of environmental regulation. Second, the equilibrium environmental standards become more severe and environmental tax rates decrease as the number of domestic firms, which are owned solely by domestic investors, increases. Third, the combination of foreign ownership restrictions and a lax environmental tax is the most desirable option for increasing welfare. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the model. Sections 3 and 4 derive the optimal environmental standards and taxes, respectively. Section 5 compares two environmental policies in terms of welfare. Section 6 summarizes the study and presents the conclusions.",2
13.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,21 January 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-010-0005-8,Optimal emission tax with pre-existing distortions,June 2011,Arwin Pang,Daigee Shaw,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It has been suggested by Pigou (1920) that when externalities are present in an economy, a direct tax on waste can internalize external social damage and correct inefficiencies in the competitive allocation of resources. The optimal environmental tax rate is set to be equal to the marginal environmental damage, which is the well-known Pigovian principle. However, many analyses, either partial equilibrium or general equilibrium, focus on how the optimal environmental tax rate deviates from the Pigovian principle in a second-best setting. On the one hand, partial equilibrium analyses where such deviation takes place include those of Lee and Misiolek (1986) and Oates (1993). In taking the non-environmental benefit generated by pollution taxation into consideration, Lee and Misiolek (1986) found that the efficient tax rate may be higher or lower than the Pigovian tax rate depending on the tax elasticity of emission demand. Oates (1993) found that the optimal environmental tax rate must diverge from the Pigovian rate by an amount equal to the reduced excess burden from other taxes under an optimal taxation model. On the other hand, Sandmo (1975) first used a general equilibrium model to integrate the theory of optimal taxation with the analysis of the use of indirect taxation to counter negative external effects and found that the optimal tax rate on the externality-creating commodity was a weighted average of the Ramsey component (the inverse elasticity) and the Pigovian component (the marginal environmental damage). Bovenberg and van der Ploeg (1994) integrated environmental externalities and the optimal provision of the public good in terms of the natural environment, and also concluded that the optimal dirty tax rate was the weighted sum of an externality correction term and a revenue-raising term. Bovenberg and de Mooij (1994) further argued that the second-best optimal environmental tax rate was lower than the marginal pollution damage if the interaction effect between environmental taxes and pre-existing taxes in the green tax reform was considered. Since then, this result, which contrasts with the intuition whereby the second-best optimal environmental tax rate is higher than the marginal pollution damage, has been widely discussed. See the summary by Goodstein (2003). There are four problems with the literature on the general equilibrium analysis of optimal environmental taxation. First, the literature uses an obsolete tax base for environmental tax in its models. The environmental tax base used is the dirty commodity that produces pollution. This method of taxing dirty commodities follows Pigou’s tradition (1920) of taxing quantities of production. We surmise that the reason behind Pigou’s choice of taxing dirty commodities was that there were no abatement technologies or abatement activities available in the 1920s and the only way to reduce emissions at that time was to reduce the production of dirty commodities. Thus, the relationship between dirty commodities and emissions was fixed at one to one. However, due to the progress in abatement technologies, this fixed relationship has changed since the 1960s. Nowadays, emissions can be reduced not only by reducing the production of dirty commodities, but also by investing in abatement activities. Thus, the present literature in environmental economics usually models the size of the externalities as a function of the quantities of dirty commodities and the inputs in pollution abatement, and uses emissions as the tax base for the environmental taxes.Footnote 1 Second, pollution abatement activities are usually ignored in the literature simply for the same reason. Third, most countries subsidize their pollution abatement activities, for instance by providing investment tax credits for firms’ abatement investment expenditures in order to stimulate investment on abatement activities and thereby foster economic growth. Fourth, the prior literature reveals the interests in this problem, but only in numerical models. Each study (Goulder et al. 1997, 1999) has a numerically solved model with abatement spending to simulate the effect of a tax on emissions, whereas their analytical model does not have abatement spending and still focuses on the effect of a tax on the polluting goods. It is for these reasons that a model that takes into consideration the taxing of emissions as well as abatement activities may be more realistic and may also be more meaningful. This paper contributes to the analytical literature in two respects. First, we extend earlier analytical work on optimal environmental taxation in a general equilibrium model by taxing emissions. Second, in our model we consider the abatement activities that are devoted to reducing emissions. In addition, these abatement activities are assumed to be subsidized. The purpose of this paper is to examine the optimal second-best emission tax rate as well as the welfare effects under the condition of tax revenue neutrality in tax systems. Contrary to the previous literature, we first find that when the tax base consists of emissions, the “Ramsey” formula is different from the traditional one. Second, contrary to Bovenberg and de Mooij (1994), the optimal second-best environmental tax rate will be lower than the first-best Pigovian tax rate when the labor tax rate is low, and will be higher than the first-best Pigovian tax rate when the labor tax rate is very high under the homogeneous and separable utility function. In Sect. 2, we present our model. In Sect. 3, we analyze the optimal second-best emission tax rate and the welfare effects of the green tax reform in the two tax systems. Section 4 concludes the paper.",13

The railway sector claims a low environmental burden in its service provision compared to air transport. However, at the stage of infrastructure construction (i.e., constructing tracks and stations), the rail sector produces a lot more carbon dioxide (CO2) than the aviation sector. In turn, air transport emits several times more CO2 during operations on a per-passenger basis, but it does not require extensive infrastructure construction. Thus, determining which of these two transport services is more socially efficient is a rather complex task if life-cycle CO2 emission is taken into account. This paper quantitatively answers this essentially empirical question by conducting a social efficiency benchmarking analysis, where the difference between desirable and undesirable outputs is explicitly incorporated into the model. This study considers three major railway companies and the aviation sector in Japan for the data period from 1999 to 2007. Included variables are passenger volume and distance as desirable outputs; life-cycle CO2 emission amount as undesirable output; labor, capital, and other inputs as transport sector inputs; and in-vehicle time as user cost. In our data set, life-cycle CO2 consists of three parts: those due to infrastructure construction, aircraft and rolling stock construction, and operation. We apply two nonparametric efficiency-measurement methods to this data set: one is a slacks-based inefficiency measurement method, while another is more conventional directional distance function approach. Our results show that, contrary to the common belief, air transport can still be socially efficient even when the environmental damage due to CO2 emission is included in the analysis. The reasoning behind this rather counterintuitive result is that the aviation sector incurs extremely low user costs as measured in terms of in-vehicle time. In other words, aviation is a necessary transportation mode for those with a very high willingness to pay for their time. Social efficiency benchmarking has been performed in the transportation sector as well as in other areas. Chung et al. (1997) applied the directional distance function approach to production relationships involving goods and bads (see review by Managi et al. 2005; Managi and Kaneko 2006). Atkinson and Dorfman (2005) treated the undesirable output as a technology shifter and utilized an input distance function. Pathomsiri et al. (2008) employed a directional output distance function of data envelopment analysis (DEA) by adapting the framework to incorporate the delays associated with airport operations. However, this specification has at least two weaknesses. One is that it does not incorporate the reduction in inputs. The other is that reductions in input and output slacks are not incorporated, because standard directional distance functions are radial inefficiency measures. In order to cope with this problem, the slacks-based measure due to Tone (2001) or equivalently the enhanced Russell measure can be used. However, this kind of measure does not have direct relationships with directional distance functions. Therefore, we use a directional slacks-based inefficiency (SBI; see Fukuyama and Weber 2009, 2010) measure which has a direct relationship with the directional technology distance function. The direct relationship can be quantified as a bias defined by the difference between SBI and the directional technology distance function, as the value of SBI is no less than that of the directional technology distance function. To date, the idea of slacks-based measures has not been incorporated into social efficiency benchmarking. SBI captures the inefficiency due to a biased utilization of inputs or an unbalanced mix of outputs in order to generate more realistic inefficiency measurement results, which conventional nonparametric methodologies often fail to provide. In view of the fact that research results can critically depend on the choice of estimation methodology, the present paper is pioneering in that it adopts the slacks-based methodology to measure the social efficiency of transportation service production, which is an update of Fujimoto et al. (2010). We expect to enhance the robustness of our estimation. In the following section we introduce our model of estimation. Section 3 presents the data. In Sect. 4, we discuss the estimation results. Finally, Sect. 5 provides a conclusion to this work.",47

A standard finding in the economic analysis of global pollution (Hoel 1991; Welsch 1993; Barrett 1994; Copeland and Taylor 2005; Finus and Maus 2008, among many others) is that optimal emission response functions are downward-sloping: if one country or group of countries raises (reduces) its emissions, the optimal response for other countries is to reduce (raise) their emissions (see Hoel 1991 for an early statement). Unilateral emission reduction by one or a few countries will therefore trigger an increase in other countries’ emissions, a phenomenon referred to as emission leakage (Felder and Rutherford 1993; Babiker 2005; Di Maria and van der Werf 2008). In this paper we extend the standard model of global pollution by incorporating a country’s adaptation capability, which allows the country to protect itself against the damage from global pollution (IPCC 1996; Stern 2006). We find that the availability of an adaptation technology can result in upward-sloping optimal response functions for emissions, the existence of which will reverse the leakage phenomenon and may facilitate efforts to reduce the global emission level. Moreover, we demonstrate that the sign of the slopes does not affect the existence and stability of an emission equilibrium. Recently, some economics papers have addressed the roles of emission reductions (mitigation) and adaptation in global pollution problems (Kane and Shogren 2000; Ingham et al. 2005, 2007; Barrett 2008), but, to our knowledge, none of the existing literature has investigated the implications of adaptation capabilities for optimal response functions in global pollution problems.Footnote 1

An early approach to the crucial role of the groups’ role emanates from Truman (1951), but the development of the literature on groups starts with Olson’s (1965) book. I distinguish between two main categories of groups: for-profit groups (e.g. industrial groups) and not-for-profit groups (e.g. environmental groups). I focus on the non-profit groups and specifically on environmental groups, which here will be referred to as Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (ENGOs). The environmental groups are part of a larger category known as interests groups (Moe 1980; Svendsen 1999; Walker 1983) as well as pressure groups (Becker 1983; Castles 1967; Rawcliffe 1998). In order to separate the environmental groups from a plethora of non-governmental organisations, we followed the United Nations’ Handbook on Non-Profit Institutions in the System of National Accounts.Footnote 1 According to the Handbook, the environmental groups belong to Group 5 (p. 95) and are categorised according to the next taxonomic classification. Pollution abatement and control These are organisations that promote clean air, clean water, reducing and preventing noise pollution, radiation control, treatment of hazardous wastes and toxic substances, solid waste management and recycling programmes. Natural resources conservation and protection These organisation focus on conservation and preservation of natural resources, including land, water, energy and plant resources for the general use and enjoyment of the public. Environmental beautification and open spaces These organisations focus on botanical gardens, arboreta, horticultural programmes and landscape services; organisations promoting anti-litter campaigns; programmes to preserve  parks, green spaces and open spaces in urban or rural areas; and city and highway beautification programmes. Animal protection and welfare Animal protection and welfare services include animal shelters and humane societies. Wildlife preservation and protection These organisations focus on wildlife preservation and protection, including sanctuaries and refuges. Veterinary services These organisations focus on animal hospitals and services providing care to farm and household animals and pets. However, another possible classification could be according to the groups’ size or according to the geographical limits of the groups’ actions. For example, we could have local, regional, national, European, or international and global environmental groups. Historically the environmental groups characterise the new era of a social movements for the protection of the environment (Dunlap and Mertig 1992). The activist organisations transfer information to consumers about the profitable companies’ methods (Feddersen and Gilligan 2001)Footnote 2 and the environmental groups, through the lobbyists, create an important communication channel that connects the government with the group and the members (Ainsworth and Sened 1993).Footnote 3 Hence, the presence and longevity of the ENGOs are very important for the quality of social and political life. Since the beginning of the environmental movement until today, new elements have characterised the ENGOs’ strategies. As Bosso (2003) states, “these organisations have simply adapted themselves to their external conditions—including the scope and potency of their opposition—in order to survive and fight another day”. Following on from Bosso’s statement, this study presents some external conditions that influence the environmentalists’ contemporary strategies and decisions. I focus on the environmental groups’ behaviour and specifically on their motivations and targets. Furthermore, I analyse the members’ obvious and non-obvious objectives, and how these could be connected with or influence the group’s aims. Besides, the similarities between a nonprofit firm and a nonprofit environmental group allow for a connection to be made between the two approaches (nonprofit firms and not-for-profit groups) simultaneously with a deeper analysis of the ENGO’s motivations and targets that, at some point, differ from the non-profit firms’ aims. It is generally accepted that a central feature of environmental group’s actions is altruism. Environmentalists are trying to protect the atmosphere, the quality of the water (sea, lakes and rivers), the forests, biodiversity (in the sea and on the land), etc. In the economic literature this behaviour is known as altruistic. A group of people are willing to sacrifice something (time, money, effort, etc.) for the improvement of the public welfare. In the case of environmental protection, all citizens gain from the benefits of better environmental quality even if only the environmentalists fight for this cause. However, according to Baron (2003, p. 50) the activists may have more than the obvious targets: “Some activists may have as their objective protecting the environment and securing human rights. They may also want to attract new members and contributions. They may also have the objective of becoming the leader of a broader movement or simply obtaining and exercising power”. From this, a number of questions emerge concerning the behaviour and the motivations of the environmental non-profit groups or ENGOs. Specifically: Is the environmental defence the only motivation for environmental groups? Are there any other motivations? If yes, are the other motivations altruistic? How do these motivations affect the environmentalists’ behaviour, priorities, aims and decisions? The purpose of this article is to investigate the above issues. The scope of this paper includes understanding the function, maintenance, strategy and targets of the environmental non-profit groups as well as the characteristics of the group managers’ decisions and to provide a more general picture for groups and members. It is hypothesised that the answers to the above questions could characterise the nature of the ENGOs’ objectives. From a fundamental viewpoint, the aim of this study is to revisit and analyse the existing theory about ENGOs as well as about the group’s behaviour in collective issues. Furthermore, in order to present an overall picture of the groups and members’ behaviour, I collect, connect and report studies from different sciences such as political science, behavioural science and sociology with interdisciplinary characteristics. In the next section the environmental groups and members’ motivations, targets and behaviour are analysed following and connecting evidence from the literature. Finally, some general conclusions are made in Sect. 3.",7

Such policies are today applied in a majority of OECD countries (e.g., Australian Government 2009; EU Commission 2008; Wiser et al. 2007). An EU member since 2004, Poland generated in 2006 60.8% of its electricity from hard coal, 34.9% from brown coal, 1.7% from natural gas, and 2.6% from renewable energy sources (RES) (URE 2007a).Footnote 1 In October 2005, Poland introduced a TGC scheme. The scheme shall enable the country to comply with the indicative target of a 7.5% RES contribution to gross electricity consumption by 2010 agreed upon in its EU accession treaty (European Parliament 2003). The target translates into a 10.4% RES quota of total electricity generation for that year. At the same time, Poland has been part of the EU emissions trading scheme since its start in 2005. Despite the obvious potential importance of support policies for the deployment of RES technologies for a country on the economic level and for its environmental and energy policies, their justification has, interestingly, hardly been discussed in the scientific literature. This discussion seems particularly relevant when a country with little previous experience of RES technologies, such as Poland, commits to such a policy. However, the Polish TGC scheme has not received much attention in the scientific literature yet.Footnote 2 We analyze the Polish TGC scheme with regard to its economic functioning, and its justification with reference to overcoming typical barriers for renewable-technology deployment. Such barriers may arise, for example, on legal, institutional, technological, and social levels or pertain to infrastructure and funding. Overcoming these barriers may justify the application of a TGC scheme, beyond a first- or second-best reasoning, on politically pragmatic grounds. From an environmental-economics perspective, the justification of RES support policies is not immediate, if an emissions trading system (ETS) that fully covers the energy industry is in place. According to basic welfare economics, every policy intervention (unless directly enhancing social welfare) needs a market failure as its basis; and every market failure requires, in general, one policy instrument which should mitigate the distortion in question without increasing another distortion (Ng 2004; Stiglitz 2000). The release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, for example, constitutes a market failure because many are likely to suffer from the consequences of climate change, while, without regulation, emitters lack an economic incentive to reduce emissions. In an idealized world, with perfect information, perfect competition, and no market failure other than the emissions externality, a cap-and-trade system for GHG emission permits or a GHG emission tax provides a first-best response of environmental policy allowing full internalization of the externality. If a first-best instrument, in this sense, is unavailable, second-best instruments may be used to mitigate the distortionary effect of a market failure.Footnote 3 Feed-in tariffs for green electricity and TGC-based quota obligation schemes constitute examples of possible second-best instruments of environmental policy. While not immediately responding to a market failure, expanded RES use will, in the absence of other environmental policy, mitigate GHG emissions by substitution of conventional fossil energy sources. An ETS, however, caps the emissions from the covered sectors irrespective of the generation portfolio. In this situation, expanded RES use can hardly further mitigate the related emissions externality. It rather tends to lead to excessive power generation costs, power prices, and rents to green-electricity generators.Footnote 4 Moreover, a negative distortion of the carbon price alleviates abatement pressure from polluting technologies. Of course, in the real world, the emissions externality is not the only distortion in an economy, and existing ETS are far from perfect. For example, as opposed to the ideal of a unique carbon price that is applied to all GHG emissions, the EU ETS only covers certain industrial sectors. Also, it is open to debate whether the emissions cap, and thus the carbon price, meet their socially desirable levels. It is therefore important to ask which additional role RES support policies should play in the policy mix that is to sustain the transition to a low-emissions economy. One common idea in this regard is that the expansion of RES use can help technology producers to exploit learning-curve effects.Footnote 5 In a more dynamic view, inducing expanded RES use in the present may, furthermore, facilitate later tightening of the emissions cap. These further important features, which relate directly to technology production or the political economy of the transition process, are beyond the scope of the present study. We rather focus on the aspect of overcoming barriers for renewable-technology deployment through RES support policies, and consider the available evidence from the recent Polish case. Apart from numerous studies on regional systems, the literature on TGC schemes has compared their effectiveness and efficiency with those of feed-in tariffs (e.g., Finon 2006; Finon and Menanteau 2004; Finon and Perez 2007; Menanteau et al. 2003; Palmer and Butraw 2005).Footnote 6 The interaction with an ETS has been analyzed (e.g., Amundsen and Mortensen 2001; Del Rio 2007; Gillenwater 2008b; Jensen and Skytte 2003; Morthorst 2001). Further contributions have focused on particular aspects, such as the relationship between wind supply volatility and TGC price (Lemming 2003), certificate banking and TGC price volatility (Amundsen et al. 2006), and the role of long-term contracts for TGC-market efficiency (Kildegaard 2008). None of these contributions treats the justification question as a particular issue. Deployment barriers have also been considered, e.g., by Neuhoff (2005), Neuhoff and Twomey (2008), and Sorrell and Sijm (2003), and in OPTRES (2007) and Sorrell (2003). The paper proceeds in three steps. Section 2 describes the Polish TGC scheme and its development in the recent past and near future with a focus on its economic functioning. In Sect. 3, we analyze the current conditions for wind-power investments in Poland based on a cash-flow model. The aim is to derive an indication of the effectiveness of the support scheme. (Data for an econometric analysis are not yet available.) We compare the two options of market sale of both green power and TGC and of a bilateral contract between generator and distributor that specifies the prices of both. In Sect. 4, we discuss, in view of the findings of Sects. 2 and 3, how overcoming barriers for RES use supports the application of the Polish TGC scheme. Section 5 concludes.",7

Many countries have adopted various recycling programs, including take-back responsibility for producers (OECD 2004). The Japanese government introduced the Law for Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances, generally called the Japanese Home Appliance Recycling Law, on 1 April 2001. In this new recycling program, consumers have to pay the recycling fees when they return used appliances to retailers. Because of this characteristic of a pay-after-use system, a great deal of concern has been expressed regarding the increase in illegal dumping. Illegal dumping potentially causes various kinds of problems. Dumped debris deteriorates local landscapes. If the runoff from dumpsites contains toxic chemicals and contaminates water reservoirs, it can increase health risks. Local governments have to spend substantial amounts of money for cleaning up contaminated sites. Therefore, it is important to analyze the situation of illegal dumping and to find effective countermeasures against it. However, the research on illegal dumping is very limited, mainly because data available on this subject are scarce. The object of this paper is to analyze the causes of illegal disposal and to evaluate the effectiveness of the countermeasures. In order to examine the situation of illegal dumping of used appliances, Japanese local governments have investigated and recorded the incidence of illegal dumping. Using this data set, we initially examine the determinants of illegal dumping. Meanwhile, local governments have taken various countermeasures. In several local governments, community residents get involved in monitoring and patrol activities. Using the data on these activities, we will examine whether the participation of community residents contributes to the reduction of illegal dumping. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, we describe a brief overview of the Japanese Home Appliance Recycling Law. Section 3 explains the situation of illegal dumping of used electrical appliances. Section 4 provides the data used in the analysis. We conduct two types of analysis in this paper. In Sect. 5, we analyze the cross-sectional relationship between the frequency of illegal dumping and various socioeconomic characteristics of the population. The result of this analysis reveals that illegal dumping is more serious in municipalities with higher unemployment rates. If the community has many illegal dumping incidents, it devises countermeasures more seriously. In Sect. 6, we examine the determinants of the changes over time in illegal dumping. We find that illegal dumping has increased significantly in municipalities with higher income and higher unemployment rates. We also find that the monitoring and patrol activities by community residents have significantly contributed to the reduction of the incidents. Section 7 presents our conclusions.",30

Following the recent financial crisis, many enterprises facing financial problems were nationalized. In some industries, where there exist public firms, such as the airline, railway, and energy industries, the production process often results in serious negative externalities. The purpose of this paper is to investigate environmental policies in a mixed market and to discuss the welfare implication of privatization. We use the model of mixed oligopoly developed by De Fraja and Delbono (1989, 1990). In this model, the public firm maximizes economic welfare, while the private firm maximizes its own profit. Although many authors use the mixed oligopoly model for a market without pollution, there are few works analyzing the environmental problem in a mixed market. Recently, however, several articles have investigated environmental policy in a mixed market (Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón 2006; Kato 2006, 2010; Ohori 2006a, b; Cato 2008; Naito and Ogawa 2009). Among these, two works have made remarkable contributions to the emission tax policy in a mixed market.
Footnote 1 Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2006) consider the standard mixed oligopoly model with pollution. They examine the relationship between privatization and environmental policies. They present a comparison of three cases: (1) the government ignores environmental damage, (2) the government does not implement any environmental policy, and (3) the government sets an emission tax. For (1) and (3), privatization is beneficial when the number of private firms is sufficiently large. The critical number of firms in (3) is larger than that in (1). Ohori (2006a, b) studies the optimal emission tax in an international duopolistic market.
Footnote 2 Moreover, Ohori (2006a) considers the possibility of partial privatization. As main results, he shows that the optimal tax rate is lower than the marginal environmental damage, and neither full privatization nor full nationalization is optimal. This paper examines a unit subsidy policy for abatement activity. First, we examine the case where the government uses only the abatement subsidy as a policy instrument. We derive a general formula of the optimal abatement subsidy, and then investigate how the privatization policy affects the optimal subsidy level for abatement activities. We demonstrate that when the number of private firms is sufficiently large, the optimal abatement subsidy decreases with privatization of the public firm, and when the number of private firms is small, the optimal abatement subsidy increases with privatization. This result implies that the optimal abatement subsidy strongly depends on the market structure. Furthermore, we investigate the welfare implication of privatization, and compare the abatement subsidy policy to the emission tax policy. Next, we consider the case where the government uses a combination of tax and subsidy. That is, in addition to an abatement subsidy, an output subsidy and an emission tax are discussed. We examine three types of policy combinations. Under each combination, the equilibrium output levels, the equilibrium abatement activity levels, and the equilibrium emission levels are identical for the mixed oligopoly and the private oligopoly. Furthermore, the first-best outcome is achieved in both markets. Thus, these results imply that the White-type irrelevance results hold. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model. Section 3 explores an analysis of the abatement subsidy policy. Section 4 examines the combined policies. Section 5 concludes this paper. The “Appendix” includes some proofs.",11
13.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,19 August 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-011-0018-y,Optimal design of deposit–refund systems considering allocation of unredeemed deposits,December 2011,Daisuke Numata,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In a deposit–refund system, consumers pay deposits that are added to the price of products and receive refunds when they return the used products. This system is one of the economic instruments that are expected to have positive effects on environmental protection, such as preventing litter and promoting material recovery. Historically, deposit–refund systems were initiated voluntarily for cost saving. In other words, voluntary deposit–refund systems aim to decrease the production cost. However, as the production costs of virgin materials decrease, voluntary deposit systems are experiencing a decline and attempts have recently been made to introduce mandatory deposit–refund systems to solve environmental problems. That is, mandatory deposit–refund systems aim to internalize negative externality. Such systems are often applied in beverage containers. Various studies, e.g., Fullerton and Kinnaman (1995), consider the case of the mandatory deposit–refund systems, and these studies show that a deposit–refund system is an optimal fee structure when compared to several other methods. One of the characteristics of the deposit–refund system is that unreturned deposits are generated. In some systems, not all used products are always returned to suppliers such as retailers, or, some deposit–refund systems adopt the system where the level of deposit exceed the level of refund. As a result, the deposits that the consumers pay exceed the refunds they receive and the difference between the deposits and the refunds is termed as unredeemed deposits. In a large-scale deposit–refund system, the amount of the unredeemed deposits becomes a lot. For example, in California, in 2006 fiscal year, the amount of the unredeemed deposits is 268.4 million dollar. For reference, in California, this amount is held by the state government and is expended not only for administrative fees for recyclers ($5.2 million), processors ($12.1 million) but also for government administration related to the deposit–refund systems ($42.9 million), including the salary of more than 230 officers in the branches in the state government related to the deposit–refund systems. The amount also compensates processing payment that will be shown as the subsequent handling commission, the amount of which is $83.4 million (Numata 2010). This large unredeemed deposits derive, in a mandatory deposit–refund system, a problem as to who should hold the unredeemed deposits among the suppliers and the government (Numata 2008a). Table 1 shows the holder of unredeemed deposits in the American states where mandatory deposit–refund systems are applied to beverage containers. In some states, the state governments hold unredeemed deposits, while in others, the suppliers hold them. There are also states where unredeemed deposits are shared among the state government and the suppliers. Deciding who should hold the unredeemed deposits has led to many lawsuits. In some cases, the decisions of the lower court and the supreme court have been different. Further, environmental groups and suppliers have been active in lobbying (Container Recycling Institute 2003). However, the allocation of unredeemed deposits has not yet been examined thoroughly in previous studies. Bohm (1981) suggests that the government should keep unredeemed deposits, because they may cause suppliers to have the incentive not to collect. This incentive comes from the fact that, when suppliers keep them, as they collect more, they have to pay more refunds, which causes suppliers’ profit to decrease. Calcott and Walls (2005) study the implications of the allocation and conclude that, in a deposit–refund system, suppliers should not keep unredeemed deposits as profits, because, if suppliers keep them, social optimal condition cannot be attained. However, these studies do not consider the case where unredeemed deposits are shared among the government and the suppliers, and do not consider the situation where the government budget constraint holds. Therefore, we investigate the optimal design of deposit–refund systems considering the allocation of unredeemed deposits under the government budget constraint from the economics aspect in detail. Numata (2009) and Numata (2008b) refer to the implications of such allocation. Numata (2009) covers this allocation under a concrete function for two cases: (1) when all unredeemed deposits are held by the government and (2) when all unredeemed deposits are held by the suppliers. It concludes that the government should collect all unredeemed deposits when the product of the negative externality and the number of consumers is larger than the half of the deposit. Numata (2008b) considers this allocation by introducing the share of unredeemed deposits that the government collects from the suppliers. It concludes that, when there is a negative externality from the used products not being returned, the government should collect the unredeemed deposits from the supplier, and the percentage of unredeemed deposits that the government should collect depends on the relative size of the deposit as compared to the negative externality. However, in the model in Numata (2008b), the government controls variables which it cannot control actually. In the model in this paper, the government controls variables which it can control. Further, this paper introduces the equilibrium in the recycled products market in which the supplier and the recycler appear. The share of unredeemed deposits the recycler has, is also introduced. Based on these, this paper investigates this allocation rule in greater detail. Our conclusions can be summarized as follows. The refund per unit should be set equal to the sum of the following three: (1) the suppliers’ marginal net revenue from collecting and treating used deposit–refund goods, (2) the marginal negative externality, and (3) the deposit per unit multiplied by the share of the unredeemed deposits that the government and the recycler collect from the supplier. The weight for the sum of (2) and (3) is the marginal product for the supplier multiplied by that for the recycler. This paper proceeds as follows. The framework of the model is presented in the next section. Section 3 concretely characterizes the model. In Sect. 4, we examine the optimal design of deposit–refund systems considering the allocation of unredeemed deposits. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Sect. 5.",5

They increase the use of renewable energy either by dictating that utilities generate some proportion of their production from renewables, or by requiring that they pay a premium above the market price for renewable energy. What determines the adoption and stringency of renewable energy standards in different jurisdictions? To what extent do they reflect political considerations? In this article, I investigate the political economy of renewable energy standards. A game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that a green politician (someone interested in improved environmental quality) may reap electoral benefits from a stringent standard. Since the standard increases profits to the renewables industry, this industry has stronger incentives to mobilize support for the green politician in subsequent elections. By doing so, the industry increases the probability that the standard will be implemented in the future. Notably, the result applies even if the green constituencies are initially weak and disorganized. The fossil-fuel lobby is powerful and organized in many countries, so it will systematically resist all efforts to promote renewable energy. The renewables industry remains immature, and therefore faces a higher cost of organizing and mobilizing than the fossil-fuel industry. Consequently, a renewable energy standard that artificially increases profits may be necessary to induce the initially weak and disorganized green constituencies to pay the high up-front cost of organizing and mobilizing. It is as though the renewable energy standard helped to correct the imbalance in favor of the established interest groups in support of fossil fuels. To illustrate, consider the United States. In 1998, the entire industry spent only USD2.4 million to lobby for favorable public policies. In 2009, the total expenditures had risen to USD30 million.
Footnote 1 This dramatic increase follows temporally the diffusion of renewable energy standards and the expansion in total renewable energy production. By creating an increasingly powerful renewables industry, state governments may have given clean energy enthusiasts a sustained presence in Washington. President Obama’s decision to allocate USD60 billion in green stimulus will also probably facilitate this development.
Footnote 2
 In addition to illuminate the political economy of renewable energy standards, this article offers useful insights for policymakers. While the public debate on climate and energy policies often focuses on economic and environmental criteria, such as effectiveness and equity, this article shows how green politicians can use public policies to mobilize supporters who then help consolidate these public policies. This positive feedback loop can help to consolidate effective climate and energy policies. To trigger it, however, policymakers must understand how a given policy influences the degree of political mobilization among supporters and opponents.",6

Shavell (1986) first coined the term “judgment proof” to describe such firms. Judgment proofness is a problem because it can stifle the incentive of a potential injurer to exercise adequate care ex ante. Regulators have responded to this problem by imposing liability on deep-pocketed third parties—such as lenders—who have the means to control an injurer’s actions.Footnote 1 This is the doctrine of “extended liability,” which has been justified on the grounds that it enhances cost recovery for tort victims when the primary producer of the damage is insolvent. Previous contributions on this doctrine have tended to assume that lenders face a simple decision of whether or not to lend and at what price. In these models, lenders do not evaluate projects prior to advancing funds, and have only one tool—the interest rate—available to control incentives and price environmental risk. In practice, of course, lenders generally do collect and use borrower-specific information to make credit decisions. Thus, by stripping lenders of the ability to screen their would-be borrowers, existing studies (see, for example, Pitchford 1995; Dionee and Spaeter 2003) essentially discount the role of information acquisition in the provision of financial services to the environmentally hazardous industries. Whilst this simplification may serve a pedagogical purpose, it is by no means innocuous, not least because information considerations are crucial to the pricing and availability of financial services (Besanko and Kanatas 1993; Hauswald and Marquez 2003).Footnote 2 Indeed, information production is today so much ingrained in credit markets that the dearth of theoretical formalization that encompasses both extended liability and information production is glaring. This paper attempts to fill this gap by employing a simple competitive lending model to compare the impact of improvements in the cost of acquiring information (represented by a decrease in the marginal screening cost) and increasing the liability of lenders for harm caused by their borrowers. In the model, wealth constrained entrepreneurs (or firms) have access to projects of different sizes. Projects also vary according to the risk of an environmental accident, which is a private information to the entrepreneur. Moreover, a randomly selected entrepreneur project is not viable, so it is never optimal for lenders to pursue a random lending strategy. Rather, lenders have access to a screening technology, which they employ to determine the creditworthiness of would-be borrowers; only those deemed to be creditworthy are funded. The screening technology is imprecise, however, it only enables the lender to receive a noisy signal about an applicant’s underlying riskiness so that a residual adverse selection problem persists. An entrepreneur’s project size determines its debt burden and thus the lender’s stake in the financial outcome. The greater the entrepreneur’s project size, the greater the lender’s stake and thus screening incentives. Assuming that entrepreneurs have the same initial endowment, only those whose projects that are sufficiently large are able to get the requisite financing. Projects that are too small simply do not yield enough return to warrant the screening expense and are therefore denied credit. The model yields a number of comparative statics results. In particular, we examine how the availability of credit and social welfare respond to reductions in the cost of acquiring information and increases in extended liability. Intriguingly, we find that whereas an increase in the liability of lenders leads to a reduction in the extent to which credit is rationed, improvements in the information system actually amplify credit rationing. The assumption of a competitive credit market underlines this somewhat counterintuitive result. In our model, an increase in extended liability requires that interest payments be increased to restore the zero profit condition on the part of lenders. High-risk borrowers, who are less likely to avoid an accident/bankrupty, find the higher repayment obligation particularly onerous and therefore drop out of the market, with the result that the average quality of borrowers improves. The lender, anticipating a better caliber of applicants, optimally lowers the minimum loan size needed to qualify for financing. The opposite result holds true for improvements in the information system. In this case, lower screening costs leads to lower interest payments as profits are competed away. This in turn causes a deterioration in the quality of borrower. Lenders respond to this pool-worsening by toughening lending conditions. As for social welfare, we find that the effect of an increase in extended liability or a reduction in information cost depends crucially on the mix of borrower-type in the population. This stems from the fact that these parameter changes evoke two distinct effects, which may not necessarily work in concert with each other: On the one hand, both changes lead to more intense screening and fewer mistakes in evaluating loan applicants. This “screening effect” leads lenders to discard projects that are particularly environmentally egregious and so tend to enhance welfare. On the other hand, these changes affect the availability of credit quite differently, with higher lender liability leading to an increase in credit while lower screening costs having the opposite effect. This “credit effect” may, by altering the quality of projects that are executed, either improve or damage social welfare. The argument is as follows. Suppose there are only two entrepreneurial risk types in the population: low risk and high risk. Assume also that low-risk entrepreneurs are endowed with socially valuable projects, whilst their high-risk counterparts have access to projects, which, because of their high likelihood of causing an accident, are socially undesirable. Now, as reported above, an increase in lender liability brings forth an expansion of credit whilst a decrease in the cost of information aggravates credit rationing. This implies that if a preponderance of entrepreneurs is low risk, then improving the information infrastructure is likely to diminish social welfare because most of the projects that are shut off the credit market are socially valuable; however, increasing the liability of the lender is likely to increase social welfare since most of the additional projects that become viable have positive net social values. The converse argument holds if there is an abundance of bad risks. Herein, an improvement in the cost of information leads to an increase in social welfare because more bad risks than good risks are discarded; that is, credit rationing effectively “cleanses” the market of bad risks. By contrast, an increase in extended liability reduces social welfare since the majority of the new projects are socially undesirable. The foregoing results suggest that an effective regulatory response to the judgment proof problem should entail a deliberate coordination between environmental and information policies, and a consideration of the quality of the borrower pool. To see this, suppose, for instance, that the quality of the borrower pool evolves exogenously through time, influenced by changes in the pattern of production, etc. Then one would expect an effective regulatory approach to be characterized by an emphasis on policies tailored toward improving the ability to acquire information, such as standardizing environmental data as suggested by the ISO 14000 process (Tietenberg 1998), when the proportion of good risk borrowers is small and a shift to extended liability when there is an abundance of good quality borrowers. This paper is in the same spirit as those studies that have examined the implication of environmental information for environmental quality. At the empirical level, we can identify two groups: The first investigates the reaction of stock markets to the release of environmental information (see, for example, Blacconiere and Patten 1994; Hamilton 1995; Hart and Ahuja 1998; Konar and Cohen 1996; Lanoie et al. 1998). The second strand documents the relationship between the availability of information and environmental performance (Foulon et al. 2002; Funf and O’Rourke 2001). At the theoretical level, Uchida (2007) examines the interaction between consumers and firms when environmental information can be disseminated through product labelling. However, a number of differences exist between Uchida’s research and ours. First, Uchida’s main concern is with the product market as the channel through which information affects environmental quality. According to this argument, consumers may bring pressure to bear on firms by choosing to buy “green” products when effective information makes this clear. By contrast, our paper explores the capital markets channel. Namely, it is postulated that lenders may alter their lending behavior if the marginal cost of collecting information about their borrowers’ risk is reduced. Second, Uchida focuses exclusively on the interactions between information provision and environmental behavior. Our model analyzes the implication of information in a more integrated framework that also includes extended liability. A common thread connecting the formal literature on extended liability is its portrayal of the lender as a “passive” investor who does not undertake any due diligence prior to committing funds, and the presumption that all the necessary accident-reducing actions are the exclusive domain of the injurer (see Balkenborg 2001; Boyer and Lafont 1997; Heyes 1995; Pitchford 1995; Shavell 1986, 1997; Dionee and Spaeter 2003; Hutchinson and van’t Veld 2005). This depiction of the lender disregards a well-known function performed by lenders; namely, the task of evaluating projects for their credit worthiness (Manove et al. 2001). The present study endogenizes the screening activity of the lender. On a general level, this paper is related to studies that have examined how lenders control asymmetric information in the market for loans. Depending on the type of asymmetric information and agency problems that prevail, lenders can design contracts that induce self-selection among borrowers (Bester 1985), they can employ ex-ante screening (Hauswald and Marquez 2003; Thakor 1996), interim monitoring (Besanko and Kanatas 1993), or ex-post verification (Townsend 1979). In all these studies, it is assumed that if a bad state manifests itself, the lender suffers no wealth loss beyond her initial investment. Our framework is different in that it admits the possibility of the lender suffering further losses from tort liability costs. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the central elements of the model. Section 3 characterizes the optimal solution to the lending game. Section 4 derives comparative statics results of the impact of increasing lender liability and improving the efficiency of the information infrastructure (represented by a decrease in the marginal screening costs). Section5 discusses the results and examines the implications of the model. Section 6 concludes.",1

Illegal disposal of waste in particular is one of the most serious problems. Our objective is to comprehensively examine the effectiveness of a licensing system that has been introduced in waste management. There are two problems in a waste management market: asymmetric information and noncompliance. These problems are followed from the simple fact that waste is worthless to both waste disposers and waste management firms (WMFs). Waste disposers are unconcerned about, and unaware of, how their waste is treated and how it damages the environment (i.e., asymmetric information). Although stringent regulations have been introduced to set a standard for how waste must be treated, the lack of interest on the part of disposers has encouraged noncompliance or illegal disposal on the part of WMFs. To address these problems, a license (or permit) to conduct waste management has been introduced into the industrial-waste management policies of many developed countries.Footnote 1 Waste treatment by unlicensed WMFs is prohibited under such a system. One of the most significant features of this policy is that it extends liability to the disposers. As a result of asymmetric information, disposers cannot know which WMFs treat waste properly and which WMFs dispose of waste illegally. To remedy this, disposers are obligated to consign their waste to a licensed WMF. We are calling this the consignment obligation. A second feature of the licensing system is that it is a two-group state-dependent regulation; WMFs are classified into two groups: licensed or unlicensed. Licensed WMFs can have their licenses suspended if they are caught disposing of waste illegally. Still, if a WMF whose license has been suspended does not operate illegally for a certain number of years, the license is returned to it.Footnote 2
 Extending liability in a licensing system to the disposer via a consignment obligation can deter illegal disposal through the ‘enforcement leverage’ that was originally advocated by Harrington (1988) and Harrington and Heyes (2001). Becker (1968) held that criminal activities can be deterred only if the noncompliance cost, including penalties, exceeds the compliance cost. But Harrington (1988) and Harrington and Heyes (2001) show that, in a two-group state-dependent model, firms may have an incentive to comply with the regulation even though the cost of compliance exceeds the expected penalty. This property has been called ‘enforcement leverage’. In Harrington’s model, firms move between two groups that differ in the treatment they receive from enforcement officials as regards frequency of inspection and severity of fines, with inspections more frequent and higher fines imposed on firms in the frequently offending group (the bad group) than in the case of firms in the more law-abiding group (the good group). Firms with intermediate compliance costs in the bad group will comply with the regulations in order to move out of the bad group even though compliance costs may exceed noncompliance costs. This is how enforcement leverage works in his model. From the regulator’s point of view, too, enforcement leverage has its benefits in cost efficiency, since conditional audit rules or a state-dependent policy can achieve regulatory compliance with fewer inspections than are required by random auditing. Harrington’s model has been extended or reexamined by several later studies, for example Harford and Harrington (1991), Heyes and Rickman (1999), Raymond (1999), and Friesen (2003). The structure of our licensing model of waste management is similar to that of Harrington (1988) and Harrington and Heyes (2001).Footnote 3 We investigate a license policy that is a two-group state-dependent regulation; the first group is one of license holders and the second group is of those who do not hold licenses. We theoretically show that enforcement leverage occurs in a licensing system—as in Harrington (1988) and Harrington and Heyes (2001)—but for a different reason. In our model, it is extending liability to disposers that creates the enforcement leverage. We examine the enforcement leverage of a licensing system in waste management using 47 regional panel data in Japan covering the years 1995–2005. Because we meet with a severe data restriction specific to waste research fields, we take a three stage estimation method to obtain the predicted data which is necessary for our purpose. Nevertheless, we obtain several interesting results in a three different estimations. First, we find a transboundary movement of illegal disposal whereby waste tends to be illegally disposed of where there is less population, more available space, in a location closer to the original source of the waste. This follows economic rationality. Levinson (1999a, b) show that the movement of industrial waste for legal disposal is also consistent with the economic rationality. He shows that interstate competition in hazardous waste disposal taxes has significantly affected patterns of hazardous waste disposal in the United States by decreasing shipments of waste to states enacting high taxes. In this study, we show that the movement of waste for illegal disposal is also determined by economic rationality. Second, we find how the court determines penalties for illegal disposal and for violation of the consignment obligation; penalties increase with the volume of dumped waste and the hazardousness of the waste. Our results are consistent with Hamilton (1996), Kleit et al. (1998), and Oljaca et al. (1998) that also find that penalties increase with the severity of the environmental damage. Third, we find that the licensing system is effective in deterring illegal disposal. Not only simply imposing penalties on WMFs for dumping waste but also extending liability to disposers (i.e., the consignment obligation) is significantly effective in reducing the volume of illegal disposal. As a result, we find evidence of enforcement leverage in a licensing system. Stafford (2007) also examines the effectiveness of the consignment obligation under RCRA. She finds that the consignment obligation gives generators of waste incentives to choose compliant WMFs. In addition, she also finds that the compliance of WMFs increases with the pressures from generators of waste which is represented by the competitiveness in a waste management market. Even though her empirical results also support the effectiveness of the consignment obligation, we try to see more directly the deterrent effect of a waste management policy including the consignment obligation, penalties, and a licensing scheme. An effective licensing system thus includes two mechanisms to deter illegal disposal: punishing illegal disposal and extension of liability to a third party. Examining the effectiveness of such a licensing policy both theoretically and empirically enables us to decide which policy can reduce illegal disposal more effectively—increasing penalties for illegal disposal, or extending liability to other parties involved. The latter choice is enshrined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA—commonly known as Superfund) in the United States.Footnote 4
 Our estimation results show that the penalty imposed for violations of the consignment obligation is more effective than the penalty on illegal disposal itself, although the deterrent effect of increasing both penalties is not as large as expected; if the expected actual penalty on illegal disposal is increased by about $1 per ton, the rate of illegal disposal can be decreased by from 0.19 to 0.93%, while if the expected actual penalty imposed on disposers violating the consignment obligation is increased by about $1 per ton, the rate of illegal disposal would decrease by from 0.36 to 1.45%. This suggests that extending liability to related parties can deter illegal disposal more effectively than increasing the penalty on illegal disposal. This paper is organized so that Sect. 2 sets out the background to our study; a theory of a licensing system and the methodology used for an empirical analysis are provided in Sect. 3; we implement the empirical analysis in Sect. 4. Section 5 contains our conclusion.",14

In addition, the International Science Workshop was held in Tokyo, Japan in July 2011, on Assessments for Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem. More research on biodiversity preservation has been called for in this context. While biological and ecological knowledge is essential for practical management of ecosystem, an economic perspective has been increasingly required to confirm efficient management and to capture the preferences of local residents. Azqueta and Sotelsek (2007) pointed out that geographic information system (GIS) on environmental assets should be coupled with its economic values ideally to incorporate the values of natural capital into national accountings; “greening the national accounts (Bartelmus 2009; P. 1850)”. Dasgupta (2009) criticized the current attempts of green national accounting and indicated the importance of estimating and utilizing shadow prices of environmental assets with national accounts. Engelbrecht (2009) demonstrated that the relationship was robust between macro-level subjective welfare and natural capital per capita. Especially on forestry accounting, Jöbstl (2009) insisted that it was necessary to highlight on the assessment of non-market benefits. Thus, we should simultaneously cumulate both natural and social scientific knowledge as soon as possible, where the latter consists of market and non-market values of natural assets including biodiversity and ecosystem. Though there are increasing calls for economic evaluation of biodiversity and ecosystem, its research seems to be scarce especially in Japan. On biological and ecological knowledge, for example, Japan Integrated Biodiversity Information System has been trying to collect and cumulate information on the species diversity in Japan.Footnote 1 Japan Biodiversity Outlook Science Committee and the Ministry of the Environment (2010) conducted the natural scientific assessment of biodiversity. On the other hand to the extent of our knowledge, there are no economic researches on public preferences for biodiversity as a whole in Japan, which includes preferences for species diversity. It may lead to the consideration that effective policies have been absent and opportunities missed. Thus, we in Japan should also try to collect and cumulate the information on the public preferences for species diversity. At present, there is a good deal of research being carried out on economic evaluations of biodiversity. The objectives in economic evaluations of biodiversity are to clarify (1) whether preservation should be conducted, (2) how preservation should be carried out and (3) whether some strategies are more effective or efficient than others. Nunes and van den Bergh (2001) summarized existing case studies and described several conflicting or complementary structures relating to biodiversity values. Their approach emphasizes that it is important to (1) keep in mind that there exist both measurable and non-measurable values, (2) estimate not only use values, but also non-use values, (3) approach both natural and social science using appropriate macro and micro concepts, and (4) gather both expert and general opinion. Furthermore, they summarized the connections between biodiversity and social welfare. When evaluating biodiversity, it should be kept in mind that four levels exist, which include (1) genetic/species diversity, (2) landscape diversity, (3) ecological functions/services, and (4) passive use values. In addition, it is possible to address several kinds of economic values and to estimate passive use values along with ecosystem services as use values. Christie et al. (2006) divided biodiversity concepts into two groups: ecological concepts and anthropocentric concepts. Choice experiments (CE) were carried out using four sub-concepts: (1) habitat quality and (2) ecosystem processes, based on ecological concepts; (3) rare or unfamiliar species of wildlife and (4) familiar species, based on anthropocentric concepts. It suggests that we should conduct simultaneous multi-attribute evaluation of biodiversity. Conjoint analysis is appropriate for simultaneous evaluation of the several kinds of characteristics possessed by biodiversity. This approach started with the concept of conjoint measurement (Luce and Tukey 1964), although certain operational notions had previously been proposed by Thurston (1927). Practical methods were developed at Psychometrics and Marketing (Louviere et al. 2000). Conjoint analysis is carried out by choosing preferred types (CE) and ranking different types (Contingent Ranking) in such a way that one clarifies preferences for multi-attribute options. CE has become an increasingly reliable approach due to a range of methodological improvements. Recent CE studies covering forest ecosystem biodiversity, along with the treatment of biodiversity used in each case, are summarized in Table 1.Footnote 2 Each study focused on site-specific species diversity. There do not appear to be any studies that evaluate biodiversity at a national level. However, in considering national strategies related to ecosystem, it is important to conduct evaluation studies at a national level. In considering biodiversity, it appears likely that the members of the public may interpret this in terms of species diversity. On animal species, Adamowicz et al. (1998) employed mountain caribou and moose population. Naidoo and Adamowicz (2005) adopted the number of bird species seen and chance of seeing large wildlife. Shapansky et al. (2008) used the numbers of certain representative species such as moose or woodland caribou. On plant species, Hanley et al. (1998) employed the mixture level of species of plant, while Nielsen et al. (2007) used broadleaves and conifers. Wang et al. (2007) utilized the number of plant species present. On the whole species, Horne et al. (2005) used the total number of species. On the rarity of species, Lehtonen et al. (2003) utilized the number of endangered species. Bienabe and Hearne (2006) and Carlsson et al. (2003) used the number of area-conserving species, while Garber-Yonts et al. (2004) employed endangered species along with the protection of salmon habitat streams and the patch of land to reserve biodiversity as a whole. Some studies focused solely on the width of the protected area; for example, Mallawaarachchi et al. (2001) adopted the width of conserving area of tea tree woodlands and vegetation. In addition, Siikamäki and Layton (2007) highlighted biodiversity hot spots. However, no previous studies have conducted integrated research on the numerical trade-off between animal and plant species with those rarities. We have used CE to study whether one can state the preference for purely numerical definitions of the species diversity by focusing on the rarity of animal and plant species in Japanese forests at the national level. Species were defined numerically without the use of names so as to avoid the effects of distribution, site-specific characteristics and so on, enabling us to investigate general tendencies in preferences for the species diversity within Japan. We employed a random parameter logit model (RPL) to grasp the overall features of the preference heterogeneity, and a latent class model (LCM) to investigate the heterogeneous preference in detail. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the online survey design in terms of contents, scheme scenarios, sample features and so on. The econometric method is explained in Sect. 3, and the results are given in Sect. 4. We provide some discussion in Sect. 5, and concluding remarks and topics for future research in Sect. 6.",6

A number of economic studies have tackled the issue of reducing unlawful waste disposal and, in particular, recycling wasted materials into productive resources (e.g., Smith 1972; Dinan 1993; Fullerton and Kinnaman 1995; Palmer and Walls 1997; Shinkuma 2003). These studies have mainly examined the properties of some combinations of different policy instruments, ranging from a disposal fee-cum-subsidy, a recycling charge-cum-subsidy, a tax on the extraction of the virgin resource, and recycled content standards under a variety of settings. As for illegal waste disposal, Sullivan (1987) derives the optimal enforcement effort of the budget-constrained authority, along with the optimal subsidy for the legal disposal to counter midnight dumping by waste generating producers. Sullivan (1987) resorts to the assumption of ‘a rational criminal’ a la Becker (1968) in describing the behavior of these producers.
Footnote 1 In this article, we follow a similar line of reasoning regarding the causes of illegal waste disposal, which eventually lead to environmental damage. Hence, we suppose that the prevalence of illegal disposal will be influenced by the size of the expected fine, which in turn depends on the severity of the governmental policing effort used to deter the illegal activity. This level of effort should be considerably easier to manipulate relative to other policy instruments and even to changing the level of the fine for illicit waste disposal, owing to the legislative and judicial procedures involved in the implementation of policy alterations. Thus, we consider that the authority adjusts the level of policing activities so that they are more readily altered in accommodating possible changes in circumstances. In contrast to Sullivan (1987), where attention is mostly paid to the direct effect of reducing illegal disposal, this paper also considers the impact of illegal disposal on recycling activities and the output market. These have not been fully explored in previous work. More specifically, we conduct a simple comparative static analysis and show how, in the absence of other policy instruments, the second-best policing effort level depends on the environment-related marginal costs, including not only the environmental damage cost of illegal disposal but also the cost associated with exported waste. In Japan, for example, the Home Appliance Recycling Law was put into operation in 2001. According to the home page of this law, the purpose of that law is “to take measures to appropriately and smoothly implement collection and recycling home appliances by retailers, manufacturers and importers, then to secure the appropriate disposal of waste and utilization of natural resources, and consequently to contribute to preservation of life environments and sound development of the national economy” (Ministry of economy, trade and industry 2011).
 However, since the importers of the home appliances, i.e., the households, must pay the collection charge and recycling cost in disposing of their waste legally, this law has caused the illegal waste dumping. Furthermore, the waste which has been carried to the manufactures but not been recycled may become the exported waste. That waste, especially E-waste (electronic waste) transported from developed countries to developing countries, has led to the serious environmental pollution. Therefore, the governments of China and India, for example, banned improper recycling and imposed a fine on it, however, this problem could not be solved. Shinkuma and Managi (2010) suggest that “governments of exporting countries are required to cooperate with those of importing countries. If an exporting firm sells E-waste to unauthorized recyclers in a developing country, the government of the exporting country must impose a fine on the firm.” Our model of this paper is based on these issues. In addition, we assume that the firm can recycle the household’s waste carried through the government collection and produce goods by using it. The main results of this paper are as follows: first, the more severe regulation on the household’s illegal waste disposal leads to a decrease in material inputs for producing goods such as recycled resource and virgin natural resource. That counter intuitive result is derived from our assumption that the firm can export the household’s waste to a foreign country before recycling. Second, in the social welfare analysis, we explore that if the government can control only the enforcement level as a policy instrument for resolving environmental problems, then whether the government should raise its level or not depends on which problem is currently the most serious. While the government should respond to the household’s illegal disposal problem by increasing the enforcement level, it should respond to the exported waste problem by decreasing its level and regulating more loosely. Both problems relate to the increase in environment-related marginal cost, however, the opposing government regulations should be applied to these problems, respectively. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the structure of our model. In Sect. 3, we set up a social welfare function and conduct a comparative static analysis on the second-best policing effort. The final section contains some concluding remarks.",

Article 38 of the WFD refers to the polluter-pays principle, and the inclusion of environmental and resource costs in the pricing of water services. Several research projects since then have tried to come to grips with the valuation and inclusion of water-related environmental, and resource costs and benefits. For instance, the so-called Aquamoney project (see http://www.aquamoney.org) brought together research teams from more than 10 European countries to test practical guidelines for the assessment of environmental and resource costs and benefits (Brouwer et al. 2009). The current paper is an outcome of this international project with the aim to present the results of the application of a contingent valuation of river restoration measures along the Austrian Danube in the federal states of Vienna and Lower AustriaFootnote 1. We employed an identical survey in two consecutive years, and also presented two scenarios differing in scope within each survey. Temporal stability and sensitivity to scale are therefore the two main methodological issues of the current paper in addition to presenting willingness-to-pay (WTP) figures for river restoration as a basis for water-related policy making. Besides the academic interest in the temporal stability of environmental valuation results (cf. Cameron 1997; Brouwer and Bateman 2005; Kealy et al. 1988, 1990; McConnell et al. 1998; Carson et al. 1997; Brouwer 2006), many studies do not find statistically different WTP bids, or reach at inconclusive results. Richardson and Loomis (2009) compare WTP bids over time and also indicate whether concrete day-to-day policy decisions may be based on values elicited at a “study” site and transferred to a “policy” site. Therefore, benefit transfer (cf. recent overviews of Wilson and Hoehn 2006; Lindhjem and Navrud 2008) might be feasible at least over time given the temporal stability of WTP bids while it might, of course, be problematic given the other potentially significant determinants of WTP (e.g., context of valuation; income changes; institutional differences between regions and countries). The stability of environmental valuation results may, on the one hand, rest on the stability of preferences of households. It may be said that economists in general search for other rapidly changing factors on demand (and WTP), such as income and prices, before they consider changing preferences as a major cause. Stability of valuation results therefore might be considered as good news in the sense that robust values can be transferred to policy sites. On the other hand, if preferences change over time, the valuation results should mirror these changes. However, it has to be questioned which changes are long-lasting, and which are only due to short-term effects like a “hot” public debate on a certain issue that might cool down fast. For instance, it is not a heroic assumption that a survey on the safety of nuclear reactors might reach at fundamentally different values before and after the current (2011) nuclear catastrophe in Japan. Furthermore, stable values for environmental goods might also point to the “warm-glow” effect. Even if environmental preferences change over time, stable WTP bids can be argued on the basis of motives other than environmental ones. This is also true regarding the sensitivity to scale of a certain project. The structure of the paper is the following: Section 2 presents the methodological approach of the current study, provides an overview of the two surveys employed in two consecutive years, and the concrete information and questions presented to respondents. Section 3.1 discusses the descriptive results of the WTP study, also with reference to the representativeness of the surveys. Section 3.2 presents the econometric results and finally Sect. 4 discusses the results, summarizes and concludes.",28

Historically, recycling has occurred because it has been economic from a private perspective, and as a consequence recycling rates have often been substantial even in the absence of policy intervention. For instance, lead scrap has constituted about 50% of the raw materials used in lead production and scrap-based production accounts for around 40% of global steel production (Swedish Steel Producers’ Association 2003). However, the growth of markets for many classes of recyclable materials is due in large to public policy incentives. The array of public policies include measures that directly support the development of these markets, including, for instance, waste collection schemes, deposit–refund systems, and public procurement schemes. Public authorities also provide indirect support for recycling markets through the internalisation of externalities at the waste management phase and upstream raw material extraction. If markets operate in conditions of economic efficiency and policy measures are introduced for different waste management options to reflect their social costs, recycling will be at its optimal level. However, in addition to the potential for the non-internalisation of environmental externalities, other types of market failure may constitute an impediment to the realisation of commercial opportunities in recycling markets. The objective of this paper is to assess the relative importance of such conditions, and discuss possible remedies (either by private or public actors) to overcome these market imperfections. We pay particular attention to the role of technological innovation as evidenced through patent activities in the waste recovery sector in the OECD economies. Whether spontaneously through the market or as a consequence of policy interventions, technological innovation can play a significant role in overcoming failures in recycling markets. Specifically, in the paper, we address causes of non-environmental market failures related to information asymmetries, as well as technological and consumption externalities. We highlight specific examples of such market imperfections, as well as a number of market- and policy-driven measures to overcome them. Technological innovation can reduce these information asymmetries by, for instance, facilitating market participants’ assessment of the characteristics of different materials. Innovation can also allow for the disassembly or separation of materials, facilitating recovery of materials, thus limiting the need for manual visual inspections of waste streams to assess quality, etc. For these reasons it is useful to analyse, in more detail, the role and the determinants of such technological innovation in the materials recovery sector. The paper therefore also provides an econometric analysis of the effect of different recycling policies on technological innovation in the recycling field. The quantitative analysis is conducted using patent data from 29 countries over the time period 1970–2007, and we focus on innovations in the case of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) and plastics packaging. The reason is that for these two cases we have been able to identify patent classes that list innovations, which tend to make recycling markets work better by economising on information needs and permitting systematic disassembly of products for the recovery of various components and materials. Thus, although we do not explicitly investigate the extent to which technological innovations reduce market inefficiencies in recycling markets, our selection of patents suggests that this is a reasonable maintained hypothesis. More generally, we add to the existing recycling economics literature in two ways. First, one research strand involves a relatively large number of empirical (econometric) studies that address the functioning of different secondary material markets, although focusing primarily on the behaviour of well-established and thus mature industries such as secondary metalsFootnote 1 and wastepaper.Footnote 2 The studies on metal scrap and wastepaper markets typically assume that these markets are not subject to imperfections. For some materials (e.g., steel scrap, secondary aluminum, etc.) these are reasonable assumptions, but for many used materials (e.g., plastics, rubber, specialty metals, etc.) markets may be underdeveloped and highly inefficient in the sense that there are significant unexploited gains from trade (OECD 2005). For this reason it is important to explicitly investigate the nature of potential market failures in recycling markets rather than assume that these work efficiently, and, in turn, discuss any related policy implications. 
Second, another growing research strand comprises several studies of waste management policies. Pigouvian taxes on disposal are generally proposed to be economically efficient. However, in the presence of illegal dumping a combined output tax and recycling subsidy (equivalent to a deposit-refund system) will be more efficient (Dinan 1993; Fullerton and Kinnaman 1995; Walls and Palmer 2001). The tax discourages production, and thus acts to reduce waste. Moreover, if the tax is assessed per pound of intermediate material produced, it will reduce the amount of materials entering the waste stream. The recycling subsidy encourages substitution of secondary materials for virgin materials (Palmer and Walls 1999). However, these policy mixes depend on the presence of efficient private markets for recycled materials. Calcott and Walls (2002) is one of few studies that addresses the solid waste policy implications in the presence of imperfect recycling markets (i.e., with positive transaction costs). The nature of these non-environmental market imperfections deserves increased attention. In some cases the market actors themselves will find ways to deal with apparent inefficiencies, but occasionally public policy intervention will be needed and the nature of such intervention is likely to be different than that which is usually found in the environmental policy toolbox. Two types of market failures require a mix of policy tools, and it is useful to identify situations which call for policy intervention beyond that of internalising environmental externalities. Moreover, at least some of the failures identified can be overcome (or attenuated) through technological innovation. Since public policy will indeed affect the pace and the direction of technological innovation in the waste sector, this could assist in overcoming important barriers to material recycling. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we review and discuss the nature of—as well as potential solutions to—three different potential market inefficiencies in recycling markets. Section 3 reviews patent data to provide evidence on innovation in technologies which facilitate recycling, and we discuss, in particular, the role of public policy on innovations in the cases of ELVs and plastics packaging. Section 4 presents the results of the econometric analyses of the effect of policy measures on patent counts. And finally, Sect. 5 provides some brief concluding remarks and directions for future research.",46

These agreements, most notably in Europe, are designed to encourage substitution toward the environment friendly (“greener”) versions of a given product. In April 1996, the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers (CECED), representing 95 % of the European producers and importers of clothes washing machines, presented their first commitment targeting domestic washing machines. The Voluntary Agreement on Washing Machines presented by the CECED was a commitment to stop producing for, and importing into, the European Union washing machines that have low energy efficiency and hence high associated emissions, and to reduce the average energy consumption of washing machines by 20 % (CECED 2004). This agreement aimed at eliminating from the market products that do not meet certain environmental criteria. By the end of the initial washing machines agreement, the percentage of high-efficiency machines (class A and B) had increased from 51 % in 1997 to around 83 % in 2002 (CECED 2002). The successful fulfillment of the first commitment motivated the industry to present a second commitment for the period 2002–2008 (CECED 2003, 2004). Several successful VAs were also implemented covering refrigerators, freezers, water heaters and dishwashers (CECED 2004). While these agreements successfully eliminated from the market the least energy-efficient versions of some domestic appliances, efforts to achieve improvements in energy efficiency voluntarily in other contexts have not always been successful. In 1998, an agreement was reached between the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), representing 86.4 % of the EC market, and the European Commission. The European Voluntary Agreement for Automobiles set a CO2 emissions target of 140 g/km across the fleet of new cars to be reached by 2008. Despite initial improvements in new fleet efficiency, by 2006 it was clear that the auto industry could not achieve further improvements. In 2007, the European Commission announced the failure of the VA to achieve its target and that legally binding measures will be adopted instead. The new regulation sets a limit on CO2 emissions of 130 g/km to be met by 2012 (Commission Staff 2009). The European Declaration on Paper Recovery presented in November 2000 is another example of an agreement with limited success. The agreement achieved a recycling rate of 56 % in 2005 (Confederation of European Paper Industries 2000), and aimed at 66 % recycling rate by 2010 (Heretier and Eckert 2009). This agreement was not recognized by the European Commission since higher recycling rates, 70–80 %, were already achieved in Germany (Schnabl 2005) and the paper industries were not willing to set such a high target. Finally, even though the appliance agreements described above achieved significant improvements in energy efficiency, the CECED Steering Committee decided on 21 March 2007 that they would not update their VAs for any of their products and therefore would not voluntarily achieve any further improvements in energy efficiency (CECED 2007). In light of the mixed results of VAs, the International Energy Agency published a report in 2008 evaluating the effectiveness of voluntary and regulatory measures in improving automobile fuel economy. The report shows that voluntary initiatives to improve automobile fuel economy have generally been unsuccessful and that regulations have been more effective than voluntary measures. As a result, there has been a general trend of moving away from VAs. Japan and Korea, which previously adopted a voluntary approach, are shifting to a mandatory program while Canada is considering the change (Onoda 2008). This suggests that VAs have been successful mechanisms for improving energy efficiency (and hence reducing pollution) in some contexts, but not in others. There is a growing literature analyzing the factors that influence the success of VAs. This literature has focused on pollution stemming from the production (rather than the use) of products, and assumes that voluntary pollution abatement undertaken by firms is costly and hence reduces producer profits. In such cases, firms need external incentives (either negative or positive) to induce them to join a VA. Negative incentives include avoiding future regulation or taxation, or negative publicity (e.g., Segerson and Miceli 1998; Segerson and Li 1999; Lyon and Maxwell 2001, 2003; Alberini and Segerson 2002; Segerson and Wu 2006; Glachant 2007; Dawson and Segerson 2008; Fleckinger and Glachant 2010), while positive incentives include cost sharing or public good will (e.g., Arora and Gangopadhyay (1995); Videras and Alberini (2000); Khanna (2001); Oikonomou et al. (2009); Blackman et al. (2010)). Thus, in the absence of some external pressure, firms would have no incentive to join a VA. In contrast to the previous literature where voluntary actions on the part of firms are assumed to be costly, Ahmed and Segerson (2011) show that an industry-wide VA can serve as a device to raise firm profits. In the contexts where pollution stems from product use, it is possible that a VA where all firms in an industry commit to reduce production of the polluting product can be profitable even though it would restrict each manufacturer’s freedom to produce and market its products. In particular, eliminating some products and thereby focusing demand on fewer (perhaps, more profitable) products can result in higher industry profits with the agreement than without it. This suggests that in some contexts, external incentives may not be needed to induce firms to join a VA. Rather, the VA can be profitable for firms while at the same time time reducing energy consumption. This paper considers product-related VAs where participation constitutes a commitment by an individual firm to meet a given environmental standard that is not mandated by the government. This paper builds on Ahmed and Segerson (2011) by identifying contexts under which industry-wide participation in product-related VAs raises industry profit and at the same time achieves environmental goals. I contend that a VA is more likely to emerge and be successful if it increases industry profit. I identify two factors that affect the impact of a product-related VA on industry profit: (1) the nature of the product and (2) the nature of the VA. More specifically, regarding the nature of the product, I distinguish between products for which there is a trade-off between energy efficiency and overall quality and products for which there is no trade-off. A trade-off exists when improvements in environmental performance require a sacrifice of desirable product characteristics, such as quality or safety, resulting in the greener version of the product being less desirable.Footnote 1 For example, in automobile production using conventional technologies, firms usually achieve greater fuel economy by using lighter materials or downsizing, which can negatively affect safety (Crandall 1992; Chen 2001) and reduce consumer satisfaction.Footnote 2 Similarly, recycled paper is not well suited for making certain grades of paper, e.g., graphical paper (European Recovered Paper Council 2002). Thus, the higher the percentage of recycled paper the fewer are its uses. In contrast, for products such as washing machines, the overall ranking of the more energy-efficient versions (e.g., front-loading machines) is higher than that of the low energy-efficient models (e.g., top-loading machines).Footnote 3
 The second factor that I consider relates to the nature of the VA. I distinguish between two types of VAs: (1) a VA that sets an average energy efficiency standard across all models of a product produced and sold by a firm, and (2) a VA limiting the output and sales of the polluting model. The European automobile VA is an example of the former type of VA, while the washing machines agreement is an example of the latter type. I show that the latter is more powerful in suppressing competition between firms.Footnote 4
 The primary results can be summarized as follows. For products that do not exhibit a quality–efficiency trade-off (such as most domestic appliances), an industry-wide VA is always profitable regardless of whether it is based on an average efficiency standard or a quota, provided the standard is not too stringent. When the standard becomes too stringent, either type of VA will no longer benefit firms; however, the VA always reduces energy consumption in this case. For products that exhibit a quality–efficiency trade-off (such as automobiles or paper), as in the previous case, a VA that is based on a quota is always profitable, provided the quota is not too stringent and will always reduce energy consumption. However, in contrast to the previous case, an industry-wide VA based on an average efficiency standard is not profitable for firms and may result in increased energy consumption depending on the stringency of the standard. This suggests that, for products with a quality–efficiency trade-off, a VA based on an average efficiency standard is not likely to be successful in the absence of some external incentive for firms to participate. This suggests that, for products that exhibit a quality–efficiency trade-off, firms will not voluntarily participate in an agreement based on an average efficiency standard in the absence of some external incentives. In that case, regulation can be more effective in ensuring participation and reducing energy consumption. Taken together, the results suggest a possible explanation for why appliance-related VAs such as the CECED agreements have been successful, at least up to a point, while success in using VAs for automobiles or paper recycling has been limited. In particular, they suggest that the initial appliance-related VAs might have provided firms with a profitable opportunity in this market, due to the nature of the product and the structure of the VA. More specifically, the fact that appliances do not generally exhibit a quality–efficiency trade-off and the use of a quantity-based VA (thereby, directly limiting sales of the low-efficiency models) combined to create the potential to simultaneously increase profits and reduce energy consumption under the VA as long as the implied restrictions were not too stringent. Thus, VAs imposing stringent standards are not likely to emerge which explains, at least in part, the refusal of the CECED to continue to eliminate the less efficient models through VAs. In contrast, our results suggest that the European VA for automobiles might not have provided a profitable opportunity for firms due, at least in part, to the combination of the quality–efficiency trade-off and the use of a VA based on an average energy efficiency standard. The combination of these two factors makes the VA costly to firms, regardless of the stringency of the target set. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model structure and the initial equilibrium. Section 3 presents the equilibrium analysis under the average efficiency VA. Section 4 presents the equilibrium under the quota-based VA. Section 5 concludes the study.",2

Plastics do not make an exception in this respect. Our aim is to contribute to the theoretical and empirical literature on waste trade. Specifically, the objective of our paper is to achieve a better understanding of the secondhand market of plastic materials, relying on plastic residuals from polyethylene (PE, henceforth). To do this, we take two main steps: we first build up a simple theoretical model of waste trade, to derive relevant testable implications. We model a two-country setting with an exporting and an importing country, to underline how their main economic and institutional features are expected to affect waste streams across countries. The main conclusions in the first part suggest that the dimension of the exporting economy as well as the convexities in disposal costs (as determined, for example, by a worse state of the recycling technology) affect waste trade positively, while the opposite holds with respect to the disposal costs/policies of the importing economy. Results are a little fuzzier if we turn to the impact of sorted disposal technologies, the strictness of controls on waste streams and the disposal and recycling policy in the exporting country. More specifically, if the dimension of the exporting economy is sufficiently large, we find that a stricter sorted disposal policy (and/or stricter controls of the exported material) will lead to a decrease in exports. Also, large unit linear disposal costs (e.g. the landfill tax) in the exporting country imply exports to increase with the regulatory weakness and to decrease with the state of the recycling technology of the importing country. In the second part of the paper, we rely on a negative binomial regression model to test our theoretical results using data on plastics and, in particular, on polyethylene (PE).
Footnote 1 A first striking result is that exporting prices do not seem to matter in export dynamics, suggesting that other factors, rather than prices, are important in explaining PE trade. This is indeed confirmed by other interesting outcomes of our analysis. First of all, and as expected, we show that more integrated economies trade more, but only if waste-related trade is accounted for. Our results also illustrate the role of waste-related policies. Namely, both a larger role for landfilling and a larger recycling rate seem to negatively affect exports. A larger landfilling might indeed suggest a bad waste management, while on the other hand a larger recycling rate might imply that better recycled materials can be used for domestic production. We also conclude that legal rights enforcement in exporting countries does not affect waste trade, although a “pollution haven” hypothesis is indirectly suggested by the negative link between wages in the importing countries and the amount of exported waste. Turning to the impact of income, upper middle income countries feature larger exports. This can be explained in terms of stages of development, as well as with reference to technology, as upper middle income countries are expected not to have a fully developed recycling technology and are likely to be characterized by a rapidly increasing production scale. Finally, and importantly, the state of the waste-related technology seems to have a significant and positive role in explaining PE waste exports. Our paper is related to two strands of literature. Under a theoretical point of view, we link to the papers assessing the determinants and welfare effects of transboundary shipments of waste. Few contributions are available in this respect. Our theoretical model is close to Bernard (2011), who adopts a stylized model of international trade, featuring a monopolistic exporting country and a representative importing firm, using imported goods as inputs in production. The degree of reusability of waste products is a crucial choice variable in the exporting country, and the actual productivity of waste in the importing country is affected by the degree of ""international vigilance"", i.e. the extent to which reusable good can be mixed illegally with non-reusable waste. The driving forces for the movement of illegal waste, paying particular attention to the role of local waste regulations, are investigated and welfare impacts are assessed. Other papers, mainly related to trade in used equipments and goods, can also be found in Bond (1983) and Clerides (2008). We depart from the received literature, in particular from Bernard (2011), by explicitly accounting for non-convexities in waste disposal costs; also, we identify comparative statics results which are not yet investigated. Under an empirical point of view, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of waste trade, such as, among the few others, Levinson (1999a, b), Baggs (2009) and Kellenberg (2012). Levinson’s papers, with reference to the US interstate trade, demonstrate that states that increase hazardous waste disposal taxes experience decreases in hazardous waste shipments from other states. Baggs (2009), using self-reported bilateral data on international hazardous waste shipments for Basel Convention members, finds results in support of the idea that hazardous waste responds to the importing countries’ income level, but concludes that other factors such as distance and capital intensity are more relevant. In a more recent paper, Kellenberg (2012) explores the possibility of international “waste havens” (leading waste to move towards countries featuring a weaker environmental regulation) and discovers that substantially less waste is traded when both the importing and exporting country have ratified the Basel Convention on hazardous waste trade. We depart from such literature as our paper is linked to non-hazardous waste, and as we show a few somehow counterintuitive empirical results on the impact of economic variables on PE waste trade flows. The paper is organized as follows: the following section presents the theoretical model; Sect. 3 performs comparative statics and derives some testable predictions. Section 4 presents the methodology and results of our empirical investigation. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the article.",2

Over the same period of time, many economists have addressed the debate over trade versus the environment.Footnote 1 While the emerging economies have shown remarkable growth, governments in advanced economies like the EU, the US and Japan have encouraged recycling and waste management to form the sound material-cycle society. Therefore, since the emerging economies are reshaping the global economy, incorporating them properly into the global material-cycle system is one of the next major issues for the advanced economies.
Footnote 2
 Recently, the prices of rare-earth metals have surged as a result of an export restriction implemented by China, which produces more than 90 % of the world’s rare earths.
Footnote 3 Consequently, importers are forced to seek alternative sources so as to produce high-tech products. For instance, Japan has started the technique of recycling rare metals known as urban mining, which is the process of extracting rare metals from abandoned consumer electronics products. Increased attention has been drawn to recycling activities, not only because of the limited availability of scarce resources, but also because of growing environmental consciousness. In many industrialized countries, therefore, recycling legislation or regulations that deal with packaging, specific products and materials have been established. At the same time, development of technology for effective recovery and recycling must be promoted through government aid and industrial collaboration among high-tech firms. Various firms have tried to recycle rare earths and metals in Japan. In 2009, the Japanese electronics firm Hitachi began to experiment with extracting rare earths from magnets in old computer hard drives, although the company announced that the project was not expected to be fully operational until 2013.
Footnote 4 Automobile-maker Toyota, which has an alliance with electronics manufacturer Panasonic, recycles batteries for its Prius hybrid vehicle.
Footnote 5 It is postulated that recycling firms tend to be of large scale and will eventually gain some degree of market power over the determination of the price of their recycled materials. Previous studies on the relation between recycling activities and pollution have employed partial or general equilibrium models with perfect competition.
Footnote 6 A first step taken by Eichner (2005) incorporates imperfect competition, specifically monopoly, in the recycling industry in association with a green product design approach.
Footnote 7 However, the consumption goods industry located in the downstream area of the recycling industry is assumed to be perfectly competitive in his model.Footnote 8 More recently, based on a model of international duopoly in a downstream final good market, Higashida and Jinji (2006) identify the government’s use of recycled content standards as a profit-shifting device from a foreign country. They assume instead that the upstream recycled materials are supplied under perfect competition. To our knowledge, there are few studies of recycling and international trade dealing with both upstream and downstream market imperfections, i.e., a model with vertically related markets, other than ours. There is a growing literature on environmental economics with a vertical market structure. Environmental policy models in vertically related markets are studied by Sugeta and Matsumoto (2007), Canton et al. (2008) and Greaker and Rosendahl (2008). The first paper emphasizes the role of the upstream discriminatory-pricing versus uniform-pricing rule in evaluating the welfare effect of the pollution tax shift from the upstream to the downstream market. The other two papers focus on the existence of market power by upstream firms producing environmental goods and services over downstream polluting firms. There are few environmental studies employing an open-economy model of strategic trade with a vertical relationship other than Hamilton and Requate (2004).Footnote 9 They examine a strategic environmental trade policy toward an upstream firm selling a polluting input to a domestic downstream duopoly firm in each country. In their model, the downstream final good is traded internationally, but the upstream input is not. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of market imperfection on the international trade in recycled materials. It is worthwhile asking whether allowing trade in recycled materials is good for the environment or not. We first analyze the conditions for the emergence of bilateral trade in recycled materials and then examine the effects of opening up trade in the upstream as well as downstream markets on environmental damage. We also show that depending on the heterogeneity in recyclability/recovery rates between the two countries, trade liberalization in each vertically related market can be either detrimental or beneficial to the environment. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a basic model with no trade in recycled materials. Section 3 examines the impact of opening up trade in the recycling sectors on environmental damage. Section 4 provides some concluding remarks.",5

According to the European waste hierarchy, in fact, landfill diversion and waste prevention are the two main priorities in new waste management strategies. Moreover, the hierarchy, which is based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and political choices, recognizes that the various systems of treatment of waste have different impacts on the environment. It proposes an overall ranking of different disposal technologies, in which waste prevention is at the top, followed by recycling, recovery, and finally disposal as the last preferred choice. For this reason, in 1999, a European landfill directive was issued (EEA 2007), which can still be considered as the cornerstone of the European waste strategy. This policy measure, like many other European guidelines regarding waste, has to be accepted and implemented at country level, because the goals set by the directive can only be achieved by a decentralised implementation associated with further national legislation. As far as Italy is concerned, we can say that the country is still dominated by landfilling as the main choice for municipal solid waste disposal, but there are significant differences between different provinces. While the northern regions were always more oriented towards a high level of recycling, separate collection and incineration, some southern provinces have lately suffered serious waste crises (for example Campania, see D’Alisa et al. 2010). The causes of these critical conditions are multiple and complex, but can be summarised as: an absence of alternative to landfilling combined with a general scarcity of land, a low level of separate collection and many failures in decentralised policy implementation and in property right enforcement. Furthermore, considering the increasing trend for municipal waste generation that characterises the country,Footnote 1 and the increasing opportunity costs and the scarcity of land in both northern and southern regions, we can understand how waste prevention, landfill diversion and promotion of recycling are hot issues in Italy. The aim of this work is to understand how this process is developing, to try to comprehend whether this reorganization of waste management in Italy is following a path that is converging to a similar point, or if this process is widening the differences between the provinces. In particular, we will estimate, basing our analysis on the literature on CO2 emissions and income growth, if the amount of waste to landfill, and the amount of waste to be recycled and incinerated, is converging among the provinces. The Italian scenario is, in fact, still not clear, and understanding theoretically and empirically if the country is experiencing a process of β-convergence (i.e. the more backward provinces are catching up with the other ones) or σ-convergence (i.e. the disparities between the provinces are decreasing over time), in waste management performances may provide food for thought for further research and policy making. The waste crisis that has affected some southern regions of Italy in the last decade (D’Alisa et al. 2010), together with strikingly different environmental and economic performances between areas within the country, has created problems both regarding the management of local ‘hot spots’ (see, for example, Pasotti 2009, 2010 for an institutional analysis of ‘state failures’ in Naples) and for the positioning of waste infrastructures (Jenkins et al. 2004). State and market failures were both present as pre-conditions of such ongoing crises. This partially unresolved situationFootnote 2 calls for a deep investigation of the overall waste management disparities across the country, which can be summarized by convergence tests. Significant differences in waste management performances across different areas of the country may not be sustainable in the long run, given the complex political implication (state intervention in provincial waste management), and managerial (waste trade) implication that they have. Although convergence-based studies are quite common in environmental literature, they usually suffer from the important lack of a theoretical foundation, as the literature review will show. As a consequence, it would be beneficial to develop a theoretical model able to predict and support the presence of convergence in waste management performances. Anyhow, the three instruments of waste disposal here analysed have very different characteristics, and the development of a single model able to predict behaviour of recycling, landfilling and incineration is not feasible. As a consequence, three different maximization problems should be set up and solved. Despite its relevance, the inclusion of such models is beyond the scope of the present paper, but might possibly be further line of research. In carrying out this analysis, we will also address another extremely relevant issue in waste studies: the role of environmental policies. If on the one hand, the WKC literature demonstrates that environmental policies have been a relevant driver of landfill diversion at both European and Italian level (Mazzanti and Zoboli 2008; Mazzanti et al. 2010), on the other hand it is generally well recognised in growth literature as the policies tend to be endogenous (Easterly et al. 2006). In particular we expect that in this field at least two elements may influence the policy environment and, through the policy, the more general waste management performances. These elements are social polarization and organised crime. Following Easterly et al. (2006) and Keefer and Knack (2002) it is argued in this work that politicians might not be able to enhance good policies if the community in which they live experiences significant social constraints or, in other words, that the absence of social cohesion and the presence of social polarisation can make the policy environment less secure and less stable. These elements have a direct consequence on environmental policies, which in turn may have important effects on waste management choices. Consequently, the presence of social polarisation may affect waste management choices through the lever of environmental policies. Moreover, organised crime may also influence waste management performance through the effect that it exerts on environmental policies. Some recent contributions (D’Amato 2011) show in fact how the presence of organised crime imposes restrictions on the “freedom” of the government in setting taxes on legal disposal and reduces enforcement effectiveness. If these last two assumptions hold, we may claim that a sort of causality exists in the waste sector, that can be explicated as an indirect effect that organised crime and social polarisation have on waste management choices, through their direct effect on waste policies. Summarising, this paper shows how separate collection is actually converging across Italian provinces, while the evidence about landfilling and incineration is less positive, and the disparities across different regions of the country seem to have increased. Moreover, this work stresses how social polarisation, through its effect on environmental policies, has a relevant effect on waste management choices. To reach this goal, it makes use of a data set that includes observations for all the Italian provinces for the time period 1999–2008. Such an extensive period of data allow the study of the national waste management programs from a very decentralised point of view, which helps us to understand the trend for a country like Italy, which is characterised by large differences between the different geographical areas. The presence or absence of convergence in the three main waste treatment options can, in fact, give an important indication, explaining how this process of landfill diversion is actually occurring. From another, more policy-oriented point of view, this work will focus on the problem of policy endogeneity in the field of waste. Section 1 includes a review of the literature placing this work inside the vast economic literature on waste, Sect. 2 gives a brief representation of the European and Italian waste management system, Sects. 3 and 4 include batteries of traditional tests for β- and σ-convergence that test our main research question, and finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",8

Reusing might also help reduce illegal waste; see the analysis on illegal waste in Shinkuma and Managi (2011b, 2012) and policy review on Shinkuma and Managi (2011a). Reusing is also focused theoretically in the electronic waste management (Yokoo 2010; Kinnaman and Yokoo 2011). Increasing the number of refilled bottles makes it possible to use reusable containers numerous times, yielding environmental benefits. The benefits of an increase in refilled bottles are shown by the increase in the high collection rate of reusable bottles (MOE 2009). These results show the necessity of increasing the demand for refilled reusable ones. In Japan, PET bottle production, and one-way bottles in particular, has been increasing. Under the Basic Law for Establishing a Recycling-Based Society, several laws have been passed to promote recycling (Sakai et al 2011), and PET bottles are a main target of this legislation. This system, however, has been criticized for promoting mass consumption and mass recycling. Tasaki et al. (2011) describes the current state of recycling and the policies that have a possibility to overcome this criticism. The reuse of bottles has been increasingly advocated in the interest of a more environmentally friendly society and in light of an impending landfill shortage. Landfill space is even scarcer in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, as the earthquake resulted in huge quantities of disaster waste. The reduction in landfill waste due to bottle reuse can be seen in MOE (2009). MOE (2008) shows that one of the conditions for success in reusing PET bottles is that consumers must accept the reusable bottles. In other words, consumers must purchase the products contained in the refilled reusable PET bottles. Previous studies on refillable bottles have shed insight on this particular issue. Atamer et al. (2012), Ferrara and Plourde (2003) and Grimes-Casey et al. (2007) analyze the manufacturer’s decision to produce reusable containers. On the one hand, Ferrara and Plourde (2003) study the decision-making process of a monopolist supplier of refillable glass bottles, using modeling and numerical examples. On the other hand, Rokka and Uusitalo (2008) consider the consumer decision-making process and perform a conjoint analysis on simple packaging; they infer that environmental friendliness can have a positive impact on whether consumers choose reusable bottles if the reusable bottles are considered as one of the simple packaging. Takahashi et al. (2011) also conduct a conjoint analysis to determine the factors to promote refilling, so that the factors are beverage variety and services for washing refillable bottles. McCarthy (1993) shows the positive effect of deposit–refund systems on the market share of refillable bottles. The deposit–refund system is a system whereby consumers pay deposits that are added to the price of a product and receive refunds when they return the containers. Numata and Managi (2010) also consider the effect of the deposit–refund system on the demand for reusable bottles. However, the factors that increase consumer demand for refilled reusable containers have not been empirically evaluated well, based on data from real projects. In 2008, MOE conducted a pilot project on reusable bottles. Fortunately, we were able to administer questionnaires to consumers over the course of that project. By analyzing the data generated by responses to the questionnaires, we were able to determine which factors increase the demand for refilled reusable containers. While Numata and Managi (2010) use these data to determine the effect of the deposit–refund system on the demand for total reusable containers which include new reusable containers and refilled reusable ones, this paper examines the factors that increase the demand for refilled reusable containers. Although the authors published a summary report on the questionnaires that briefly discusses these factors (MOE 2009), this paper focuses on the demand for refilled reusable containers in more detail. The contents of this paper are as follows. In the next section, we explain the structure of the pilot project conducted by MOE that focused on reusable containers. We also describe the situations under which the questionnaires were administered during the project. In the third section, we discuss the results of the empirical analyses of the data obtained through the questionnaires to deduce the policy implications for increasing the demand of the refilled reusable bottles. In the final section, we present our conclusions and possible directions for future work.",7

The impact of multilateral/unilateral policy reform on welfare and emissions is analyzed, and the impact of product differentiation on the characterization of policy is also explored. A two-country model with product differentiation where firms and governments play a two-stage Cournot–Nash game is employed. The government in each country sets policy and firms then make their output and emission decisions simultaneously. Three key results arise from the analysis, viz., several distinct policy reforms may raise global welfare, reduce global emissions and optimal policy is sensitive to the degree of product differentiation. It is widely agreed upon that if global environmental problems are to be solved, participation across countries is crucial, particularly within the context of the development of effective multilateral environmental policies.
Footnote 1 The literature has studied aspects of multilateral/unilateral environmental policy (e.g., Hoel 1991; Hatzipanayotou et al. 2005; Turunen-Red and Woodland 2004) as well as issues of product differentiation and its impact on policy (e.g., Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas 1995; Poyago-Theotoky and Teerasuwannajak 2002), but the contribution of the present analysis can be narrowed down to the works of Fujiwara (2009) and Lahiri and Semeonidis (2007).
Footnote 2
 Fujiwara (2009) analyzes the sensitivity of policy with respect to the degree of product differentiation in a closed-economy Cournot setting; the only policy considered is an emission tax and abatement efforts by firms is assumed away. One key result from Fujiwara’s analysis is that policy is sensitive to the degree of product differentiation. This paper extends Fujiwara’s work in two fundamental ways. First, a two-country model is considered, thereby including aspects of cross-border pollution and oligopolistic interdependence. Second, the paper adds abatement efforts and an abatement subsidy to the model. These two new elements of analysis allow one to examine, inter alia, the impact that policy setting in other countries may have on the relationship between product differentiation and optimal policy. Lahiri and Symeonidis (2007) consider a two-country model with oligopolistic interdependence with the emission tax as the only policy. The authors explore cases where the tax may increase global emissions as well as the impact of multilateral policy reform, but do not conduct welfare analysis. This paper extends Lahiri and Symeonidis’ work by (1) including an additional policy (i.e., abatement subsidy), (2) examining the welfare implications of multilateral/unilateral policy reform, and (3) exploring the sensitivity of policy with respect to product differentiation. This extension allows one to explore how a subsidy–tax policy combination may help tackle pollution within the context of multilateral/unilateral policy reform in the presence of country asymmetries.
Footnote 3 In particular, the framework of analysis allows one to examine the extent to which a subsidy may affect the ability of the emission tax to reduce global emissions and the role of pollution intensity coefficients in this context. In other words, the model allows one to see whether the subsidy either compensates (i.e., helps reduce emissions) or offsets the effect of a tax in terms of reducing global emissions, and in this analysis the role of the pollution intensity coefficients across countries and degree of product differentiation will be clear. The framework of analysis can be further motivated by the trade relationship between, as well as the tax and subsidy schemes in, Norway and the EU in mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials, a sector which includes two key components in energy production, namely, oil and natural gas.
Footnote 4 Arguably, this is an example of imperfect substitutes in the energy sector where emission taxes (CO2 -based taxes both in Norway and the EU) and subsidies (the NER 300 call for CCS technology for EU member states
Footnote 5 and Norway’s government funding for CCS technology
Footnote 6 to lower production costs) take place.
Footnote 7 A second example which may help justify the present model setup is the car industry in the USA and Germany. In this case, the car industry (1) exhibits horizontal product differentiation (cars of relatively same quality differ in e.g., color), (2) faces an emission tax in the USA in the form of a gas guzzler tax and in Germany in the form of a CO2-based tax on cars, and (3) governments in the USA and Germany have provided subsidies in the form of low-cost loans or grants during the recent economic slowdown.
Footnote 8
 From a policy perspective, the study of the abatement subsidy tax scheme considered here can be motivated also because it intuitively moves the analysis toward a first-best allocation, particularly within the context of imperfect competition. Furthermore, the aspect of product differentiation is relevant because it plays a key role in the characterization of environmental policy as shown, for example, in Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas (1996) and Fujiwara (2009). But this aspect is also important because policy reform, as will be clear from the analysis, may be more or less effective in reducing emissions depending on whether the degree of product of differentiation is small or large. The rest of the article is structured as follows. The next section presents the model followed by some of the results from the comparative statics exercise. Section 4 examines the impact of policy on emissions and Sect. 5 the relationship between policy and the degree of product differentiation. Section 6 presents the impact of multilateral policy on welfare and the last section concludes the article.",11

Many environmental regulations affect consumer product markets. Such environmental regulations may take various forms, i.e., recycling, product standards, taxes, eco-labelling and energy-saving. How to adopt regulation policy schemes while considering the impact on product markets is a central issue in the current environmental policy discussion. Our paper provides some evidences regarding the impact of environmental regulations in the Japanese refrigerator market. The Japanese government adopts a proactive attitude towards environmental problems, as is evidenced by such initiatives as the Kyoto Protocol. This has resulted in drastic changes in environmental regulations over the last decade. This in turn has impacted several product markets. The Japanese refrigerator market has been influenced by two substantially different types of regulation: energy-saving regulation with the leading runner approach, and non-chlorofluorocarbon (non-CFC) regulation. These two types of regulation are enforced by different regulatory bodies: the government (energy-saving regulation) or industry-level self-regulation (non-CFC regulation). They also take different forms, i.e., binary regulation (non-CFC regulation) or index regulation (energy-saving regulation). We therefore feel that the Japanese refrigerator market is a good example on which to test for the impact of environmental regulations on prices. We address three questions: whether environmental regulations lead to an objective attribute of the product and whether consumers perceive ‘eco-ness’ as a characteristic of the product. The second question is whether regulations raise prices and how willing consumers are to pay for environmental regulations. A final question is whether the two different types of regulation have differing impacts on prices. To answer these questions our paper studies Japanese environmental regulations in the refrigerator market. We single this market out due to the following intrinsic features of the market: (1) refrigerators consume the largest amount of energy and have the most substantial environmental burden of all household electronic appliances. (2) The refrigerator market has been subject to several environmental regulations and has been influenced by both international and domestic environmental policies in the last decade. (3) The Japanese refrigerator market is a representative case of successful environmental regulation. (4) The refrigerator market is quite competitive in price and quality. Producers are sensitive to consumer’s behaviour and quality standards. Satisfying environmental regulations leads to the improvement of quality. In empirical studies on quality and price, the hedonic approach has long been used.Footnote 1 In particular, it is often used in fields including: urban economics to study land rents, agricultural economics to study the relationship between food price and quality, and business administration/marketing to study market strategies in electronic household equipment markets. The first group of studies using the hedonic approach analyses the relationship between house rents and air pollution (Beron et al. 2001; Chattopadhyay 1999; Kiel and McClain 1995) and water pollution and amenities (Hoehn et al. 1987).Footnote 2 The second group applies the approach to daily necessities. Kalita et al. (2004) studies many durable and non-durable products using consumer reports and finds that firms use prices as a signal of quality.Footnote 3 Combris et al. (1997) study the Bordeaux wine market using not only objective characteristics of the products, but also sensory characteristics.Footnote 4 In a study closely related to our paper, Greening et al. (1997) study the impact of appliance standards on refrigerator prices and attributes. A third group of studies based on the hedonic approach include studies in business administration. Similar to our paper in methodology and data resource is Ioannidis and Silver (1999, 2003) which use point-of-sale data (POS data) in the UK television set market and propose an augmented method based on the hedonic approach.Footnote 5
 Apart from the hedonic analysis, some papers study the impact of a specific environmental regulation associated with eco-labels on consumer behaviour in a specific commodity market. Using US monthly time series data and an almost ideal demand system, Teisl et al. (2002) find that dolphin-safe labels significantly changed consumer purchases of tuna fish products. Blamey et al. (2000) find that recycled paper labelling had a significant impact on consumers’ purchasing behaviour. Furthermore, Bjorner et al. (2004) test the impact of the Nordic Swan on consumers’ purchases of toilet paper, paper towels and detergents from 1997 to 2001.Footnote 6 Related to the topic of this paper, some studies use the hedonic approach to discuss the impact of environmental policy on commodity prices. Nimon and Beghin (1999), using the hedonic regression in an apparel market, find that environmentally friendly dyes do not have significant impact but organic cotton does. Roe et al. (2001) using the hedonic regression in electricity markets, find that certificated green electricity has a significant impact on consumer purchases. Our paper studies the impact of two environmental regulations, i.e., energy-saving regulation and non-CFC regulation, on refrigerator prices using POS data from 1998 to 2006. Our study has the following characteristics. First, we study the impact of environmental regulation in more detail. We make a comparison in terms of impact between government regulation and sector self-regulation. Second, we study the impact of the introduction of the eco-label system. In what follows we first discuss Japan’s environmental regulations and refrigerator market. In Sect. 3 we discuss some stylised facts on prices. Then Sect. 4 provides estimation results from the hedonic approach and discusses the relationship between environmental regulations and prices. In Sect. 5 we discuss the results. At the end of the paper we draw some conclusions from the analysis.",2

Financial players are often presented by market analysts as outweighing commercial or physical players, buying or selling far more paper barrels than physical players do. Although some financial institutions engage in physical trading of oil by controlling storage facilities, most financial players enter the oil market through futures contracts which do not result in physical delivery. Speculation appears indeed as a possible explanation for the 2008 crude oil price swing. While physical and macroeconomic fundamentals were responsible for the rise in the equilibrium oil price, speculation on the futures price of crude oil might have led to both overshooting of prices in the first half of 2008 and undershooting in the second half of the year. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure speculation in any direct way. One obvious straightforward approach is to look at the data on the open interest of oil futures, which have grown spectacularly for large investors over the last few years (Medlock and Jaffe 2009). In essence, speculation is not necessarily evil, as speculators provide necessary information for futures price formation, especially in terms of supply and expected demand. To put it simply, speculation consists in placing funds whilst understanding fully that this activity entails a high level of risk. Speculators rely mainly on price change expectations with a view to make a profit. The presence of numerous non-professional, therefore speculative, participants gives the market the necessary liquidity so that a producer/trader/consumer can at any time find the counterparty required to open/close an operation. The speculative presence is therefore necessary to give the market the required depth. A physical potential arbitrage/paper ratio of 5 is usually a minimum when considering the efficiency of a forward market. However, the massive arrival of non-financial traders in the oil futures markets following the 2000s institutional reforms in the US has changed the situation radically, and the hypothesis of harmful speculative trading must be considered. In October 2009, the IMF report entitled “Global Financial Stability: Financial Stress and Deleveraging, Macro−Financial Implications and Policy” concluded that speculative positions and oil prices are not strongly linked, without discarding formally the hypothesis of price manipulation by certain participants. In October 2008, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)’s Interagency Task Force Interim Report on Crude Oil was unable to identify a statistically significant effect with a particular class of trader. By 2008, daily trading in paper barrels had reached 15 times the daily world production of oil (of around 85 million barrels per day) and remained at about that level through the first half of 2009.Footnote 1 These numbers provide evidence of the enormous “financialization” of the oil market that has taken place since 2000, and some part of this may reflect speculative activities. As a reaction to this situation, the CFTC has announced on July 7, 2009 that it would consider imposing position limitsFootnote 2 on futures contracts for energy products, which would bring oil in line with the policy of limits the CFTC places on speculative trading in agricultural products like wheat and corn. One main problem, however, arises when using indicators of speculative activity for crude oil futures. First, to isolate the speculative component in the net open positions, one has to separate out commercial and non-commercial positions, since the former are presumably related to hedging rather than speculation. While separate data on commercial and non-commercial net open positions are reported by the CFTC, in practice the distinction between the two is more or less arbitrary. The CFTC has pledged to improve the quality of futures data, as it released on September 4, 2009 sub-categories for the Commitment of Traders weekly report. Since September 4, 2009, the CFTC has been publishing more than 3 years of disaggregated data history included in the weekly “Commitments of Traders (CoT)” report. For the oil market, this data focuses on the NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contract, and supplements data previously available on the CFTC website. The advantage of being able to access disaggregated CFTC data is the distinction between “commercial” and “non-commercial” traders. The CFTC defines a “non-commercial” trader as any trader who does not use oil futures contracts to hedge. Traders looking to hedge are typically producers and consumers of the physical commodity, who use futures contracts to offset the risk of price change. The “non-commercial” traders seek profit by taking positions in the futures market in the hope of gaining from changes in price of the commodity, and have no interest in its physical delivery. The boundary between these two types of trader is extremely blurred, however. There are many uncertainties over the classification made by the CFTC based on the raw data it has available. The CFTC establishes each trader as being “mainly” commercial or non-commercial against its own criteria. These classifications based on raw data escape the public sphere, however, denying the academic community the opportunity to review these classifications. The number of statistical studies using the disaggregated CFTC data is inherently limited by the recent availability of this data in the public domain. Saporta et al. (2009) have developed a vector autoregressive model (VAR) to explain the potential causes of the March–August 2008 shock in the oil market. Their statistical analysis relies on the use of public CFTC data on the long position of non-financial traders, in conjunction with data on crude oil prices, during two sub-samples 2003–2006 and 2006–2008. They conclude very cautiously that the hypothesis of speculative bubble (generated by non-commercial traders) cannot be ruled out totally when explaining the oil price dynamics of 2008. Besides, the authors underline very clearly the advantage in accessing the CFTC confidential data on investor positions, thereby identifying ‘speculator’ flows more accurately. Ribeiro et al. (2009) have further investigated the relationship between commodity prices and trader positions in futures markets in the light of disaggregated data published by the CFTC. They add the net positions of swap dealers and money managers to measure speculative positions. According to their VAR analysis, 96 % of the variance in the weekly price of oil is caused by shocks over inventory levels, whereas the changes in net speculator positions seem to influence oil price volatility only in the short term. Similarly to other studies, Ribeiro et al. (2009) conclude that there is no causal link between net position changes by non-commercial traders and commodity prices (including the oil market). Irwin and Sanders (2012) have also used the CFTC disaggregated CoT report to test the claim that long−only index investment was a major driver of the 2007–2008 spike in commodity and energy futures prices. They provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between legacy, disaggregated and supplemental commitment of traders report, along with a clear explanation of each category. They reveal that commercial traders are segregated into processors and merchants,Footnote 3 as well as swap dealers.Footnote 4 There is considerable uncertainty in this category whether swap dealers’ positions represent an underlying speculative or hedging position. Concerning non-commercial agents, managed money represents positions held by commodity trading advisors (CTA), commodity pool operators (CPO) and hedge funds that manage and conduct futures trading on behalf of clients. The traders included in the managed money category would typically fall in the class of speculative agents. Finally, other reportable are non-commercial traders who are large enough to report, but do not fit into one of the other CFTC categories.Footnote 5 Based on various comparisons between datasets and reports, Irwin and Sanders (2012) cannot conclude that index funds have harmed price discovery in commodity futures markets. In this literature, it is also worth mentioning the contribution by Büyüksahin and Harris (2011), who have accessed a unique CFTC “raw” dataset to test the relation between crude oil prices and the trading positions of various types of traders in the crude oil futures market. The authors apply Granger causality tests between the changes in the WTI price and the changes in positions of non-commercial traders according to CFTC disaggregated data. They cannot establish that the changes by financial institution net positions (large investors + swap dealers) cause in the Granger sense changes in the oil price at a statistically significant level. In this paper, we use the disaggregated CFTC data (namely the open interest positions held by agents’ sub-categories on crude oil futures) to investigate the potential ‘speculative’ behaviour of large investors (hedge funds, pension funds, commodity trading advisers, etc.). Compared to previous literature, the novelty is that we investigate this research question based on Hamilton (1989)’s non-linear Markov-switching model, which allows tracking unobserved changes in macroeconomic conditions with respect to the econometric variable of interest. The importance of taking into account non-linearities when studying the crude oil futures market has been well documented in previous literature. The central issue concerns the non-linear adjustment between the price of crude oil and real output (see Kilian and Vigfusson 2011 for a review). Although no final answer can be reached, Hamilton (2011) asserts that the relation between GDP growth and oil prices is non-linear. Pursuant on this issue, Herrera et al. (2011) also confirm that the oil price–output relationship is non-linear by using a data set of monthly industrial production indices. Hence, there is a case for studying the crude oil price changes in a non-linear framework. Engemann et al. (2011) further illustrate the usefulness of studying oil price changes against the underlying business cycle. Their Markov-switching analysis features that oil prices do have some predictive ability for forecasting recessions, and that oil price shocks can be used to date current turning points. Raymond and Rich (1997) and Clements and Krolzig (2002) can also be cited in this literature studying the behavior of oil prices within the Markov-switching framework. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, no prior study has investigated to date the topic of oil and speculation with CFTC disaggregated data under the angle of business cycle non-linearity. This paper precisely aims at filling this gap. Our main results point towards the influence at statistical levels of the CFTC “Money Managers” net positions category on the WTI crude oil futures price. This result holds whatever the specification employed for the Markov regime-switching model, i.e., with CFTC disaggregated data only, or with other supply- and demand-side fundamentals on the crude oil market. We cannot, however, conclude that this influence of money managers is definite evidence in favour of the hypothesis of speculative trading during the summer 2008. We re-join other studies in the literature (Hamilton 2009b; Kilian and Murphy 2010; Büyükşahin and Harris 2011) by concluding that a wide array of economic forces was at stake during the summer 2008 that may more convincingly be taken as a better explanation than speculation alone behind the 2008 oil price swing. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a background discussion. Section 3 details the Markov-switching analysis and the data used. Section 4 contains the results. Section 5 concludes.",5

He concluded that “virtually none of the systems… exhibits the purity of the instruments which are the subject of theoretical inquiry”, “all … systems… place great importance on the status quo”, and “distributional concerns play an important role in the acceptability” (Hahn 1989: 97, 109).The same insights can be obtained looking at carbon markets in Japan. After successful efforts to increase energy efficiency in the aftermath of the oil price shocks of the 1970s, Japan’s specific national climate policy started in 1990 and is today based on the Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan of 2008 (GoJ 2008).Footnote 1 At the Kyoto Conference in 1997, Japan committed to emission reductions of 6 % by 2008/2012 based on 1990 levels. In addition, at the climate summit in Copenhagen, Japan committed to a 25 % reduction by 2020 and a 60–80 % reduction by 2050 with 1990 as base year (GoJ 2010: 38). Altogether, in 2007, Japan was about 15 % short of its commitment (MoE 2009a), even though a stringent and immediate national climate policy would pay in terms of costs and benefits (Kemfert 2005). On the policy instrument level, Japan’s Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan focuses on industry’s Voluntary Action Plan (Wakabayashi and Sugiyama 2007), which was rather unsuccessful in limiting industries’ absolute emissions. Market-based instruments, on the other hand, are only mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan sporadically. Emission markets for environmental protection have been spreading globally, especially since the new millennium (OECD 2004). While environmental economists had been emphasizing the merits of emissions trading since its invention by Dales (1968),Footnote 2 it took until the 1990s to implement national emission markets in the USA (Ellerman et al. 2000).Footnote 3 In climate politics, emissions trading had not been used before the Kyoto Protocol allowed the Flexible Kyoto Mechanisms. Since then, emissions trading schemes have been evolving rapidly across the globe including supranational system in the EU, national approaches in New Zealand, and even regional and local systems in the northeastern and western USA and the city of Tokyo. In addition, many more countries are seriously considering the use of carbon markets. Experiences are mixed so far, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme being the most vivid example (Ellerman et al. 2010).Footnote 4 Still, carbon markets appear to become the most important policy instrument in global climate policy, capable of being both economically efficient and environmentally effective. Carbon markets in Japan—a leader in environmental policy and technology development in the 1970s and 1980s (Weidner 1992)—have been used since 2005 but only produced modest outcomes. Emission reductions have been negligible, and the creation of an efficient carbon market has failed. Thus, in this paper we try to answer the following questions: What are the major design flaws of the Japanese carbon markets? What are the political reasons behind the failure of Japanese carbon markets? How has the political situation changed after the Great Tōhoku-Earthquake? While political science literature has analyzed environmental policy making in Japan,Footnote 5 there is a gap of knowledge on policy instrument choice in Japanese climate policy with respect to market-based instruments. This is true not only for the literature in western languages but also for Japanese sources, due to a lack in policy feasibility and implementation research in Japan. To date, an individualistic actor-based approach has not been applied to climate policy in Japan. Thus, in order to answer the questions of this paper, we apply environmental economics as well as Public Choice within a case study design.Footnote 6 Besides using existing literature, an extensive qualitative interview study containing more than 50 individual interviews with Japanese climate policy experts and stakeholders was conducted between 2009 and 2011 for data collection. In Sect. 2, we analyze Japan’s carbon markets based on environmental economics’ criteria.

Given the large number of disperse criteria the optimal policy has to meet; it is not surprising that the economic literature has not been able to provide a clear ranking of the available policies. Apart form the inherent properties of the different regulatory approaches the choice of the correct policy instrument is also determined by the specific characteristic of each environmental problem. Differences in climatic and geomorphologic characteristics make certain locations within a catchment more vulnerable to nonpoint pollution than others and demands that instruments should be designed site specific (Panagopoulos et al. 2011). This requirement aggravates the major obstacle for the regulation of nonpoint pollution that emissions are either not observable or cannot be observed at a reasonable cost. Therefore, it is impossible to attribute emissions to particular polluters, and the use of first-best instruments like a Pigouvian tax on the emissions is infeasible. Alternatively, economists have focused on designing instruments to control pollution directly, e.g. economic incentives or standards. However, this requires that the regulated inputs or management practices can be truncated to a subset of choices that can be observed easily and is highly correlated with the emissions of the pollutant (Shortle and Abler 1998; Dosi and Tomasi 1994). This restriction limits these approaches to being second-best. Moreover, enforcing these approaches may provide a powerful instrument for reducing pollution, but may also induce illegal elimination of the pollutant, e.g. illegal dumping or burning, or incorrectly applying the contaminating input in a way that may be less costly but more pollution intensive (Fullerton and Wolverton 2005). In the specific case of nonpoint pollution control, due to the lack of powerful instruments, regulations in EU countries often concentrate on control instruments like technology-related standards and management rules. However, the scientific community lacks tools that use readily available data to investigate the relationships between management rules, site specific characteristics and water quality (Rao et al. 2009). Moreover, these instruments do not involve economic incentives and farmers do not act voluntarily. Consequently, introducing clean technologies and implementing good codes of environmental practices have often failed to solve nonpoint source pollution problems (Abdalla et al. 2007). Palmer and Walls (1997), Walls and Palmer (2001) and Fullerton and Wolverton (2000) propose alternative incentive-based instruments that maintain most of the properties of a first-best Pigouvian tax while minimizing the need for monitoring and enforcement. These are called two-part instruments and consist of a tax on the contaminating product, or input and either a subsidy for recycling the product at the end of its lifetime, or for employing a clean technology. Fullerton and Wolverton (1999) provide a first-best, closed-form solution within a general equilibrium framework, as do Walls and Palmer (2001) within a partial equilibrium framework. Two-part instruments can be considered as a generalization of the deposit–refund system on products such as glass bottles or batteries. However, in contrast to deposit–refund systems, two-part instruments do not imply that the tax and the subsidy are identical and they do not relate to the same commodity or the same agent. Two-part instruments aim to avoid enforceability and control problems inherent in previous approaches by simultaneously taxing a product and subsidizing other market transactions, such as purchasing a clean input or employing a clean technology. As noted by Fullerton and Wolverton (2005), the two-part instrument can be employed within a wide variety of contexts. One such context is the control of nonpoint source pollution; however, this approach has not been explored in the existing literature. The objective of this article is to design different two-part instruments that induce the socially optimal level of nonpoint source pollution. The different instruments are analysed and compared to assess their applicability in practice. In this respect, designing two-part instruments to control nonpoint source pollution can be considered as a novel instrument in the economic literature. The design of these instruments for nonpoint source pollution, however, has to overcome several problems which have not been considered in the previous literature. To analyse two-part instruments in a realistic context it is necessary to specify the production process as precisely as possible and, in particular, to model different outputs and several inputs as well as their interdependencies. Only in this way is it possible to define the tax or subsidy base unambiguously so that firms cannot escape tax payments or receive subsidies in a fraudulent way. In contrast to the model suggested by Fullerton and Wolverton (2005), the input or technology cannot be classified as clean or dirty in the context of nonpoint source pollution, but rather the way the input is applied leads to lower or higher emissions. Therefore, technical progress is not embodied in capital or in the input, but in management practices. This leads to the problem that the application of the input itself cannot form part of a two-part instrument although its purchase constitutes an observable market transaction. To overcome the problem of being unable to observe management practices, we have introduced the figure of an accredited firm to validate that the input is applied in accordance with good environmental practices. In other words, we create a market for the best management practices, and the market transactions can be used to design the two-part instruments. Since the adoption of good environmental practices is often voluntary our proposal also relates to the literature on voluntary agreements. Segerson and Wu (2006) for instance combine voluntary and mandatory policies to induce cost minimizing abatement behaviour for nonpoint source pollution. They show that the combination of both types of policies is more efficient than each policy on its own if the tax can be applied retroactively. However, as noted by the authors this condition is frequently not given in practice. Millock et al. (2002, 2012) also combine a voluntary policy (installation of a monitoring technology) and a mandatory policy (emission tax). Lankoski et al. (2010) propose a similar approach. However, instead of a monitoring technology they propose self reporting. In this respect our proposal is close to the approaches chosen by Millock et al. (2002, 2012) and Lankoski et al. (2010). However, their approach is based on the existence of a monitoring technology or self reporting while our approach relies on an accredited firm that guarantees compliance. Moreover, their policy design focuses on emissions or input use while the presented approach here provides not only policy options for the regulator with respect to emissions (Millock et al. 2002, 2012) or predominately contaminating inputs (Lankoski et al. 2010) but also with respect to a variety of non-contaminating inputs and all outputs. The principal difference between the proposal of this paper and the approaches in the previous literature resides in the fact that it considers multiple inputs and outputs. This distinction is important if the firm produces more than one output and the utilized inputs are complements or substitutes among each other, or if the production of the different outputs is related. This later bond may emerge in form of a vertical chain of different outputs, or in form of byproducts either as a good or a bad. In this situation the presented approach provides additional policy instruments (taxes, subsidies, rebate on all inputs and outputs), and it takes account of the distortions of the production process that will not be considered if the policy makers rely only on input orientated models, or if the complementary or substitutable relationship between all inputs is not considered. The analysis in this article leads to a proposal to design economic incentives for the implementation of good environmental practices by making use of a mix of pure regulatory approaches. For the sake of better understanding we frame the analysis within the context of corn and swine production in which the resulting manure (byproduct of swine production) can be managed according to good or bad practices. Nevertheless, the analysis is also applicable to other nonpoint source pollution where the regulator finds it difficult or very costly to monitor good practices.",2
15.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,03 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-013-0055-9,The impact of policy diffusion on optimal emission taxes,July 2013,Peter Michaelis,Thomas Ziesemer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Non-cooperative behavior is a recurring theme whenever the internalization of negative environmental externalities is analyzed in a setting with more than one country. For instance, strategic environmental policy games show that the resulting Nash-equilibrium usually is characterized by a trade-off between the firms’ rent-seeking motive and the reduction in environmental harm, which regularly leads to ecological dumping (Rauscher 2005). The latter implies a downward adjustment of the instruments’ strength, e.g., the rate of an emission tax, until the according reaction functions intersect. That is, the government’s decisions regarding the instruments’ respective strength are strategic substitutes. This result, in turn, is the consequence of the inherent disincentive of the governments to pre-commit to their regulatory decision in a game of simultaneous decision-making. In principle, the interdependency underlying the strategic environmental policy models captures the reaction of one government upon the policy decision of its counterpart. These multi-stage games, which basically are a modification of the classic strategic trade models (Spencer and Brander 1983; Brander and Spencer 1985), consider the above described non-cooperative decisions about the respective strength of environmental policies in different setups. The latter comprise analyses of the interdependencies of emission taxes and subsidies (Conrad 1993), varying configurations of competition and market structure (Barrett 1994), the impact of emission-reducing R&D expenditures (Simpson and Bradford 1996, Ulph and Ulph 1996), or the inclusion of an environmental service sector (Feess and Muehlheusser 2002). However, Bárcena-Ruiz (2006) shows that simultaneous decision-making is not the only possible setup; countries may move sequentially due to the impact of transboundary pollution. If pollution spillovers are sufficiently low, emission taxes are strategic complements due to the pollution shifting effect known from Kennedy (1994) that is a country has an incentive to shift production to another country to avoid environmental damage. Consequently, emission taxes and social welfare are higher compared to the standard simultaneous decision-making setting. In case of high emission spillovers, this incentive diminishes and emission taxes may become strategic substitutes. Our model follows this idea but leaves aside the pollution shifting effect to find another rationale that explains the possibility of a gradual spread of policies among countries, and how this spread influences the governments’ regulation schedules and their attitude toward acting as a leader. A swift glance at the real world of environmental policy making shows that policies employed elsewhere may indeed be adopted by second-movers. One example is the gradual spread of CO2/energy taxes as can be seen from Table 1.Footnote 1
 Hence, we ask, if policy adoption is a systemic determinant of policy making, whether this issue can be implemented into the context of strategic environmental policy. To begin with, a review of the literature on the topic of policy convergence ultimately provides three explanations for the spread of policies (Elkins and Simmons 2005): (1) policy makers respond similarly to similar conditions in an independent and uncoordinated way; (2) the propagation of policies ensues from an interdependent and coordinated process, which may involve either harmonization or imposition; and (3) policy makers decide uncoordinatedly, but in doing so they consider their counterparts’ choices. We focus on the third explanation because both the first explanation, which involves no strategic interactions, and the second, which deals with coordinated policy convergence, does not add much to the ongoing debate that concern the prediction of ecological dumping made in strategic environmental policy games. The third explanation, which refers to the diffusion of policies, has also been dubbed “uncoordinated interdependence” (Elkins and Simmons 2005, p. 35) and, therefore, corresponds to the non-cooperative settings in strategic environmental policy games. According to the majority of scholars, we view policy diffusion as the process by which a political innovation—such as the introduction of a novel emission tax—disseminates over time among countries (Rogers 2003). This implies that at least one country has to act as a first-mover in terms of policy making. The choice of the first-mover is then expected to alter the probability of further policy adoptions (Strang 1991). These notions can be readily translated into a non-cooperative Cournot game in which a government sets an emission tax under consideration of the other player’s decision. Although the aforementioned example of the spread of energy taxes refers to transboundary pollution, the focus of our model is local pollution. We restrict our analysis to local pollution because we are mainly interested in the strategic effects that arise due to the impact of the governments’ policy choices on the established trade mechanism of strategic environmental policy games. To motivate one country to play leader, we assume that the domestic country has a higher damage parameter which may result from (1) a higher vulnerability of the environment, or (2) a higher aggregated demand for a sound environment. Accordingly, we can analyze how the prospect of policy diffusion affects the decisions of a government concerning the setting of an optimal emission tax. The higher the domestic government sets its emission tax rate, the higher the probability that the foreign government adopts this policy. Nonetheless, our simple model is not meant to give a detailed account on the determinants of policy diffusion. By focusing on asymmetric damage parameters, we rather aim at investigating one motivation that may explain its emergence. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the model and in Sect. 3, we analyze the equilibrium domestic tax rate in the case of an exogenously given probability of policy diffusion. In Sect. 4, we then compare the results of our Stackelberg-setting with the conventional simultaneous non-cooperative game. In Sect. 5, we discuss the determinants of policy diffusion and analyze the resulting impact on the optimal domestic tax rate. Finally, in Sect. 6, we summarize the main conclusions of our model.",1

15.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,23 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-013-0057-7,"Democracy, income and pollution",July 2013,Clas Eriksson,Joakim Persson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The empirical literature on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)
Footnote 1 indicates that democracy is good for the environment. For example, Harbaugh et al. (2002) include an index of democracy among the regressors to explain the level of pollution in a sample of countries. They report negative relationships between democracy and the concentrations of sulphur dioxide, smoke and total suspended particulates. This pattern is robust and arises in numerous specifications.
Footnote 2
 This paper theoretically examines a mechanism that provides an explanation of these results. We use a model where environmental policy is determined by the median voter. The analysis focuses on two different effects. On the one hand, a democratization process typically changes the income of the median voter and, thus, his preferred environmental policy. On the other hand, income growth on the macro level is also the main driver of the EKC curve itself. A central purpose is to single out each of these two mechanisms. Regarding the effect of democratization, the historical analysis in Aidt et al. (2006) indicates that it is often poorer groups who enter the electorate when it is expanded (see also Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). These results, thus, indicate that when a country becomes more democratic the income of the median voter tends to fall, ceteris paribus. Following the results in Harbaugh et al. (2002), this median voter prefers a cleaner environment than the richer median voter in a less democratic country, with the same average income. In other words, poorer individuals prefer a cleaner environment. At the same time, the EKC literature provides evidence that countries improve aspects of the environment as their per capita incomes rise, at least when per capita income has surpassed some critical level. It, thus, appears that there could be notable differences between responses to changed incomes on the individual and aggregate levels, respectively. We, therefore, examine what the common requirements are for the model to give the following two results: (1) pollution declines if the country as a whole gets richer; (2) pollution declines if the median voter becomes a person with a lower income. A possible explanation for a negative empirical relation between democracy and pollution could come from the assumption that poorer groups are more exposed to emissions, e.g. because they live closer to polluting activities. We have provided an analysis along such lines in Eriksson and Persson (2003). This paper explores an alternative mechanism, which is based only on core micro fundamentals: preferences and technology. This makes income (individual and national) the primary driver of the pollution time path.
Footnote 3 By reducing the importance of the localization of voters, this paper focuses on emissions that are uniformly mixing, reaching all inhabitants to the same extent. We, thus, foremost have mobile air pollutants in mind. In the analysis below, we extend the model of our earlier paper (Eriksson and Persson 2003), by generalizing the elementary functions, which earlier were all constant-elastic. We thereby obtain modifications of the results that are non-trivial. In particular, we are able to make a distinction between the effects on pollution, following an income change on the individual level and on the economy-wide level, respectively. The production side of the economy has an exogenous production and pollution capacity, which grows at the same rate as aggregate productivity. This scale effect on pollution can be counteracted by a technique effect, through switches to cleaner production methods, at the cost of a lower growth in income. The technical standard is decided by the median voter, who faces a trade-off between consumption and environmental quality. The results of the paper depend largely on two elasticities, \(\zeta\) and σ. The former is derived from the transformation function between pollution and income: \(\zeta\) is the elasticity of the slope of this function. A high \(\zeta\) means that it costs much, in terms of lost income, to reduce pollution. We define σ as the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption. If σ is large, the marginal utility of consumption declines rapidly when consumption increases, which tends to make the consumer more prone to seek higher utility from reduced pollution. To get the effect that more democracy lowers pollution, it is required that σ < 1 for the median voter when a democratization makes the median voter poorer. Thus, the utility function cannot exhibit satiation in consumption, although this has been pointed out as important for a reduction of pollution in other models (e.g. Stokey 1998). For the model to generate the result that pollution is reduced as the entire economy gets richer, it is required that \( \zeta < \sigma\). Thus, for a decline of pollution in response to growth in aggregate productivity level, a moderately high σ must be compensated by a ‘generous’ curve of transformation (between income and pollution), i.e. by a low \(\zeta\). These results arise because individual productivity and aggregate productivity have different effects on the individual households’ desired environmental policy. In particular, only the economy-wide productivity will influence the marginal cost of pollution. This absence of a perceivable individual influence on the marginal cost is due to the public-bad nature of pollution. There is an obvious formal similarity between this paper and the articles by Romer (1975), Roberts (1977), Meltzer and Richard (1981) and others, which endogenize the size of public spending in median voter models. Since we here consider pollution (a public bad), however, there is no need to finance the supply of it (as opposed to the public good in those papers). Moreover, the motives for subsidizing the reduction of pollution are weak.Footnote 4 There is, thus, no need to raise public funds in this paper (and no need to explicitly model any governmental budget constraint), since the environmental policy is implemented by a technical standard. These modelling differences make this paper more specialized towards environmental policy, in contrast to the papers mentioned above which consider public goods. Although using a median voter model is a simplification,Footnote 5 it serves as an initial check on how individual preferences can be transformed into social policy, and it is also a useful reference point to which one can compare the outcomes of more elaborate political models. In particular, this model is suitable for an examination of the interaction between various properties of fundamental microeconomic functions in the determination of environmental policy. The median voter model has not been frequently used in the literature on the endogenous formation of environmental policy, but some examples are McAusland (2003), which analyzes the endogenous formation of environmental policy in open economies, and Jones and Manuelli (2001), which presents a dynamic analysis of environmental policy.Footnote 6
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The model is presented in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, the preferred environmental policy is derived, in particular, for the median voter. In Sect. 4, we examine how the preferred policy varies in response to changes in aggregate and individual productivity, respectively. We analyze the consequences of these changes on pollution in Sect. 5, where we also compare the results to the empirical observations mentioned above. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1
15.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,06 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-013-0061-y,Residential preferences for stable electricity supply and a reduction in air pollution risk: a benefit transfer study using choice modeling in China,July 2013,Taro Ohdoko,Satoru Komatsu,Shinji Kaneko,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The demand for electricity in China has increased sharply in recent years. According to the Tenth 5-year plan (2001–05), the Chinese government expected electricity demand to grow by 5 % annually, whereas in reality it increased by 12.9 % (Japan Electric Power Information Center Inc. 2006). Maintaining a stable power supply to meet accelerating energy consumption in China is essential for sustaining economic development. However, a recent succession of large-scale power breakdowns in China has had adverse consequences for both the economy and citizens (see, among others, Andrews-Speed et al. 1999; Steenhof and Fulton 2007; Wang 2007). For example, during the summer of 2005, the power supply was restricted in 26 of China’s 30 mainland provinces and provincial-level municipalities and cities because of insufficient supply (Japan Electric Power Information Center Inc. 2006). The potential loss of national income caused by similar power breakdowns in 1994 (Yang and Yu 1996) was estimated at 140–470 million renminbi (RMB) in 1990 prices. Similarly, Yuan et al. (2007) showed that electricity consumption unilaterally caused economic growth, and that the energy sector and the whole economy would be unsustainable under the existing economic structure. Using data from Shanghai, Sun et al. (2009) concluded that the outage cost of the electricity supply is much higher than the average cost of the supplied electric energy. This cumulative evidence demonstrates that preventing future power breakdowns and ensuring a reliable power supply constitute important policy items for China. Maintaining a balance between electricity supply and demand in China requires power generation to increase in volume. Increasing thermal power generation from coal is one of the more promising approaches because China has large coal stocks relative to its oil and natural gas reserves. In 2001, thermal power generation accounted for 81.2 % of total power generation, and 95 % of thermal power generation was dependent on coal power generation (Zhu et al. 2005). However, as coal power plants also emit air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides [SOX; mostly sulfur dioxide (SO2)], and particulate matter (PM), including PM2.5 and PM10, policy is also required to encourage a decrease in these pollutants. The main pollutants from coal power plants are PM and SO2 (Xue et al. 2005). Nationally, China’s thermal power plants discharged on average 41 % of China’s SO2 emissions in 2004 (Japan Electric Power Information Center Inc. 2006). Furthermore, PM from coal power generation accounts for about one-third of the total discharge by China’s industrial sector (Zhu et al. 2005). At the same time, coal power plants have fallen behind in terms of adopting countermeasures to decrease pollutants. For example, just 12.6 % of all coal power generation units in China have installed desulfurization equipment (Horii 2008). Therefore, policy in China should aim to ensure a simultaneous increase in the reliability of the power supply and the better adoption of countermeasures for pollutants associated with the power supply. From a policy perspective, it is vital to evaluate the benefits of maintaining a reliable power supply while minimizing the level of pollutants. When evaluating those benefits, it is important to consider not only residential consumer surplus in China but also, inevitably, the effect on producer surplus. It is also reasonable to assume that Chinese residents face a trade-off between a more stable electricity supply and a reduced risk of air pollution associated primarily with electricity supply causing serious health problems. Thus, when conducting a cost–benefit analysis (CBA) of this trade-off, it is necessary to capture the preference structure for Chinese residents. Nevertheless, although value estimates are a prerequisite for the implementation of CBA for policy decisions such as these, benefit assessments in developing countries are generally insufficient because of a lack of suitable financial and human resources, at least when compared with those available in developed countries. Accordingly, when estimating these values, we should not only address the conventional investigation of policy benefits but also consider alternative methods. In the conventional investigation of residential benefits, choice modeling (CM) is generally appropriate because it is able to assess several policy variables at the same time (Louviere et al. 2000). CM usually involves choosing preferred types through, say, a choice experiment (CE), or ranking different types, using perhaps contingent ranking (CR), in such a way that clarifies the preferences for multiattribute options. For instance, in China, Zhai and Suzuki (2008) conducted a CE on environmental management and regional development in coastal areas. However, because the opportunity and timing of such surveys in China tend to be limited, CR appears more appropriate because of its capability to extract a richer set of information. As for an alternative method, benefit transfer (BT), which estimates benefits using the results of previous studies, could be one of the more promising approaches for developing countries. Because BT uses previously estimated benefits, we can measure benefits quickly and at lower cost. In addition, CM is consistent with BT analysis in environmental valuation studies (Morrison et al. 2002; Morrison and Bergland 2006) because CM is sufficiently flexible to adjust the values of the policy instruments, such as the degree of health risk reduction. Therefore, in this study, we conduct both CM surveys and a BT study on the economic evaluation in China of a stable electricity supply and a reduction in health risk related to local air pollution. To ensure sufficient observations from the surveyed respondents, we employ CR. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the previous research on the stability of energy supplies, local air pollution risk reduction, and BTs. Section 3 describes our survey design and details the chosen econometric methods. Section 4 provides the estimated results, which we discuss in Sect. 5. Finally, in Sect. 6, we present our concluding remarks and present several topics for future research.",7

One day, a person moves in next to the club and starts complaining about the music noise. Does the club have to spend money to reduce its music noise? If the neighbor continues to complain about the noise even after the club taking necessary measures, does the club have to be closed down? This is a situation that many music clubs in Australia face today (Daily Pedestrian 2010; Australian Capital Territory 2011). Environmental disputes arise at all levels of society, and a compromise needs to be reached for their resolution. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is a non-adversarial process meant for resolving disputes with the assistance of a neutral third party, and many countries have nowadays promoted its use for environmental dispute resolution.Footnote 1 Therefore, it is important to identify the factors that influence the effectiveness of environmental ADR. As in the above music club case, the order of occupancy often becomes a point at issue in dispute settlement. When addressing pollution complaints, do mediators have to necessarily consider who occupied the area first? There are diverse opinions on the need for this consideration. While some argue that the order of occupancy should be considered for the resolution of environmental disputes, others argue that it should not be considered (Haritsuka 2005; Iida 2007). The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine whether the order of occupancy is reflected in the environmental ADR practiced in Japan. Coase’s theorem predicts the maximization of social welfare when the right to use an environmental resource is assigned to the person showing the highest willingness to pay for its use in the current period. However, as an example of emission trading systems would show, grandfathering of polluters is considered in the introduction of pollution control measures. Using the order of occupancy as a proxy for grandfathering, we examine whether it can be considered in environmental ADR procedures empirically. If it can be considered, we predict that a society will not achieve the first-best resource allocation when resolving environmental disputes. As of now, only a few analytical studies have been carried out on environmental ADR, because relevant data are scarce. Environmental ADR is still rather uncommon in Europe (Holzinger 2000), and adequate records are not available. In the USA, where the private sector has taken the initiative to develop environmental ADR, standardized records are not available (Sipe 1998).Footnote 2 Contrastingly, in Japan, the public sector leads in the development of environmental ADR, therefore, volumes of records are available for analysis. In view of data limitations in other geographical regions, this paper analyzes a micro-level dataset of environmental disputes obtained from the Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission (EDCC) of Japan. Although several studies have examined the effectiveness of command and control environmental regulations, only few have examined consensus-based regulations. Matsuno (2007) studied the Pollution Control Agreements (PCAs) in Japan and reported that they played a larger role in reducing sulfur oxides emissions than any other policy instruments in the country. No other study has yet examined the effectiveness of consensus-based regulations in a systematic way. To evaluate the impact of the order of occupancy on the effectiveness of environmental ADR, we use a duration model in this study. The results of the duration analysis reveal that the order of occupancy does impact the effectiveness of environmental ADR. We find that environmental ADR becomes less successful when the polluter occupied the area first. More specifically, we find that dispute settlement takes longer when the polluter emitting air pollutants or creating noise occupied the area prior to the victims’ occupancy. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the environmental ADR practiced in Japan. In Sect. 3, we summarize the data used in this study. Section 4 presents the duration model for our empirical analysis. Section 5 reports the estimation results. Section 6 concludes the paper.",
15.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,22 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-013-0065-7,Effects on growth of environmental policy in a small open economy,October 2013,George Adu,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines the effect of optimal environmental policy on economic growth in a small open economy in which pollution is an argument in both the utility and production functions. This paper extends the basic model to a small open economy in which capital can flow across national borders and thus offers a complementary explanation to the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH). The central question that this paper answers is what determines whether a country imports capital (and thereby hosts considerable volumes of polluting production) or exports capital (leaving considerable part of polluting production to the rest of the world)? In addition to this, we examine how the preference for a clean environment (environmental policy) influences national income and its growth rate. The present paper complements the existing theoretical literature on the PHH phenomenon. In particular, we extend the basic static multi-sector trade models in the previous literature (e.g., Copeland and Taylor 1994, 2003) into a dynamic model in the spirit of Di Maria and Smulders (2004). To do this in a simplified framework, we use a one-sector aggregated growth model with pollution, similar to Brock (1977),Footnote 1 which allows for international capital flows. In the previous literature, a higher demand for environmental quality forces (some of) the dirty production sector abroad. In this paper, a high demand for environmental quality directs savings away from polluting domestic production investments to investments on the “clean” (from the small country’s perspective) international capital markets. Thus, differences in environmental regulation standards across national borders can be a major source of differences in capital per unit of effective labour and hence long-run income distribution. The model contains only one physical kind of good, but foreigners can buy domestic output and domestic residents can buy foreign output. The function of international (and inter-temporal) trade in our model is to allow domestic production to diverge from domestic expenditure on consumption and investment. Thus, we consider the intertemporal aspects of international trade but neglect the implications for patterns of inter-sectoral specialization and comparative advantage in production. The latter case is well addressed in the previous literature (see for instance Copeland and Taylor 2003; Levinson and Taylor 2008). Since this paper offers a complementary explanation to the PHH phenomenon, it is important to take a brief review of this strand of the literature here. The central prediction of the PHH is that liberalized trade in goods will lead to the relocation of pollution intensive production from high income and stringent environmental regulation countries to low income and lax environmental regulation countries. The existing literature on the PHH can be divided into two: theoretical and empirical studies on inter-country trade flows (Copeland and Taylor 1994, 2003; Levinson and Taylor 2008) and studies (mainly empirical) on plant and industrial location (foreign direct investment) decisions (Kalamova and Johnstone 2011; Javorcik and Wei 2004; List and Co 2000). In the studies that focus on regulatory stringency and trade flows, the conclusions seem to back the existence of pollution haven effect (see for instance Levinson and Taylor 2008; Copeland and Taylor 2004; Brunnermeier and Levinson 2004; Ederington and Minier 2003). In this paper, we will theoretically analyze how environmental preferences influence the decision to invest abroad and at home, respectively. Thus, more relevant to the present paper is a strand within the PHH literature that focuses on the role of capital mobility, in the form of foreign direct investment. Millimet and List (2004) find that the impacts of environmental policy on industry location depend crucially on heterogeneity of location-specific attributes. List and Co (2000) suggest that stringent environmental regulation does influence negatively the location decisions of inward FDI in the US. Keller and Levinson (2002), however, find a less robust evidence of the pollution haven effect at the industry level. Xing and Kolstad (2002) find that US outbound flows move significantly to host countries with more lax environmental regulations in the heavily polluting industries. The industry-level evidence shows that environmental regulation can influence negatively the location decision of a specific industry, while having no effect on another polluting industry (e.g., Keller and Levinson 2002; Henderson and Millimet 2007; Waldkirch and Gopinath 2008). There are only a few papers using FDI data to study pollution havens at the global level. Javorcik and Wei (2004) studied the determinants of actual and planned investment by 534 major multinational firms in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union. They find no robust support for the PHH. The theoretical model of Eskeland and Harrison (2003) shows that, depending on possible complementarities between capital and pollution abatement, environmental regulation can lead to an increase or a decline in investment in both the host (developing) country and the originating (developed) country. In their empirical analysis, they find some evidence that foreign investors are concentrated in sectors with high levels of air pollution in Mexico, Venezuela, Morocco and Ivory Coast, although the evidence is weak. In their recent study, Kalamova and Johnstone (2011) established two major results regarding the effect of stringent environmental policy and FDI flows. First, they show that a relatively lax policy in the host country has a positive (although small) effect on incoming FDI flows in both developed and developing countries. However, this effect tends to exhibit an inverse U-shape, and thus reverses below a certain level of environmental stringency in the sample of non-OECD host countries. Thus, once the environmental regime of a host country becomes too lax, this country loses its attractiveness as an FDI location. Our analysis reveals the following conclusions. Within our framework we show that it is not changes in comparative advantage due to differences in environmental policy per se that generates the pollution havens, but the fact that the environmental quality is a normal good. Environmental care imposes a drag on long-run economic growth, by increasing the capital–output ratio and lowering the returns to capital. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the drag that the demand for environmental quality imposes on growth is larger (smaller) in the open economy if consumption grows faster (slower) than the capital stock [i.e., the economy is a net exporter (importer) of capital]. Our analysis of the open economy case also reveals that whilst the growth rates of consumption, output, the capital stock and pollution are constant, there are three possible qualitative scenarios with respect to the debt depending on the relation between the growth rates of consumption and the capital stock. First, we considered a benchmark scenario in which consumption and capital grow at a common rate. Under this scenario, we show that the debt and capital stock grow at a common rate and hence the debt–capital ratio is constant at all points in time. The implication of this is that the history of the debt and the capital stock puts a constraint on the initial consumption level. We show that a country which has had a history of generous lending will benefit from it twofold. It can afford to choose a high consumption path and also have a considerable share of its income from the international capital market, which does not cause any negative pollution effect on this country. In the second case where consumption grows faster than the capital stock, we show that the small open economy eventually exports capital (negative debt) to the rest of the world by accumulating assets abroad over time. This process is faster if the elasticity of marginal disutility of pollution is high relative to the rest of the world so that it has higher drag on (production) growth. As a final scenario, we considered the opposite case where the capital stock grows faster than consumption. In this case, we show that the economy imports capital due to the low aversion to pollution, and thus accumulate debt. To summarize, we show that a high demand for environmental quality in our small open economy is found to induce capital flight to countries with lower demand for environmental quality. This result offers an alternative restatement of the PHH. The theoretical findings of this paper suggest that empirical study of a panel of countries that are at the same level of development may find little evidence or none at all for the pollution haven hypothesis. The reason is that their demand for environmental quality will be about the same. This is the potential source of conflicting findings in the empirical literature on pollution havens. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 sets up the basic open economy growth model in which pollution augments the primary inputs (man-made capital and labour) in the production process. The model solution and its implication for long-run growth are discussed in Sect. 3. Section 4 modifies our basic model of Sects. 2 and 3 to a closed economy model with optimal policy and also compares the results in the open economy with the closed economy outcome. Section 5 concludes the paper. All the analyses in the paper are based on command optimal solution. The decentralized solution is presented in the Appendix 1 and 2 and the equivalence between command optimum and the decentralized solution is established therein.",1

EU policy is putting a stronger emphasis on resource efficiency and Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) as key themes for achieving a green economy pathway (see the EU Resource efficiency roadmap launched on 20.9.2011, EC, 2011Footnote 2). The ‘20 years from the Porter hypothesis’ event in 2010 (Porter 2010; Ambec et al. 2010) added fuel to discussions about combining the goals of sustainability and competitiveness and the role in this of environmental regulation (Costantini and Mazzanti 2012), within micro, meso and macro perspectives (Mazzanti and Montini 2010). It is possible for heavy sectors to remain competitive if there is a positive correlation between economic and environmental performance paths, driven by regulation and (eco)innovations (Horbach 2008; Johnstone 2007). The manufacturing sector is prominent in this debate because of its relatively high impacts on the environment and high potential for innovation (Marin and Mazzanti 2013). Thus, analysis of manufacturing is relevant to understand the industry mix effects and the technological drivers of sustainable production, focused on win–win economic–environmental gains (Mazzanti and Zoboli 2009a). Research into how to achieve higher added value is along three directions: (1) the effects of environmental performance and innovation on economic performance, given the relatively bigger space occupied by the drivers of environmental innovation; (2) increased attention to the dynamics of short- and medium/long-run relationships (Costantini and Mazzanti 2013); (3) extending micro and meso level analyses of manufacturing to other industries. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 illustrates the literature background. Section 3 defines the conceptual framework on which the research hypotheses are based, and discusses the data sources, the empirical model and the econometric methodology.

However, due to dual market failures investment in these technologies is limited: The first market failure results from the public goods nature of knowledge which leads to underinvestment in R&D. External benefits arise because the inventor fails to account for the full value of social returns from R&D activities. The second market failure comes from the fact that resource prices do not reflect the true social costs of global warming with the result that there are insufficient incentives to reduce greenhouse gases. Unless there are ancillary benefits for inventors or users the market for climate-friendly technologies that reduce emissions will be limited. Yet, environmental and innovation policies can be an important driving force for investment. Since these policies and other innovation determinants typically differ between countries, the development and diffusion of new technologies and new knowledge proceed unevenly. The main focus of today’s climate policies is on reducing carbon dioxide (CO2). This is understandable since CO2 is by far the biggest contributor to the human-made greenhouse effect. However, there are other potent greenhouse gases which are less important in terms of absolute volume but have a high global warming potential and thereby represent a significant threat to the global climate when released. Among those other greenhouse gases are the fluorinated gases (F-gases) which are primarily used as refrigerants in air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, as propellants for sprays, as insulating material, or as fire extinguishers. F-gases currently cause about 2 % of the greenhouse effect whereby their share is expected to rise to up to 6 % by 2050. Relative to CO2, the global warming potential of some of these gases is higher by a factor of several thousands. Recent policy efforts aim to reduce emissions by technical means (e.g. the use of leak tight systems), the replacement of gases with a high global warming potential by more benevolent alternatives and the use of alternative systems or equipment. This paper considers technologies in the mobile air-conditioning sector which accounts for about a third of total greenhouse gas emissions from the air-conditioning and refrigeration sector. As opposed to other subsectors (domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration, transport refrigeration and room/stationary air-conditioning) mobile air-conditioning can be delineated fairly easily, is more relevant in terms of greenhouse gas emissions than most other subsectors and is targeted (partly) by other regulations. This paper attempts to link two main aspects of technological change, the inducement of new innovations and the diffusion of knowledge. The paper contributes to the relatively small literature on the diffusion of knowledge on environmental technologies in an international context, in particular by distinguishing between environmental and other technologies. The empirical analysis is based on an induced-innovation framework and tests propositions advanced by the theory of environmental lead markets. We use patents from the World Patent Statistics Database (PATSTAT) as indicator of innovations and patent citations as a proxy for knowledge spillovers. Section 2 highlights the theoretical background and previous research upon which this study builds. Section 3 provides some background information on the mobile air-conditioning sector, its technologies and the regulatory environment in different countries and regions. Section 4 presents the data and the way innovations and spillovers are measured. The various models and their results are discussed in Sects. 5 and 6. Section 7 concludes.",4

Halkos,Nickolaos G. Tzeremes,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Scholars regard that the relationship between ethics and Environmental Economics is not perfectly clear. Mohr (1994) argues that Environmental Economics rarely touches on environmental norms, which in the literature of economic analysis the relationship between human behaviour and the environment is not extensively analysed. Nassauer (1995) emphasises the fact that scientists and scholars have felt the necessity of binding social and cultural insights into ecological knowledge due to the fact that human perceptions, cognitions and values directly affect the environment. Nightingale (2003) suggests that cultural practices and their effect on ecological change have been examined by studies investigating how capitalist development influences land management regimes at different scales. According to Ehmke and Shogren (2008), the answer to the question of how societies can increase development and prosperity while still protecting natural resources and the environment, requires the investigation of how people behave within institutions and natural environments. Furthermore, Ohl et al. (2007) suggest that human activity affects the ecosystem through the extraction, transport and transformation of resources which are driven by societal and economic pressures. Land use, land cover, production, consumption and disposal are the main human activities which influence countries’ environments (Redman et al. 2004). Culture in addition contains the ways of living which are built-up by a group of human beings and transmitted from one generation to another. Hofstede’s (1980, pp. 260–283) definition of culture is “the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one human group from another”. In that respect since national culture shapes the beliefs and values by being responsible for creating “the mental programs” of human groups (Hofstede et al. 2010), we argue that humans’ perceptions, beliefs and values of the environment will be different among countries based on national culture characteristics which will result to different levels of countries’ environmental performance.Footnote 1
 To our knowledge there is not any study examining empirically the link between cultural values and eco-efficiency (here after EE).Footnote 2 In that respect our study tries to capture the existence of an environmental commune. Therefore, it investigates empirically if the role of norms (i.e. national culturesFootnote 3) is to ensure the survival of the commune (i.e. countries’ eco-efficiency). We assume that environmental norms shape humans’ behaviour towards an environment commune which in turn has a direct impact on countries’ environmental policies and thus to their eco-efficiency levels. The structure of our study is the following. Section 2 reviews the existing relative literature and Sect. 3 presents the data used and the proposed nonparametric techniques adopted. Section 4 presents the empirical results derived while the last section concludes the paper.",18

The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and its extended version post 2013 are typical examples of international efforts toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to counter climate change. For example, under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex 1 countries were required to reduce GHG emissions by a specified degree between 2008 and 2012, using the GHG levels in 1990 as the baseline. For example, the EU, Canada, and Japan were required to reduce their GHG emissions by 8, 6, and 6 %, respectively. In spite of the growing international concerns over climate change, globally, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased consistently from 18042 million tonnes in 1980 to 20974 million tonnes in 1990, 23509 million tonnes in 2000, and 30276 million tonnes in 2010 (IEA 2012). Therefore, the reduction of GHGs, particularly CO2, is a globally pressing issue. This article explores how CO2 emissions may be reduced effectively by focusing on the Japanese thermal power industry, a major CO2 emitter in Japan. Incidentally, Japan is the fifth largest CO2 emitter in the world (IEA 2012). The Japanese thermal power industry has had the distinction of recognizing the need to reduce CO2 emissions while simultaneously securing a stable energy supply through nuclear power generation. Indeed, Japan’s Basic Energy Plan 2010 once set a national goal of 30 % reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, by attempting to increase the country’s share of electricity generation through nuclear power to 50 %. However, the explosions at the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s Fukushima nuclear power reactors in March 2011 forced a radical change in this strategy. This disastrous accident produced catastrophic and extensive radioactive contamination; as concern regarding the contamination spread swiftly across the nation, people become acutely sensitive to the risks of nuclear power generation. As a result of this strong public opinion, the Japanese power industry now faces great challenges, in that it has to pursue its goals for a stable energy supply and CO2 emissions reduction concurrently, without nuclear power generation. We adopt a directional output distance function (DODF) approach with panel data for 1990–2011 concerning Japanese thermal power industry. The DODF approach informs us the efficiency of power industry in the form of the degree of deviation of each sample from the boundary of output set and the marginal abatement costs of carbon dioxide in the form of shadow price. From the revealed efficiencies of power industry, we will know the extent to which electricity and carbon dioxide are potentially to be increased or reduced, respectively, when the electric power companies were to operate efficiently. For example, from this perspective, Wang et al. (2012) showed that averaged province in China has the possibility to further reduce CO2 emissions by 40 % if it were to operate efficiently. Jaraitė and Maria (2012) focused on the public power generation sector in the EU and pointed out that carbon pricing induces technological progress and offers the opportunity to further reduce CO2 emissions. Estimating the efficiency of Japanese prefectures while taking CO2 emissions into account, Nakano and Managi (2010) suggested that social capital improves the efficiency of prefectures, resulting in CO2 emissions reductions. On the other hand, the shadow price of CO2 for each electric power company helps the government to design environmental policies, such as an emission trading system or environmental tax, aimed at reducing emissions. It is well known that stakeholders determine whether to make an effort to reduce CO2 emissions, depending on their own marginal abatement cost of CO2 and the price of allowance traded in emission trading systems or the rate of the environmental tax. Many studies focusing on this point have been conducted around the world so far (e.g., Kwon and Yun 1999; Gupta 2006; Färe et al. 2006; Rezek and Campbell 2007; Park and Lim 2009; Wang et al. 2011; Lee and Zhang 2012; Morris et al. 2012). This article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide the background of the energy and environmental policies relevant to Japanese thermal power industry. In Sect. 3, we introduce an analytical model of the DODF, which was mainly developed by Shephard (1970) and Färe et al. (1993), and derive the shadow price of CO2 using the DODF. In Sect. 4, we analyze the data, present our results, and provide some policy implications. Our conclusions are summarized in Sect. 5.",8

Early accounts on the science–policy interaction claimed that scientists could easily ‘speak truth to power’ (Wildavsky 1979). This linear model of the science–policy interaction has been supplanted by more nuanced approaches. Scholars have, for instance, pointed out that scientific knowledge is deeply embedded in politics and the broader culture of the society (e.g., Jasanoff 1996), scientific findings may reflect the bias of funding institutions (e.g., Andresen and Østreng 1989; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998) and scientists are not apolitical actors without self-interests (e.g., Collingridge and Reeve 1986; Andresen et al. 2000; Boehmer-Christiansen and Kellow 2002). However, the question how governments exert influence on scientific knowledge has not been analyzed in much detail. This article takes a first step in that direction by adopting an ‘interest-based’ perspective on the science–policy interaction in the international regimes for the protection of the ozone layer and the global climate.Footnote 1
 Two aspects are quite obvious when comparing the ozone regime and the climate regime. First, attempts to alleviate the problem of climate change have been far less successful (until now) than attempts to solve the problem of ozone depletion, even though in both cases much effort has been put into research. Second, various countries have acted very differently in the two international environmental regimes. While the United States (US) played a leadership role in the ozone regime, it has been one of the strongest laggards in the climate regime. Interestingly, several major European countries have played reversed roles. They initially blocked international chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emission controls, but were supportive of early international greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation. This leads to the question why countries respond differently to international environmental problems. The ‘knowledge-based’ epistemic communities approach and the ‘interest-based’ approach to international environmental cooperation offer different explanations to answer this question. While the ‘knowledge-based’ epistemic communities approach emphasizes shared knowledge as key variable for the different national responses to environmental problems, the ‘interest-based’ approach to international environmental cooperation suggests that the varying national policies can largely be attributed to diverging national interests. This article takes up this thread and argues that while epistemic communities can play an important role in bringing environmental problems on the agenda, their impact declines in later stages of the policy cycle when governments have defined national interests in the respective issue area. In the following section, I first sketch the basic assumptions of the ‘knowledge-based’ epistemic communities approach. Then, I present an ‘interest-based’ approach to the science–policy interaction that is used in this article to explore the impact of national interests on scientific knowledge. In Sects. 3 and 4, I apply this approach to the ozone regime and the climate regime. Finally, I compare the findings of the two case studies, draw conclusions about the two theoretical approaches discussed here and point to factors that merit attention in future research on the relationship between science and policy in international (environmental) regimes.",9

Bhat,Ramachandra Bhatta,Mohamed Shumais,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The Republic of the Maldives of the central Indian Ocean is endowed with a large number of atolls. Atolls, which are small, flat islands formed of coral reefs and embedded with an open lagoon at their center, are home to some of the world’s most unique ecosystems. They are to be found predominantly in the tropical Indo-Pacific oceans and are home to more than 700,000 people (Spalding et al. 2001). The Maldivian atolls are known for their beautiful coral structures, fish abundance, white sandy beaches, coastal vegetation and mangroves. The Global Environment Facility, recognizing the Baa Atolls of the Maldives to carry “globally significant biological diversity,” recently provided funding for a major conservation project (Emerton et al. 2009). Until recently, corals served as a source of building materials for the construction industry in the Maldives. The coral reefs have been heavily quarried since the 1970s to meet the nation’s construction demand, especially around the capital island of Male which is a major urban and international tourist center (Edwards and Clark 1999). Threats to the coral reefs also come from other development-related activities such as near-shore reclamation, harbor construction, dredging and other island expansion activities, and nutrient enrichment from inland sewage discharges. The Maldivian Government, as a policy response to both the increasing demand in tourism and the degrading coral reef fishery, has already declared 31 marine-protected areas with the aim of protecting the diving spots from overuse (UNEP 2002). However, these areas do not strictly conform to the protected area management regime because bait fishing by those members of the local communities holding permits is allowed at all the protected sites while they also continue as popular diving spots for tourists with 14 of them designated exclusively for shark watching. Moreover, the demand for reef fishes from the local tourist resorts and exporting companies continue to grow, forcing local fishermen to encroach into protected areas. However, both a lack of political will and budgetary constraints appear to hinder the effective implementation of the marine protection law on the part of the Maldivian government. The marine-protected area program from inception has received only meager financial support from the government. There are two main sources of funding that support the Maldivian resource agencies: the central government of the Maldives and overseas donors. In 2007, the total government expenditure on environmental protection was RF 142 million or USD 11.06 million (MPND 2009). This budget constituted only 1.71 % of the total Maldivian Government expenditure although the tourism and transportation sector together contributed about 46 % of the GDP (MPND 2009). The agencies received another USD 16.30 million from overseas donors in 2007 towards environmental protection (NDMC 2007b). That same year, an additional USD 14.35 million was contributed by foreign agencies towards tsunami-related recovery activities. Although information on the actual environmental budget needed is not available, our discussions with agency officials suggest that the above funding level may not be adequate to achieve the various environmental goals and protection needs of the marine environment. The inadequate funding of such programs seriously limits the ability of the management agencies to enforce protected area regulations, and conduct educational programs. Part of the reason that institutions and mechanisms for the conservation of the environment around the world receive insufficient funding is the failure of governments to recognize both the market and non-market values derived from natural resources (Baral et al. 2008). With nature-based tourism in particular, there exists a significant amount of utility or economic surplus which the tourists derive but which does not enter the market process. As a result, the government fails to recover at least a portion of that surplus which could in turn be used to defray the costs of protecting the resource from its users. In the case of the Maldives, the tourism industry continues to expand significantly, making tourists the major user group of the marine resource base. However, while the user group that most benefits from the rich natural resource are international visitors, the responsibility for the sustainable and fair use of the resource falls largely on the local population and the government. One way to overcome this disparity is to identify funding sources from the group who directly benefit from tourism and the tourism dollars, and to design policies to ensure appropriate money transfer from beneficiaries to those responsible for conservation and regulation. Emerton et al. (2006) and Reid-Grant and Bhat (2009) have discussed at length possible alternative mechanisms for the purpose of raising funds to support protected areas. This paper focuses on the recreational activities of tourists visiting the Maldives. We intend here to estimate the size of the economic benefits or welfare derived by tourists and to identify suitable financial sources from within the tourism sector for the purpose of recovering, as user fees and/or additional service charges, a reasonable portion of the tourists’ economic surplus. We conduct, therefore, a travel cost study for international visitors to estimate their economic surplus from recreational activities, which is a key indicator in determining the feasibility of a user-based scheme to finance marine protection programs. The study develops alternative estimates of economic surplus by considering (1) exogenous travel costs (i.e., costs that tourists have no control over), and (2) combined exogenous and endogenous costs (i.e., costs chosen by tourists). We then analyze the expenditure profile of tourists to identify feasible user fee bases which could be used to improve the financing of Maldivian atoll and coral reef conservation. In the next section, we briefly discuss past studies on the economic valuation of coral reefs and the significance of atolls in the Maldives. In Sect. 3, we develop the conceptual model of the study and describe how the data was collected and analyzed. In Sect. 4, we present the study results while discussing how this economic valuation study can be used in policy making. Section 5 concludes with a brief discussion of policy implications.",4

The effect of manufacturer participation in a voluntary environmental program on consumer preferences,January 2014,Xiaogu Li,Christopher D. Clark,Steven T. Yen,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The Climate Leaders (CL) Program was launched by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in February 2002 as a voluntary program to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by businesses and institutions and to promote improved ambient environmental quality. The program started with 11 initial partners and grew to over 250 by the end of 2010. Participants ranged from small firms to major corporations and represented a variety of industries and sectors from manufacturers and utilities to financial institutions and retailers (USEPA 2011b). USEPA discontinued the program in September 2011 citing similarities with programs operated by states and non-governmental organizations and other GHG reporting and climate leadership recognition activities within USEPA (USEPA 2011a). However, the program phase-out raised concern that programs sponsored by state or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) would not provide the same value as a national initiative (Environmental Leader 2010; Klafter 2010). Discontinuation of the CL program in light of the success and consumer recognition of other USEPA programs, such as the Energy Star, raises the question of how consumers would have received a CL program label and whether they would have considered it in making purchase decisions. The essential requirements for firms or other institutions participating in the CL program were that they develop a GHG emissions inventory, set a GHG emissions reduction goal, and report annual progress toward that goal (USEPA 2011a). In return, they received free technical assistance from USEPA on such topics as implementing GHG accounting methods, monitoring GHG emissions, and improving emission inventory management, along with USEPA recognition as environmental leaders. This recognition came in the form of press releases and public service announcements in major national publications and USEPA’s Carbon Copy newsletter. In addition, USEPA provided participants with a variety of resources to publicize their own participation, goals, and accomplishments, including a program label that participants could use in marketing materials (USEPA 2011a). The nature of the requirements for participation and the manner in which information was disseminated do not suggest that the program was targeted at a specific audience, but, instead, could have altered perceptions of program participants by a variety of audiences, including regulators, investors, consumers, and other stakeholders. The failure to provide consumers with readily-digestible and conveniently-timed information and to bolster the relevancy and accuracy of this information with a promotional campaign raises questions as to whether the program, as constructed, would have significantly influenced consumer behavior. More fundamentally, the nature of the information provided by the CL program may have been less likely to influence consumer behavior than other types of environmental information. For example, a consumer who reduces energy consumption by purchasing an Energy Star appliance (as opposed to some less energy-efficient variety) not only reduces emissions but also enjoys the cost savings associated with energy conservation. On the other hand, consumers who purchase an appliance manufactured by a participant in the CL program do not realize any energy savings. And, these consumers may also perceive the environmental benefits associated with actions taken by the manufacturer prior to purchase differently from those associated with the purchase of a more energy-efficient appliance (i.e., consumers may not view emissions reductions associated with actions by the manufacturer in the same way that they view emission reductions associated with their own reduced energy consumption). For these reasons, it is perhaps not surprising that there is considerable empirical evidence to suggest that consumers can be influenced by information on the environmental attributes or characteristics of a particular product or service provided in the form of an eco-label,Footnote 1 but much less evidence of whether consumers can be influenced by awareness of manufacturer or retailer participation in a voluntary environmental program. However, gaining a better understanding of whether and how consumers might be influenced by such participation is increasingly important given the widespread adoption of voluntary environmental programs around the world. In this study, we investigate consumer preferences for products manufactured by firms participating in one of these other types of voluntary environmental programs by analyzing data from a contingent choice experiment that includes manufacturer participation in USEPA’s CL program as a product attribute. We estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a variety of product attributes, including manufacturer participation in the CL program. We also examine how respondent characteristics and attitudes influence preferences for CL program participation. By addressing these questions, we hope to provide a better understanding of the potential for a broader array of voluntary environmental programs to influence consumer preferences, in addition to answering the more specific question of whether consumers were willing to pay a premium for products manufactured by participants in the CL program.",6

Arimura,Alan K. Fox,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"To address climate change issues, the European Union has adopted a domestic system, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Other developed economies are now considering the adoption of domestic emissions trading schemes (ETS), and permit allocation methods have become an important issue. Many studies find that auctioning of permits is desirable in terms of both macroeconomic impact (effects on welfare and gross domestic product, GDP) and equity. However, auctioning permits would impose a heavy burden on energy-intensive industries. In particular, energy-intensive industries competing with foreign competitors could lose their edge and end up severely reducing production. In fact, because of the competitiveness issue, such industries have demonstrated strong opposition to the ETS. Naturally, political support from industry, including energy-intensive industries, is essential to the adoption of an ETS. For this reason, to ensure smooth adoption of emissions controls, regulators must pay attention to the burden on energy-intensive industries and macroeconomic effects. Reasons for lessening the burden on energy-intensive industries go beyond politics. Although emissions regulations can cause such industries in developed nations to reduce production, they also could cause carbon leakage by shifting production to countries where energy efficiency is lower and regulations are looser, such as China and India. This shift weakens the benefits of carbon regulations in developed countries by increasing emissions in developing countries. Major contractions in energy-intensive industries in regulated countries could simply result in large-scale leakage to countries without tight regulations. In light of the potential for such leakage, policymakers need to be cautious when placing a heavy burden on energy-intensive industries. The gratis allocation of emissions permits, as opposed to auctioning, has been proposed to ease burden on energy-intensive industries. In fact, EU ETS employs a grandfathering method in Phase II (2008–2012).Footnote 1 Recently, another type of free allocation method, output-based allocation (OBA), has attracted attention. Under OBA, emissions permits are distributed gratis to firms involved in international competition, based on their output. In the United States, the Lieberman-Warner and Waxman-Markey bills have proposed OBA to protect domestic industries that compete in international markets while preventing leakage. In response to the growing interest in OBA, Fischer and Fox (2007) employ a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for a quantitative analysis of three methods: auctioning, grandfathering, and OBA in the United States. Their analysis suggests that OBA is somewhat effective in both helping energy-intensive industries and reducing leakage. Fischer and Fox (2010) extend this work by looking at specific combinations of OBA with either auctioning or grandfathering, to further explore the role of tax interactions as well as leakage. They find that, from a US perspective, combining auctioning with OBA for energy intensive sectors—particularly the trade-exposed ones—is more cost-effective policy than auctioning alone. The rationale involves a combination of tradeoffs in tax-interaction effects, carbon leakage, and terms-of-trade effects. However, it is not clear if this result would extend to any country undertaking a unilateral policy. Because full-fledged emissions trading may be adopted in Japan, a quantitative economic analysis of the different permit allocation methods is needed to provide information for policy decision making. In this study, we apply the Fischer and Fox model to Japan to compare the various permit allocation methods. We construct a multiregional and multisector static CGE model with 14 regions and 26 sectors. We assume that each country and region consists of three economic agents—households, firms, and governments—and that households and firms behave optimally. To analyze energy production activities in detail, we have designated two types of production functions: a fossil fuel production function and a non-fossil fuel production function. We also assume that household utility depends on consumption and leisure—that is, households choose the supply of labor endogenously. As emissions regulations, our analysis assumes a cap-and-trade scheme restricting total emissions. In addition, we assume that emissions controls are adopted by Japan, the United States, and the 27 EU member states, reducing emissions in these entities by 30, 20, and 16 %, respectively, from 2004 levels. We also assume that no scheme for international emissions trading is adopted; emissions permits are traded only internally, within each country or region. In addition, because the primary aim of this study is to analyze emissions trading in Japan, we assume that the United States and the EU-27 countries always allocate quotas using an auctioning method, with only Japan changing allocation methods. Following Fischer and Fox, we compare three allocation methods: auctioning (AUC), grandfathering (GF), and OBA. GF and OBA allocate permits gratis. As opposed to GF, in which permits are allocated independently of firm behavior, permits are to firms’ outputs under OBA. Because this allocation method has the effect of subsidizing production, prices of outputs do not rise when emissions controls are imposed. This reduces negative effects caused by the tax-interaction effectsFootnote 2 and mitigates the leakage and competitiveness issues. In theory, auction and gratis allocation (GF and OBA) are handled separately. In discussions of emissions controls, however, a combination of auction and gratis allocation methods has been proposed: some industries would receive permits gratis and others obtain permits through auctioning. For example, although plans call for the EU ETS to shift to an auctioning method in the future, gratis allocation would continue for industries exposed to “significant risk of carbon leakage,” such as the steel industry.Footnote 3 Such a hybrid allocation method is under consideration in Japan as well. Therefore, we also analyze gratis allocation to only certain industries. Specifically, we analyze two scenarios with auctioning for most industries but gratis OBA for (1) eight energy-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) sectors, electricity (ELY), and refined petroleum and coal products (Scenario AO-E), and (2) only EITE sectors (Scenario AO-ET). The sectors receiving gratis allocation have been selected according to criteria used in the US Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (see Sugino et al. 2013). We also assume that the government saving is equal to zero in the benchmark equilibrium and that the government would adjust labor taxes to keep real government expenditures at a fixed level. This revenue-recycling effect reduces the distortion in labor markets. Our model has many resemblances to but some important differences from Fischer and Fox (2007, 2010). First, whereas they use US data for endogenizing labor supply in all regions, this study employs Japanese data for specifying the labor supply in Japan; furthermore, of importance for tax-interaction effects, we note that labor tax rates are higher in Japan than in the US. Second, whereas Fischer and Fox (2007) use GTAP6 data with 2001 as the base year, like Fischer and Fox (2010) we use GTAP7 data with 2004 as the base year. Third, this study analyzes different hybrid allocation methods combining the auction and OBA methods like Fischer and Fox (2010). Fourth, unlike the Fischer and Fox studies, we assume that some major trading partners—notably the US and the EU—already have emissions regulation in place, so the policy is not simply a unilateral one. But the main difference is our focus on the Japanese perspective, and how these climate policy options affect welfare, GDP, permit price, leakage, and production in each sector. In addition to Fischer and Fox, other researchers have analyzed emissions trading from the perspective of initial permit allocation methods. Parry et al. (1999) employ a static CGE model to compare emissions trading using auctioning and free allocation under conditions of taxation leading to distortions in the United States.Footnote 4 In another study focusing on the United States, Goulder et al. (1999) compare various controls on carbon dioxide emissions, including emissions trading. Employing a forward-looking dynamic CGE model, Jensen and Rasmussen (2000) compare the three allocation methods of auctioning, grandfathering, and an OBA system based on market share in emissions trading in Denmark. Böhringer and Lange (2005) analyze the effects of emissions trading in the EU (primarily Germany), under auctioning, OBA, and free allocation based on emissions volume (i.e., share of emissions). Finally, Dissou (2006) employs a forward-looking dynamic CGE model to analyze emissions trading in Canada under auctioning, grandfathering, and OBA. Those studies focused on ETS in Europe or North America. The competitiveness and leakage issues, however, may be more relevant for Japan because its industrial rivals, such as China, face no carbon caps and are geographically nearby. Thus, it is important to analyze the leakage and competitiveness issues under an ETS for the Japanese economy specifically. Analyzing an ETS for Japan is important from a European perspective as well. The EU is promoting an ETS for all countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 2020. For that purpose, it is essential that Japan have a domestic ETS as early as possible. Unless the regulatory agencies can deal with the competitiveness and leakage issues to some degree, it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese government to adopt an ETS. This paper focuses on emissions trading in Japan by establishing parameters, data, and scenarios that provide useful information to assist Japanese policymakers in addressing the leakage and competitiveness issues. Taking the Japanese perspective, we find some subtle and some significant differences compared to earlier studies. The most important results of our analysis can be summarized as follows. First, our analysis shows that when allocation methods are compared for macroeconomic effects (i.e., welfare and GDP), the least disruptive method is AUC, followed by AO-ET, AO-E, OBA, and finally, GF. Conversely, the results show that OBA and AO-E are superior for controlling carbon leakages and minimizing the burden on domestic energy-intensive industries. Still, in sensitivity analysis holding global emissions constant, the welfare ranking remains robust, indicating that the value of the leakage reductions does not offset the policy costs, which differs from previous studies for other regions. For example, Fisher and Fox (2010) showed that combining auctioning with OBA for energy intensive sectors is more cost-effective policy than auctioning alone. The reason why we obtain different results for Japan may be attributed in part to the fact that the labor tax rates in Japan are higher than those in the US. Taking all results into consideration, AUC is the best allocation method if top priority is given to macroeconomic effects, but it causes overseas leakage and harms domestic energy-intensive industries. OBA causes the least leakage and the least harm to energy-intensive sectors, but its macroeconomic effects are undesirable. AO-ET provides balance: its macroeconomic effects are close to AUC and it simultaneously alleviates leakage effects and the burden on EITE sectors.",22

For years, international negotiations have been struggling to ensure a concrete follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Yet notwithstanding the slow progress in the international negotiation process, obituaries for the multilateral, state-driven climate regime had to be shelved time and again. Indeed, while the negotiations on a future climate regime so far failed to produce outcomes that would require ambitious emission reductions (e.g. UNEP 2011), the UNFCCC process itself has proved to be remarkably resilient. At the same time, observers have pointed to—and tried to make sense of—the rapidly increasing number of climate change initiatives taking place outside of the auspices of the UNFCCC (e.g. Jagers and Stripple 2003; Pattberg and Stripple 2008; Andonova et al. 2009; Okereke et al. 2009; Bernstein et al. 2010; Biermann 2010; Bulkeley and Newell 2010; Hoffmann 2011; Keohane and Victor 2011; Zelli 2011; Abbott 2012). The amalgam of non-UNFCCC efforts covers a wide range of public, private and hybrid initiatives at various levels of governance, aimed at both reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and adjusting to the impacts of climate change (adaptation). In the view of these authors, the UNFCCC cannot (or no longer) be seen as the sole site of global climate governance. The starting point for our argument is that this increasing institutional complexity urges both practitioners and academics to rethink the role of the UNFCCC in a creative and pragmatic manner. Indeed, the lingering uncertainty in the climate negotiations, combined with the emergence of other governance arrangements, has already triggered broader questions about the advantages and drawbacks of different possible climate governance architectures. However, much of the climate policy literature is still preoccupied with asking questions about which climate governance architecture is more effective in reducing emissions, more equitable and just, more economically efficient, more politically viable, etc. (e.g. Biermann et al. 2009; Hof et al. 2009; and various contributions in Aldy and Stavins 2007, 2010). One key tenet in these contributions is contrasting architectures in which the UNFCCC plays a central role with architectures in which the role of the UNFCCC is limited or non-existent. While these contributions address valid questions, they also obscure the reality of the current state of global climate governance. As we argue in this article, global climate governance is already fragmented. Rather than asking which architecture is ‘better’, we hold that a more pertinent question is how to link the different elements of global climate governance to ensure coherence among them. In particular, we ask how different non-UNFCCC initiatives could be connected to each other, and what the role of the UNFCCC could be in terms of coordinating different initiatives. By doing so, the aim of this paper is to redirect attention to fostering linkages between individual components of the existing global climate governance architecture, as opposed to searching for an ideal governance architecture, and to provide some first ideas on how such linkages could look like at the intersection of climate change mitigation and trade policies. The article is structured as follows. First, we explain how global climate governance was initially firmly anchored within the international climate regime, but how this changed in the early 2000s, when the UNFCCC’s predominance was increasingly put into question (Sect. 2). Based on this analysis, we advance our argument in favor of enhancing the coherence between the different elements of global climate governance. To this end, we draw on scholarly work that distinguishes various degrees of fragmentation of governance architectures. We posit that by making links between the different elements of global climate governance, it is possible to move away from what Biermann et al. (2009) term conflictive fragmentation (Sect. 3). We illustrate this normative argument with three different cases, showing how coordination of various climate change mitigation initiatives could make a contribution from a practical perspective (international climate technology initiatives; emerging emissions trading systems; and unilateral trade measures), with specific attention for the role that the UNFCCC could play (Sect. 4). We provide concluding remarks in Sect. 5.",57

The study relies on data covering judgements of the Cour de Cassation for the period 1956–2010. We attempt to assess whether liability ensures compliance with regulation, or encourages more stringent care than required by regulation, and if so, whether liability encourages aspects of care that cannot be monitored by regulators at reasonable costs. Indeed, as Bhole and Wagner (2008) notes, regulators can monitor the installation of certain filters, the compliance with certain procedures and the use of certain products but cannot observe the care taken by individuals in their daily operations. Thus, the existence of two dimensions of care—one observable ex ante by regulators and one unobservable before an accident occurs—might explain the joint use of ex ante regulation and ex post liability, as complements to induce care to potential injurers. Our primary results are descriptive and our conclusions rely on an econometric logistic analysis. We focus on trial outcomes when environmental accidents occurred despite injurers having complied with regulatory standards. Studying this restricted sample allows exploring whether civil liability is only used to provide polluters with incentives to comply with regulations or whether liability generates incentives to take care in dimensions not covered by regulation. Although courts’ decisions where defendant did not comply with regulations might shed light on the role of courts, restricting our analysis to compliant defendants will make the observation of the role played by courts easier. Indeed, in such situations, compliant injurers will be held liable, if so, under legal motives that are not directly related to regulatory standards of care, so that interpreting these legal motives will allow us to assess whether liability is used as a complement to regulation in preventing and punishing environmental accidents.Footnote 3
 Our main result is that judges complement regulators’ action by focusing primarily on resources management (mismanagement and careless behaviour) that cannot be regulated ex ante. Hence, it seems that liability is used to mitigate the limits of the French environmental regulation.Footnote 4
 The paper proceeds as follows: section 2 discusses the relevant literature and Sect. 3 provides background information about French environmental institutional structure, which combines regulation and liability. Section 4 describes our empirical approach and dataset. Section 5 presents statistical observations and our main hypotheses and Sect. 6 provides the results of the logistic regression. Section 7 concludes and presents further research issues.",8

In December 2009, the Copenhagen climate summit failed to produce a global climate treaty to follow the Kyoto Protocol, and calls for innovative solutions to break the negotiation gridlock have since grown stronger. Any such solution must induce countries to participate in the global mitigation effort (Barrett 1994; Carraro and Siniscalco 1993). I examine whether cooperation on clean technology deployment, by which I refer to policies that promote the domestic use of clean energy technologies, would enhance global carbon abatement efforts. Technology cooperation figures prominently in the contemporary debate, largely because the cost of carbon abatement depends on the availability of new technologies that can help countries reduce emissions at a low cost (de Coninck et al. 2008). However, technology cooperation has many different forms. While much of the literature emphasizes research and development, promising energy technologies will not help unless they penetrate the market (Gallagher et al. 2006; Sandén and Azar 2005; Unruh 2000). In addition to subsidizing research and development, countries may benefit from collaboration on deploying new technologies, such as increasing renewables production. Analytically, technology deployment differs from research and development because the former does not feature the positive externality of new knowledge. Admissible actions and measures include grid reform to facilitate the use of renewable energy, demonstration projects, feed-in tariffs or mandatory portfolio standards, investment subsidies, and so on. In an agreement, for example, a group of countries could each agree to increase the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix by a certain percentage. Technology deployment agreements remain rare. In a recent survey, de Coninck et al. (2008) note that although technology cooperation is a promising approach to international climate policy, virtually all existing agreements are relatively shallow, comprising such provisions as information or cost sharing. To be effective, technology deployment requires substantial scaling up. Perhaps, the only international initiative that contains provisions for aggressive technology deployment is the 2008 climate and energy package of the European Union. In addition to emissions reductions, it prescribes that union members must collectively produce one-fifth of the total energy mix using renewable sources by the year 2020.
Footnote 1
 The literature on strategic international environmental policy has paid scant attention to deployment cooperation. Barrett (2006) argues that “breakthrough technologies” generally cannot achieve much more cooperation than conventional pollution abatement would, but this result is based on the assumption that breakthrough technologies are a substitute to pollution abatement. In my dynamic setting with technology deployment, this result does not hold because the deployment decision is made before the abatement decision. Hoel and de Zeeuw (2010) consider the strategic dimension of technology cooperation, but they also focus on research and development instead of deployment. Thus, they are unable to shed light on the benefits of technology deployment cooperation. Carraro and Siniscalco (1995) show that research and development can facilitate the enforcement of international environmental cooperation, but only if countries can, somewhat implausibly, form a “technology club” that produces substantial private gains to the members. Can technology deployment cooperation improve climate cooperation? My approach to technology deployment cooperation is strategic (Barrett 2003). In the game, ex ante symmetric countries—with identical abatement costs and benefits— first decide on technology deployment and then engage in pollution abatement. If a country deploys new technology, it reduces the domestic marginal cost of subsequent pollution abatement. Both the deployment and abate decision are binary. The key theoretical innovation is that countries can contract on both pollution abatement and technology deployment. If technology deployment is costly but produces a large decrease in the cost of pollution abatement, a technology deployment agreement can help countries significantly expand the total number of cooperators. Previous scholarship has shown that in a static game of pollution abatement, only a small group of countries can form a coalition because each country must be pivotal for cooperation (Carraro and Siniscalco 1993; Barrett 1994, 2001). According to this research, the equilibrium coalition has exactly K members. The number K must be high enough for collective action to be worthwhile, but small enough so that any member’s exit would greatly reduce cooperation. The latter requirement prevents large coalitions. In my game, the total number of cooperators can be increased. Suppose a group of L countries first agree on mutual technology deployment. The number L is such that each signatory of the agreement is pivotal to the optimality of collective technology deployment. Since technology deployment is a sunk cost that reduces the marginal cost of pollution abatement through learning by doing and economies of scale (Nemet 2006; Jamasb 2007; Söderholm and Sundqvist 2007), technology deployment allows these countries to credibly commit to pollution abatement in the future. Therefore, these L countries abate pollution regardless of what the remaining N − L countries do. At the subsequent pollution abatement stage, another coalition of K countries that have not deployed the technology will contract on pollution abatement among themselves. The number K does not change due to the introduction of the technology deployment agreement. In equilibrium, two international agreements with different provisions and members emerge. The main contribution of the technology deployment agreement is to increase the number of cooperators from K to L + K. In the absence of a technology deployment agreement, the total number of cooperating countries is at most K, because only a small number of countries can simultaneously have an incentive to join a pollution abatement coalition (Barrett 1994; Carraro and Siniscalco 1993). The finding is particularly notable in light of the possibility of multiple coalitions in environmental cooperation. Asheim et al. (2006) find that regional climate treaties may enhance participation. In their model, if countries can commit to regional climate cooperation, each region can support a renegotiation-proof climate treaty with K members. Similarly, Bloch (1997) finds that international environmental cooperation should give rise to multiple small coalitions due to reasons of coalitional stability. In contrast, my model generates two different coalitions from the fundamental strategic logics of sunk costs and reciprocity. The model allows the examination of the conditions such that a technology deployment agreement will enhance cooperation. As long as the number of countries is large enough, N > L + K, the equilibrium coalition sizes for deployment and abatement without deployment are fixed to L and K, respectively. However, in the absence of a large number of countries, the equilibrium unravels. This finding indicates that technology deployment agreements are most valuable when governments find it difficult to commit to cooperation and the number of relevant countries is large. Importantly, both conditions seem to apply to global warming. In practice, the present findings may provide valuable strategic insights into effective policy formation. The formal analysis demonstrates that somewhat counterintuitively, technology deployment cooperation is the most valuable if the international cooperation is difficult and the cost of technology deployment is too high for effective unilateralism. Given the magnitude of the decarbonization challenge, the condition for successful deployment cooperation seem to hold for many key energy technologies, such as wind and solar energy (Sandén and Azar 2005; Stern 2006; Unruh 2000). When countries sink costs and reduce the cost of future abatement through learning by doing and economies of scale, they can increase cooperation toward global climate mitigation.",2
16.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,28 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-014-0076-z,Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws? Survey evidence from Brazil,July 2014,Michaël Aklin,Patrick Bayer,Johannes Urpelainen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Governments of many developing countries have written impressive environmental policies, but their effects on environmental quality are undermined by a lack of rigorous enforcement (Ascher 1999; Bechtel and Tosun 2009). While the lack of bureaucratic resources matters for monitoring and oversight of industry groups, corruption is a key facet that prevents effective environmental policy (Fredriksson et al. 2004; Cole 2007). If corrupt officials accept bribes for looking the other way, individuals and organizations who pollute or destroy natural resources can avoid fines without changing their behavior (Hu et al. 2004; Asproudis 2011). Who among the general public blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws? This question has both academic and policy relevance—it is particularly important in a democratic society, where governments are more responsive to concerns from the public than in autocracies (Stigler 1972; Wittman 1995). To the extent that voting constituencies worry about corruption as an impediment to environmental quality, governments have an incentive to implement anti-corruption reforms in environmental policy implementation. Without the public perception of corruption as a cause of weak enforcement, the government has little incentive to combat corruption in environmental policy implementation. In consequence, environmental degradation goes unpunished. Unfortunately, previous studies have shed little light on how publics perceive the importance of corruption as an impediment to enforcing environmental policy. While existing research has paid attention to the causes of environmental attitudes based on de facto characteristics such as wealth, education and political orientation (Van Liere and Dunlap 1981; Dietz et al. 1998; Dunlap 1975; Dunlap and Mertig 1995), there is a little evidence on why people believe environmental policies are not improving environmental quality based on their de jure characteristics. As much as the demographic traits of people matter in shaping public opinion and government policy, their perceptions are equally important, given that they may motivate politicians to act (Ohdoko and Yoshida 2012). Understanding public perceptions of the causes of enforcement failure can, therefore, help predict and facilitate future action by governments of democratic countries. In turn, such action shapes the effectiveness of environmental legislation on actual outcomes. We present evidence from a June 2012 survey on environmental issues and policies in Brazil. The survey was conducted by DataSenado, an official Brazilian government agency, in preparation for the Rio+20 United Nations Conference. It surveyed about 1,200 respondents on their opinion on the environment and its regulation in the country. We use a question on the respondent’s perception of corruption as the primary reason that hinders environmental law enforcement. Brazil is an interesting case to study because it is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, suffers from severe environmental degradation (e.g., Amazonian deforestation), and has in place various environmental policies that are not being properly enforced (Drummond and Barros-Platiau 2006; Fearnside 2005; Andersen and Granger 2007). Moreover, the failure of enforcement in the country is also associated with corruption (Tabarelli et al. 2005), and there has been little research on environmental public opinion in Brazil.
Footnote 1
 Our primary interest is in the respective roles of income and education, and our findings suggest that personal wealth is an excellent predictor of the perception that corruption is responsible for the lax enforcement of environmental policy. We show that respondents who earn less than minimum wage in Brazil believe corruption to be the primary cause of the loose enforcement of environmental regulations with a probability slightly higher than 0.20; however, this probability increases to more than 0.40 for respondents with the highest levels of income. These findings make sense, given that wealthier individuals interact more with government officials and have more opportunities to observe bribery and therefore associate corruption with enforcement failure in general (Mocan 2008; Hunt and Laszlo 2012). By contrast, we do not find evidence for educational effects. Assuming education is a good proxy for being informed, the findings suggest that improved environmental awareness does not strengthen the link between corruption and the lax enforcement of environmental policy. While educated people have more access to media and, therefore, information about environmental problems, this information does not seem to strengthen the connection between corruption and environmental policy. One reason could be that the Brazilian media does not emphasize violations of environmental regulations. Another could be that the effect of education on awareness about corruption in environmental enforcement is offset by the selection of educated people into the service sector, where environmental issues are less pronounced than in agriculture and industry. To set the stage, we begin with a review of environmental legislation in Brazil. We focus on how the environmental laws in the country have changed over time and the disconnect between the laws and its enforcement. Next, we review the literature on public perceptions of environmental policy failure and identify the key contributions of this paper to the fields of environmental politics, corruption, and public opinion. In the following section, we list the main hypotheses on income and education and their relation to the perception of corruption and enforcement of environmental policy in Brazil. Then, we present the research design focusing on the construction of the dependent, explanatory and control variables. Lastly, we present the results of our findings.",24

The maintenance of forests also plays an important role in preserving a wider diversity of livelihood options and buffers against extreme events such as floods and landslides (World Bank 2010). The World Bank (2010) reports that the net global deforestation, however, averaged 7.3 million hectares a year from 2000 to 2005, contributing about 5.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year in emissions, or about a quarter of the global emission reduction needed. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007), emissions associated with land-use change and deforestation account for about 17 % of total greenhouse gas emissions, which is larger than all the world’s emissions via transportation and is comparable in size to the industrial sector. We also note that the deforestation has been concentrated in developing countries, whereas forest cover in industrial countries is stable or even increasing slightly. This study explores the determinants of deforestation, especially in terms of globalization, to clarify the effect of trade openness on deforestation. Figure 1 shows a simple scatter plot of deforestation and trade openness. It indicates that there is no apparent correlation between deforestation and trade openness. Previous studies do not find a statistically significant effect of trade openness on deforestation (Frankel and Rose 2005; Van and Azomahou 2007). However, causality could be found if an improved estimation method is adopted. We use updated data on the annual rate of deforestation for 142 countries from 1990 to 2003, treat trade and income as endogenous, and take into consideration an adjustment process by applying a dynamic model. As a result, we obtain statistically significant results concerning trade that contradict previous studies.

16.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,25 September 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-012-0047-1,Greenhouse gas emissions and the role of the Kyoto Protocol,October 2014,Hiroki Iwata,Keisuke Okada,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Global warming is an important issue for all people in the world. Once greenhouse gases (GHGs) are generated, they accumulate in the atmosphere for a very long period. As a result, various problems such as rises in sea level and abnormal climates caused by global warming will seriously damage the environment and human society.Footnote 1 The scope of their impact is not only limited to the present generation but will also affect the generations to come. Therefore, global warming is closely related to sustainability, because increases in GHGs worsen the level of sustainability.Footnote 2 In addition to inter-generation issues, global warming encompasses intra-generation issues such as North–South problems. The atmosphere has a characteristic of public goods, and each country has incentives of free-riding. Consequently, efforts by each country to address global warming would not be made to a satisfactory level. Coordinated and concerted actions are absolutely essential in reducing GHG emissions on a worldwide scale. International negotiations to prevent global warming started in the late 1980s. In 1988, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted by the congress in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol was established at the third conference of the parties (COP3) in 1997. This protocol obliges approximately 40 developed countries (Annex I countries in the UNFCCC) to limit or reduce GHG emissions. Although there are many difficulties such as conflicting interests among countries in reducing GHGs, the practice of international efforts to address global warming is needed. Therefore, it is important to examine whether the Kyoto Protocol has substantively reduced effects on GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol covers six kinds of GHGs such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).Footnote 3 Existing studies on the effects of the Kyoto Protocol mainly focus only on CO2 reduction (e.g., Grunewald and Martínez-Zarzoso 2009), and few research studies have examined the effects of the Kyoto Protocol by taking all of the GHGs into consideration. To fill this gap in the literature, our study pays attention to not only CO2 but also non-CO2 emissions. According to the IPCC, the fractions of GHGs from man-made sources are 76.7 % for CO2, 14.3 % for CH4, 7.9 % for N2O, and 1.1 % for other GHGs (HFCs, PFCs, and SF6), respectively (Rogner et al. 2007, p. 103). Atmospheric concentrations of long-living GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) have increased rapidly since the industrial era (Forster et al. 2007, p. 135). Moreover, non-CO2 GHGs have greater global warming potential (GWP) than CO2, defined by the relative value of global warming effects of each GHG. For example, the GWPs of CH4, N2O, and SF6 are 25, 298, and 22800, respectively, if the GWP of CO2 is assumed to be unity in a time span of 100 years (Forster et al. 2007, pp. 212–213).Footnote 4
 In addition, in recent years some papers have insisted the importance of including non-CO2 emissions to solve global warming. Reilly et al. (1999) study the emissions of GHGs other than CO2 and point out the possibility of cost effective measures to prevent global warming. They show that the cost of a multi-gas control strategy could be much cheaper than a CO2-only strategy in fulfilling the Kyoto Protocol. Rao and Riahi (2006) and van Vuuren et al. (2006) also argue that the cost of GHG reduction would decrease by considering both CO2 and non-CO2 gases. Given the discussion above, our study empirically investigates the effects of the Kyoto Protocol’s quantified emission limitation or reduction commitments on various GHG emissions such as CO2, CH4, N2O, and other greenhouse gases (HFCs, PFCs, and SF6).Footnote 5 The Kyoto Protocol is a precious milestone for preventing global warming, and to further mitigate global warming, it might be important to include all GHGs into the analysis.Footnote 6 Therefore, our main contribution is to clarify the effects of the Kyoto Protocol on each GHG. Our empirical analysis is based on the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, the stochastic version of the IPAT model as mentioned in the next section. Few studies have demonstrated the effects of the Kyoto Protocol using the STIRPAT model. Our sample consists of 119 countries in 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. In addition, we utilize the annual data of CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2005 to check the robustness of our analysis. Our estimation results show that the Kyoto Protocol is effective in reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions, whereas its effect is insignificant on N2O emissions and significantly positive on other greenhouse gas emissions. These results have important policy implications for global warming issues. While previous studies on these problems tend to merely focus on CO2 emissions, our results suggest that the emissions of GHGs other than CO2 should be taken into account as well. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 explains the IPAT model and its stochastic version, the STIRPAT model, which are the methods for our analysis. Section 3 provides the empirical analysis, which includes the estimation methodology, data, and estimation results. Section 4 gives the conclusion.",65

There are also two opposing paradigms for SD indicators, namely, Weak Sustainability (WS) and Strong Sustainability (SS) (Neumayer 2003). According to the SS concept, an economy is said to be on a sustainable path only if it preserves a certain level of “critical natural capital.” WS, on the other hand, does not stipulate this minimum requirement of natural capital. Instead, indicators of WS include Genuine Savings (GS). Several representative neoclassical growth studies have laid the foundation for WS literature. Examples include optimal savings (Ramsey 1928), utilitarian optimal growth (Koopmans 1960), the so-called DHSS model that deals with explicit exhaustible resources (Dasgupta and Heal 1974; Dasgupta and Heal 1979; Solow 1974; Stiglitz 1974), net investment (Dixit et al. 1980), sustainability as a nondeclining utility (Pezzey 1989), sustainability criteria (Chichilnisky 1996), evaluation of natural capital and intra-generation equity (Dasgupta 2001), and inter-generation equity (Asheim et al. 2012; Roemer and Suzumura 2009). The  GS indicator has the ability to measure SD consistent with neoclassical economics, which indicates that a positive value of  GS is a necessary (but insufficient) condition for sustainability.  GS is a kind of Hicksian income, starting with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as its base value, while the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) take a Fisherian approach, using consumption expenditures as their base values (Lawn 2006). 
GS defines SD such that a development path is sustainable if social well-being does not decline along that path (termed as “non-declining welfare in the future”). Let the well-being be a discounted sum of future flows of utility from consumption, which a social planner is assumed to be maximized. Capitals are the inputs to production from which consumption is derived. Hence, the value function is also a function of the score of capital assets in the economy. Then, the shadow prices or accounting prices of the capitals become the derivatives of the value function with regard to each capital, implying a marginal contribution to the well-being of an additional unit of capital. The time derivative for the value function—in this case, the  GS—is the sum of time derivatives of the capitals weighted by their shadow prices. Then, the sustainability criterion of “non-declining well-being in the future” can be satisfied if the  GS, that is defined as such, is non-negative (for a critical review, see Pezzey 2004). Compared with the theoretical and conceptual progress in economics, there have been comparatively fewer studies on the empirical analysis of  GS. Several studies have incorporated empirical analyses of the economics of sustainability (Pearce and Atkinson 1993; Hamilton and Clemens 1999; Hamilton 2003; Hamilton and Atkinson 2006; World Bank 2006; Hamilton and Bolt 2007). These papers proposed the concept of  GS with illustrative results and expanded the measurements to the entire world for the past 50 years. Recent studies (Dasgupta 2001; Arrow et al. 2004; Ferreira and Moro 2011; Ollivier and Giraud 2011) have extended these measurements. Dasgupta (2001) pointed out that  GS is a superior measure compared to extant measures, such as the  GDP or Human Development Index (HDI). It is, however, true that the extant approaches do not provide the future paths of  GS, although such research needs to be further pointed out. Asheim (1994) showed that non-negative  GS at a point in time is not sufficient for sustainability. Arrow et al. (2003a, b) postulated that sustainable economies must ensure non-declining well-being in the future, which in turn requires non-negative  GS for any point in time onwards. Sato et al. (2012) chose the stochastic process with Monte-Carlo stimulation to measure the future path of  GS using the World Development Indicators (WDI) database. This study chooses an alternative approach by applying an integrated assessment model (IAM) to forecast future paths of  GS. In order to include various mineral resources (fuel and nonfuel) and environmental impacts other than global warming, we incorporate an originally developed mineral resources balance model as well as a detailed environmental impact assessment model adjusted to the world’s ten regions from a life cycle impact assessment model developed in Japan, into an existing, orthodox IAM. This paper is an extension of a previous publication (Kosugi et al. 2009) in the sense that it offers major revisions in  GS forecasting methodology and includes nonfuel mineral resources while forecasting  GS paths. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the methodology used to measure  GS in the previous studies, especially those by Hamilton and Atkinson. Section 3 explains the outline of the methodology applied in this study, and Sect. 4 provides the results. The final section summarizes the paper, its contributions, and limitations.",2

16.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,16 March 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-014-0078-x,"Environment, growth, and technological change in a two-country overlapping-generations model",October 2014,Shintaro Nakagawa,Masayuki Sato,Rintaro Yamaguchi,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Recently, many firms and governments have invested in research and development of cleaner technologies that emit fewer pollutants, especially greenhouse gases. Examples include more efficient solar panels, more efficient windmills, next-generation nuclear power plants, and cleaner coal-fired power plants. These innovations are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output, which implies that they reduce the cost of abating greenhouse gas emissions. However, not all of these technologies are available to all countries. For example, the development of more cost-effective windmills would reduce abatement costs in countries located in high-wind regions, but it would have little effect in countries located in regions where the wind speed is unsuitable for power generation. Our question is, “What is the effect of such unilateral technological progress on the global environment?” Policies affecting the global environment have intergenerational externalities. An abatement effort by a country benefits not only the present generation, but also unborn generations. However, many governments attach considerably more importance to the present generation than to unborn generations. To address the intergenerational issue and such myopic government behavior, we utilize the overlapping-generations (OLG) model of Diamond (1965). Employing a one-country OLG model of the global environment, John et al. (1995) conducted several comparative static analyses and showed that improvement in abatement technology augments capital accumulation and environmental quality. John and Pecchenino (1994) also produced a one-country OLG model of the global environment, assuming that the capital stock at the last period improves current productivity, to investigate the consequences of a short-lived government’s behavior. Fisher and van Marrewijk (1998) examined a one-country OLG model, in which clean air was used as an input, and they showed the possibility of endogenous growth. In addition to intergenerational externality, global environmental policies have intragenerational externalities. The global environment brings nonrival and nonexcludable benefits to agents throughout the world. Thus, it can be thought of as a global public good. Improvement of the global environment by one country benefits not only the agents living in that country, but also the agents living in other countries. To examine international interactions, it is necessary to extend the analysis to a model that consists of at least two countries. 
John and Pecchenino (1997) investigated a two-country OLG model and examined the consequences of intragenerational international cooperation and the role of international transfers. However, studies of two-country OLG models of the global environment are relatively few compared with studies of one-country models, and those previous studies did not examine the effect of technological change in the two-country setting.Footnote 1 The present paper explores the effects of improved technology on economic growth and on the global environment, particularly the effects of a unilateral improvement in abatement technology. The model most closely related to our model is the one-country OLG model of John et al. (1995). By extending their one-country model to a two-country one, we examine the impact of a unilateral improvement in abatement technology. As in John et al. (1995), we assume that agents live in two periods: they work, save, and pay taxes when they are young, and they consume and benefit from the environment when they are old. We assume that at each period, the government of each country independently maximizes the welfare of its living agents by considering abatement as the best response to the abatement by the other country. Unlike John et al. (1995), we assume that governments take the interest and wage rates as givens. By assuming price-taking behavior, we avoid complexity and focus on strategic behavior in the global environment. Extending John et al.’s (1995) one-country model to a two-country model, we introduce heterogeneity of the countries. The two countries may differ in population size and in abatement technology. Using a static model, Ihori (1996) investigated the voluntary provision of an international public good by countries that differ in the productivity of the public good. He derived the welfare impacts of international transfers and of an improved productivity of the public good. Unlike his model, our model is an OLG model and we concentrate on the impacts of technological changes on the global environment and on capital stock. In our two-country model, the two countries face the same global environment, but their heterogeneity may cause the two countries to choose different behaviors. We derive three types of Nash equilibrium at each period: (1) two countries abate pollution; (2) only one country abates; and (3) no countries abate pollution. The results of our comparative static analyses are as follows. First, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a unilateral improvement in abatement technology to improve the two-country global environment and to increase the global capital stock. We show not only the condition for a unilateral improvement in abatement technology to improve the global environment, but also the condition that deteriorates the environment. The latter case is somewhat paradoxical. However, it occurs, for example, if the sustainable environmental quality is positively related to the capital stocks and if the improvement of environmental quality by advanced abatement technology is relatively small. Second, we show that both less pollutive consumption and a higher capital depletion rate result in greater accumulation of capital and higher environmental quality. Third, the greater the total factor productivity (TFP), the more capital is accumulated. However, the impact of TFP on environmental quality is ambiguous if one country does not abate the pollution in the initial steady state. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we construct our model. In Sect. 3, we investigate a single-country version of our model in which a single government governs two regions. In Sect. 4, we consider the behavior of a short-lived government in our two-country model. In Sect. 5, we derive the Nash equilibrium at each period. In Sect. 6, we obtain the steady state of this economy. In Sect. 7, we conduct several comparative static analyses. Section 8 concludes this paper.",

The environmental policy toolkit includes emission standards, tradeable emission permits and environmental taxes/subsidies. While complying with standards defined in terms of emissions per unit of the final product requires firm to invest in R&D for either abatement or replacement technologies, their reaction to the introduction of the adoption of policies based on the allocation of pollution rights or the introduction of Pigouvian taxation may just take the form of output reductions, with productive technologies remaining unmodified. That is to say, an industry may react to the introduction of an environmental policy by either reducing outputs, or implementing green R&D projects, or else by a combination of both. These alternative perspectives are indeed reflected in the steam of research being produced in this field. Indeed, many contributions examine the effectiveness of Pigouvian taxation in inducing firms to reduce damaging emissions through output contractionsFootnote 1 or through R&D efforts in the form of either abatement or replacement technologies.Footnote 2 The cap-and-trade policy has also been largely investigated,Footnote 3 and the comparative efficiency of these instruments in spurring green R&D has been assessed in great detail.Footnote 4
 Although a large portion of the literature on this matter does include in the picture R&D activities, such investments are not to be taken for granted because any output reduction is a substitute for emission abatement in terms of the resulting lower pressure exerted by any environmental policy on firm’s profits. As mentioned above, market-based instruments such as emission rights and carbon taxes, as opposed to command-and-control tools like standards, give firms the option to intervene on production plans only, without necessarily generating any appreciable technological progress. Of course, if pursued, this route involves deeply undesirable long-run consequences, with industries sticking to old and brown technologies for long periods. This aspect of the matter, in particular, has been addressed in a very influential paper by Laffont and Tirole (1996) who illustrate that pollution permits diminish or eliminate altogether firms’ incentives towards green R&D because once a firm has acquired the right to pollute, then she finds it more convenient to leave aside any uncertain and costly project eventually yielding a green technology.Footnote 5 This argument illustrates a gloomy perspective in which firms may perceive pollution permits as a competing technology offsetting innovation incentives. In addition, the use of permits becomes inefficient as soon as a green innovation is available. Our aim here is to nest into this debate by proposing a model connected with (Laffont and Tirole 1996), where, however, we introduce some relevant modifications in the way we characterise the interplay between the costly acquisition of pollution rights on one side and green innovation incentives on the other, so as to single out the possibility for a public agency aiming at preserving the environment to design the distribution of pollution rights as an instrument to foster environmental R&D, producing equilibrium outcomes at which permits and green innovations can coexist. As in [Laffont and Tirole (1996), pp 132–35], we assume that the government issues a given volume of non-tradeable permits, not contingent upon the availability of a clean technology. Unlike Laffont and Tirole (1996), we rule out the possibility of issuing additional permits ex post, which jeopardise innovation. Moreover, in Laffont and Tirole’s model, the mechanism used for allocating allowances is not fully specified, but there exists a demand schedule for emissions governing their allocation and ultimately interfering with the arising and adoption of green innovations. In our setting, it is instead assumed that, to acquire emission permits, firms must participate in a lottery for a fixed amount of permits controlled by the government, the winner being required to pay a fixed cost. The scope of adopting such a lottery for non-tradeable permits instead of the traditional cap-and-trade scheme, or any other involving a demand schedule, is precisely that of inducing losers to take the alternative route of R&D projects by ruling out the presence of a price mechanism that would allow permits to compete with green technologies. The mechanism yielding this result can be intuitively explained as follows. If the outcome of the lottery is the assignment of pollution rights to a limited number of firms (say, one), the losers face two alternatives: the first is to stay out of the market, the other is to enter with a clean technology. In view of this, the regulator may set up the lottery with this in mind, expecting to get two eggs in one basket. That is, awarding monopolistic pollution rights to a firm may not necessarily force the regulator to accept a suboptimal trade-off between market power (and the associated negative price effect) and pollution abatement, provided that—with some positive probability—the loser is going to innovate and enter the market with new clean technologies. Given the R&D expenses and the probability of innovation success, the regulator can appropriately raise the participation fee to the lottery to encourage the entire industry to disregard altogether the latter and invest instead in clean technologies, in such a way that the lottery can be considered as a powerful instrument in fieri in the hands of the regulator. To illustrate this perspective, we adopt a simple model involving two firms, choosing whether to participate in the lottery or try their luck in an uncertain R&D project aimed at the attainment of a green technology. We characterise (i) the equilibria of the game between firms, based on expected profit incentives, (ii) the consequences on consumer surplus, and (iii) the social preferences over alternative scenarios. The main result of our analysis is that the policy maker can manipulate the fee associated with the lottery to generate an outcome in which both firms actually disregard the lottery and invest in green technologies. Moreover, there exists a non-empty region of parameters where social and private incentives are indeed aligned, so that it appears that assigning pollution rights via the lottery can be taken—at least indirectly—as a means to drive profit-seeking firms to invest their resources in green technologies even in the absence of taxation or subsidisation, at the same time ensuring the attainment of social efficiency. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates the setup. Section 3 briefly outlines the problem from the consumers’ viewpoint. In Sect. 4, the firms’ equilibrium behaviour is illustrated. Section 5 assesses the social welfare consequences of market equilibria. An example based on the Cournot model is contained in Sect. 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.",2

Although the number of undernourished people has been decreasing since 1990–1992, global progress in reducing hunger has slowed and leveled off since the world food price crisis of 2006–2008 (hereinafter referred to as the food price crisis) (Fig. 1). As Fig. 1 shows, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the prevalence of undernourishment in the developing world by 2015 is within reach, if appropriate actions are taken to reverse the 2007 slowdown (FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012). However, it is presumed that the World Food Summit (WFS) goal of halving the number of undernourished people in the developing world by 2015 will be extremely difficult to reach. Hunger trends in developing regions (3-year moving average). Source: Modified by authors from Fig. 1 in FAO et al. (2012) At the same time, a large amount of edible and healthy food is wasted in today’s world. According to research conducted by the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) (Gustavsson et al. 2011, 2013), roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumptionFootnote 2 was lost or wasted globally in 2007, amounting to approximately 1.3 billion tons.Footnote 3In developed countries, the majority of losses occur at the consumer and food service levels, whereas in developing nations, most food losses occur between harvest and the market (Gustavsson et al. 2011).Footnote 4
 Food losses deprive the poor in the developing regions of the opportunity to access food and cause extensive depletion of resources such as land, water, and fossil fuels that are used in food production. Moreover, the food sector is estimated to contribute over 20 % of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (FAO 2011a). Postharvest losses have not received much attention since the passage of a 1975 U.N. resolution that called for a 50 % reduction in postharvest losses over the following decade (Stuart 2011). Food prices on world markets declined substantially from the early 1960s to the early 2000s, and this trend has been associated with considerable food losses and food waste during this period. However, global food prices began to increase slowly from 2003 to 2006 and then surged upward from 2006 to the middle of 2008, corresponding to the food price crisis. In addition, public awareness about natural resources and environmental issues has increased over the last few decades. In response to this changing situation, in January 2012, the European Parliament (2012) adopted a resolution to halve food wastage by 2025 and designated 2014 as the “European year against food waste.” In April 2012, the Japanese government introduced a policy intended to reduce food wastage in the food industry in accordance with the Food Recycling Law.Footnote 5 One reason for this law was that up to 8 million tonsFootnote 6 of edible food is estimated to be wasted in Japan each year, which is approximately equal to Japan’s annual rice production in weight (MAFF 2008). These actions at the state level are considered significant in that “reducing postharvest losses requires fewer resources and applies less pressure to the environment in maintaining the quantity and quality of food than through increased production to offset postharvest losses” (FAO 1981). Concurrently, researchers have taken a greater interest in the issues of food losses and food waste. As mentioned previously, the extent of global food losses and waste has been revealed in stark detail (Gustavsson et al. 2011). The global volume of food wastage is estimated to be 1.6 gigatons (Gt) of primary product equivalents (FAO 2013d, e). As a consequence, the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated to be 3.3 Gt of CO2 eq. without accounting for GHG emissions from land use change. The global consumption of surface and groundwater resources of food wastage is about 250 km3, and produced but uneaten food vainly occupies almost 1.4 billion hectares of land close to 30 % of the world’s agricultural land area. At the country level, Gunders (2012) estimates that getting food from farm to fork consumes 10 % of the total energy budget, uses 50 % of the land, and consumes 80 % of all freshwater in the United States. Nevertheless, up to 40 % of the food in the United States today goes uneaten. As a result, almost 25 % of U.S. methane emissions are produced by the uneaten food in landfills. According to a preliminary study on food waste across the EU 27 (European Commission 2010), annual food waste generation in the EU27 is estimated at approximately 89 million tons (Mt), which generates approximately 170 Mt of CO2
Footnote 7 and is expected to rise to approximately 126 Mt by 2020. With respect to long-range predictions, the United Kingdom’s Government Office for Science reported that halving the total amount of food waste by 2050 is a realistic target and that this could reduce the food required by an amount approximately equal to 25 % of today’s production, based on the current global estimate of 30 % waste (Foresight 2011). A report by the McKinsey Global Institute projects that reducing food waste by 30 % at the consumer level could save approximately 100 million acres of cropland by 2030 (Dobbs et al. 2011). Although several studies have demonstrated that food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain and that these losses lead to wasted resources such as land, water, energy, and other inputs and cause unnecessary GHG emissions, little research has been performed on the effects of food loss and food waste reduction on food insecurity in the developing regions, natural resources, and the environment. Consideration of market mechanisms, in particular, appears to be lacking in the research conducted on food losses and waste. Discussion of international food market effects is inevitable because less developed regions have tended to depend more on food imports during the recent economic globalization of the food supply chain. For instance, small import-dependent countries, especially in Africa, were deeply affected by the food price crisis. The number of undernourished people in Africa increased by 8 % during that period (FAO 2011c). The present study is undertaken to evaluate the effects of food loss and food waste reduction in developed regions on food insecurity in developing regions and on global natural resources and GHG emissions, taking reactions in the international food market into account. Although, food is lost mostly in the early and middle stages of the food supply chain in low-income countries, the present study is limited to the countermeasures against food wastage in developed countries, where the prevalence of undernourishment is relatively low and significant edible food is wasted at the consumption stage.",64

The best way to deal with this is to price carbon via either a global carbon tax or a global market for tradable emission permits. The price of carbon should in a first-best world be equal to the social cost of carbon, which corresponds to the present value of all future marginal global warming damages. As a result of pricing carbon appropriately, carbon emissions are curbed by substituting away from fossil fuel to renewable energy and other production factors, more fossil fuel reserves are locked up in the crust of the earth and the carbon-free era is brought forward. Furthermore, pricing carbon will make it attractive to also mitigate global warming with carbon capture and sequestration and research and development into renewables. It is crucial to get a good grasp of the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of the global carbon tax and also to have a quantitative assessment of the optimal carbon tax. Many empirical integrated assessment models of climate change have been developed for this purpose and yield useful estimates of the social cost of carbon starting from 5 to 35$ per ton of carbon (or 1.4–10$ per ton of CO2) in 2010 and rising to 16–50$ per ton of carbon (or 4.4–14$ per ton of CO2) in 2050 [e.g., the DICE, PAGE and FUND models described in Nordhaus (2008), Hope (2006) and Tol (2002), respectively], but the Stern Review obtains much higher estimates of the social cost of carbon with a much lower discount rate [e.g., Stern (2007)]. These models are often rather large and difficult to understand, so that it is not always clear what the underlying assumptions and the crucial parameters deriving the results are. Our purpose is therefore to put forward a simple classroom model of climate change and to carefully discuss an illustrative and transparent calibration of this model. We then use this to derive the optimal carbon tax, the optimal amount of fossil fuel to leave untapped, and the optimal time for the commencement of the carbon-free era, and to compare these with the no-policy outcomes. Crucial for our analysis are the twin assumptions of, on the one hand, the availability of carbon-free backstop technology such as solar or wind energy which is currently more expensive than fossil fuel, and, on the other hand, fossil fuel extraction costs which rise as less reserves are left. These assumptions ensure that there comes a point in time that the economy no longer uses fossil fuel and switches to using the carbon-free backstop. Our objective is to show how much fossil fuel reserves to leave untapped and to highlight the determinants of the timing of this energy transition We also use our model to discuss the adverse effects of the second-best policy of subsidizing renewables instead of the first-best policy of pricing carbon. Although this shortens the duration of the fossil fuel era and encourages the market to leave more fossil fuel unexploited compared with the no-policy scenario, it also leads to faster fossil fuel extraction rates and acceleration of global warming in the short run which has been coined the Green Paradox by Sinn (2008). Large renewables subsidies have proportionally larger economic costs and are thus more likely to be counterproductive from a welfare point of view. The first-best optimal carbon tax leads to slower fossil fuel extraction rates than under “laissez faire” and does not suffer from Green Paradox effects. The optimal carbon tax also locks up more fossil fuel in the crust of the earth. The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses and calibrates a simple classroom model of how burning fossil fuel leads to more atmospheric carbon and thus to more global warming. Section 3 discusses various specifications that have been used to capture damages for global warming and puts forward a simple specification which captures that at higher levels of mean global temperature damages increase more than proportionally with temperature. Section 4 puts forward a partial equilibrium model of fossil fuel depletion, renewables and climate change and uses it to discuss and highlight how increases in the carbon tax rate and the renewables subsidy can result in Green Paradox effects. Section 5 discusses social welfare and shows that large renewables subsidies cannot only damage green welfare, but can also damage overall welfare and thus be counterproductive. Section 6 derives the social optimum and the optimal carbon tax. Section 7 concludes.",3

Broadly speaking, there are four ways of achieving this target: reducing the output of primary and secondary energy use and of other CO2-intensive products, enhancing energy efficiency (i.e., producing the same amount of output with less carbon input), substituting low-carbon fossil fuels (such as natural gas) for carbon-intensive fuels (like lignite and hard coal), and generally replacing fossil fuels by increasing the share of renewable energy sources (RES). An efficient mix of all these measures would be the optimal solution. To make the allocation of such CO2 reduction efforts work, the marginal opportunity costs of all these measures have to be equal. Following this rule, CO2 reductions will be maximal given a fixed amount of financial resources. To meet their joint target at the lowest possible cost, signatory countries could implement a rigorous cap-and-trade system (or charge a corresponding uniform carbon tax) covering all their CO2 sources. If the whole world implemented a cap-and-trade system (or a uniform carbon tax) covering all sources of carbon, that of course would be better still. Looking at the different measures countries opt for in their attempts to curb CO2 emissions, we observe quite an array of different policy instruments, some used alternatively, others in an overlapping way. In the USA, for instance, a nationwide CO2 cap-and-trade system seems politically impracticable at the moment, with the upshot that an increasingly complex set of policy measures has evolved at state level. They encompass renewable portfolio standards, various energy efficiency programs, and (output) taxes on electricity or fuels (labeled “public benefits charges”) to generate revenues for energy efficiency programs and subsidies. In addition, states like California or groups of states in the north-east (headed by NY, MA, CT) have implemented local carbon-trading schemes, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Other states have implemented different schemes for using RES (renewable energy sources), notably for generating electricity (RES-E).Footnote 1
 By contrast, Europe’s major carbon policy is the EU-ETS, a CO2 emission cap-and-trade scheme covering roughly half of the continent’s overall CO2 emissions, including all emissions from major power plants and carbon-intensive industries. As a supplementary policy, the European Commission has also initiated the 20-20-20 target, meaning that by 2020 CO2 emissions are to be reduced by 20 %, energy efficiency increased by 20 %, and the share of RES stepped up to 20 %. Ignoring the problem of international carbon leakage for a moment, we can say that the spirit of Kyoto revolves around the emission reduction goal. But it is less obvious why the other two targets (increasing energy efficiency and implementing a particular share of RES) are necessary to achieve this overall emission reduction. In fact, it is far from clear whether these two sub-targets would be the spin-off from efficient allocation designed to achieve the main goal (a 20 % emission reduction). If they were, a cap-and-trade scheme would automatically bring about the achievement of these goals. If they were not, the sub-targets would only increase the cost of achieving the actual emission reduction target. Besides the main goal of curbing greenhouse gases, the EU directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources names other objectives of this policy, notably lowering dependence on fossil fuel imports, creating new employment opportunities, triggering green growth, and promoting competition on the electricity market (EC 2009). However, these additional objectives are highly questionable. Take the lowering-import-dependence argument. Except for oil, which plays almost no role in electricity production, fossil fuel resources are—unfortunately for the greenhouse problem—abundant and ubiquitous. In the last few decades, coal prices have increased only modestly and, due to the discovery of new deposits and new methods of exploitation, gas prices have even gone down. From the theory of exhaustible resources we know that if social and market interest rates coincide, if resources come under private property, and if resource markets are competitive, then the resource extraction path induced by the market will also be socially optimal and there will be no market failure. Therefore, if we were not facing the greenhouse problem, there would be little need to intervene in the market and artificially reduce fossil fuel imports. The employment and growth arguments also stand on shaky foundations. We will discuss these objectives in more detail in Sect. 7. Even if we take it as both self-evident and politically desirable that fossil fuels be salvaged, the question is how to implement such a target in a cost-efficient way. To achieve the 20 % RES share target in all energy use, various countries use different policies to increase the share of RES-E. These policies divide roughly into two classes, quantity-based and price-based. We refer to quantity-based policies if a certain share of RES-E is compulsory for electricity utilities. Nationwide (or worldwide), such a share can be implemented in a cost-efficient way by implementing a system of tradable green certificates (TGCs). This means that utilities (or private owners of RES-E equipment) exceeding the required share of RES-E can apply for certification of RES-E electricity units and sell these to electricity producers unable to meet the required target on their own (or only at a prohibitively high cost). Two main types of price instrument exist, the feed-in tariff system and the premium system. The latter, as implemented in Spain, works like a customary subsidy. RES-E electricity producers receive a premium (i.e., a subsidy) in addition to the market price, they are thus also exposed to market price volatility and can react to supply and demand. In a feed-in tariff system, as originally implemented in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany (62 other countries have now followed suit), RES-E electricity producers receive a guaranteed feed-in price independently of market prices. Electricity producers using RES are thus completely divorced from supply and demand, and grid operators have to buy RES-E electricity even if there is excess supply and the market price has become negative. In the feed-in tariff system as implemented in Germany (and other countries), there is indeed a guaranteed feed-in price, but the system is also discriminatory. Feed-in tariffs are technology-specific. The higher the unit cost of electricity production using a specific technology, the higher the feed-in tariff. Supporters of the discriminatory system put forward different arguments to justify this policy. One such argument is that the government has to boost learning-by-doing. By subsidizing high-cost technologies, cost can be brought down to competitive levels. The second, quite different argument is that a discriminatory system leads to low rents for both RES-E operators and RES-E equipment producers, thus keeping the social cost of subsidization low. In this article, we analyze both CO2 emission reduction and RES-E share policies. We start by recalling that if an emission cap is the only policy target, an optimal mix consisting of high and low carbon use of fossil fuels, deployment of RES-E and energy savings can best be achieved by either setting a uniform tax for CO2 or by implementing a cap-and-trade system covering all CO2 sources. An additional RES-E share target only makes it more expensive to achieve the emission cap. We also show that more ambitious emission targets lead to higher prices for both emissions and electricity and thus to lower output (i.e., higher electricity savings). A more ambitious target also automatically increases the share of RES-E and lowers the share of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. By contrast, the impact on low-carbon fossil fuels like natural gas is ambiguous. In a second step, we investigate how a uniform feed-in tariff (FIT) impacts on the crucial endogenous variables. For this purpose, we distinguish between a FIT financed in a lump-sum way (or by raising distortionary taxes elsewhere in the economy) and one that is financed by a mark-up on the electricity price. In the first case (lump-sum finance), increasing the uniform feed-in tariff does precisely the wrong thing. It leads to lower electricity prices and thus provides smaller incentives for households and industry to save energy. Such a policy clearly increases the share of RES-E, which is desirable. But it overshoots the mark, since it also crowds out low-carbon fossil fuels. If the FIT is financed by a mark-up on the electricity price, the effect will be similar. While the overall impact on total output and prices is ambiguous, electricity prices are indeed likely to increase. The third issue we shall be investigating is RES-E quotas. Our findings indicate that increasing the RES-E quota crowds out all fossil fuels including the low-carbon varieties, which is not necessarily efficient. The impact on total output is also ambiguous. Accepting a politically set RES-E quota, however, we show that such a quota can be efficiently decentralized by implementing a system of tradable green certificates (TGCs). The quota can equivalently be decentralized by a budget-balanced premium system where RES-E operators receive a premium on top of the market price and the premium is financed through a mark-up on the electricity price. A budget-balanced FIT system, by contrast, is less efficient since it creates a fiscal distortion through excessive electricity prices. We also discuss differentiated, technology-specific feed-in tariffs. Given a fixed share of RES-E, an increase in the tariff for high-cost electricity coupled with a reduction in the tariff for low-cost electricity will clearly lower the share of low-cost RES-E and increase the share of high-cost RES-E, thus rendering electricity production from RES-E altogether more costly and less efficient. The impact on the electricity-price surcharge and hence on the final price paid by consumers and industry is ambiguous. This finding contrasts with the claims typically put forward by the champions of technology-specific feed-in tariffs, who argue that these tariffs lower producer rents in the RES sector and are therefore beneficial for consumers. Finally, we scrutinize the learning-by-doing argument, contending that, if learning effects are purely private (i.e., there are no learning spillovers), FITs are not necessary or should simply be equal to the market price for electricity. Only if there are learning effects that differ across technologies can a differentiated technology-specific FIT system be justified. However, in contrast to current practice, the FITs should be paid according to the marginal spillover effects, not the current marginal cost of production. Private learning effects are (or should be) taken into account by RES equipment and electricity producers. There is a vast literature on the pros and cons of FITs and other climate policies. Many of the items in it are, however, anything but rigorous and are frequently based on unreliable theoretical foundations. Auer et al. (2009), Haas et al. (2004, 2010), Held et al. (2006) and others argue in favor of technology-specific FITs. Their main point is that such a differentiated system lowers producer rents and is better at reducing electricity prices than either a uniform FIT or a market TGCs. Mitchell et al. (2006) also favor FITs for the protection of RES-E generators from market hazards, thus shifting the risk from the green electricity producers to society. Klessmann et al. (2008) argue that a FIT system protects RES-E against market risk. By contrast, Midttun and Gautesen (2007) argue in favor of a cross-European TGC system. Jensen and Skytte (2002) study the interaction between the electricity output market and TGC markets. They argue that TGCs are not the right instrument for the deployment of RES-E. Zhou and Tamas (2010) investigate the interaction between TGCs and the output markets in the presence of market power. In a follow-up paper, Tamas et al. (2010) show that even under imperfect competition, uniform FITs and green certificates are equivalent. Morthorst (2003a, b) studies TGC markets in a multi-country model. In contrast to our conclusions, he argues that a combination of a CO2 permit market and TGCs might be efficient in achieving national CO2 reduction targets. Both Bläsi and Requate (2009) and Reichenbach and Requate (2012) study FITs and learning effects in the RES-E equipment industry. For both competitive and imperfectly competitive markets they show that pure learning effects do not warrant subsidies. Only if there are learning spillovers do subsidies for the RES-E equipment industry make sense, while FITs turn out to be inefficient. The authors draw on Petrakis et al. (1997), who show that the presence of purely private learning effects does not bring about market failure. This article is organized as follows: in the next section we set up the elements of a formal model. In Sect. 3, we study a pure emission target and instruments for achieving it. In Sect. 4, we investigate how to achieve a quota for renewable energy in an efficient way. In Sect. 5, we study differentiated industry-specific feed-in tariffs. In Sect. 6, we discuss the implications of learning-by-doing effects. In Sect. 7, we briefly discuss other objectives that are often put forward to justify the promotion of renewable energy sources, and in Sect. 8 we draw some conclusions and indicate various avenues that further research might usefully explore.",21

In the 1990s, policy makers primarily focused on the costs of specific emission reduction requirements, using marginal abatement cost (MAC) as an evaluation mechanism. Current policy discussions, however, focus increasingly on balancing costs and benefits. While the social cost of carbon (SCC) has been discussed in the academic world since the 1990s, this concept has only recently captured policy makers’ interests. Technically, the SCC denotes the net present value (NPV) of the impact on climate change by an additional ton of carbon being emitted into the atmosphere. The SCC is derived from a cost-benefit analysis using an integrated economic-environmental model. The MAC is defined as the cost of reducing carbon emissions by an additional one ton to achieve a specific abatement goal. The MAC is derived from a cost-effectiveness analysis using the integrated economic-environmental model. It should be noted that at the SCC point, the values for both SCC and MAC become equal, that is, the two mechanisms overlap under certain circumstances. While the SCC is gaining more attention, it does not necessarily mean that the SCC is being accepted as a policy goal. For example, the Kyoto Protocol and the Post-Kyoto negotiations adopt the MAC-based cost-effectiveness approach. Therefore, it is important to understand both the SCC and MAC for climate policy considerations. A number of studies estimate the SCC and MAC through energy-economy models. However, their estimates are study dependent, and it is difficult to find a price consensus among researchers. Significant SCC research has been conducted that consolidates the price range (see Fankhauser and Tol 1997; Tol 2005). Kuik et al. (2009) summarized the price range for the MAC. Tol (2005) and Kuik et al. (2009) conducted regression analyses for the existing SCC and MAC estimates, selecting factors that determine carbon prices. While there may be several causes for carbon price variation, parameter setting is often the major one. The Stern Review (Stern 2007), for example, showed that a high SCC can be a consequence of setting a low discount rate. This paper conducts a parameter sensitivity analysis of the SCC and MAC, finding parameters that increase carbon prices as well as mechanisms that result in the increase of these prices. The SCC and MAC sensitivity analysis is not novel. Nordhaus (1994) and Gerlagh and van der Zwaan (2004), for example, conducted sensitivity analyses on the SCC and MAC, respectively. These studies show the factors increase carbon prices. However, the mechanisms of this carbon price increase have not yet been fully investigated. To examine this phenomena, the marginal benefit and cost curves similar to that of Pizer (2002) addressed the debate on price versus quantity control in climate change policy. Carbon prices are arrived at by determining the net of the marginal benefit (MB) minus the marginal cost (MC) of CO2 emission reduction.Footnote 1 The intersection of the MB and MC curves represents the SCC (see Fig. 1). The MAC is bounded by the MC curve and is primarily dependent on the exogenous goal of CO2 emission reduction, yielding the implicit damage function in the model. Moreover, because of the above difference, the parameters that increase the SCC and MAC as well as the mechanisms that increase the carbon prices differ. Two possible mechanisms of the SCC increase: Price increase by an upward shift of the MB and MC curves As a simplistic notion, there are two SCC increase mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 1
Footnote 2: one is an upward shift in the MB curve, and the other is an upward shift in the MC curve. The SCC increase mechanisms, however, are different from those shown in Fig. 1. This study analyzes the SCC and MAC increase mechanisms and the resulting shift of the MB and MC curves when parameter values are changed. The findings of these analyses contribute to the consideration of the SCC or MAC as appropriate for policy formulation. Section 2 reviews previous studies’ estimates of the SCC and MAC, and compares the time profiles of their values. Section 3 conducts a sensitivity analysis of the SCC using the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) model proposed by Nordhaus (2008) to shed light on the mechanisms of SCC increase. Section 4 presents the sensitivity analysis of the MAC, conducting an observation similar to that in Sect. 3. Section 5 concludes.",4

Especially as long as there is no worldwide carbon pricing scheme, climate policy can attempt to reduce emissions by supporting investments that transfer advanced technologies to developing countries. But also with a global carbon pricing scheme, such support can ease market-based technology diffusion. A commitment for financial and technological support for developing countries by industrialized countries can also convince developing countries to join a carbon pricing scheme. Therefore, plans for supporting and governing energy investments and technology transfer have been frequently proposed (Bali Roadmap 2007; Copenhagen Accord 2009; Cancún Summit 2010) and worked out. In particular, international transfers amounting to 100 billion US-$ per annum by 2020 were ambitiously proposed (compare UNFCCC 2010). Currently, technology funding schemes are being introduced (for example, Climate Investment Funds 2014; for a critical comparison with the UNFCCC framework: Haughey 2009; for an overview: Climate Funds Update 2014). Technology funding can principally occur via grants, loans and guarantees for potentially energy-saving investment projects. Because technology funding policies are in their early phase, it is still open how technology funding will work out and how an economically efficient design of a technology funding mechanism looks like. It is also open to what extent and for what purposes developing countries will in theory make use of technology funding and what the outcomes in terms of technical progress, economic development and emissions will be. This paper addresses these research issues. A better understanding of these issues can help design technology funding schemes in such a way that the likelihood of achieving the desired policy effects—in particular emissions reductions and economic growth—increases. For this purpose, this paper sets up a ‘Ramsey type’ growth model of intertemporally optimal investment for a developing country as a small open economy. Besides using domestically created capital, the country can buy capital from abroad. ‘Abroad’ means in particular from industrialized countries. Different to domestic capital, foreign capital embodies advanced technologies that create technology spillovers. There are two types of spillovers: an output increasing and a carbon emissions reducing spillover. They work in opposite directions in terms of total emissions. Increasing output raises carbon emissions by assuming that production requires energy and energy generation requires fossil fuel inputs. Nonetheless, the output increasing spillover is inevitable for economic development. Going beyond a scale, technique and composition effect (Antweiler et al. 2001), the socially optimal solution of this model shows that buying capital from abroad generates in total five effects: (1) Productive capital: Capital as a production factor simply increases output. (2) Productive technology: The embodied technologies increase output (positive side effect of capital use and externality in case of spillovers to other firms). (3) Emitting capital: The use of capital additionally requires the use of fossil fuel inputs that generate carbon emissions. (4) Emitting technology: Since technologies also increase output, they will indirectly also increase fossil fuel use and thus emissions (negative externality of capital use). (5) Abating technology: The embodied technologies reduce the volume of emissions generated by a given volume of capital or output (positive side effect and spillover externality of capital use). These effects are derived from the first-order conditions of the model solution. This paper then identifies four technology-related policy levers that make use of these five effects with the aim to enhance technology spillovers: (1) Emissions intensity of energy supply, (2) Energy efficiency of production, (3) Macroeconomic absorptive capacity, and (4) Microeconomic absorptive capacity. It shows how these effects and levers are interconnected. Based on these insights, it opts for an integrated technology funding scheme that takes all these aspects listed above into account rather than solely focusing on one aspect. Such an integrated technology funding scheme has so far not hardly been considered in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or in technology funding schemes. Each single policy lever (for example, a reduction in the emissions intensity of energy supply via low-carbon technologies) is due to diminishing returns and hampered by other factors that are insufficiently developed (for example, infrastructure as a determinant of absorptive capacity). Although technology funding has recently gained such a high relevance, scholars have hardly theoretically examined technology funding schemes. Yet there are comprehensive reports addressing climate change, economic development, international financing and technology transfer (IPCC 2000; OECD 2002; World Bank 2006, 2008, 2010; climate finance: Levi et al. 2010; climate funding: OECD 2010; innovation and technology diffusion: UNFCCC 2010). And there are numerous (1) theoretical, (2) numerical, (3) econometric, and (4) innovation system studies that address issues related to international technology spillovers. The following references can only provide a brief overview of related literature strands: The theoretical literature on (endogenous) growth covers international technology spillovers (for textbook versions: Acemoglu 2009, chapter 18; Aghion and Howitt 2009, chapter 7) and technical change that can be directed towards clean and dirty technologies or sectors (Acemoglu et al. 2011). More specifically, some theoretical contributions have studied the complex interaction of international technology spillovers with different carbon pricing schemes (Golombek and Hoel 2005, 2008, 2011). A recent theoretical contribution examines international cooperation on technological development as an alternative to international cooperation on emissions reductions (El-Sayed and Rubio 2014). It shows that, under specific assumptions, a coalition engaged in technological cooperation consists of three to six members. Innovation and international technology diffusion have been acknowledged as being important for numerical climate policy modeling and thus been implemented in a number of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models (Popp 2004; Kemfert 2005; Otto et al. 2008; Hübler 2011; Kypreos and Turton 2011) and numerical growth models (Edenhofer et al. 2005; Bosetti et al. 2008; Leimbach and Baumstark 2010; Hübler et al. 2012). In this literature, endogenous innovation and imitation (international technology spillovers) have some potential to reduce climate policy costs. Numerous econometric studies examine technology spillovers via foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade in general (for example, Aitken and Harrison 1999; Javorcik 2004; for overviews: Blomström and Kokko 1998; Saggi 2002; Keller 2004; Hoekman and Javorcik 2006) and a few in particular with respect to energy and emissions savings (Cole 2006; Perkins and Neumayer 2009; Hübler and Keller 2010), with mixed results. A few studies find energy efficiency improvements via Official Development Assistance (ODA) (Hübler and Keller 2010; Kretschmer et al. 2013). Moreover, technology transfer is found to occur via the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) (De Coninck et al. 2007). A large number of studies describe processes of innovation and technology diffusion in the form of innovation systems that encompass system functions (for example, Hekkert et al. 2007, 2009). A ‘system of innovation’ describes the ‘determinants of innovation processes’, this means “all important economic, social, political, organizational, institutional, and other factors that influence the development, diffusion, and use of innovations” (Edquist 2005). More specifically, they distinguish the functions ‘entrepreneurial activities’, ‘knowledge development (learning)’, ‘knowledge diffusion through networks’, ‘guidance of the search’, ‘market formation’, ‘resource mobilisation’, and ‘creation of legitimacy/counteract resistance to change’ (Hekkert et al. 2009). Some studies particularly focus on the evolution of (renewable) energy technology systems (for instance, Jacobsson and Bergek 2004; Healey and Bunting 2008). Finally, the literature on technological transitions examines “socio-technical regimes, niches and landscapes, which form the basis of a so-called multi-level framework to study the transformation of regimes” (Markard and Truffer 2008). This paper fills the lack of theoretical thinking about technology funding at least to some extent: It sets up and analyzes an intuitive, stylized Ramsey type model of economic growth in Sect. 2. It discusses the different effects and policy levers and their interactions in Sect. 3. It derives policy conclusions and discusses future research in Sect. 4.",1

Wiedmann,Heinz Schandl,Daniel Moran,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Throughout history, metals have played an important role in human development and large increases in metal use have been a symbol and a condition for the thriving of modern societies. The way we build, get around and communicate today critically depends on the availability of large amounts or iron and steel, copper and aluminium as well as a large variety of other metals (Chen and Graedel 2012; Gerst and Graedel 2008). Global metal ore extraction has grown rapidly in the past few decades and reached an unprecedented level of almost 7.4 billion tons (gigatons Gt) in 2008. This is twice as much as in 1985 and three times as much as in 1970 (CSIRO 2013; Krausmann et al. 2009). Metal consumption is set to grow in the future (Cullen and Allwood 2013; Cullen et al. 2012), not least because low-carbon energy infrastructure is also dependent on metals (Prior et al. 2012; Vidal et al. 2013). Recent research has found a strong coupling of metal use and economic development suggesting a high income elasticity of consumption (Steinberger et al. 2013; Steinberger and Krausmann 2011). Rapid economic growth in China and other developing countries, especially since 2000 (Schandl and West 2010), has ratcheted up metal ore extraction and has led to increasing global metal ore prices for the first time in a century (McKinsey Global Institute 2011). Further processes of industrialization and urbanization and the growth of a new middle-class in many developing countries (Myers and Kent 2003) suggest that the global demand for iron ore and bauxite will further increase. This puts pressure on business strategies and policies to enhance resource productivity of metal use dramatically not to curb development and prosperity in many developing countries (Bleischwitz 2011; Bringezu and Bleischwitz 2009). Adequate metrics of resource productivity are required to inform effective policy design. Currently used measures, however, tend to mask the full reliance of consumption on primary resources from global supply chains (Wiedmann et al. 2013). One commonly used indicator, domestic material consumption (DMC), suggests that OECD countries have stabilized their use of metal ores (OECD 2011) when in reality material and energy intensive processes of production may have been outsourced to other countries. In this research we look at global patterns of supply and demand for two economically critical metal ores—iron ore and bauxite—and take a novel look at the productivity of metal use proposing a consumption perspective. Iron ore is the world’s most commonly used metal and steel making is one of the world’s largest industries with applications in structural engineering (buildings, bridges, and other large scale construction projects), in transport (ships, railways and automobiles) and other industry sectors such as machinery and tools (Cullen et al. 2012; Moynihan and Allwood 2012; Pauliuk et al. 2013b). Steel production accounts for 25 % of global industrial CO2 emissions (Allwood and Cullen 2012). Because of the abundance of iron ore there is no immediate issue of supply scarcity for steel making. Mining of iron ore is a highly capital-intensive business with high physical volumes and low economic margins, undertaken by a handful of multinational companies including Vale (of Brazil), BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. Bauxite—aluminium ore—is the most widely used non-ferrous metal ore. Aluminium has a wide range of applications including in transportation, packaging, construction (windows and doors), household items, and shells of consumer electronics and for electrical transmission lines, to mention the most important uses (Liu et al. 2013; Liu and Müller 2013a, b). Recycling rates for both metals are relatively high—end-of-life recycling rates for iron and aluminium are above 50 % (Reck and Graedel 2012) and can reach up to 90 % for iron and 70 % for aluminium (Graedel et al. 2011). These rates are enabled through the usage of scrap steel in steel production and the favourable energy balance of recycled aluminium when compared to virgin aluminium. For iron and aluminium the primary sustainability concerns evolve around the energy and pollution intensity of ore processing (e.g. Milford et al. 2013). Liu and Müller (Liu and Müller 2013a, p.4882), for example, write: “The contemporary global aluminium stock in use (0.6 Gt or 90 kg/capita) has reached about 10 % of that in known bauxite reserves and represents an embodied energy amount that is equivalent to three-quarters of the present global annual electricity consumption”. There are additional social, economic and environmental impacts of mining and increasing conflicts with other land uses, such as agriculture, that must be considered if further extension of current supply systems is to be considered. It may well be that constraints to increasing supply are social and environmental, not merely limits on resource availability (Martínez-Alier et al. 2010). The apparent unsustainable and rising levels of global metal consumption require a step change in resource productivity, i.e. a much higher economic and physical efficiency of metal extraction, transformation and use (Ayres et al. 2013). The potential for efficiency improvements can be large, as has been shown for the steel production sector (von Weizsäcker et al. 2009). However, has there been any actual progress in the recent past in using metal resources more efficiently at the global or regional level? Have there been evident cases of relative or even absolute decoupling of metal ore use from economic growth (cf. UNEP 2011)? These are the questions we are addressing in this research. We investigate the productivity of consuming metal ores in selected countries and world regions for the period 1990–2008. Resource productivity is defined as GDP output per resource input; sometimes the inverse—resource use per GDP—is measured as the resource intensity. An overview of the literature and brief discussion has been provided by Steinberger and Krausmann 2011 (see also Gan et al. 2013). Whilst gross domestic product over domestic material consumption (GDP/DMC) is currently being used by governments as an official indicator of resource productivity, it has recently been suggested to use the material footprint as the basis for measuring resource productivity (Wiedmann et al. 2013) to correct for shifts in environmental burden through trade. The material footprint (MF) is a consumption-based material flow indicator (Wiedmann et al. 2013), most widely known under the term raw material consumption (RMC) (Bruckner et al. 2012; Kovanda et al. 2012; Kovanda and Weinzettel 2013; Muñoz et al. 2009; Schaffartzik et al. 2013; Schoer et al. 2012; Weinzettel and Kovanda 2009, 2011; Wiebe et al. 2012). Analysis of international flows of materials, and particularly critical and scarce materials, has been an area of increased research activity in the field of Industrial Ecology in recent years (Bleischwitz et al. 2012; Dittrich and Bringezu 2010; Dittrich et al. 2012; Eckelman et al. 2012; Elshkaki and Graedel 2013; Giljum et al. 2014; Nansai et al. 2014). The MF is conceptually equivalent to other footprint approaches for carbon emissions, energy and water (Čuček et al. 2012; Ewing et al. 2012; Fang et al. 2014; Galli et al. 2012, 2013; Giljum et al. 2013; Moran et al. 2013; Steen-Olsen et al. 2012) and summarizes the total amount of raw materials (metal ores in the case of the present study) associated with the domestic final demand of a country or region. An important idiosyncrasy of the MF is that it does not account for the actual physical movement of materials within and between countries but instead provides a quantitative link between producing countries (where natural resources are extracted) and consuming countries (where final products are consumed). The advantage of using MF instead of DMC to quantify resource productivity is grounded in the fact that DMC is limited to the amount of materials directly used by an economy and does not include upstream raw material requirements occurring in countries that export goods and services to that economy (Wiedmann et al. 2013). The MF accounts for these upstream raw material equivalents (RME) associated with imports, exports and consumption. We approach resource productivity from a consumption perspective of metal ore use. This perspective compares the footprint of metal ore mo of a country to the total economic activity in this country, expressed as gross domestic product (GDP). Resource productivity of consumption can, therefore, be expressed as RPcons = GDP/MFmo. All numbers are expressed on an annual basis. This consumption-based indicator of RP is a novel way of assessing the resource productivity of metal use, addressing questions at the interface of economic and Industrial Ecology research. The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. After a description of methodology and data in Sect. 2 we first identify important countries in terms of iron ore and bauxite production and consumption (3.1) and then analyse trends in metal ore productivity from the consumption perspective (3.2). We discuss our findings and conclude in Sects. 4 and 5.",38
17.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,17 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-014-0086-x,Analyzing instability of industrial clustering techniques,July 2015,Shunsuke Okamoto,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In Japan, a large number of organizations have regularly published life-cycle assessment (LCA) reports as specified in the ISO 14000 series (Suh et al. 2004). An important issue of the LCA is how an organization estimates its life-cycle CO2 emissions through the entire supply-chain network. An LCA is categorized into two analyses: a process analysis and an input–output analysis (Heijungs 1994; Joshi 1999; Suh and Huppes 2005; Suh and Nakamura 2007; Lenzen and Crawford 2009; Strømman et al. 2009; Fukuyama et al. 2011; Shao and Chen 2013; Shao et al. 2014). The process analysis has an advantage in accuracy in the production processes, while the input–output analysis has an advantage in its completeness with regards to the supply-chain network (i.e., it uses a complete system boundary) (Suh et al. 2004). The process LCA method is subjective, in the sense that the LCA system boundary is freely decided by LCA practitioners, which consequently leads to truncation error and underestimation of life-cycle emissions (Lenzen 2001). Kagawa et al. (2013a, b) developed a graph partitioning method that combines the spectral clustering method and input–output analysis to find environmentally important supply-chain clusters and proposed that one of the implications of the results of their analyses is that LCA practitioners will be able to determine the critical LCA system boundary based on the cluster information. In addition, recent mixed research on clustering and component analysis has contributed to unifying the assessment of industry-based CO2 emissions in China (Xia et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012). Graph partitioning methods were originally developed in the fields of computer image processing and discrete optimization (Donath and Hofmann 1973; Fiedler 1973; Lee and Seung 1999, 2001; Shi and Malik 2000; Ding et al. 2005; von Luxburg 2007; von Luxburg et al. 2008; Zhang and Jordan 2008) and have since been applied to a wide range of fields, including economics, sociology, and industrial ecology (see, for example, Kagawa et al. 2013a, b). Graph partitioning methods operate on network structures consisting of nodes and edges; in economics, for example, the nodes might correspond to industrial sectors and the edges might correspond to transactions between industries, whereas in sociology the nodes and edges might correspond to actors and the interconnections between them, respectively. These methods detect relatively strong sub-networks, i.e., clusters, in these economic and social networks. As noted by Kagawa et al. (2013a, b), cluster analysis methods for network partition can be categorized into methods based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the normalized Laplacian matrix (see, for example, Zhang and Jordan 2008) and methods based on the nonnegative matrix factorization of the normalized affinity matrix (see, for example, Ding et al. 2005). It is still unclear whether one of these two classes of methods yields approximate solutions of greater accuracy than the other, and what the extent of the superiority is. Both clustering methods based on eigenvalue decomposition and nonnegative matrix factorization ultimately use rounding procedures via the K-means method to convert an approximate assignment matrix including real values into a (0, 1) assignment matrix, which identifies the clusters to which individual nodes should be assigned. It is well known that rounding via the K-means method is unstable due to random initialization of cluster centers (Ben-David et al. 2007; Ben-David and von Luxburg 2008; von Luxburg 2010), and therefore in Kagawa et al. (2013b), the K-means method was applied 100 times to try to reduce the instability of the K-means method. However, there is no guarantee that 100 repetitions of the K-means procedure suffices to yield a reliable solution (i.e., an accurate assignment matrix). In general, although increasing the number of repetitions might bring the second best solution closer to the global optimum, using an extremely large number of repetitions in the K-means method requires a dramatically larger computation time. Herein, this paper focuses on two clustering methods based on nonnegative matrix factorization and eigenvalue decomposition, and compares the reliability of the solutions obtained using the two methods. In addition, the number of K-means repetitions required to obtain a reliable solution is investigated. As a case study, the network data describing supply chains for passenger vehicles studied by Kagawa et al. (2013a, b) are considered. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 formulates the two clustering methods. Section 3 describes the data used in this study. Section 4 presents results obtained by applying the two clustering methods to network data for passenger-vehicle supply chains; a comparative assessment of the results and discuss on how the solution is affected by the number of repetitions of the K-means rounding procedure are presented. Conclusions are given in Sect. 5.",4

A confidence analysis of a contingent valuation application",October 2015,Dani Aoun,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Following the current trends in environmental degradation, some 46–58 million square miles of forest are lost each yearFootnote 1, noting that forests cover 31 % only of the land area on our planet; therefore, the importance of preserving the environment for future generations has never been more vital than today. Lebanon is no exception. After 15 years of civil war (1975–1990), and a general absence of strict environmental laws, a country once 25 % green has now reached a 13.4 % thresholdFootnote 2. Lebanon has over the last few decades, seen its forests suffer from chaotic human activity marked by widespread disregard for the environment, such as overhunting, overcutting, and overgrazing. This has led to the ruin of the floral and faunal resources, a great imbalance in the productive system, as well as bringing some rare species of plants and animals to the verge of extinction. Natural reserves or protected areas are one of the mostly used instruments to preserve the environment; they now cover more than 12 % of global land area (Chape et al. 2005) and are a critical environmental policy tool. These areas provide important environmental benefits including carbon sequestration, watershed protection, and wildlife habitat (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005; IPCC 2007; International Union for the Conservation of Nature 2009). However, the global conservation community is increasingly concerned about the local socioeconomic impacts of protected areas (Adams et al. 2004; Scherl et al. 2004; Agrawal and Redford 2006; Wilkie et al. 2006; Robalino 2007; Ferraro and Hanaeur 2011). By definition, protected areas will constrain resource use, and might reduce local incomes. However, protected areas might also create new income from eco-tourism; stimulate infrastructure improvement, or increase the flows of economically significant environmental services. Unfortunately, there is little empirical evidence on the socioeconomic impacts of protected areas in developing countries to inform this debate. As a result, the research principally seeks to provide an economic valuation of a protected area in Lebanon estimating local residents’ and visitors’ willingness to pay (WTP), by using the contingent valuation method, one of the most appropriate tools for valuing non-market public goods, as is the case in hand. We also aim to determine whether there are any appreciable differences between the valuations declared by visitors and local residents (Fairweather and Swaffield 2002; Hess and Beharry-Borg 2012) and to assess the sensitivity of these findings to the subjects’ various socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics. In addition to measuring the respondents’ WTP, we aim also to evaluate the Lebanese population knowledge of the reserve and their valuation of the reserve’s different attributes. The findings to emerge from the research may prove useful in gaining an insight into visitors’ demand and may provide guidelines for management issues such as pricing policy, capturing sponsorship or project evaluation. Finally, as an innovation, we explore hypothetical bias problems in contingent valuation exercises and correction thereof through a certainty analysis of stated preferences. The paper is structured as follows: this section is the introduction. Section 2 gives an overview of Ehden reserve, their value and attributes. Section 3 presents the method used while Sect. 4 covers the survey and respondents’ profiles. Section 5 presents the results of the study and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",2

Binam,Frank Place,Eric Haglund,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The importance of the parkland system in the Sahelian and Sudanian ecozones is well-known as the rural communities in these areas are vulnerable to climate hazards, due to their dependence on natural resources and climate sensitive livelihoods (Batterbury and Warren 2001; Duvall 2007; Tsurumi and Managi 2013). The parklands have at least three main functions in the household economy of rural communities living in or adjacent to them. Firstly, they help to fulfill households’ subsistence and consumption needs in terms of, e.g. energy and nutrition as well as medical and construction purposes. Secondly, they serve as a safety net in times of crises (e.g. income shortages from other income sources, e.g. crop failure) and thirdly, some AFTPs provide regular cash income (Kater et al. 1992; Sabiiti and Cobbina 1992; Hall et al. 1996, 1997; Cavendish 2000; Campbell and Luckert 2002; Maranz et al. 2004; Shackleton and Shackleton 2004; Diallo 2001; Becker and Statz 2003; Teklehaimanot 2004; Kalinganire et al. 2007; Sidibé and Williams 2002; Kouyaté 2005; Cavendish 2002; Angelsen and Wunder 2003; Chileshe 2005; Shackleton et al. 2007; CIFOR 2011). Added to these provision services, Jonsson et al. (1999) reported agricultural crops under trees were less exposed to excessive temperature of above 40 °C. Trees from agroforestry parklands can also reduce wind speed while increasing soil and air humidity as well as diseases like fungal attacks (Bayala et al. 2014). For soil property, recent studies of Sahelian agroforestry parklands have revealed a decrease in soil bulk density and as a consequence, soil under trees displayed higher porosity compare to adjacent open areas (Sanou et al. 2010 quoted by Bayala et al. 2014). Beyond the above-mentioned provision and regulation services, trees in the parklands provide also supporting services as they contribute to the reduction of carbon in the atmosphere by accumulating biomass via photosynthesis. This process is important as indicated by Bayala et al. (2014), in improving soil properties when accumulated biomass is stored in the below-ground compartment as soil carbon. However, the relationship between parkland trees and soil fertility is not simple and unidirectional because some trees are more likely to regenerate and thrive in spots of higher fertility. Thus, farmer managed natural regeneration can be perceived as an improved land-use management practice that is also essential to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These parklands are the result of conversion of forest to agricultural landscapes. In the process, farmers maintained some tree species that they found useful either for the products or environmental services. If young trees emerge through natural regeneration, and the farmer finds the species useful, then he/she protects and manages that species in the parkland. The practice of actively managing and protecting non-planted trees and shrubs with the goal of increasing the value or quantity of woody vegetation on farmland is known as farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) (Abasse et al. 2009; Haglund et al. 2011). Pye-smith (2013) added that FMNR is a practice which involves identifying and protecting the wildlings of trees and shrubs on farmland. It depends on the existence of living roots systems and seeds. Shoots from roots grow more rapidly than saplings from seed, and they make up the bulk of protected woody matter on farm. Farmers will generally choose five of the strongest stumps they wish to retain on their land, pruning away the remainder. These stems can periodically be harvested to provide firewood and timber. For larger trees, farmers will often allow one stem to develop into a full-size tree. The species favored by farmers vary from place to place; so does the density of the trees. Some projects have advised farmers to keep 40 trees/ha, but densities of over 150 are not unusual. While there are common parkland species throughout the Sahelian/Sudanian ecozones, the composition of species differs across space due to rainfall conditions, topographical location, soils and farmers’ preferences for tree species and functions (Faye et al. 2011). Tree density is similarly variable and anthropogenic factors are also important in its determination. The management of trees to protect the soil from drying out and the diversification of agricultural products are additional strategies to cope with climate hazards (Robledo et al. 2012). Some of the benefits from FMNR have been studied but not well quantified in terms of economics and livelihoods (Haglund et al. 2011). Furthermore, there has been no systematic study of how such benefits vary across the landscape according to the parklands, countries, etc. The main objective of this study is to provide information about the economic benefits of FMNR practices and other socio-cultural benefits to guide decisions on whether, where and how to scale up the practice to other dryland and sub-humid areas. In achieving this, the paper aims to provide insight into two questions. First, what is the level of economic benefits that communities and households obtain from FMNR? Second, how do these benefits differ among different socio-environmental conditions such as dominant parkland type? Our econometric analysis is based on cross-sectional data collected from a stratified sample of 1080 households residing in four countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal). The livelihood benefit variables include crop production (quantity of cereals harvested), household income and food security as captured by the food consumption score (FCS) and coping strategy index (CSI). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the theoretical framework used to estimate the impact of FMNR practice on the selected outcomes, and describes the sampling procedure of the study and the type of data used for estimation. The results and discussion section provides basic descriptive statistics and presents the estimated impacts of FMNR practice. The last section summarizes the main findings, draws some policy implications and highlights areas for further research.",31

The ETS sectors’ CO2 emissions account for approximately 40 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. During the first period, between 2005 and 2007, 99.8 % of the allocations were distributed for free, the remaining part being auctioned. National Allocation Plans for the second period, from 2008 to 2012, distributed 97 % of allocations for free (Schleich et al. 2009). And from 2013, the beginning of the 3rd phase, roughly 50 % of allocations are allocated for free (European Union 2009). Free allocation was motivated to avoid carbon leakage from a loss of competitiveness. The following two intertwined mechanisms may drive such a competitiveness-driven carbon leakage. Carbon costs, insofar as they are passed through in sales prices, cause a higher European demand for imports and a lower international demand for exports. Under free allocation, carbon opportunity costs may be passed through in sales prices (see further). To the extent that this is the case, free allocation is not effective against this channel of carbon leakage. By contrast, insofar as companies do not pass through real carbon costs in sales prices, profitability decreases. This dampened profitability may lower investments and stimulate off-shoring. Under free allocation, real carbon costs are close to zero. Hence for this mechanism, free allocation is effective against carbon leakage. On the other hand, Porter and Reinhardt (2007) argue that a stringent climate policy imposes low-carbon strategies on companies, stimulating R&D, energy efficiency and innovation which will ultimately create a competitive advantage in the long run. To our best knowledge, carbon leakage has not yet been observed ex post for any sector (Ellerman et al. 2010; Lacombe 2008; Reinaud 2008a). But since carbon leakage is a slow process and since market shares are driven by many factors, finding a significant impact of the EU ETS on carbon leakage for such a short time frame is difficult. Many studies have estimated carbon leakage ex-ante for different sectors, with contrasting conclusions (Anger 2010; Bernard and Vielle 2009; Demailly and Quirion 2008; Fitzgerald et al. 2009; Hourcade et al. 2008; Ponssard and Walker 2008; Reinaud 2005, 2008b; Smale et al. 2006; Szabó et al. 2006; Tomás et al. 2010; see Chapter II for an overview). These studies examine the economic effect of the EU ETS by estimating demand and supply functions and cost pass-through. The difficulty of observing loss of competitiveness makes it particularly relevant to monitor the ETS’s perceived impact on firm earnings by evaluating investor’s expectations. Indeed, stock prices can be considered as representing the expected discounted future cash flows of companies (Fama 1991). This paper investigates the effect of carbon prices on stock prices of ETS-regulated companies. This allows to evaluate whether investors expect the regulatory burden of the EU ETS to be shifted to shareholders or on the contrary, if shareholders expect the EU ETS to have a positive effect on profitability. In the former case, the investment-driven channel of carbon leakage is a policy concern, in the latter case, the investment-driven channel of carbon leakage is unlikely. Consequently, the assessment from a capital market perspective is a complementary approach to the above-mentioned approach of estimating carbon leakage via the estimated cost pass-through. Besides policy evaluation of the EU ETS, the correlation between stocks and carbon returns is of interest for hedging strategies against EUA price risks. Oberndorfer (2009) and Veith et al. (2009) investigated the link between carbon prices and stock prices during the first EU ETS period (2005–2007) for the electricity sector. Mo et al. (2012) investigated the electricity sector during the first and second (2006–2009) period. All authors find a positive effect of carbon market prices on stocks of electricity companies during the first phase of the ETS. For the second phase, Mo et al. (2012) find a negative effect of carbon prices on stock market prices for the electricity prices. The first contribution of this paper is to develop a more efficient econometric methodology to estimate the effect of carbon prices on stock prices. Econometric efficiency is of particular importance because price elasticities are very low. We compare outcomes, efficiency and bias of 21 model specifications. We find that the taking into account conditional heteroscedasticity and covariances of error terms between firms by a multivariate GARCH leads to a considerable efficiency gain. We show the importance of avoiding aggregation bias when imposing a common carbon effect for all companies belonging to a common sector. The second contribution of this study lies in the fact that we expand the analysis to six other sectors beside the electricity sector. This is of particular policy importance since carbon leakage exposure is assumed for the allocation rules in the 3rd period but difficult to observe. Moreover, windfall profits from cost pass-through are not studied intensively, as it is the case for the electricity sector (see Sect. 2). Expanding the study to more sectors also led to investigate a much larger number of companies (N = 97) than former studies. The following section presents the hypotheses that will be tested; Sect. 3 describes the dataset; Sect. 4 gives the results and Sect. 5 concludes.",15

Halkos,Aksel Sundström,Nickolaos G. Tzeremes,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A burgeoning literature has in the last decades studied how the design of governance affects environmental outcomes, focusing on the role of constitutions, legal systems, degree of democratization and other institutional features of countries’ mode of governance. Besides the attention on the formal design of government institutions there has also been a wide concern among scholars and policymakers that quality of government—the extent to which the state is infested by corruption and partiality—has an impact on environmental outcomes since this affect the formulation and implementation of environmental policies (Damania et al. 2004; López and Mitra 2000; Kanie and Managi 2014). While the massive number of empirical studies on this topic certainly has not reached a consensus, the majority of this research largely contends that there are negative effects from corruption on different measures of environmental performance. Yet it has been shown that environmental problems, such as air emissions, or measures to meet these challenges, such as pollution abatement, seldom are uniform across countries, but in fact vary across regions within nations (Collins and Harris 2005). In line with this conviction, we have identified a gap in the body of research dealing with corruption and the environment, and argue that it is problematic that an absolute majority of these studies only use national-level variables as empirical measures of governance and environmental outcomes. Although exceptions exist, as some recent studies focus on one subnational unit or different units within a country (Macpherson et al. 2013; Golden and Min 2012; Halkos and Tzeremes 2013a), few studies have, to date, analyzed regional differences across countries in a comparative perspective. Barrett et al. (2006) argue that the debate on whether or not corruption has a negative impact on environmental performance has been limited by the focus on countries as the unit of analysis: “Researchers employing the conventional model [of corruption and environmental outcomes] have thus far focused on national-level political corruption, which is understandable. Data availability sharply limits analysts’ ability to study these phenomena at smaller scales. //… [Yet] given all the possible subnational variation in resource characteristics and quality of governance, a single measure of corruption at the national level seems highly unlikely to capture whatever true relationship(s) might exist between corruption and resource outcomes” (p. 1359). We pick up this point and focus in this article, in contrast to previous studies on corruption and the environment, on regions as this limits the risk of ecological fallacies when making inferences only based on national values. Seminal work has provided insights on the regional differences in economic growth within countries (Kaldor 1970). To account for the role of economic development, we focus in this study on environmental efficiency, broadly understood as the relationship between desirable economic output and undesirable ecological output (i.e., pollution) at the regional level. The aim of our article is more specifically to examine the effect of French, German, and the UK NUTS level 1 regions’ governance quality on their environmental efficiency levels. Recently Halkos and Tzeremes (2013a) introduced a variation of the model proposed by Färe and Grosskopf (2004) based on the probabilistic characterization of a directional distance function (Simar and Vanhems 2012) to the environmental efficiency case allowing a single exogenous factor and constant returns to scale. Similarly, we follow the latest developments as have been introduced by Daraio and Simar (2014) to measure the effect of government quality on regions’ environmental performance. More precisely, we apply nonparametric estimatorsFootnote 1 to examine the effect of regional quality of government on the environmental performance in 36 regions. We use the European Quality of Government Index (EQI), the most comprehensive existing measure on subnational governance. The index gauges the partiality, corruption and effectiveness of government services in each region. By utilizing regional-level measures of three pollutants (CO2, CH4 and N2O), we construct subnational environmental efficiency indicators and analyze the effect of governance on environmental performance. More analytically, we treat pollutants as joint outputs of the production process and we impose strong and weak disposability conditions on inputs and outputs.Footnote 2 The majority of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based studies (also called two-stage DEA studies) construct environmental performance indexes (or other performance indexes) in a first-stage analysis and then in a second-stage regression-type analysis examine the effect of several external/exogenous variables on the estimated efficiency measures. However, as has been demonstrated by Simar and Wilson (2007, 2011), this methodological approach imposes several assumptions regarding the data-generating process, which most of the cases is unrealistic and is not supported by the economic data. As a result, those studies assume that the separability condition between the input–output space and the space of the exogenous factors holds.Footnote 3 This study without assuming the separability condition applies conditional directional distance measures examining for the first time the effect of governance quality on regions’ environmental performance levels at a regional level. The article proceeds as follows: The following section reviews the theoretical arguments and empirical findings regarding the impact from governance on environmental outcomes. After describing our datasets in Sect. 3, we discuss the statistical methods employed in Sect. 4. We then present the empirical results in Sect. 5. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study and outlining a future research agenda.",29

Fossil fuel fueled economic growth during the industrial revolution, and it will remain a key energy source in the future (IEA 2013). However, rising greenhouse gas concentrations are likely the reason behind the increase in temperatures over the last 50 years (IPCC 2013), and almost all greenhouse gas emissions are CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Such an antinomic relationship produces anxiety in policy makers about how to ensure economic growth while combatting climate change. Therefore, it is essential that policy makers develop measures to attain economic growth while mitigating climate change. Several nations have attempted to implement a policy mix of decreasing fossil fuel consumption while increasing renewable energy. The European Union enforced one example of this policy mix in the legislation for its climate energy package. Promoting renewable energy can spur economic growth and provide mitigation, for example, offering financial support. Climate policies can increase economic output both directly and indirectly (Hallegatte et al. 2012). Considering the environment to be productive capital, an increase in environmental input through environmental policy leads to economic output. Previously, researchers have noted that correcting market failures resulting from policy indirectly increase economic output.Footnote 1
 By promoting renewable energy as a mitigation policy, furtherance is an effective mitigation policy, at least in the short run. This short-run success occurs because renewable energy technology is already available and is economically efficient compared to other zero emissions energy or technologies (see IPCC 2011). In addition, enforcing incentive-based policies contributes to the promotion of renewable energy as well as to the abatement of CO2 emissions. This policy includes a tax on fossil fuel and the auction of emissions allowances. This is a typical mitigation policy that involves a policy mix. This type of policy raises the revenue needed to support the usage of renewable energy. Previous studies have addressed economic growth in the context of environmental and resource economics. These studies are broadly classified into two categories: one category investigates an exhaustible energy resource stock where the stock decreases as fossil fuel is consumed (e.g., Hotelling 1931; Barrett 1992), and the other category captures the dynamics of a pollution stock where the stocks increase as pollutants are used (e.g., Gradus and Smulders 1993; Stokey 1998). In particular, Tahvonen and Kuuluvainen (1993) analyzed economic growth using stock pollution and renewable resources, the latter of which are described as a smooth substitution for emissions. Previous studies have largely failed to analyze climate policy by considering the relationship between economic growth and the implementation of a policy mix. This is because most studies have focused on one type of resource input even though it is crucial to describe the simultaneous use of nonrenewable and renewable energy. Our challenge in this paper is to examine how economic growth is attained under the simultaneous use of two energy inputs. The main purpose of our paper is to consider an optimal growth model with a stock of nonrenewable energy using a decentralized and competitive framework. In particular, we analyze the substitutable inputs of nonrenewable and renewable energy following Tahvonen and Salo (2001). This model contrasts with other economic growth-resource depletion models in which only one type of energy contributes to production over time, even after considering a backstop technology (see Dasgupta and Heal 1974). Our model intends to reflect recent trends in which nonrenewable energy consumption decreases with increasing renewable energy in a phased manner. Several papers study dynamic economic models focusing on policy instruments, which are closely related to our interest. de Miguel and Manzano (2006) modeled a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy to import oil and analyzed an oil tax without an exhaustible energy resource stock. The authors found that the distortions of oil prices caused by taxes do not lead to an optimal allocation. Belgodere (2009) considered the optimal climate policy in the presence of oil rents. He showed that a per-unit tax is the policy instrument that obtains the optimal allocation for the provisory decentralized economy model. Fischer and Springborn (2011) analyzed the short-term impact of taxes, emissions caps, and intensity targets on economic growth. There are only a few studies that assess a policy mix in the context of economic growth. Golosov et al. (2009) analyzed the neoclassical growth model, and Golosov et al. (2014) consequently applied a DSGE model. These works analyzed an externality of the climate change problem using fossil energy as an input to the production function. However, there is only a fossil fuel input for producing the final goods. Acemoglu et al. (2012) analyzed an endogenous and directed technical change in a growth model with environmental constraints, focusing on environmental policy and research subsidies. Chakravorty et al. (2006) showed that both the low-cost nonrenewable resource and the high-cost renewable resource were used jointly under the binding of the stock of emissions. They showed that supplementing the energy supply through clean renewable resources meets the environmental standard when energy demand declines in the long run. Moreover, energy demand returns to dirty fossil fuels in the future when the ceiling becomes non-binding. van der Ploeg and Withagen (2012) analyzed optimal climate policy in the presence of exhaustible oil, abundant coal, and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. They considered three regimes: only oil use, only coal use, and combining the use of oil and coal. They showed the regime switch of fossil fuel use; the oil-only phase is followed by an oil/coal phase in the social optimum until oil reserves are fully exhausted, at which point the economy switches to coal. Our paper is more closely related to van der Ploeg and Withagen (2010). They followed Golosov et al. (2014) and developed a Green Ramsey model with different regimes of energy use. Their framework for incubating different regimes is consistent with Tahvonen and Salo (2001). We consider the decentralized economy adhering fundamentally to Tahvonen and Salo (2001), but our paper differs from them in that externalities and policy are included in our model. Externalities come from a monopoly of renewable energy production and environmental damage. Many previous studies have analyzed the relationship between environmental policy and an incentive of R&D to reduce environmental pollution. Fischer et al. (2003) studied the effects of economic incentives to reduce emissions considering technological innovation. Moreover, a polluting firm that invests in environmental R&D affects its strategic position as well as slashes its emissions reduction costs (Montero 2002a, b). This suggests that there is an interaction between environmental policy and environmental R&D. In our model, renewable energy is the only technology that reduces environmental pollution by indirectly shifting from nonrenewable energy. Additionally, the energy monopoly is introduced as a character of the structure of actual market. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our analytical framework. Section 3 considers the optimal tax, which can be derived by comparing the decentralized economy problem with the social planter problem. Section 4 provides quantitative examples. Section 5 summarizes the results.",3

Australia’s emissions per unit of GDP are about twice the level of the OECD (IEA 2010) mainly due to low fossil fuel energy prices. Stationary energy in Australia is the largest source of CO2 at around half of total emissions (Treasury 2011), of which more than two-thirds come from electricity generation (i.e., electricity generation accounts for 35 % of all CO2 emissions in Australia). Thus, the climate change plan was introduced by the previous government as part of its clean energy future policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 5 % below 2000 levels by 2020, and to 80 % below 2000 levels by 2050.Footnote 1 The CPM was central to the plan; its aim was to incentivize Australia’s largest emitters to enhance energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy. Under the CPM, businesses emitting over 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) emissions annually were required to purchase emissions units from the government (Clean Energy Regulator 2013). The CPM became effective on the first of July 2012, with an introductory phase during which the price of uncapped permits was fixed (starting at $23 per tonne of CO2e and increasing to $25.40/tCO2e) with a planned transition to an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in July 2015.Footnote 2
 In the confines of the Australian wholesale electricity market, the intention behind imposing a price on carbon was to encourage producers to switch away from coal-fired generation and move to gas and renewable sources of energy through increasing the costs of fossil fuel combustion.Footnote 3 However, the coincidence of increases in power prices with the implementation of the CPM in Australia has raised the question as to whether electricity generators have already passed through the costs of carbon to wholesale electricity prices. Seeking an answer to this question could help to reveal the effectiveness of the CPM policy in encouraging the substitution of current methods of power generation with low carbon-intensive technologies. According to existing statistics, power prices within the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) increased significantly after July 2012 (the implementation of the CPM). For instance, the average annual wholesale electricity spot price increased from $29.77 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the 2012 financial year, to around $60/MWh in 2013.Footnote 4 For some states, the increases in prices have been very significant. For example, in Queensland, wholesale electricity spot prices increased from $29/MWh in 2012 to $67/MWh in 2013; in the same year, South Australian prices increased by 130 % to around $68/MWh. Therefore, the research question this paper asks is: to what extent can the increase in wholesale electricity spot prices be attributed to the pass-through of the costs of carbon on to consumers through higher prices [the so-called “carbon costs pass-through rate” (CPTR)]? In this paper, the concept of carbon pass-through refers to terminology in Sijm et al. (2006) and Chen et al. (2008); defined as the ratio of changes in the price of power to the changes in marginal costs due to the implementation of the CPM.Footnote 5 Similarly, Nelson et al. (2010b) and Wild et al. (2012) define the carbon pass-through as the proportion of carbon prices that are passed through to electricity prices. The hypothesis of this paper is that carbon costs are passed on fully to wholesale electricity spot prices within the NEM. The issue of interdependence between carbon and electricity prices is examined in several papers.Footnote 6 Although there appears to be sufficient evidence to conclude that carbon prices affect electricity futures prices, there is much less empirical support for the hypothesis that the carbon price has a significant impact on electricity spot prices. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to measure the actual impact of the CPM on electricity spot prices in Australia by statistically estimating the CPTRs using econometric evidence from the NEM during the period July 2010 to October 2013. In contrast to the very few existing studies in Australia that address a similar issue using simulation analysis,Footnote 7 the paper adopts an empirical approach and a “let the data speak for itself” modelling philosophy to statistically test its hypothesis. The empirical investigation employs a sequence of econometric tests including unit root tests and Granger causality tests to examine short-run links between carbon prices and electricity and energy prices. Regression analyses are also used to statistically estimate the carbon pass-through rates. To the best of my knowledge, this paper is a pioneer empirical study on carbon costs pass-through rates to wholesale electricity spot prices across the NEM. As such, this study undertakes one of the first evaluations of the CPM and fills a vital research gap around design issues in environmental markets in Australia. The findings could be crucial for policy-makers when assessing the CPM’s performance and its impacts on industry and households. Estimating the CPTRs determines the incidence of the carbon cost, while having the foresight to cost the incidence addresses the consequences of a carbon price on the key participants within the NEM in their attempts to curb the growth of carbon emissions. A higher rate of CPTR is indicative of consumers bearing a large proportion of the tax, while a lower rate shows that the tax incidence would be internally absorbed to a significant extent by generators, subsequently altering the marginal cost relativities, changing the competitive landscape and potentially further encouraging the use of carbon-efficient technologies.Footnote 8 By assessing the need, the scope and the role of industry assistance plans, including the partial or complete allocation of free permits, this paper will support policy-makers to make better-informed regulatory decisions when designing the Direct Action Plan and the Emissions Reduction Fund to combat climate change.Footnote 9
 The analysis indicates that the incidence of taxation would apparently be borne by consumers rather than generators. The extent of the estimated CPTRs for all states considered in this study reveal that the implementation of the CPM could lead to carbon-induced profit effects (so-called “windfall profits”)Footnote 10 for some generators.Footnote 11 These findings corroborate those of Wild et al. (2012) and Nelson et al. (2010b) who find by using simulation analysis that carbon prices impact wholesale electricity spot prices significantly. However, their findings also show relatively low levels of carbon pass-through. For instance, the results produced in Nelson et al. (2010b) revealed that the average carbon pass-through rate on wholesale electricity prices was around 0.95. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that an empirical method is employed in this paper to estimate the pass-through rates, while previous studies have applied simulation analysis. Another explanation is that this paper statistically estimates the pass-through rates for all five states within the NEM separately rather than estimating the average rate for Australia. Moreover, a proportion of this difference can be attributed to the use of a different dataset as well as different time periods. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of some of the rules that govern the electricity market in Australia. It also provides a brief review of the existing studies that address the carbon pass-through rates. Section 3 describes the dataset and provides a preliminary data analysis. Section 4 discusses the econometric model and the empirical findings. The last section concludes the paper.",17

In particular, the role of public policies and governance systems is under scrutiny so as to understand how to ensure the conditions for fostering economic development while protecting the environment (OECD 2010, 2011). In this context, environmental goals are increasingly intertwined with economic goals as the concept of sustainable development itself implies. The notion of sustainable development in fact looks simultaneously in different directions: development on the one side and environment on the other, something that can appear as inherently contradictory and irreconcilable (Kates et al. 2005). The introduction of more stringent environmental regulations has been in fact traditionally seen as potentially harmful for productivity and competitiveness of industries as it leads to higher costs faced by firms (Brock and Taylor 2005; Copeland and Taylor 2004). Only if environmental policies are capable of inducing firms to generate innovations in products and processes that positively affect the dynamic efficiency of the economy, environmental goals may become compatible with growth promotion and competitiveness (Porter and van der Linde 1995). Despite these potential contradictions, the ongoing economic and financial crisis has engendered increasing attention towards a broadly defined transition to the green economy as a powerful mechanism to escape from the current downturn, especially in the European Union context. This implies that not only environmental objectives should be achieved without harming economic competitiveness, productivity and economic growth, but also that the framework of policies designed to promote environmental sustainability should be able to sustain economic recovery and employment growth. To reach these objectives, a roadmap for the development and diffusion of environmental-friendly technologies combined with a coherent and effective governance framework for the achievement of both environmental and economic goals is widely acknowledged as necessary (European Commission 2011a, b; EEA 2013). In this respect, within an international policy framework that suffers from lack of coordination, the EU has led the way in setting targets—such as the Lisbon agenda and the 20–20–20 strategy on energy, CO2 and renewable energies. Moreover, the launch of Horizon 2020 is expected to provide new stimuli for the transition towards a resource efficient, low carbon and more competitive and inclusive economy (European Commission 2011a, b). Though such steps are important, the real outcome of this process is far from being clear for several reasons. First, the compliance with the Lisbon agenda has been poor and although the Kyoto targets have been achieved, this was mainly due to the ongoing crisis (Borghesi 2011), and it is not clear whether the 20–20–20 targets will be achieved when the economy eventually recovers from the recession. Second, the link between environmental policy and eco-innovation is still at the center of economic debate which showed that the drivers of innovations in environmental technologies are multifaceted and touch upon various spheres of society and policy-making (Horbach et al. 2012; Costantini and Crespi 2008, 2013). Only properly designed policies can spur eco-innovations when firms believe that innovation offsets are greater than regulatory costs (Costantini and Mazzanti 2012). Third, the interpretation of environmental and economic consequences due to the introduction and adoption of new environmental technologies is not unambiguous. With respect to the former issue, for instance, on the one hand new technologies can favor the reduction of carbon emissions and the usage of energy, on the other hand, gains in the efficiency of energy consumption will result in an effective reduction in the per unit price of energy services, leading to increasing consumption of energy services (i.e., “rebound” effect), partially offsetting the impact of the efficiency gain in fuel use (Greening et al. 2000). Regarding the economic effects, the actual dimension of the macroeconomic impact of eco-innovations is still unclear. In particular, the net employment effects of new environmental technologies and sustainable transition is currently under scrutiny as the outcome of a process of creative destruction in which both job creation and job destruction are jointly operating (Horbach et al. 2012). Finally, the impact of the recent economic crisis on the pace and geographical distribution of sustainable transition could have been relevant, though largely unexplored. The sharp decrease in economic activity levels may have lowered the incentives to accelerate green transition, as it contributed to lower oil prices and to reduce the dynamics of emissions (Borghesi 2011). On the other hand, the economic crisis has negatively affected innovative investments in certain geographical areas (e.g., in Europe), which may translate into a reduction of the pace of technological change, potentially delaying the emergence of a new green technological system (Archibugi et al. 2013). These considerations draw attention to the complexity of the issues at stake and to the need for developing a broad analytical and policy framework for governing the transition towards the green economy by achieving both environmental and economic goals. The aim of this paper is then to highlight such complexity and the importance of adopting a systemic perspective for the analysis of sustainable transition to better identify the challenges related to the transition governance and possibly identify useful tools to deal with this complexity. In so doing, building on the literature on complex systems dynamics (Anderson et al. 1988; Arthur et al. 1997; Lane et al. 2009; Antonelli and Ferraris 2011; Antonelli 2011; Harper and Lewis 2012), it will be argued that the green transformation of the economy can be conceived as the possible outcome of an emergent system property that takes place if and when there is an appropriate matching between the properties of the system and the characteristics and behaviors of individual agents. In this context, the organization of the system plays a key role as it shapes the process of transition, where the system conditions are the crucial and complementary pillars to drive the emergence of the green transformation of the economies. The elaboration on the complexity of transition processes allows us to understand the green transformation of the economies as a process shaped and explained by the interactions between the individual agents and the organization and structure of the economic system. In this framework, it is clear that systems can succeed or fail in achieving a sustainable transition because of their intrinsic characteristics including their structure and architectures. Hence, policy actions aimed at increasing the quality of transition systems can represent an effective way to support and assist the interactions between agents and spurring the sustainable transformation of the economies. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyses the theoretical and policy implications of shifting the focus of policy action from market to system failures. Section 3 offers some examples of policy interactions between the domains of environmental and energy policies, innovation and labor policies. Paragraph 4 elaborates on the notion of Green Transition Systems, while, Sect. 5, provides some summary conclusions.",13
18.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,25 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0127-0,Did the financial crisis affect environmental efficiency? evidence from the Japanese manufacturing sector,April 2016,Hidemichi Fujii,A. George Assaf,Roman Matousek,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The financial crisis has increased consumer fears and caused rapid decrease in market demand (Morita 2014). Many sectors including the manufacturing sector have experienced a decrease in total factor productivity due to the low facility operation rate by production adjustment (Fujii et al. 2011; Pratap and Urrutia 2012; Coulibaly et al. 2013). This has however allowed manufacturing firms to decrease their energy consumption (Bekhet and Yasmin 2014). The country of Japan, for instance, has successfully achieved Kyoto protocol agreement due to the reduction effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions triggered by the global financial and the collapse of Lehman BrothersFootnote 1 (Kuramochi (2015). Among all industries, the manufacturing industry has experienced the most significant gain in environmental efficiency due to the continuous effort by many developing countries to enforce a scrap-and-build policy for their heavy industrial sectors.Footnote 2
 At the firm level, manufacturing firms have also stopped running inefficient production lines, relying instead on high energy-efficient production lines to minimize production costs. The Toyota Motor Corporation (2013, p 25), for example, has recently indicated that “the Myochi plant in Japan has been consolidating its production process in order to adjust its production capacity. Both an older line and a new line had been in use for the casting process, which consumes a large amount of energy. By consolidating production into the new line, which possesses higher energy efficiency, the Myochi Plant was able to reduce usage of contracted power supply by 30 %, thus reducing CO2 emissions per unit produced by 10 %.” Hence, if manufacturing firms have an incentive to reduce energy improvement activities and eliminate inefficient production lines, the financial crisis may have triggered even further improvements in environmental efficiency. As no study to date has assessed the relationship between environmental efficiency and the financial crisis, we aim in this study to test this relationship. Specifically, using a sample of firms from the Japanese manufacturing industry, we test whether the crisis has led to any significant reduction in environmental inefficiency. We also differentiate between various industries as the available energy-saving activities during production adjustments are different among industries. Therefore, the characteristics of an industry must be considered when analyzing the determinants of environmental efficiency.

Friesenbichler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Limiting the man-made contribution to climate change by considerably reducing greenhouse gas emissions is regarded as one of mankind’s biggest challenges (Stern 2006; Meinshausen et al. 2009; IPCC 2014). The entire energy system needs restructuring and incremental technological change is insufficient to limit the global temperature rise (Antal and Hukkinen 2010). These scientific calls for ‘radical reform’ have been echoed by ambitious policy targets. For instance, the European Union (EU) provides a set of interdependent goals seeking to cut gas emissions by 40 % by 2030 and produce 27 % of its energy from renewable sources compared with 1990 levels. These targets are more ambitious than their predecessors of Europe 2020, although previous targets were binding. The 2020 targets, inter alia, considered a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % and a share of renewable energy of total energy consumption of 20 % by 2020.Footnote 1 The transition to a new technology base will not be as smooth as previous transitions. The shift from wood to coal and subsequently to gas and oil occurred in a quasi-frictionless manner (Moriarty and Honnery 2012). Over and above capital obsolescence and financial costs that the transition brings about (De Castro and Dutra 2011; Monopolkommission 2013), there are imbalances between (sometimes) conflicting policy objectives that hamper the change to a new capital stock. In particular, this concerns sector regulation that seeks to maintain security of supply and promotion of volatile renewable energy. Volatile renewable energy is defined as renewable energy that is not stored prior to electricity generation. This includes not only wind and solar PV energy technologies but also technologies like tidal power and run-of-river hydropower (Cochran et al. 2012). These facilities replace peak and emergency capacities due to their lower marginal costs on the wholesale market. Especially the deployment of cost-competitive wind power increasingly influences market outcomes and infrastructure requirements (Klessmann et al. 2008). This challenges the sector framework which is set by the policy objectives of the European Commission—sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply (European Commission 2006). These are typically pursued to an equal extent by uncoordinated policy fields with separate stakeholders and policy makers. Hence, stakeholders often have conflicting interests and also different negotiation powers (del Río González 2008). Especially in Germany, there is evidence that outage risks increase (Bundesnetzagentur 2011; Schleicher-Tappeser and Piria 2012). This reflects that policy making has not fully adapted to the new setting that the diffusion of renewable energy (RE) technologies brings about, which has been particularly rapid in recent times (Wilson et al. 2013). It is unclear how institutions and policies can be designed to provide an equilibrium between conflicting policy objectives (del Río González 2008). The guiding question of this paper is as following: why did some countries increasingly face outage risks while others remained largely devoid of such difficulties? We argue that there are inherent trade-offs in energy policy objectives that pose frictions to the establishment of a new technology base. Three policy fields will be analysed: (1) the development of generation capacities, (2) promotion policies for RE and (3) the electricity transmission grids. These jointly determine the systemic performance, i.e. the integration of RE in the electricity mix under the condition of maintaining the security of supply (del Río González 2008; Rykkja et al. 2014). The results indicate that enhanced policy coordination mechanisms may mitigate outage risks. In addition to its policy relevance, this study contributes to the literature in several ways. It provides rare cross-country evidence of the outcomes of different public policies and institutional architectures in the electricity sector. The case study approach allows studying a phenomenon where large samples are lacking (Rykkja et al. 2014). In addition, the analysis goes beyond a single-country analysis but uses experiences from three countries by providing an analysis of the attributes of policy fields, thereby adding a multilevel dimension (Foxon et al. 2013). The remainder of this article is divided as follows: first, some conceptual thoughts and the method are presented. Then, the stage is set by a sketch of the underlying difficulty to maintain security of supply which is also linked to trade-offs in policy objectives; third, the selection of the comparison countries is justified and fourth, the country-specific policies in the abovementioned fields are presented. The paper closes with a discussion of the results and concluding remarks.",3

Institutions and policies are considered means for influencing these interactive dynamics, such as shifting innovative focus from traditional to environmentally oriented production, more environmentally friendly types of energy use, or environmental protection measures, products or services (Bergh 2007; Chaminade and Edquist 2010; Freeman 1992; Kemp 1997; Sandberg 1999). Institutions and policies can, thus, be considered drivers or incentive structures of change in technologies, processes, markets, raw materials or organizational forms—the five classic types of innovation according to Schumpeter (Schumpeter 1947). Given such a definition of institutions and their function as drivers (“sticks”) or incentive structures of change (“carrots”) in technologies among organizations, one would expect to find institutional changes behind most, or at least many, of the technological changes that reduce environmentally unfriendly effects if these changes do not also imply economic advantages. One would also think that public and private organizations might be affected somewhat differently by institutions. Institutions created and modified within the framework of the political and economic system are typically formulated in a way that distinguishes between public and private ownership and therefore also how public organizations are managed versus how private corporations are handled. This is particularly true for mixed market-oriented welfare states with strong political and governmental structure and public organizations managed at national, regional and local levels, such as Sweden (Carlsson et al. 2010; Cooke 2012). Political history has shaped the industrial structure of any innovation system, and in Sweden’s case, the industrial and organizational structures have emerged mostly during Social Democratic governments (1932–1976, 1982–1991, 1994–2006, and 2014–). However, Sweden experienced a shift in government to an “Alliance” of rightist parties (2006–2014), which is noteworthy in relation to industrial, environmental and innovation policies in which central and governmental influences were rolled back in favor of more entrepreneurial and liberal principles. The “Alliance” gave the impression that their policy of reducing fossil fuel use and replacing it by non-fossil energy was environmentally friendly and an example of “green innovation” in line with the recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Energimyndigheten 2013; IPCC 2007a). One empirical question is of course whether it was true that there was a shift and if so, whether the shift was of environmental and technological significance. The question of climate effects of increased non-fossil energy use in different forms is, therefore, not the topic here.Footnote 1 Instead we focus on the actual energy source innovations made in Swedish organizations, the question whether the increasing use of non-fossil fuel actually reduces the levels of CO2 emissions, and what factors can explain this shift from a time dynamic and evolutionary perspective. We think the answers to this question, presented in this article, should be of wider interest especially for OECD nations that take pride in green innovation and shifts toward sustainable technologies. It should also be of interest for environmental technology policy makers of other nations. However, not only are facts and figures are important. In this context, it is also important to use adequate statistical techniques that can reveal why certain technologies are replaced by others over time, as they are measured in time series data sets. We propose here, in a spirit of evolutionary analysis of technological change (Aldrich 2003; Carroll and Hannan 2000; Colombelli et al. 2013; Dosi 1981; Hirschleifer 1977; Mokyr 1991; Sandberg 1999, 2006; Silverberg 1988), in which some technologies “die” and others “are born” among organizational “hosts”, to apply a statistical survival analysis. Survival analysis, we will argue, has several advantages in cases where there is time series panel data, i.e., data for many units of analysis over time, and the dependent variable is a binary indicator of categorical change in the time series. This is why we address the analysis of the shift from fossil to non-fossil use of energy in Swedish organizations as technological change, where we look for explanations in terms of changed institutions and policies and their resulting eco-innovations (Arundel and Kemp 2009; Halila and Rundquist 2011; Hörte and Halila 2008). This paper therefore looks closer into climate gas emission and the shift to non-fossil energy in Sweden and, therefore, asking the questions: what types of organizations are behind the shift to non-fossil energy use, what are the relative effects on emissions, to what extent can these interactive dynamics be considered eco-innovations, do these effects vary between public and private organizations, and if so, can they be related to specific institutions and policies?",4

Although firms engage in production to achieve their key objective of economic development, the production processes of manufacturing companies generate a significant amount of environmental pollution (Fujii and Managi 2012). In the production process, a firm can realize economic benefits by recycling and saving intermediate materials. However, these savings are usually smaller than the costs of pollution abatement (Jasch 2006). Additionally, consumer preferences are still not significantly related to the environmental burden created through the production process but instead primarily concern product performance (Hibiki and Managi 2010). Therefore, an environmentally friendly corporate image has a weak influence on the market competitiveness of products, and improving environmental performance does not always generate higher profits. Based on these situations, a clear explanation about the merits and demerits of CEM, as observed through empirical studies, is needed to provide an incentive for private firms and thereby encourage their CEM activities. If we can explain why and how firms can obtain market competitiveness and profit through CEM, a firm may be willing to promote CEM activities as long as they can receive such benefits. In this sense, an objective analysis using real firm data will play an important role in encouraging CEM. Figure 1 shows the trend in the academic literature addressing CEM. From the figure, the number of publications has increased yearly, especially since 2004. Journal publications including “chemical” have been observed since the 1980s, whereas journal publications including “greenhouse gases” are primarily seen since the late 2000s. These results can be understood as environmental policy, information technology development, and available databases. Trend of academic literature on corporate environmental management.

Note (2) Year 2015 data covers January 2015 to August 2015. The other years cover from January to December First, environmental policy on chemical substances was enforced in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, Japan, and many other countries (Fujii et al. 2011). Because several toxic chemical present a high toxic risk for human health and ecosystems, governments have tried to control this risk through environmental policy. Additionally, an open database of toxic chemical substances was built in 1986 in the US, called the toxic release inventory (TRI), and they started to provide toxic chemical release data through the original homepage in 1999. Using this page, researchers can consult a huge amount of data over the internet. Today, many countries provide such information on chemical substances online.Footnote 1
 Second, greenhouse gas emissions policies started to be enforced mainly in developed countries in the 1990s and 2000s. Additionally, a corporate GHG emissions database was opened in Japan through the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Reporting System (covering 2006 onwards) and in the United States via the TRI (covering 2010 onwards). The Carbon Disclosure Project was started in 2000 (https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx) and is another open data source of corporate GHG emissions. These open data, which were published in the 2000s, came later than that for chemicals. To compare these search results, the availability of quantitative data is an important factor to encourage empirical studies on CEM. Further, corporate data published by non-English language are difficult to use for foreign researchers who cannot read the given language. Another point is that corporate data are generally sold by private companies at high costs. Therefore, we believe that a free corporate financial and environmental database in English would allow to use corporate data and undertake empirical studies on CEM by researchers who do not have a sufficient research budget to buy such a database. The objective of this study is to create the world resource table (WRT), an open Japanese corporate financial and environmental database published by the Japanese government. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We next review the literature on CEM and compare existing databases. Section 3 describes the database constructing approach, and Sect. 4 concludes.",5

Today, the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences. Synergistic effects of habitat destruction, overfishing, introduced species, warming, acidification, toxins, and massive runoff of nutrients are transforming once complex ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests into monotonous level bottoms, transforming clear and productive coastal seas into anoxic dead zones, and transforming complex food webs topped by big animals into simplified, microbially dominated ecosystems with boom and bust cycles of toxic dinoflagellate blooms, jellyfish, and disease. Rates of change are increasingly fast and nonlinear with sudden phase shifts to novel alternative community states. We can only guess at the kinds of organisms that will benefit from this mayhem that is radically altering the selective seascape far beyond the consequences of fishing or warming alone. The prospects are especially bleak for animals and plants compared with metabolically flexible microbes and algae. Halting and ultimately reversing these trends will require rapid and fundamental changes in fisheries, agricultural practice, and the emissions of greenhouse gases on a global scale” (Jackson 2008). The concern that marine biologists express over trends in the world’s oceans, captured in this quotation from one of the most influential papers of the last decade, is different from the concerns expressed over trends in terrestrial systems. Environmental stresses in terrestrial systems are largely seen as a consequence of habitat conversion and the growth of industrial and agricultural emissions to land, air and water. In marine systems, environmental stresses are most closely linked to the growth of wild capture fisheries. The pollution of marine systems is an issue, but is linked more to the expansion of land-based activities in coastal zones, than to the growth of marine activities—fisheries, marine transport, offshore mining and oil extraction, or aquaculture. For example, one of the main ocean pollutants is reactive nitrogen. Nitrogen deposition in the oceans increased by something like 80 % between the middle of the nineteenth century and the end of the twentieth century (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). This was largely due to the development of the Haber–Bosch process for manufacturing nitrogen fertilizers in the early twentieth century, and the subsequent expansion of agriculture (Galloway and Cowling 2002; Galloway et al. 2004). Nitrogen runoff leads to coastal eutrophication, algal blooms, and oxygen depletion. In extreme cases, it leads to the development of ‘dead zones’—areas so depleted of oxygen that they cannot support any marine life (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008; Perrings et al. 2014). The different environmental stresses in marine and terrestrial systems partly reflect differences in the biophysical characteristics of the two systems. However, they also reflect differences in the institutional conditions under which each system is exploited. Unlike terrestrial systems, access to all ocean resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction is almost entirely unregulated. Moreover, where access is regulated in territorial waters and the exclusive economic zones, regulation is often ineffective. The consequences of this include overfishing; destruction of mangroves, coral reefs and other coastal marine habitats; the incidental introduction of harmful alien species; the congestion of key sea transport routes and both occasional and routine pollution beyond the assimilative capacity of the resource. To understand the use and abuse of the oceans we need to understand both the overharvesting of fish stocks in more and less regulated waters, and the discharge of land-based pollutants into marine environments. More particularly, we need to understand the decisions that people make when harvesting marine resources or discharging waste to the sea, and the decisions that they would make if they took all the consequences of their actions into account. Where there is a gap between the two—where there are ‘externalities’ of private extraction or emission—we need to understand the factors that cause people to behave in ways that impose social costs. Costs may be localized and of short duration, as is the case with some oil spills, or widespread and long lasting, as is the case with the collapse of major fisheries through overharvesting (North Sea) or pollution (Black Sea). We need to understand when and where private activities impose social costs, and what can be done to reduce these. This paper considers the economics of extraction and pollution externalities in marine systems. The stylized facts it seeks to explain are that around 70 % of fish stocks are being exploited at or beyond maximum sustainable yield, while many coastal systems—including the mangrove forests and coral reefs that serve as fish nurseries—have been severely depleted through coastal habitat conversion and land-based emissions (Jackson et al. 2001; Hughes et al. 2003; Worm et al. 2006, 2007; Jackson 2008). Moreover, many ocean resources are effectively open access, markets fail to signal the true scarcity of many marine resources, and governments fail either to protect against or to correct for the inability of markets to allocate resources efficiently (Berkes et al. 2005; Worm et al. 2006; Costello et al. 2008). The paper first describes the way that economists approach the optimal extraction of marine resources and the optimal discharge of wastes. It then considers the effect of institutional conditions on the decisions made by private resource users, and hence on extraction and waste discharge rates. This is followed by an evaluation of existing institutions in terms of their impact on marine environmental externalities. In the oceans, as on land, people are interested in the services that ecosystems yield. This includes the provision of foods (and fuels) from the exploitation of marine mammals, marine plants, benthic, demersal and pelagic fish among other organisms. It includes marine transport and recreation, the esthetic value of seascapes and the scientific value of marine ecosystems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). It also includes the value of the oceans in regulating fundamental climatic and hydrological processes. The regulation of climate through marine biogeochemical pathways, for example, is roughly the same as regulation from terrestrial systems. Approximately 92.2 GtC of atmospheric carbon enters the ocean annually while 90.6 GtC exits the ocean to the atmosphere (Denman et al. 2007). Marine phytoplankton play an essential role in the production of oxygen (Behrenfeld et al. 2006), while microorganisms are critical to the recycling land-based wastes discharged into the oceans (Perrings et al. 2011). Some of these services are public goods, while others are private. This affects the degree to which individual agents are able to capture the benefits of their supply. Marine environmental public goods, like terrestrial environmental public goods, tend to be undersupplied. We will consider where and when this compromises human well-being.",5

Halkos,George J. Papageorgiou,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Analyzing pollution control issues for developed and developing countries has become an important multi–disciplinary topic. Since the design of efficient action against pollution has to take into consideration the intertemporal response of victims, dynamic modeling can be used as an appropriate tool. In this paper we make two basic assumptions. The first is that the environment provides two different kinds of services. i.e., the environment may serve as an input to the production of conventional goods and second, the environment itself provides amenities. In the second assumption the damage function is depending on the intensity of emissions and on the intensity of abatement as well. We use both optimal control and differential game approaches to study the intertemporal strategic interactions between the polluters and the social planer or the group of environmental enjoyers. The pollutants accumulation is a major problem in our world and finding a way to effectively reduce, while maintaining the standards of the production process, is a great challenge facing capitalistic societies. The clean environment is obviously a public good. Conversely, all the “dirty” production process that creates pollutants accumulation, e.g. emissions caused by uncontrolled production, constitutes a public bad. But which of the factors of production process generates pollutants? Clearly uncontrolled, with respect to the environment, production involves antiquated equipment that emits more than permissible and therefore constitutes a polluters’ “bad weapon”. It is a usual phenomenon the old production equipment—which used to be the main production equipment for the Western developed countries—to change hands moving to the Southern or Eastern developing countries at a low acquisition cost. Similarly, all the extracted depletable resources which are used as inputs in the production are sources of pollution. The power of such a “dirty” production process rests upon the accumulation of a stock of resources, consequently depending on the financial capital for these resources that emits more and therefore accumulates pollutants. On the other hand, in early days of applications of dynamic systems to economic problems, it was recognized that the optimal solution of infinite time problems may be characterized by multiple equilibrium points. Finding multiple equilibrium points in economic models is not an attractive solution for the policy makers. But the recognition of multiple optimal stable equilibria may be crucial in order to locate the thresholds separating the basins of attraction surrounding these different equilibria. Starting at a threshold, a rational economic agent is indifferent between moving toward one or the other equilibrium, but a small movement away from the threshold can “destroy” this indifference, leading in a unique optimal course of action. Since the introductory one sector, with a convex—concave production function, optimal growth model of Skiba (1978), there has been a lot of progress towards the cyclical solution strategies generated in intertemporal dynamic economic models. Wirl (1995) exploring the optimality of cyclical exploitation of renewable resources stocks, reconsidering a model of Clark et al. (1979), concludes that equilibrium that falls below the maximum sustainable yield but that exceeds the intertemporal harvest rule due to the positive spillovers allows for optimal, long run, cyclical harvest strategies. Limit cycles, according to Poincare–Bendixson condition (Hartman 1982) which also restricted in planar systems, has the intuitive explanation which says that if a trajectory of a continuous dynamical system stays in a bounded region forever, it has to approach “something”. This “something” is either a point or a cycle. So if it is not a point, then it must be a cycle. This gives rise to cyclical policies in economic models, e.g. if a policy trajectory, say an abatement pollution policy, is restricted in a bounded planar space then this policy sooner or later will retrace its previous steps. The Poincare–Andronov–Hopf theorem (Kuznetsov 2004), which applies in a higher than the two dimensional systems, gives sufficient conditions for the existence of limit cycles of nonlinear dynamical systems. Informally, one can think of this theorem as requiring that equilibrium must suddenly change from a sink to a source with variation of a parameter. Arithmetically this requires that a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues exists for a particular value of the bifurcation parameter and that the real part of this pair of eigenvalues changes smoothly its sign as the parameter is altered from below its actual value to above. Hence, analogously to equilibrium, the stability of limit cycles is of great importance for the long run behavior of a dynamical system. But since the existence and therefore stability of a limit cycle is highly dependent on an arbitrarily chosen bifurcation parameter we have to deal with the qualitative analysis of such a problem. Economic mechanisms that may be a source of limit cycles, as mentioned by Dockner and Feichtinger (1991) are: (1) complementarity over time, (2) dominated cross effects with respect to capital stocks, and (3) positive growth of equilibrium. The main contribution of the paper is twofold: First, it considers the environment as a renewable resource for which the environmental quality grows with the pollutants abatement but reduces with the damages stemming from pollutants accumulation which in turn are treated as a stock. Having the two states, i.e. the environmental quality as a stock and the stock of pollutants the benevolent social planer has to steer the control variable, i.e. the emissions, in an optimal way between the two states, and this setting gives rise for complex polices especially for limit cycles. Second, it considers the pollution problem, as a differential game in which two players involved. The first player is the polluting representative producer which maximizes his own utility stemming from emissions while the second player is every enjoyer of the environmental services, maximizing his own utility derived from the clean environment and from the pollutants abatement as well. In both cases, we explore the Nash equilibrium and especially in the first case we investigate the existence of limit cycles and consequently the existence of cyclical strategies of the instrument variables. The environmental pollution control game takes place between the government, acting as the social planer, and polluters for which the resources used in production accumulate pollutants. Such pollutants accumulation and regulation control models can be found, among others, in Forster (1980) concerning optimal energy use model; in Xepapadeas (1992) regarding environmental policy design and non-point source pollution; in Mäler et al. (2007) in the shallow lake game; in Wirl (1995) and so on. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the social planer’s optimal control model and gives a necessary condition for cyclical strategies. Section 3 investigates the stability of the management model according to the Dockner’s formula (1985). Section 4 explores the limit cycle equilibrium of the management model, while Sect. 5 introduces and solves analytically the proposed differential game. The last section concludes the paper.",1

Stern,Donglan Zha,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There has been much recent concern about hazardous levels of particulate pollution in some Chinese cities (e.g., Wong 2015), which the Chinese government has been attempting to reduce (Victor et al. 2015). In this paper, we examine the role of income, convergence, and time related factors in explaining recent changes in PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate pollution in 50 Chinese cities. We use a recently developed model that relates the rate of change of pollution to the growth of the economy and other factors, as well as the traditional environmental Kuznets curve model. We also use new measures of ambient air quality that the Chinese government has published only since the beginning of 2013. Particulate pollution fell sharply from 2013 to 2014. We show that economic growth, convergence, and time effects all served to lower the level of pollution. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) has been the dominant approach among economists to modeling ambient pollution concentrations and aggregate emissions since Grossman and Krueger (1991) introduced it a quarter of a century ago. The EKC is characterized by an income turning point—the level of GDP per capita after which economic growth reduces rather than increases environmental impacts. Though the EKC was originally developed to model the ambient concentrations of pollutants, most subsequent applications have focused on pollution emissions and, in particular, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide (Carson 2010). Recent studies using global data sets find that, in fact, income has a monotonic positive effect on the emissions of both these pollutants (Wagner 2008; Vollebergh et al. 2009; Stern 2010; Anjum et al. 2014). Both Selden and Song (1994) and Stern et al. (1996) already noted that ambient concentrations of pollutants were likely to fall before emissions did. Stern (2004) suggests that this may be due to both the decline in urban population densities and the decentralization of industry that tend to accompany economic growth. Furthermore, actions through which governments can try to reduce local air pollution include moving industry outside of populated areas and building taller smokestacks. The latter reduced urban air pollution in developed countries in the twentieth century at the expense of increasing acid rain in neighboring countries and the formation of sulfate aerosols (Wigley and Raper 1992). Additionally, pollutants with severe and obvious human health impacts such as particulates are more likely to be controlled earlier than pollutants with less obvious impacts such as carbon dioxide (Shafik 1994). Despite this, relatively little recent research has attempted to apply the EKC to concentrations rather than emissions. More recently, it has become popular to model the evolution of emissions using convergence approaches. Pettersson et al. (2013) provide a review of the literature on convergence of carbon emissions. There are three main approaches to testing for convergence: sigma convergence, which tests whether the dispersion of the variable in question declines over time using either just its variance or its full distribution (e.g., Ezcurra 2007); stochastic convergence, which tests whether the time series for different countries cointegrate; and beta-convergence, which tests whether the growth rate of a variable is negatively correlated with its initial level. We are not aware of attempts to test for convergence in pollution concentrations rather than emissions. Yet, it seems reasonable that high concentrations of pollution would encourage defensive action to reduce that pollution (Ordás Criado et al. 2011). Anjum et al. (2014) propose a model that nests both the EKC and beta-convergence models. It can be seen as an extension of Ordás Criado et al.’s (2011) model to also include the EKC effect. The model allows us to test the contributions of economic growth, convergence, and time effects to the evolution of pollution. In this paper, we apply this model to recent data on concentrations of particulate pollution in Chinese cities. We also estimate the traditional EKC model. The results show that there is a very close relationship between the two approaches in the two period panels we have here. The Sect. 2 of the paper reviews previous research on modeling particulate pollution concentrations, with particular reference to China. The Sect. 3 presents our modeling approach and the Sect. 5 presents our results. The Sect. 6 presents our conclusions.",29

The literature considering this relationship is vast. It covers the theory on growth and natural resources extraction and depletion, explores the impacts of endogenous growth theory and investigates the link between environmental pollution and income. Akao (2014) defines a sustainable development path as a balanced growth path with environmental conservation in the lines of endogenous growth theory. The advancement of economic growth theory started with the Solow–Swan model (Solow 1956; Swan 1956) with exogenous technological progress and growth being considered either with exogenous saving rates as in the Solow–Swan model or with households’ consumption and savings optimization models called optimal growth or Ramsey models (Ramsey 1928; Cass 1965; Koopmans 1965). These models were followed by endogenous growth models where the “engine of growth” is either technological progress (Romer 1990) or human capital accumulation (Lucas 1988). Natural resources contribute significantly to production. In the basic form of the neoclassical growth theory the contribution of natural resources in production is completely missing. In 1972, the perception of the Solow–Swan model (with three inputs, namely labor, capital and production methods) was confronted by the report of the Club of Rome “the limits to growth” (Meadows et al. 1972). In the report it was predicted that the exhaustion of non-renewable resources will result to the fall down of the global economy and the worldwide collapse of the standards of living. Specifically, the report notified humanity for the damaging influence of uninterrupted and rapid economic growth. More pollution and inappropriate use of non-renewable resources may stop economic growth. The economic growth versus the environment dispute considered the relationship between growth and quality of the environment arguing whether a change in growth is essential in improving environmental quality. There are various theories of the relationship between economy and environment. The limits theory classifies this relationship in terms of the irreversible damage imposed on the environment hitting a threshold ahead of which production is so defectively influenced that the economy shrinks. The new toxics view is based on the idea that pollutants’ emissions are reduced with additional economic growth but the new pollutants replacing them are raised. In this way, the validity of the calculated turning points is questioned and there is possibility that environmental damage persists to be enhanced as economies develop (Everett et al. 2010). According to the race to bottom theory, international competition first increases environmental damage up to the point where developed countries begin to decrease their environmental effect but at the same time export activities polluting the environment to poorer countries. In this way, we may end up in a non-improving situation. Finally, the Porter’s hypothesis considers economic growth and the environment as a false dichotomy. It finds that effective environmental policies may raise the level of R&D into more resource efficient processes, leading to higher competitiveness and profitability (Everett et al. 2010). Empirical findings of the relationship between economic growth and the environment and the investigation of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis are based on model specifications. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis suggests the existence of an inverted U-shape relationship between environmental damage and per capita income. Specifically, it relates environment (using environmental pollution or damage as dependent variable) with economic development represented by economic variables (like GDP/c in level, square and cubic values as independent variables). Depending on data availability different variables have been used to approximate environmental damage like air pollutants (SOX, NOX, CO2, PM10, etc.), water pollutants (e.g., toxic chemicals discharged in water, etc.) and other indicators like deforestation, municipal waste, energy use and access to safe drinking water. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 presents the dynamic models of modern macroeconomic theory together with the proposed theoretical inclusion of the environment into the neoclassical growth theory.Footnote 1 Section 4 presents data and econometric methods used in the proposed application and the related empirical findings. The final section concludes the paper.",4

The pessimistic view is that continued growth is incompatible with environmental sustainability since the growth process requires the use of the environment both as a source of energy and raw materials and, as a sink for its wastes (solid, gas and liquid) all of which harm the environment. According to this school of thought, the sure way to environmental sustainability is to halt growth. However, the optimistic school of thought is of the view that continued economic growth need not be incompatible with environmental sustainability in a world of continuous technological change. This view emphasizes the importance of using green technologies and other alternative ways of production and consumption that do not compromise economic growth both in the medium to long term. Thus, a concerted global effort that takes into account cost-effective instruments of mitigating the effects of rising global temperatures would in the end promote, and not harm economic growth. The empirical evidence on this debate is of much relevance to growth and environmental policies in the developing world, more so in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) where income levels are below acceptable standards. Ensuring sustained long-run growth and environmental sustainability requires prior establishment of the nexus between economic growth and the environment. Recent attention has shifted to the pair-wise nexuses between climate change and economic growth, economic growth and emissions, and emissions and climate change. However, a huge gap remains, particularly, on the empirical nexus between economic growth and climate change. This paper looks at the effect of climate change on sustainable growth for a panel of SSA countries using panel cointegration modelling techniques. We explore and analyse the effects of climate change on economic growth. Although global warming is a problem that all countries have to contend with, the costs and benefits of rising global temperatures tend to vary across countries and regions. Most studies indicate that poor countries, particularly those in SSA would bear the brunt of climate change (see Lanzafame 2012). The overwhelming reliance on agriculture and other climate-sensitive sectors for production as well as the limited capacity to respond appropriately to climate-related shocks tends to expose the African continent to the vagaries of extreme weather conditions (Stern 2006). See for instance Jiang and Koo (2014), Tanaka et al. (2011) and Kumar and Managi (2014) for more elaborate discussions and evidence on climate change impact on agriculture and the role of adaptation. Thus, by focusing exclusively on SSA, we are able to obviate some of the nuances that are left undetected in the global debate, and contribute to the search for appropriate policy responses at the national and international levels. In this paper, we estimate the effect of climate change on long-run economic growth for a selected sample of SSA countries using panel cointegration. Our estimation results reveal an unanticipated long-run relationship between temperature and economic growth. This is true about precipitation in the long run. However, in the short run, we establish that temperature has a more pernicious effect on economic growth. Specifically, a percentage increase in temperature significantly reduces economic performance in SSA by approximately 0.13 %, ceteris paribus. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between real GDP per capita on one hand and the climate variables on the other hand is intrinsically nonlinear. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we survey the literature, examining particularly the effect of climate on growth. We establish several empirical relationships between climate and economic production and other indicators of environmental quality and sustainable growth. Section 3 provides the information on data sources, model specification and estimation strategy. Section 4 of the paper presents the results of the panel cointegration analysis. Section 5 concludes.",46

The basic EKC model regresses some measure of pollution, P, on income Y and its squared term, Y

EKC studies have focused on various types of pollution including air (Tsurumi and Managi 2010; van den Bergh and van Veen-Groot 2001), water (Farzin and Grogan 2013; Thompson 2013) and deforestation (Bhattarai and Hammig 2001). As variables other than income may affect pollution levels, recent EKC studies have included political institutions (Bhattarai and Hammig 2001), civil liberties (Lin and Liscow 2009), and population density (Panayotou 1997) as explanatory variables. A cubic term for income has been included as an explanatory variable in several papers (Barua and Hubacek 2009; Paudel et al. 2005). The present study focuses on water pollution and downstream dependence. In other words, this paper aims to find whether or not an EKC exists between water pollution in the downstream country and economic growth in the upstream country.",1
18.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,30 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0118-1,Is it more profitable to acquire cleaner or dirtier firms?,October 2016,Mahelet G. Fikru,Matt Insall,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"When polluting firms acquire firms in the same industry, do they seek out greener firms in order to make use of their cleaner technology, especially under threat of penalty for pollution? How does penalty for pollution affect the incentive for acquisition? The result of this study indicates that firms who are penalized for their pollution do not necessarily seek out greener firms to acquire. Our result suggests that it is more profitable for polluting firms to takeover dirtier firms and shut them down. Our result also indicates that, at lower levels of emission tax, the incentive for acquiring a dirtier firm increases with an increase in tax but the opposite is true for higher levels of emission tax. Results from our model suggest that post-acquisition production takes place in relatively cleaner plants. Furthermore, generally polluting firms have more incentive to acquire and shut-down plants relatively dirtier than themselves than acquire and use relatively cleaner firms. Acquisitions or takeovers occur when a company (acquirer) takes a controlling ownership of another firm (target) by purchasing its asset and stocks. In the legal sense, the target disappears and the acquirer continues to exist possibly under a new name where no new entity is created (Depamphilis 2008). Most takeovers are friendly in the sense that they are solicited or accepted by the target in return for some payment. Often times friendly takeovers are referred to as mergers; and sometimes the two terms, mergers and acquisitions, are used interchangeably to represent a takeover deal. The theoretical literature on mergers and acquisitions has established that inefficient plants seek out efficient plants to use their efficient technology (Farrell and Shapiro 1990; Fauli-Oller 2002). Most studies adopt a Cournot competition model where acquisition results in an exogenous decline in the number of firms. Salant et al. (1983) showed that acquisition of one firm by another that is identical in all industry specific respects will not be profitable unless it results in a monopoly. The implication is that some sort of heterogeneity among firms is required for profitable acquisitions. One important and frequently studied source of heterogeneity is with respect to marginal cost of production. In this study, we introduce heterogeneity among firms in terms of their pollution intensity. Profitability of acquisitions when firms have different marginal cost of production was first examined by Farrell and Shapiro (1990) and later adopted by Barros (1998), Long and Vousden (1995), Collie (2003), Qiu and Zhou (2007) and others in different scenarios. These studies find that as long as firms have different marginal cost, acquisitions can be profitable due to rationalization of production: that is, shifting production from the high-cost plant to the low-cost plant. Cost saving in terms of shifting production to a more efficient plant could be an important motive for acquisitions (Farrell and Shapiro 1990; Fauli-Oller 2002; Levin 1990). Furthermore, synergies may be possible if the cost of the post-acquisition firm is much lower than the sum of the costs of the constituent firms (Qiu and Zhou 2006; Perry and Porter 1985; McAfee and Williams 1992; Horn and Persson 2001). In addition, if huge fixed costs are present, acquisition will allow the elimination of redundant fixed inputs and hence lead to cost savings. Besides the incentive related to cost saving, efficiency and synergy, acquisitions could be triggered by an external shock such as deregulation, foreign competition, uncertainty, information asymmetry or technological change (Qiu and Zhou 2007; Fridolfsson and Stennek 2005a, b; Banal-Estanol 2007; Das and Sengupta 2001). These studies and others have explained some of the great acquisitions that occurred in previous years. However, none of them have specifically considered pollution and resulting penalties in their models (except Fikru 2013 and Fikru and Lahiri’s 2013 study upon which we expand this current paper). Fikru (2013) examines welfare implications when polluting firms merge and Fikru and Lahiri (2013) examine acquisition decision among identical polluting firms. Our paper is significantly different from Fikru and Lahiri (2013) and Fikru (2013) in that we consider a market where firms are heterogeneous and the penalty for pollution is an exogenous variable respectively. Exogenous policy, such as a given amount of penalty for pollution, implies that the government penalizes producers irrespective of the market structure and irrespective of their decision to acquire other plants or sell their own. We consider firms identical in all respects except their pollution intensity. We examine whether firms penalized for their pollution seek out greener or dirtier firms as potential acquisition targets. With the recent pressure on companies to adopt greener technologies the study of how pollution parameters and pollution related penalties affect the incentive to acquire have important policy implications. According to Gillston and Meyer (2013) takeover deals ought to consider environmental liabilities such as contamination and pollution from toxic chemicals. Similarly, Gehsmann and McCeney (2009) argue that firms planning to make a merger deal should assess the effect of environmental policy on those businesses they wish to acquire. In Sect. 2 we present the theoretical model and derive first order profit maximization conditions for firms in the pre-acquisition market. In Sect. 3 we model the acquisition decision and present four possible alternatives for the potential acquirer. By comparing the four alternatives, we determine whether it is more profitable to acquire a cleaner firm or a dirtier firm. Using the most profitable case we study the relationship between emission tax and the incentive to acquire in Sect. 4. Finally Sect. 5 concludes by proffering some policy implications and questions for future work.",3
18.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,11 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0119-0,Inequality in emissions: evidence from Indonesian household,October 2016,Mohammad Iqbal Irfany,Stephan Klasen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Human activity has been found to be the leading contributor to the rise in global emissions, particularly since the industrial revolution (IPCC 2013). At the same time, the relationship between economic development and environmental degradation is described by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, which proposes that in the early stage of development environmental degradation surges until reaching its peak; then a further increase in economic affluence would lead to a decline in environmental degradation. For that reason, the investigations of the driving forces as well as the evolution of CO2 emission levels are important and thus have been becoming of great interest to both research and policy. However, different levels and patterns of development in countries or groups of economic actors lead to a disparity in associated environmental degradation. Of particular relevance is the fact that the inequality in emissions across countries (or regions) is enormous. For instance, the World Bank (2013) reports that in the 1980s developing countries in East Asia emitted only 1.27 tons of CO2 per capita compared to the European countries that emitted about 5.75 tons/capita. In 2009 however there was a huge change in the emission disparity as the CO2 emission per capita in East Asia jumped to 4.59 tons while Europe increased to just around 7.22 tons of CO2 emissions. More importantly, many studies, such as Heil and Wodon (1997) and Clarke-Sather et al. (2011), proclaim that the inequality in emissions between developed and developing countries has been one of the huge challenges hampering the process of forging international agreements towards reducing green house gas (GHG) emissions. One particular reason for this is that developed countries believe that restraining their emissions will disrupt their economy. Conversely, developing and emerging economies argue that their growth should not be limited by any climate mitigation policies, as their historical levels of carbon emissions have been lower (Heil and Wodon 1997; Duro and Padilla 2006). These arguments pose a challenge for the mitigation of global climate policies. Notwithstanding the fact that the emission inequality problem is somewhat global or regional, it could be also relevant to investigate the issue at the micro level across households within a country. This study measures inequality of CO2 emissions and its decomposition from the household/micro perspective that could be valuable in the discourse on climate change. The measure and degree of inequality in CO2 emissions across households show what degree of “responsibility” different emitters and emission sources have within a country. In particular, the aims of this study are: to determine the extent of emission inequality among households, compare it to overall expenditure inequality, and to investigate the drivers of emission inequality. Similar to the macro literature that has studied emission inequality; we apply several measures of inequality to synthesize the amount of emission inequality at the household-level. In addition to determining the level of inequality, we will also disaggregate and decompose inequality into subgroups of observations as well as into sources of emission. The major reasons to decompose household emission inequality are: (1) allowing us to identify whether the change in emission inequality is fueled by a reduction in the emission gap between households of different levels of affluence, or whether the difference is due to the homogeneity of households’ lifestyles within the same group; (2) allowing us to understand which subgroups (and source of emissions) contribute predominantly to overall emission inequality. Finally, regarding the comparison between expenditure and emissions, we analyze the inequality measures as well as decomposition of the two variables into the drivers and sources of such inequality so to see whether emission inequality is largely driven by expenditure inequality. A number of studies have been conducted to investigate emission inequalities that are mainly focusing on the global level (e.g. Heil and Wodon 1997; Hedenus and Azar 2005; Padilla and Serrano 2006; Cantore and Padilla 2010) as well as the regional level (e.g. Alcantara and Duro 2004; Padilla and Duro 2013; Clarke-Sather et al. 2011). In general, these studies have taken into account the characteristics of the emission distribution and have dealt with decomposing it into between and within-country inequality. In an international context, Heil and Wodon (1997) analyze the CO2 emissions inequality between poor and rich countries. Employing the Gini index, results found that the inequality in GHG emissions remained high during the period 1960–1990 and the between-group component accounted for half of the per capita emissions inequality. Padilla and Serrano (2006) applied conventional applications of inequality to measure CO2 emissions inequality, and employ the Theil index decomposition to investigate the contribution of four income country groups to the overall inequality in CO2 emissions. They found that while the overall CO2 emissions inequality lessens over time, the low-income countries experience an increase in inequality. Employing the concentration indices of emissions (cross-country emission inequality ordered by increasing value of income, which was proposed by Kakwani et al. (1997)), they found it have diminished less than the conventional measure in emission inequality. Duro and Padilla (2006) decompose the Theil index of emissions by using Kaya factors to find what contribution the factors had on per capita CO2 emissions, CO2 intensity, energy intensity and per capita income. They found that the CO2 emissions inequality was mainly attributed to the difference in per capita income levels. Recently, an investigation of the international inequalities in ecological footprint was conducted by Duro and Teixidó-Figueras (2013) that primarily suggested that the global emission inequality was largely explained by “between-group” inequality rather than the “within group” component. From the regional context, a study on the energy intensities inequality among OECD countries by Alcantara and Duro (2004) revealed that the decline in energy intensities differences was mainly due to “between-group component inequalities” rather than “within group inequalities”. Similarly, Padilla and Duro (2013), who only focused on the European Union case, employed the same method of decomposing emission inequality of using the Kaya factor. They found that per capita output is the most important factor of emission inequality. In other words, evidence from the European Union is consistent with the global context. Furthermore, there was a significant decline in emission inequality, which is primarily due to the declining contribution of energy intensity inequality and the reduction of output inequality between country groups. In the case of sub-national analyses, Clarke-Sather et al. (2011) primarily investigate whether the Chinese provincial-level of CO2 inequality mirrors the international pattern. They found that global evidence of CO2 emission inequality was not reflected in the provincial context, as the contribution of the “within group inequality” (i.e. intraregional inequality) was larger than the “between-group” inequality component. This means that the variations of CO2 emissions between regions in China are lower than the variation within any particular provinces. Therefore this study could fill the gaps in analyzing inequality in emission and its decomposition from the household-level perspective. As mentioned, although the above problem is global, it is also relevant to investigate it in local context. In that sense, a cross-country study on household-level emission inequality and how it relates to income is relevant. Specifically, the contributions of this study are as follows: (1) disaggregated household-level study on CO2 emissions in a developing country using Indonesia as example, to understand the patterns of emission inequality from the micro level perspective; (2) a study on the main contributors (drivers) of CO2 emissions inequality at the household-level and its link to expenditure inequalityFootnote 1; (3) investigation on the internal dynamics of emission inequality at the household-level, which remains an understudied dimension in mitigating climate change.",12
18.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,15 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0120-7,Econometric analysis of cleanup of illegal dumping sites in Japan: removal or remedial actions?,October 2016,Toshiaki Sasao,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Illegal dumping sites and land contamination from past hazardous waste disposal should be cleaned up to avoid environmental damages and health risks. However, remediation is incomplete at many contaminated sites. The number of outstanding illegal dumping incidents involving industrial waste was 2564 in Japan as of March 2014.Footnote 1 The total residual quantity of untreated waste was approximately 17 million tons. While most incidents total less than 1000 tons per incident, some incidents exceed 100 thousand tons per incident. Illegal dumping causes not only environmental damages, such as water and soil contamination, but also imposes a financial burden for site cleanup, which is borne by the relevant local governments. For example, along the prefectural boundary between Aomori and Iwate, in Northern Japan, cleanup costs will amount to 70.8 billion yen (666 million dollars,Footnote 2 both prefectures together). Most of these big hazardous dumping sites are supported by Industrial Waste Site Restoration Fund and Act on Special Measures concerning Removal of Environmental Problems Caused by Specified Industrial Wastes (Special Measures Act, hereafter). The former is a fund established according to the 1997 amendment of the Waste Management Act. It provides funds for three quarters of the treatment costs on a site through the national government and industry (one quarter and one half, respectively). The remaining one quarter has to be paid for by the prefecture where the site is located (Fujikura 2011). Approximately 4170 million yen (39 million dollars) has been spent on 69 sites until March 2014. However, the fund has also been applied to improper disposal cases that occurred after June 17, 1998. For the cases prior to this date, only one-third of the treatment costs are funded. This fund, however, was insufficient to cover the costs incurred by local prefectures. Therefore, the national government enforced the Special Measures Act to promote the treatment of unsolved illegal dumping incidents in 2003. For the cases approved by the Minister of Environment, the burden on local government is reduced due to special local government bonds and related tax allocations. Approximately 47.7 billion yen (448 million dollars) has been spent on 17 sites until March 2014. This total amount exceeds the estimation provided by the central government when the act was enforced. However, most illegal dumping sites remain uncleared. Consequently, the Special Measures Act was extended for further 10 years, although it was enacted as a time-limited act for 10 years. Important issues in the cleanup of illegal dumping sites of hazardous waste are cost, time, and safety. These issues seem to depend on whether dumped waste and contaminated soil are removed from the site, and in case of removal, the amount of waste and soil that is removed. In general, removal actions (off-site cleanups) are considered to be more expensive than remedial actions (on-site cleanups) (Sigman and Stafford 2010). However, residents near the site often favor removal options because they perceive it to be a permanent solution to the problem, as mentioned by Gupta et al. (1995). The average income and political power of residents near the site may affect their decisions regarding removal. On the other hand, it is also important to assess the costs and periods needed to clean up illegal dumping sites for each action. Prior assessment of costs and periods would contribute to planned and efficient cleanup operations. Cleanup options selected by decision makers can affect the costs and periods for cleanup in association with other related factors. However, few studies show empirical evidence for the decision-making process, costs, and periods regarding cleanup options comprehensively. In particular, very few empirical studies have examined the cleanup of illegal dumping sites in other countries than the United States. Therefore, this study examines the determinants of removal decisions concerning dumped waste and contaminated soil from sites in Japan. Furthermore, it examines the determinants of costs and periods to clean up sites including removal actions, amount of dumped waste, toxicity, and other socioeconomic factors. These two analyses would interact with each other. In general, there is a trade-off between cost and cleanup level. The cleanup level is dependent on cleanup options, and residents near the site would favor permanently safer options. Consequently, decision makers have to make a difficult choice s between the costs and safety when choosing a cleanup option. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of existing relevant studies on cleanup operations on contaminated sites. Section 3 explains the estimation methods and data used in the analysis. Section 4 presents the estimation results, and Sect. 5 offers concluding remarks.",4

Recent theoretical and empirical literature shows that patronage and rent-seeking behavior associated with corruption in the natural resources sector is more likely to manifest when institutions of democratic accountability and the rule of law are weak (Bhattacharyya and Hodler 2010; Andersen et al. 2013), and can in turn lead to a “resource curse” (Robinson et al. 2006; Mehlum et al. 2006; Collier and Goderis 2007; Kolstad and Wiig 2009). In addition to its adverse impacts on economic development, corruption can lead to illegal and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources (Transparency International 2007; Smith and Walpole 2005). Repetto and Gillis (1988) discuss how “grand” corruption in the form of policy distortions favoring special interest groups has contributed to the loss of forests in several countries. Smith et al. (2003) use the example of Indonesia to document how unstable and fragmented political regimes, characterized by collusive corruption (where individual government officials and the private sector collude to rob the government of revenues) can facilitate illegal logging of timber. Wright et al. (2007) reach a similar conclusion by using satellite-based data on the effectiveness of combating forest fire as a measure of conservation. Their findings from 823 forest reserves globally indicate that the forest conservation is more effective in countries with lower levels of corruption. Agnew et al. (2009) find a significant relationship between the extent of illegal and unreported fishing worldwide and governance (as measured by the mean of four World Bank indices of governance—government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption). Using the same index of governance, Osterblom et al. (2010) find that vessel operators involved in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are increasingly choosing countries with weak governments, with presumably lower ability to address non-compliance, as flag states. Examining the theoretical underpinnings of corruption in the natural resources sector, Barbier et al. (2005) develop an open-economy model in which profit-maximizing economic agents provide political contributions to a corruptible government to induce greater diversion of forest land. Amacher et al. (2012) show how “petty” corruption at the level of local inspectors, who can be bribed by harvesters to allow illegal extraction, leads to higher unreported harvesting and lower environmentally sensitive logging of timber than in the case where bribery is not possible. Damania (2002) studies petty corruption in a model of information asymmetry where the regulator determines the optimal policy mix (pollution tax, penalty, audit rate) without being able to observe true emission levels. It is shown that for the firm and inspector to truthfully reveal emissions it is necessary that the tax schedule is concave in emissions and the audit rate is convex in reported emissions. Damania et al. (2004) develop and empirically test a model of combined grand and petty corruption in which it is shown that political instability indirectly affects environmental compliance, via judicial inefficiency and corruption. Wilson and Damania (2005) look into the interacting effect of political competition in a model of stratified corruption. They show that increasing political competition yields more stringent policy and better environmental outcomes. However, its impact on petty corruption depends on existing enforcement mechanisms and judicial institutions—when institutions are weak, an increase in political competition can provide incentives for agents to switch resources from grand to petty corruption. As is evident from the above review, much of the existing work on corruption and natural resources is based on an underlying assumption of a single homogenous government. In reality, the governance of natural resources in federal systems is characterized by the multiplicity of competing jurisdictions. While some recent literature studies the issue at the sub-national level (see for instance, Halkos et al. 2010), there is no discussion on the interaction amongst levels of government within a nation.Footnote 1 Andersson and Ostrom (2008) argue that the diverse experience of federal countries in decentralized natural resource management (see Shackleton et al. 2002; Larson and Soto 2008 for case studies) can be understood better by drawing on institutional theories of polycentricity—the relationships among multiple authorities with overlapping jurisdictions. This literature emphasizes the importance of relationships between political actors who operate at different levels of governance and makes the case for considering the degree and forms of nestedness of these actors within larger political systems. The literature on the political economy of fiscal federalism, offers some examples of this interaction. For instance, the political composition of the central government has been shown to play a significant role in its decision to bailout sub-national governments when the latter default on debts. Even fiscally irresponsible sub-national governments are able to obtain bailout because of their relationship with the ruling party or coalition at the center. This can be blatant when the central government happens to be a loose coalition of logrolling regional interest groups (Rodden et al. 2003). In turn, the presence of a soft-budget constraint can lead sub-national jurisdictions to choose their fiscal policy opportunistically in anticipation of fiscal bailout by a federal authority (see Vigneault 2007 for a survey of related literature). In a related paper, Desai et al. (2005) use panel data from 80 Russian regions to show that regional governments are more likely to pursue rent-seeking opportunities when they are more dependent on appropriable rents from resource extraction or from budgetary transfers from the central government as compared to more locally generated revenues. Similarly, Boex and Martinez-Vazquez (2006) conclude from a survey of empirical literature that political influence and the size of a jurisdiction play an important and consistent role in determining the horizontal allocation of inter-governmental grants.Footnote 2
 The issue of inter-governmental relationships within a country has not received adequate attention in the theoretical literature on the political economy of natural resource governance. Fredrikkson et al. (2010) come closest to looking at the issue. They model the case where the legislature consists of geographically distinct electoral districts and federal environmental tax policy is decided by a majority of districts acting as joint welfare-maximizers. It is shown that the majority party (at either the national or the state level) favors its own home districts in determining environmental policy. Thus, depending on the location of polluting industries and the associated pollution damages, the majority party may impose sub-optimally high or low pollution taxes due to a majority bias.Footnote 3 The paper, however, does not delve into how a majoritarian bias can interact with corruption in the natural resources sector. This is a pertinent issue in federal countries, especially where the control and management of natural resources is vested with multiple tiers of government, as is true for India, Australia, and Argentina (Fischer 2007; Cullen 1990; Brosio and Jimenez 2012). The Constitution of India provides for duality of control in the governance of mining with the ownership of minerals vested with the States but regulation of the sector vested largely with the Central Government. The resulting institutional confusion not only creates turf wars but also provides fertile ground for illegal mining due to collusive and corrupt behavior by State and Central officials (ISID 2013). Available data for Indian states for the period 2009–2012 show that although illegal mining was reported in all mineral-rich states and across party lines, the highest number of cases were reported in states which enjoyed among the highest weight in the central coalition government (e.g., Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh).Footnote 4
 Our stylized model integrates some of these features of federal countries in a model of rent seeking in the natural resources sector in order to study how a majoritarian bias operating through party affiliation and size of a jurisdiction, contributes to illegal mining and welfare. We consider a federation with two tiers of government (national and state). We assume that the state-level politician is corruptible and willing to allow illegal mining of a sub-soil resource in exchange for bribes from a private miner.Footnote 5 We then introduce overlapping jurisdictions in resource governance through a national agency which can audit mines to detect any unlawful production. We bring in majoritarian politics by positing that the probability of audit is a decreasing function of the political weight of the concerned state politician in the national government. Federal corruption, thus, enters implicitly and exogenously in the model as a function of the given weight wielded by the state politician in the national government. This weight may be thought of as the percentage of seats that the politician contributes to the ruling national coalition. We focus on the national audit instrument for several reasons. One, judicious central oversight is considered an important non-electoral mechanism for improving accountability of local governments in federal systems, both in the context of decentralized natural resource management (Ribot 2002; Bartley et al. 2008), and, more generally, in the study of decentralization and corruption [see for instance Triesman 2002; Mookherjee and Bardhan 2005].Footnote 6 Second, in practice, the statutory right to audit resource extraction is vested with multiple levels of governments in some federal nations including India. Third, inspection and audit systems are important determinants of the level of illegal mining and can be influenced by political factors in addition to factors like available budgets and rule of law. Cai and Treisman (2004) reason that one of the ways that sub-national political actors can protect firms is to use their influence over the central regulators to look the other way when they audit a certain firm.Footnote 7 An independent commission probing illegal mining in India has listed poor inspection of mines by central and state government authorities as one of the major factors that encouraged illegal mining. It has pointedly asked if the failure to inspect mines even on receiving complaints from citizens is a case of dereliction of duties or a deliberate omission which resulted into illegal mining and huge loss to government exchequer (Shah 2012).Footnote 8
 This paper is different from existing literature in several respects. First, we examine rent seeking/corruption in resource extraction in a model of multiple tiers of government while, in comparison, related work (e.g., Barbier et al. 2005; Wilson and Damania 2005; Amacher et al. 2012) assumes a single homogenous tier. Second, we incorporate the effect of majoritarian politics on the corruptibility of the central and state governments which to the best of our knowledge has not been considered in previous research. Finally, unlike existing research in which misreporting is linked to petty corruption while policy distortion is linked to grand corruption (e.g., Amacher et al. 2012; Damania et al. 2004; Wilson and Damania 2005), we model a case where misreporting of extraction takes place with the involvement of politicians rather than local inspectors. This is borne out of evidence from India—the Commission inquiring illegal mining of minerals in the country has specifically noted that illegal mining and evasion of royalty of the scale was not possible without the connivance of politicians, bureaucrats, and lessees (Shah 2012). At a more general level, the paper contributes to the dense literature on corruption and political institutions.Footnote 9 In the context of democracies, this literature argues that when checks and balances are weak and governments are politically unstable, resource rents can unleash patronage politics, undermining the potential growth-enhancing effect of electoral competition in democracies (Ackerman 1999; Collier and Hoeffler 2009). Our paper reasons that in federal democracies, checks and balances take place at multiple levels of governance and are also shaped by inter-governmental political relations—where the central government is a multi-party coalition, it may compromise on ‘checks and balances’ in the interest of political ‘stability.’ The model leads to some interesting conclusions. We find that the corruptibility of the state politician leads to higher extraction of the mineral but lower under-reporting/illegal mining as compared to the case of a non-corruptible politician. This happens because the bargaining between the politician and the miner ensures that the public good effect of royalty revenue partly offsets the royalty evasion motive of the miner. Next, we find that greater politicization of a national audit agency does not necessarily lead to higher illegal mining at the sub-national level. The outcome depends on the weight, relative to an endogenously determined threshold, of the state politician in the national coalition government. A higher (lower) weight that the threshold is, will lead to greater (less) illegal mining. This threshold is found to be rising in the per-unit fine on royalty evasion faced by the miner but declining in the rate of royalty. The result suggests that a high rate of penalty can be an effective way of insulating natural resources from politicized audit systems. We also find that the level of bribes are a function of several parameters, including the corruptibility of the politician and the fines faced by the miner and politician on being detected, and thus may not always increase following an increase in illegal mining. Finally, in the absence of social and environmental externalities of mining, the model suggests that welfare can increase with illegal mining when the marginal utility of the royalty-funded public good is less than unity. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 of the paper details the baseline model and solves two benchmark equilibria in the case of a politically neutral national audit agency—one when the state politician is honest, and the other when he is corruptible. Section 3 studies the change in illegal mining and welfare due to a politicized audit agency. Section 4 offers some policy insights and concludes.",2

However, the optimality condition, or first-best nature of the so-called Pigouvian tax, under which the pollution tax equals to the marginal environmental damages at the optimal emission level, depends on three crucial assumptions: (1) a benevolent regulator maximizes a utilitarian social welfare function (SWF); (2) pollution taxes are transfer payments not designed to raise revenues and (3) the administrative costs of assessing and collecting emission taxes are negligible. Previous research has relaxed the assumption that taxes are transfers and they have taken into consideration the costly administration of pollution taxation. This strand of literature shows that the optimal pollution tax may diverge from marginal environmental damages. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there is no previous attempt to simultaneously relaxing all three assumptions. We relax the typical assumption, made in the optimal taxation literature, that a utilitarian social planner maximizes a simple utilitarian (‘Benthamite’) social welfare function (SWF) defined as the un-weighted sum of citizens’ utilities (welfare) (Diamond and Mirrless 1971). In line with Holcombe (1998), we argue that any tax policy is a product of politics, so a complete understanding of tax policy requires an explicit recognition of the political environment within which tax policy is designed. At the simplest level of analysis, such a political environment can be captured by assigning different weights to the components of the SWF (Rausser et al. 2011). The resulting generalized utilitarian SWF brings a positive dimension into the analysis, usually known as a public-choice approach (Oates and Portney 2003). Specifically, we apply the so-called weighted linear SWF. It enables us to explore the implications of a generalized utilitarian SWF that captures the regulator’s social weights attached to the various components included in a SWF. These distributional weights are typically interpreted to represent public preferences or to reflect the rent-seeking abilities of interest groups (Bullock and Salhofer 2003). It is often argued that distributional weights are attached to the components of an SWF as the correct response to address equity considerations (Brent 2006).Footnote 1 Johansson-Stenman (2005) examines when the use of distributional weights are second-best options in applied cost-benefit analysis. Hahn (1990) uses such a model to examine the choice of policy instruments for environmental regulation. Grossman and Helpman (1994); Tanaka (1998) and Horan et al. (1999) use a weighted SWF in different contexts. Furthermore, previous examples that combine positive and normative approaches can be found in Giannakas and Fulton (2000, 2002) and Casamatta et al. (2011). With such a setting, we derive a set of results, which have not previously been identified in the relevant literature of second-best pollution taxation. Note that a second-best world refers to the situation where pre-existing distortionary taxes prevails and the government cannot use lump-sum transfers (Lans Bovenberg and Goulder 2002; Pang and Shaw 2011).Footnote 2 First, under zero marginal tax revenues, it is the relative ranking between regulator’s weights on environmental quality and on producers which determines whether a second-best pollution tax deviates from the Pigouvian rule. On the contrary, under positive marginal tax revenues, the major determinant of such a comparison is the relative ranking between the regulator’s weights on producers and on the total value of tax revenues. In addition, the paper discusses how the balance of (market) power between the government and the firms affects second-best pollution taxes. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 presents the proposed model, while Sect. 4 discusses how the balance of power between the government and the firms shapes second-best pollution taxes. The comparison between second-best pollution tax and marginal damage is given in Sect. 5, whereas previous results are presented in Sect. 6. In addition, policy implications are discussed in Sect. 7 and the last section concludes the paper.",7
18.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,18 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0133-2,Why regulators adopt voluntary programs: a theoretical analysis of voluntary pollutant reduction programs,October 2016,Takuro Miyamoto,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the last four decades, environmental policy tools have been developed and applied in response to growing environmental concerns. Among these tools, voluntary approaches to environmental protection have become prominent in developed countries since the late 1980s. In the European Union (EU), the number of new voluntary agreements increased from 6 in 1981 to more than 45 in 1995 (OECD 1999). There are over 300 negotiated agreements between governments and polluting industries or firms in Europe. In the United States (US), Brouhle, Griffiths and Wolverton (2005) identified over 50 voluntary programs at the federal level alone since 1991, when the 33/50 program,Footnote 1 the first voluntary program, was launched. In Japan, over 30,000 negotiated agreements between local governments and (in most cases, individual) polluters are in effect.Footnote 2
 One of the main motives for voluntary emission abatement is legislative threats (or regulatory threats). Firms might take voluntary environmental actions (without the direct involvement of governments), make voluntary environmental agreements with governments or participate in voluntary environmental programs designed by governments to avoid a costly mandatory regulation. Numerous voluntary approaches have been adopted in response to threats of mandatory regulation. However, the low participation rates of voluntary programs (VPs) suggest that these threats are typically weak; for example, the participation rates of the US 33/50 program and the Canadian Accelerated Reduction/Elimination of Toxics (ARET) program, the goal of which is to reduce the release and/or transfer of chemicals, are 17.0 and 13.4 %, respectively.Footnote 3
 These voluntary programs have been led by governments. This prompts the following question: why do the governments continue to implement VPs rather than mandatory policies given the former’s low participation rates? Weak legislative threats primarily result from the political difficulty of establishing stringent mandatory regulations. Therefore, governments have implemented VPs due to the fear of weak mandatory regulations (or the lack thereof) even though their participation rates were low. In addition to political difficulty, it is possible that governments prefer a VP with a high abatement rate and low participation rate to one with a low abatement rate and high participation rate because the former generates greater social welfare than the latter. Because participation in VPs is not mandatory, there is a trade-off between the participation rate and the abatement rates of individual participating firms. By taking this trade-off into account, governments might place more weight on abatement rates of individual participating firms than the participation rate. This paper addresses the following two questions; first, why have governments implemented VPs despite their low participation rates, and second, how should governments design VPs given the trade-off between the participation rate and the abatement rate. Although many researchers have studied voluntary approaches to environmental protection, we are unaware of any study that resolves both of these questions. Lutz, Lyon and Maxwell (2000) and Maxwell, Lyon and Hackett (2000) analyzed voluntary environmental actions by firms rather than voluntary programs designed by governments or voluntary agreements between governments and firms. Most studies on voluntary programs and voluntary agreements have ignored individual firms’ participation decisions regarding voluntary programs or agreements because they focused on the case of a single polluter (Segerson and Miceli 1998, 1999; Hansen 1999; Glachant 2007; Fleckinger and Glachant 2011) or assumed that all polluters participate in voluntary approaches (Manzini and Mariotti 2003). Lyon and Maxwell (2003), Dawson and Segerson (2008) and Brau and Carraro (2011) developed models that incorporate an individual firm’s participation decision. However, at most, these studies only answered one of our two research questions. In the model of Lyon and Maxwell (2003), there is no trade-off between the participation rate and the abatement rate of individual participating firms, as the voluntary program concerns the adoption of a new technology that induces some fixed amount of emissions abatement. Therefore, they provided no information on how voluntary programs should be designed when there is a trade-off between firms’ participation and abatement rates, although they provided a rationale for implementing a VP that differs from the one analyzed in this paper. Dawson and Segerson (2008) developed a model where a government seeks to achieve an exogenous industry-wide emissions abatement target through a VP or an emission tax. In their model, the government implements the VP if it achieves the abatement target, despite the government being able to impose the first-best tax. Thus, Dawson and Segerson (2008) analyzed the VP that is very similar to ours but did not provide a rationale for implementing such a VP. Brau and Carraro (2011) also analyzed voluntary emission abatement actions of firms within the same industry in a case with spillover effects in which firms’ production costs decrease more as more firms commit to emissions abatement and as committing firms’ levels of emissions abatement increase. Their main focus was on firms' behavior, in particularly the relationship between firms’ commitment and spillover effects. As a result, their analysis did not provide the government’s motivation for implementing low participation rate VPs and the implications of VP design when the government faces a trade-off between abatement and participation rates. In this paper, we develop a multiple-firm (multiple-polluter) model of a voluntary program in the presence of a weak legislative threat to resolve the above two questions. The weak legislative threat in our model is inspired by Glachant (2007), who developed a model of a non-enforceable voluntary agreement without a trade-off between the participation and abatement rates (an agreement between a benevolent regulator and a single polluter). The weak legislative threat particularly results from a legislative mandatory standard in which a representative of the polluters lobbies the congress. Due to the weak legislative threat or laxness of the mandatory standard, a benevolent regulator might have an incentive to offer the VP to achieve greater social welfare, although the regulator cannot force the firms to participate. In addition to the regulator, the individual firms might have an incentive to participate in the VP to save lobbying costs. We find that if the legislative threat is very weak, a low participation rate VP can generate higher social welfare and greater aggregate abatement than the mandatory standard. In addition, the highest social welfare and the greatest aggregate abatement are generated by the highest abatement rate of individual firms such that the participating firms’ abatement costs under the VP are less than under the mandatory policy if the damage resulting from individual firms’ emissions does not depend on other firms’ emissions. The participation rate under this abatement rate is the lowest among the abatement rates of VPs that generate higher social welfare. Thus, the abatement rate of the participating firm is important when the damage due to individual firms’ emissions is independent of other firms’ emissions. However, as damage due to individual firms’ emissions becomes more sensitive to other firms’ emissions, the importance of the participation rate will increase relative to that of the abatement rate. This paper is organized as follows. In next section, we presents a model and analyzes equilibrium conditions. Section 3 discusses the effects of settings other than the basic setting. Section 4 concludes this paper.",2
18.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,06 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0134-1,Green status seeking and endogenous reference standards,October 2016,Heinz Welsch,Jan Kühling,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In addition to environmental concern and moral motivation, social status has recently been invoked as a motivation for pro-social and in particular pro-environmental behavior (Griskevicius et al. 2010; Sexton and Sexton 2011; Ferrara and Missios 2012; Cecere et al. 2014). While traditional explanations of such behaviors involve pure altruism (Becker 1974) or impure altruism (Andreoni 1989, 1990), a more recent explanation involves social comparison and considers pro-social activities as manifestations of what has been referred to as “competitive altruism”.Footnote 1 Competitive altruism entails that people derive utility from pro-social behavior as a means to attain status by signaling selflessness.Footnote 2
 In addition to providing a non-standard explanation for pro-social behavior in terms of social comparison, the literature has discussed the issue of whom people compare to and has proposed models of heterogeneous individuals who choose those identities, norms and reference standards from which they benefit most, given their own individual characteristics. Reference standards involved in social comparison thus become endogenous (Falk and Knell 2004). In this paper, we combine the ideas of competitive altruism and endogenous reference standards and apply them to the case of pro-environmental consumption. In this context, the notions of “green competitive altruism” or “conspicuous conservation” entail that pro-environmental consumption serves to gain status by signaling environmental concern, where the magnitude of the status signal is measured by the intensity of one’s green behavior (“greenness”, for short) relative to some reference greenness and the benefit (utility) of the green signal increases in the greenness of one’s peers (Sexton and Sexton 2011).Footnote 3
 We propose to model green status seeking as a two-stage process in which consumers first choose their peers and associated green reference standard, taking into account that later this will affect the benefits and costs of green consumption choices. The first stage involves balancing the gains to be enjoyed from outperforming others that are less green (downward social comparison) against the greater (marginal) benefit of the green signal when peers are greener.Footnote 4 The second stage involves choosing the greenness of one’s consumption conditional on the chosen reference standard. We show that green status seeking implies upward-sloping optimal response functions: if the marginal utility of the green signal increases in the greenness of one’s peers, then people respond to their peers behaving greener by behaving greener themselves. Against the background of our model we hypothesize that the consumer’s optimal green reference standard increases in her “generic” preference for green consumption (environmentalism). This then suggests the existence of an indirect effect of environmentalism on green consumption through the choice of the reference standard. We use a unique set of survey data on people’s environmentally friendly consumption and the corresponding behavior of their peers to test whether our model is consistent with the data. Our data set includes information on respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, their attitudes towards the environment (environmentalism) and towards consumption (materialism), and on their consumption of organic food and the corresponding behavior of their friends and neighbors.Footnote 5 From the consumption data we build indicators of the greenness of respondents and of the greenness of their peers (peer greenness). The indicator of peer greenness serves as a measure of the green reference standard. We use those indicators to estimate (a) the relationship between respondents’ greenness and peer greenness, controlling for respondents’ characteristics and attitudes, and (b) the relationship between peer greenness and the respondents’ characteristics and attitudes. We find that (a) the greenness of survey respondents’ consumption increases in their green attitude (environmentalism) and in the greenness of their peers’ consumption, consistent with green status seeking, and that (b) the greenness of peers’ consumption increases in respondents’ degree of environmentalism (along with other characteristics), consistent with endogenous selection of green reference standards. Our results suggest the existence of a direct and an indirect relationship (through the green reference standard) between environmentalism and green consumption choices, and the indirect relationship is found to be sizable. Our empirical findings are robust to inclusion of a rich set of control variables and several estimation methods. In comparison with previous literature, our model of reference standards has some similarity with models dealing with the influence of norms and social approval on pro-social behavior. Brekke et al. (2003a), Östling (2009) and Nyborg (2011) analyze models in which people strive to act in accordance with their moral values. Holländer (1990) studies the role of social approval for voluntary cooperation. The moral values and social norms featured in those papers enhance pro-social behavior, similar to the green reference standard in the current paper, but the underlying motivations in those papers refer to conformance rather than to the status motive that we focus on.Footnote 6
 Another strand of literature explicitly addresses the issue of gaining status through conspicuous conservation, similar to the second stage of the framework that we propose. Griskevicius et al. (2010) and Sexton and Sexton (2011) report evidence of conspicuous conservation in studies of consumer behavior both in the field and in the lab.Footnote 7 Ferrara and Missios (2012) and Cecere et al. (2014) study the influence of reputation concerns on recycling and waste reduction. In contrast to the current paper, these papers do not address the endogenous choice of the reference standard involved in signaling green status. Regarding the choice of a reference standard, the paper closest to the current study is Falk and Knell (2004). In their model of “Choosing the Joneses”, however, the reference standard refers to individuals’ aggregate consumption level, not to a particular type of consumption behavior or lifestyle.Footnote 8 In their model, the choice of a reference consumption level involves balancing the motives of self-enhancement (through downward comparison) and self-improvement (through setting an aspiration level for improving one’s own economic performance). Our model differs from theirs in that we do not focus on the level of (own and peer) consumption, but on the quality (that is, greenness) of consumption. As noted above, the relevant tradeoff in our framework is that between the magnitude of the green signal (own greenness relative to peers’ greenness) and the greater benefit of the green signal when peers are greener.Footnote 9
 To our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate green status seeking and endogenous reference standards in a common framework both conceptually and empirically. Modeling the green reference standard as the result of the consumer’s strategic choice suggests that environmental concern (environmentalism) may affect green consumption not only directly, but also indirectly through the green reference standard. Our empirical results are consistent with such an indirect relationship and suggest that it is of sizable magnitude.Footnote 10
 At the policy level, our findings suggest the existence of a multiplier effect of greater environmental concern, as it raises the green reference standard to which others compare and which they try to outperform by consuming in a more environmentally friendly way. This way, “conspicuous conservation” may to some extent counteracts the negative environmental implications of traditional conspicuous consumption.Footnote 11
 In Sect. 2 we present our model of green status seeking and endogenous reference standards whereas Sect. 3 contains the empirical analysis. Section 4 concludes.",12
19.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,02 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-016-0161-6,Equity and the convergence of nationally determined climate policies,January 2017,Lucas Bretschger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is broad public consensus that the Paris Agreement on climate change constitutes a milestone in the international environmental policy. For the first time in history, the world community unanimously agreed on limiting global warming by adopting specified procedures. Yet, concrete climate policy measures are not implemented on a global level, but formulated in terms of independent country contributions, which may be called the “bottom-up” approach to climate policy. It encourages broad policy participation, but has been criticized as being neither efficient nor equitable.Footnote 1 Indeed, current policy contributions are not efficient, because countries’ marginal abatement costs are not equalized and the internationally agreed temperature targets are not reached. This contrasts with the principles of environmental economics, according to which an efficient policy would set a unique world carbon price or limit the quantity of world carbon emissions on an optimal level. Moreover, policy contributions are not equitable, because certain countries are significantly more ambitious in emission abatement than others, reflecting that no general guidelines or benchmarks for burden sharing have been implemented so far. It is important to analyze the gap between the currently agreed and an efficient climate policy. Advising governments to adopt optimal policies may be called the “top-down” approach to environmental policy. It is correct according to theory but risks to ignore all the problems associated with getting the policy approved by the political process; with global warming, this even includes international negotiations. Hence, the top-down procedure usually misses the transition costs of changing an economy to a new equilibrium. Difficulties typically arise because of policy-induced changes in the sectoral structure and the income distribution. In fact, climate policy affects the different economic sectors and household types in an asymmetric manner. Public perception is often biased, however, see Sterner (2011).Footnote 2 Already on a national level, equity (or perceived equity) is a prime concern when crafting the environmental policy. Accordingly, green tax reforms and emission trading systems usually contain a redistribution component favoring those groups which are mostly affected by policy. On the international level, distributional problems are only compounded. This especially holds true for climate change and climate policies, which have both a major impact on world income distribution. Without any policy, less developed and vulnerable countries will suffer disproportionately.Footnote 3 With stringent climate policies, carbon-intensive countries have to bear significant costs to decarbonize their economies. Current country contributions to international climate policy are closely related to domestic costs and benefits of climate policy; the different “national circumstances” have been stressed by many parties of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015). Given the rules of the United Nations, policy participation is voluntary; every country can decide to stay outside of an agreement or to withdraw from it. There is no invisible hand guiding a country to accept a solution which is efficient on the global level, but perceived as unfair at the country level. This naturally suggests to start with a bottom-up procedure for formulating international policy. Yet, to reach convergence between the countries and to meet global temperature targets, a powerful international coordination mechanism is needed. The paper argues that equity can provide the guidelines for this coordination. The Kyoto protocol failed, because it prescribed uneven burden sharing; it missed to include all major emitters in a meaningful way. If equity principles are successfully applied, they can form a major driver to close the gap between the currently envisaged and the optimum in the international climate policy.Footnote 4 Ideally, it will become possible to extract those national circumstances which are generally acceptable for fair burden sharing. International climate policy is, indeed, an important equity issue as much as it is an efficiency problem.Footnote 5 An indication that this might set the direction is the fact that the concept of equitable burden sharing appears prominently in the text of the Paris Agreement.Footnote 6 The paper aims to explain the mechanics of a policy convergence process and the role of equity-based signals in an international context, which may affect public opinion and policy decisions at the country level. Providing economic guidelines for solving equity problems is not the usual task of deriving empirically testable and potentially refutable propositions from the first principles. Here, the economic approach does not seek to explain observable events, but rather to evaluate the desirability of alternative policy choices. To do so, welfare theory can be applied, embedding equity concerns in social welfare functions. An alternative concept is the Pareto condition which was put forward in the climate context under the label “International Paretianism” (Posner and Weisbach 2012). Because not a single country should lose from the international climate policy, the concept implies a substantial income redistribution from climate vulnerable and poor countries to oil-extracting countries. This has been criticized as indefensible, confirming the importance of distribution and fairness for the international climate policy. The present paper introduces and discusses welfare functions to organize, formalize, and synthesize equity consideration in formal theory.Footnote 7 To deal with this aspect of climate policy, it is convenient to use emission quantities rather than prices, i.e., to focus on country carbon budgets.Footnote 8 By focusing on equitable climate policy, the contribution is related to Lange et al. (2007), Mattoo and Subramanian (2010), and Bretschger (2013), where specific rules for burden sharing based on equity principles are derived.

Evidence from Greek manufacturing industries,January 2017,Nikos Chatzistamoulou,George Diagourtas,Kostas Kounetas,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The 2013 edition of the World Energy Outlook (International Energy Agency, IEA 2013) recorded an increase in oil demand, an inevitable increase of energy consumption and a 20 % rise of CO2 energy related emissions which potentially leads to an average rise of the global temperature by 3.5 °C. Furthermore, the department of Environment of the European Community (EC) had announced an increase by 7.1 % in 2009, in the EU-27 and 6.9 % in the EU-15 regarding the greenhouse gas emissions (Environmental Energy Agency, EEA 2010), while the industrial emissions across Europe appear to be more than two million tons of CO2 (E-PRTR, EEA 2011). Such a situation requires the adoption of environmental management practices by firms to reduce emission levels (Dessus and Bussolo 1998), improve their energy efficiency (Kounetas et al. 2012) and fulfill the commitments arising from the Rio Declaration and the Kyoto Protocol. Many countries of the European Union including Greece, aspire to achieve a sustainable level of growth (EEA 2011). To this end, significant efforts have been made to comply with the environmental legislation of the European Union (Directive, 2010/75/EU) recognizing the significance of environmental pollution issue emanating from industrial activities (Kunz et al. 2013). Moreover, Greek manufacturing firms devote their scarce resources towards the direction of innovative production techniques in order to reduce greenhouse gases, exploit green energy sources and reuse waste material (Halkos and Evangelinos 2002; Halkos and Sepetis 2007; Skouloudis et al. 2014). The promotion of those structural reforms contains extensive capital expenditures and large scale operating costs associated to pollution abatement practices. However, the heavy dependence of Greek industries on petroleum products requires the development of policies that contribute in following the obligation commitments of the Kyoto protocol (Tsani 2010). In particular, both capital expenditures and operating costs appear to have an ambiguous effect on firm’s productivity and therefore, on economic growth (Fujii et al. 2011; Tsurumi and Managi 2010). As far as the development of Environmental abatement incentive schemes in the Greek manufacturing sector is concerned, over the last two decades the Greek environmental policy is based almost exclusively on the directives of the Environmental Commission of the European Union. The department of Environment of the European Commission follows three distinct channels to regulate the industrial activity such as environmental legislation, abatement subsidies and encouraging voluntary environmental actions. Under the 5th Environmental Action Programme (1993–2002), the Environmental Commission put in force the Directives of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) and SEVESO II. The introduction of the IPPC Directive (1996) in the EU targeted to further improve and upgrade the EU environmental protection. Prevention measures were specified, or in case the latter was not possible to be implemented and measures to reduce air, land and water emissions, from the industrial activities side were proposed instead. In addition, IPPC sets environmental conditions for providing pollution permits to infant industries and introduce innovation in pollution prevention, by applying the best available techniques (BAT). The SEVESO Directive defines measures to address the risks of major accidents in plants due to the presence of unstable and dangerous chemical substances. The SEVESO II Directive (1996) has fully replaced its predecessor. Significant changes have been made and new concepts have been introduced into the SEVESO II Directive. The latter include the revision and augmenting its scope, the introduction of new requirements relating to safety management systems, emergency planning, along with land-use planning and a reinforcement of the provisions on inspections to be carried out by the Member States. Within the philosophy of the 6th Environmental Action Programme (2003–2012), Environmental Commission adopted the Directive on “Environmental Liability” (2004). The “Environmental Liability” Directive concerns the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (ELD), establishes a framework based on the “polluter pays” principle, according to which the polluter has the obligation to compensate and restore for any environmental damage occurs due to the activities the latter undertakes. The turning point for the environmental policy of the EU was the Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP) which was announced by the European Commission in early 2000s, to promote and subsidize eco-friendly technologies.Footnote 1 The objective of this ambitious plan was to boost innovation, growth and sustainable development in Europe, following a major consultation exercise with governments, business communities and other stakeholders. Greece has established the national action plan for eco-friendly technologies, which provides a range of actions for the promotion of ETAP. For implementing the national action plan, Greece adopted a new Developmental Law (2004) and established the operational programme called ‘competitiveness’ under the Greek Ministry of Development funded by the 3rd Community Support Framework (3rd CSF/2000–2006). The Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness’, is a 60 million euros program containing the action 2.9.4 (Support for the creation/extension of units managing and/or re-using waste) under the measure 2.9 (support for entrepreneurship in environmental sector). Considering the above, the main research question of the present paper can be stated as follows: do the pollution abatement efforts have a significant impact on industrial productivity increase forcing firms and industries shift to cleaner production methods to boost their productivity? This is the million dollars question during the last two decades or so due to the desire of the economies in reducing the undesirable byproducts associated with the production of goods and services. In this study, we aspire to contribute to the existing body of literature by focusing on a European economy characterized mostly by small and medium-sized firms that is Greece. Moreover, the measurement of the effect of abatement efforts on industrial productivity is based on specific firm’s idiosyncratic behavior concerning the underdeveloped corporate social responsibility (Skouloudis et al. 2014), the low level of environmental protection (Halkos and Sepetis 2007), the relatively lax environmental regulation, legislation competitiveness and high levels of industry pollution intensity (Mulatu et al. 2010). From the one hand, a positive answer to the abovementioned research question might be in favor of the concerns regarding the win–win hypothesis (Porter and van der Linde 1995; Darnall et al. 2007; Testa et al. 2012). On the other hand, a negative answer verifies the Gray and Shadbegian (2005) traditional approach (Färe et al. 2007) stating that “abatement expenditures contribute less or nothing to production, although those do not have a significant effect on productivity of non-abatement inputs” (Gray and Shadbegian 2005, p. 196). Taking into consideration the regulatory pressure on governments to follow the environmental directives of the European Union (EU), the former have introduced a broad spectrum of policy measures related to firms’ production (Testa et al. 2012). These policy measures contain performance standards, subsidies for environmental management, emission taxes and quotas (Brännlund and Lundgren 2010), auctioned permits (e.g. EU Emissions Trading Scheme) and conventional agreements (Jung et al. 1996; David and Sinclair-Desgagné 2005). In this paper, we comprise a unique dataset consisting of firms from the Greek manufacturing sector which adopted clean technologies and undertook the cost of pollution abatement effortsFootnote 2 to reduce pollution to a socially acceptable level. The paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews the related literature, Sect. 3 presents the methodological strategy, Sect. 4 describes the data, the variables used in the analysis and the policy measures proposed by the EU for the Greek manufacturing, Sect. 5 discusses the empirical results and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",10
19.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,29 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-015-0138-x,Emission trading for air pollution hot spots: getting the permit market right,January 2017,Werner Antweiler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While emission permit trading systems have grown in use over the last decades, their application potential remains somewhat limited because such trading systems work well only for uniformly mixed pollutants such as greenhouse gases or widely dispersed pollutants. Conventional emission permits for non-uniformly mixed pollutants are economically inefficient because emission concentrations vary strongly across receptor locations. ‘Hot spots’ are localized areas with high concentrations of a pollutant. The efficacy of any policy intervention depends crucially on how it targets these ‘hot spots.’ Interventions have to target high-damage ‘hot spots’ more aggressively than low-damage regions. 
Montgomery (1972) introduced a theoretically ideal alternative: ambient concentration contribution permits; see Tietenberg (2006, chap. 4) for an extensive discussion. In the presence of strong spatial heterogeneity, defined by the location of emission points (plants) and receptor points (people), ambient concentration permit markets suffer from practical limitations. Most importantly, such a system requires a large number of markets to work efficiently. The multiplicity of such markets implies high transaction costs and low liquidity of the traded permits.Footnote 1 A further problem is the nature of the permit contracts. Unlike emission permits, ambient concentration contribution permits may be difficult to monitor and enforce as additional contributions to emission concentrations at a given receptor location may be subject to large stochastic variation. It is much easier to monitor emissions at the source. Because of the impracticality of ambient-concentration markets, numerous alternatives have been proposed in the past; see Atkinson and Tietenberg (1982) for a discussion. Much of that research has been focused on second-best models involving trading zones with a limited number of markets. Among the most prominent examples are Førsund and Nævdal (1998), who propose a zonal system with inter-zone exchange rates, and more recently Krysiak and Schweitzer (2010), who derive the optimal size of zonal permit markets in the presence of informational constraints. Recent research by Farrow et al. (2005), Hung and Shaw (2005), Muller and Mendelsohn (2009), Fowlie and Muller (2013), Fowlie et al. (2015) and Holland and Yates (2015) have opened a new frontier for tackling the hot spot problem; it is a matter of ‘getting the prices right’ for individual emitters.Footnote 2 Individual emitters need to face heterogeneous price signals that reflect their contribution to environmental damage, and not just their overall emission level. The key innovation in these papers is the use of bilateral trading ratios through which pairs of firms can exchange permits. While the economic logic of this approach is compelling, the question arises on how to operationalize this concept. Obviously, bilateral trading is not as efficient as trading through an integrated (anonymous) permit market with a single price. This paper advances such a solution for ‘getting the market right.’ This is an implementation question—and a policy problem—rather than a question about new economic theory. Theoretical elements introduced in this paper refine and complement the theoretical structure in the aforementioned papers. While some theoretical elements may appear as isomorphic, they introduce subtle modifications and simplifications that help develop an operationally feasible permit market for air pollution hot spots. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to refine environmental policy, but not to develop novel economic theory. The keys to a practicable tradeable permit system for ‘hot spots’ are simplicity, objectivity, liquidity, and gradualism. A trading system is simple if it keeps transaction costs low, and offers verifiable and enforceable contracts. To make a permit market for hot spots a feasible alternative to other forms of regulatory intervention, such a market cannot be more complex for participants than conventional permit markets. A market must also strive for objectivity by basing any firm-specific rules on measurable quantities that are relatively immune to challenge or to lobbying. In an UNCTAD report, Tietenberg et al. (1999, pp. 105–107) comments on design principles for a permit trading system: The emissions trading system should be designed to be as simple as possible. The historic evidence is very clear that simple emissions trading systems work much better than severely constrained ones. The transaction costs associated with implementing and administering an emissions trading system rise with the number of constraints imposed, and as transactions costs rise, the number of trades falls. As the number of trades falls, the cost savings achieved by the programme also decline. [...] Transaction costs play a key role in the success or failure of an emissions trading system. In the past, only emissions trading programmes with low transaction costs have succeeded in substantially lowering the cost of compliance. To make emission permit trading work for ‘hot spots,’ the trading system has to be as simple and transparent as the conventional cap-and-trade system for uniformly mixed pollutants. As Burtraw (2013) points out, governing institutions are often the pitfall of emission pricing: getting institutional mechanisms ‘right’ is as important as getting the pricing ‘right.’ As the \(\hbox {SO}_{2}\) trading system has shown, even a simple cap-and-trade system faces formidable obstacles (Schmalensee and Stavins 2013). State-level and source-level constraints—imposed by the Clean Air Interstate Rule and related court rulings—effectively closed down the \(\hbox {SO}_{2}\) market in the United States. This paper proposes a new practicable emission trading system for non-uniformly mixed pollutants. It implements the pioneering economic theory by Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) through subtle, but useful enhancements. It involves a single emission permit market with permits based on firms’ actual emissions. However, to provide the economically efficient incentive for reducing emissions more aggressively in air pollution ‘hot spots,’ firms contributing emissions to ‘hot spots’ must face a higher effective permit price than firms outside these ‘hot spots.’ On the other hand, a unified permit market only has a single market-clearing price. The key insight to facilitate this effective price differentiation is to require firms to buy a number of permits that is proportional to their emissions rather than exactly equal to their emissions, with the proportionality factor varying by emission source and reflecting each source’s contribution to environmental damage. For example, a firm contributing pollution to a hot spot may have to buy twice as many permits as their actual emissions, while firms outside the hot spot may have to buy permits for only half of their actual emissions. This proportionality measure, henceforth referred to as the hazard factor, can be measured objectively and attributed to each firm prior to trading.Footnote 3 With this adjustment in place, an individual firm faces an effective permit price per unit of emissions that is equal to the product of the market permit price and the hazard factor. Each firm buys emission permits equal to the product of its emissions times its hazard factor at the prevailing permit market price. This feature also allows trading to be anonymous. The intuition behind this simple concept is that price and quantity signals are both economically efficient (at least without uncertainty), and that both signals can be mixed in a hybrid fashion. Policy hybridization plays an important role in environmental policy discussions since the seminal work by Roberts and Spence (1976) where price floors and price ceilings can improve the overall efficiency of the system by ensuring sufficient dynamic incentives to innovate (price floor) and relief from sudden price spikes (price ceiling, or allowance reserve). A hybrid price-quantity system is envisioned in this paper to overcome limitations of previously proposed emission permit markets for ‘hot spots.’ While the use of multiple (hybrid) policy instruments has been considered extensively (e.g., Bennear and Stavins 2007) in particular with respect to second-best approaches, the hybrid price-quantity mechanism proposed here aims at achieving first-best optimality, albeit sequentially (iteratively) rather than instantaneously. This hybrid market mechanism is a natural extension of Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) that turns their theoretical instrument into a practical instrument. The proposed hybrid market is also in the spirit of the results in Holland and Yates (2015), who show that under asymmetric information trading ratios based on marginal damage are generally not optimal and can be improved upon through optimal ex-ante trading ratios. The trading system introduced in this paper also relies on gradualism: approaching the first-best solution over time rather than in a single step, as is the common approach in most theoretical models. The benefit of gradualism is twofold. It reduces the information burden of determining marginal damage, relying instead on observing average damage changing over time. Gradualism is also a political imperative. Firms must be given sufficient time to make necessary investments and adjustments. Lastly, the proposed market also allows for anonymous trades. Market participants do not need to know the identity of other participants in order to trade permits. Financial markets that facilitate anonymous trading are generally thought to attract more liquidity (Welker 1995; Theissen 2003; Rindi 2008).",5

Differences in the value of houses can be attributed therefore to housing and neighborhood characteristics with different amenity or disamenity values. Of these, location has always been an important determinant of property value. Before modern transportation, most people, in fact, preferred to live close to their places of work. Today, on the other hand, it is the quality of the neighborhood that determines the choice of residence for most people, with amenities such as green fields and fresh air, as opposed to disamenities such as noise, dust, open drains, odor, etc., often influencing housing decisions. Since there is no direct market for environmental goods, one way to understand the value of environmental goods is to examine how their presence or absence affects the housing market and housing prices. Thus, there are a number of studies which estimate the implicit price of an environmental attribute through an examination of the relationship between attributes preference and the price of property. The value of an environmental amenity is the additional price at which a property will sell due to the presence of that amenity. The hedonic property price approach is popular among economists for the purpose of estimating the value of environmental amenities and disamenities based on housing prices. For instance, Nelson et al. (1992), Reichert (1997), Michaels and Kerry Smith (1990) and Cameron (2006), who examined the localized environmental disamenity of a superfund site for perceived risk, found that distance has a significant impact on housing prices. Kohlase (1991), who estimated the impact of a toxic waste site on housing prices, found that the capital value of the house and the distance to the toxic site were positively correlated. Similarly, Sergio et al. (2002) found that apartments located in close proximity to a sewage treatment plant carried relatively low prices in comparison with those located at a greater distance from the plant. Most hedonic studies are, however, based in Western countries, with comparatively fewer studies from the Asian region. In the case of Pakistan, no empirical work has been conducted so far to investigate preferences with respect to locational disamenities. The present study attempts to address this knowledge gap by estimating the impact of an open sewer system on housing values, identifying distance to sewers and smell as disamenities. We base the study on survey data from 1000 households in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The results show that the disamenity of the open sewer system does have a depressing effect on property values in the city, which makes it incumbent upon policy makers to address the problem of open sewers on both environmental and economic grounds.",16

Spatial distribution of disposal sites in Japan,January 2017,Yuichi Ishimura,Kenji Takeuchi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Deciding where to locate facilities is of capital importance for firms. For those dealing with waste disposal, such decisions can be extremely complicated. While firms hope to find an optimal location for their operations, waste disposal sites are generally considered unwanted facilities. Nearby residents often oppose the construction of such facilities, and local governments worry about conflict related to not in my back yard (NIMBY) and locally unwanted land use (LULU) issues. These issues raise several questions: How are site locations determined? Are these locations concentrated in municipalities with specific characteristics? To what extent do residents’ opinions affect location decisions? Previous empirical studies on the location decisions of firms have tended to focus on geographical endowment, relative price, transport cost, or agglomeration benefits (Wheeler and Mody 1992; Head et al. 1995; Devereux et al. 2007). In cases of unwanted facilities, however, the local community may put pressure on firms and ultimately affect their location decisions. Thus, residents’ welfare loss might be a significant factor in the location decisions for waste facilities. The purpose of this paper is to understand the spatial distribution of unwanted facilities. Using spatial econometric techniques, we investigate the characteristics of communities in Japan that currently host industrial waste disposal sites. We also examine the characteristics of communities in which conflict over the location of disposal sites is likely to occur and examine the impact of conflict on these location decisions. Previous studies on the location of waste treatment facilities have mainly focused on site selection procedures. Kunreuther and Kleindorfer (1986) proposed a sealed-bid mechanism for eliciting citizens’ willingness to accept facilities. Minehart and Neeman (2002) presented a modified second-price auction procedure for choosing a site location. Swallow et al. (1992) proposed a three-phased approach that integrates the technical, economic, and political dimensions related to the landfill-siting process. While these studies relate to the normative aspect of site selection, few studies have investigated the empirical aspect of location decision-making for disposal sites or waste-related facilities. The few examples are Stafford (2000) and Laurian and Funderburg (2014). Stafford (2000) examined the impact of environmental regulations on the location of hazardous waste management firms. Laurian and Funderburg (2014) focused on the location of waste incinerators in France from the viewpoint of environmental justice. This study contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, we investigate the concentration of disposal sites empirically. Since it is difficult to identify municipalities that are most likely to accept disposal sites, waste management companies tend to choose specific municipalities with certain characteristics. Japan provides an excellent setting to test this hypothesis because of its high population density and the scarcity of land for refuse disposal. Since existing studies (Stafford 2000; Lauriand and Funderburg 2014) use a dummy variable of location as dependent variable, they cannot take the extent of spatial concentration into consideration. Moreover, these studies do not address spatial correlation in their estimation. We focus on the number of disposal sites per capita in our estimation and consider spatial dependence by using spatial econometric techniques. Second, we examine whether conflict with residents affects the location decision. While it is reasonable to expect that conflict reduces the number of disposal sites per capita, it is unclear to what extent this opposition is successful. For example, conflicts may not reduce the number of disposal sites if legal procedures and regulations do not strictly require the agreement of local residents regarding disposal site selection. The next section describes the process of locating disposal sites for industrial waste in Japan. Section 3 introduces the method used for estimation as well as the study’s empirical strategy. Section 4 explains the model specification and data, and Sect. 5 explains the results of the spatial concentration analysis of disposal sites and conflict. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes and discusses policy implications.",7

The role of policy design when cost development for key abatement technologies is uncertain,January 2017,Matthias Weitzel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"To avoid dangerous climate change, deep and costly cuts in CO\(_2\) emissions on a global scale are unavoidable. Cost for emission reductions is determined by the underlying demand factors such as population and economic growth and supply factors such as efficiency improvements (IPCC 2007). Since these underlying factors are not deterministic, therefore also the resulting emissions or costs of emission abatement are uncertain. An unanticipated shock to these demand or supply factors can move abatement costs away from their expected value. Macroeconomic shocks can affect the cost of reducing emissions to a given level. A lower growth rate leads to a lower aggregate demand for fossil fuels and thus less abatement effort to reach a certain emission level. The recent financial crisis can serve as an example of how an economic slowdown can also lead to a drop in CO\(_2\) emissions. In Europe, part of the decline in prices for CO\(_2\) can be explained by lower demand for fossil fuel (Ellerman et al. 2014). On the other hand, more rapid economic growth can accelerate emissions. Following China’s entry into the WTO and the subsequent export driven growth, emissions in China exceeded projections (Blanford et al. 2009). Another source for uncertainty of abatement costs lies in the uncertainty of technological advancement and thus the cost development of low carbon energy sources. The availability of cheap renewable energy options or carbon capture and storage (CCS) makes abatement more affordable. Many of the cost estimates and scenarios for possible future energy systems rely on assumptions of technological development in key technologies, which today still play only a minor role or are at their infancy. But, it is uncertain whether these technologies can live up to the expectations placed on them. Most prominently, various renewable energy technologies and CCS play a crucial role in many future low carbon scenarios. In general, economic costs estimates of future emission reductions are quite sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions on inclusion of key technologies like CCS or renewables, especially for scenarios aiming at very low emission levels. For example, economic costs for mitigation can be substantially higher when CCS is limited or not available (Edenhofer et al. 2010; Luderer et al. 2012; Kriegler et al. 2014). The (policy driven) fast expansion of renewables in Europe has also demonstrated that the availability of renewable energy can lead to lower carbon prices.Footnote 1 In this paper we focus on the effects of shocks to cost of key abatement technologies, more specifically their future cost. Shocks to key emission reduction technologies are unlikely to occur in single countries or regions, yet it is likely that technological shocks will have different impacts in different regions. For example, lower cost of solar energy has much less value for Russia than to the Middle East region. These examples of shocks obviously have a strong direct impact on the country where the respective technology has a competitive advantage, yet in today’s interconnected world shocks will also affect other countries indirectly. One important transmission channel is changes in international energy prices. A reduced demand for energy in response to a shock would lead to lower energy prices and thus affect exporters and importers of fossil fuels (see Sorrell and Dimitropoulos 2008 and Sorrell et al. 2009 for an overview on the rebound effect). With respect to this transmission channel, shocks to renewable energy and CCS are likely to be different because a positive shock to renewable energy will lower the demand for fossil fuel while this is not necessary the case for CCS (Kalkuhl et al. 2015). Important questions related to the nature of shocks therefore are: How do different types of technology shocks affects other countries? What are the different channels for transmission? What is the role of positive correlation between shocks in different countries? The different transmission mechanisms can be influenced by the instrument choice to regulate emissions. McKibbin et al. (2008) have demonstrated that unexpected macroeconomic shocks in one country always have some, yet different, feedback effects on other countries under price-based and quantity-based emission control policies, respectively. While a carbon tax as an instrument has no repercussion on interlinked emission trading schemes, it can still have considerable effects on other markets such as international fossil fuel markets. These feedback effects on the fossil fuel market are acknowledged in the literature (Böhringer and Rutherford 2002; Klepper and Peterson 2006; Peterson and Weitzel 2015). Lüken et al. (2011) decompose distributive effects due to differences in the availability of technologies into direct (domestic) impacts, impacts via international fossil fuel trade, and impacts via an international permit system. While it seems to be straightforward that countries would benefit from reduced abatement costs caused by lower costs for the deployment of renewable energy or CCS technologies, this might in fact depend on the policy instrument. It is even possible that under certain circumstances lower abatement cost curves can lead to higher total costs. Under a price-based system with a fixed carbon price, lower than expected abatement costs would translate into additional (costly) abatement effort. A negative effect could also happen under an emission trading scheme. Suppose that in an emission trading scheme a country is a net seller of permits. Then lower marginal abatement costs reduce the carbon price and hence the value of the permits it can sell—the overall effect of a seemingly positive shock could well turn out to be negative. Questions in the realm of policy design can thus be formulated as follows: How can the choice of policy instruments influence international transmission of a technology shock? Can policy design lead to additional cost as a result to lower abatement costs? How should this be taken into account when designing policies? These considerations are further developed with a simple theoretical model in Sect. 2. To better understand whether these results also apply in a more realistic setting, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to assess the impacts of a technology shock under different policy instruments in Sect. 3. This allows tackling questions like: do these theoretical arguments also carry over to a more complex model and what is the relative importance of the different channels? Sect. 4 finally discusses implications and concludes.",2

The research question is then the following: Are regulatory standards sufficient, or should subsidies as well be used in conservation? This article is motivated by the following experience. In the European Union (EU), the European Commission (EC) regulates the conservation of biodiversity by two directives (cf. Ostermann 1998): 
Birds Directive 79/409/EEC establishes a network of designated sites called Special Protection Areas (SPAS) for wild birds. 
Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC establishes a network of designated sites called Special Areas of Conservation (SACS) for the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. These two directives contain annexes where habitats and species are listed as being of Community interest. The NATURA 2000 network consist of both SPAS and SACS sites. A Member State is obliged to guarantee a “Favorable Conservation Status” to every NATURA 2000 site. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in the political structure of the EU. For instance, according to Weber and Christophersen (2002), the forest-owner associations (CEPF and BNFF) and the environmental NGOs (WWF and Fern) perform political influence on implementing the Habitats Directive. There has been three reasons for why EU policy has traditionally relied on direct regulation rather than on financial measures: Until 1987, EU environmental policy lacked a proper legal basis. It had to rely only on the “implied powers” of Article 235 of the 1957 Rome Treaty, which stipulated the use of directives (Ledoux et al. 2000). With the ratification of the 1999 Amsterdam Treaty, the EU could adopt eco-taxes and other fiscal measures only with the unanimous agreement of all states (Jordan 1998). This caused a threshold for ecological tax reforms and a continuing institutional inducement to rely on regulation. Because the founding Member States vested the EU only with a little financial resources, from the viewpoint of the Commission, regulation had the benefit of being paid for by private actors in the Member States rather than the EU itself (Majone 1996). Would it be useful to extend the authority of the Commission beyond direct regulation? There has been political pressure towards the co-financing of the regulatory sites through the budget of the Commission.  Swanson (1994), Barbier and Schulz (1997) and Endres and Radke (1999) consider the optimal area of a habitat when the variety of species yields utility, comparing the benefits of maintaining the habitat with those of using land in production. Barrett (1994), Swanson (1996), Sarr et al. (2008), Gatti et al. (2011) examine biodiversity management in a world where some countries (called the “South”) are highly endowed with biodiversity, while the others (called the “North”) are the primary location of the research and development industries relying upon these resources. In that case, the problem is how developing countries should be compensated for the “incremental costs” of biodiversity conservation. Because I focus on the case of the European Union (EU), I rather work with a model where every country is endowed with biodiversity that enhances welfare for the inhabitants of all countries. The problem is then how the common policy should be organized, given that the policy makers are potentially self-interested. 
Winands et al. (2013) consider how the heterogeneity of countries with respect to ecosystems and wealth influences the stability of international agreements on biodiversity conservation. They model a coalition formation game and obtain following results. In the absence of inter-country transfers, heterogeneity in ecosystems and wealth reduces the size of a stable coalition, but with optimal transfers, even large coalitions can be stable. In contrast to Winands et al. (2013), I consider the case where countries lobby the regulator that manages conservation, but where any individual country can refuse from conservation at a fixed cost. The problem is then to find out the optimal set of tools for the regulator. 
Palokangas (2013) examines biodiversity management by a self-interested regulator for a coalition of countries that perform R&D. He assumes in particular that the countries have the same production function, the same labor supply and the same natural resources. He shows that if the subsidies are financed by a distorting consumption tax, then the introduction of subsidies harms welfare. In this study, I examine a more relevant case where countries have different production functions, different labor supplies and different natural resources. To simplify the analysis, I assume non-distorting taxation and replace R&D by government input to production. In this setup, I show that the introduction of subsidies harms welfare, because it distorts the allocation of labor between the private and government sectors. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 specifies the structure of the model. Section 3 derives the Pareto optimum for the economy, as a point of reference. Section 4 considers the behavior of firms and local governments. Section 5 establishes the political equilibrium, by which the welfare considerations of environmental policy are examined in Sect. 6. The results are summarized in Sect. 7.",

19.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,21 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-016-0153-6,On the influence of environmental factors on harvest: the French Guiana shrimp fishery paradox,April 2017,Nicolas Sanz,Bassirou Diop,Luis Lampert,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Since the mid 1990s, environmental issues have become central in the public debate (Dunlap 1991). Nowadays, next to the CO2 emission limitation and the management of water and wastes, the question of the safety of biodiversity also represents a crucial issue. Among all the numerous species the French Guiana entails, the shrimp constitutes a good example of a species being exploited for economic purposes that has almost totally collapsed in recent years (Lampert 2011a).Footnote 1
 The French Guiana coast‘s proximity of the Amazon estuary results in the presence of a muddy corridor bounded by a red line (see Fig. 1). Two shrimp species are mainly exploited in the shrimp fisheries, the brown and the pink shrimps (respectively, Farfantepenaeus subtilis and Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis). The F. subtilis represents more than 85 % of shrimp landings. The other species, fished farther offshore and the eastern limit of their spatial distribution, represent the remainder. Currently, the number of employees is about 135, and essentially of foreign nationality (Guyana, Suriname, Brazil). The industry achieves a turnover amounting to € 6.52 millions and the weighted average price collected by the shrimp industry per kilogram thus € 6.91. The French Guiana shrimp fishery started in the late 1960s with the US fleet activity. All the boats are Florida-style shrimp trawlers, each using two trawls at the same time. Japanese boats also exploited shrimps, but the whole fleet became progressively French between 1970 and 1990. Over this period, the US–Japanese fleet increased up to 80 trawlers. Since 1992, the whole fleet is only composed of French trawlers targeting shrimps on the continental shell. The stock assessment has been first performed each 2 years by a working group within the institutional and international framework of the Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC) up to 1999, and has then been undertaken by the Ifremer (French institute of research for the exploitation of the sea) for management advice since the 1980s, allowing a strong knowledge of the population. The method used for assessment is the well-known “Virtual Population Analysis” (VPA), carried out on a monthly step basis which allows to obtain the recruit abundance as well as the spawning stock biomass and the fishing mortality. The Guianan–Brazil shrimping grounds One particular interest it presents is that its stock has steadily decreased over years though the effort, and harvest levels have followed quite the same trend. Yet, some management rules and instruments have been progressively implemented or reinforced after the creation of the Exclusive Economic Zone. The management of the fishery is in compliance with European legislation. A total allowable catch (TAC) of 4108 t/year (about  t/month) (for brown and pink shrimps has been adopted in 1983, of which 108 t/year can be caught by neighboring countries (Surinam, Trinidad, Barbade). Compared to the historical catch, the TAC level has never been fully achieved. This TAC level has not been changed until 2011, despite the decreasing trends in biomass and landings. In 1991, a license system has been introduced for both species. The main objective was initially to limit the number of boats to protect the shrimp resource. Licenses are provided without fees. The main objective was initially to limit the number of boats to protect the shrimp resource. However, the license system did not seem to be in fact an active or efficient resource management tool. Indeed, the year abundance of shrimp is mainly correlated with recruitment, but not with effort like, e.g., the number of boats or the number of days at sea. The number of licenses was slightly reduced from 69 in 1991 to 63 in 1999, and to 49 in 2010. During this period, the number of active shrimp trawlers was less than the number of licenses (less than half in 2006). The license system could have been a tool to adjust the number of boats to improve the economic results, but this objective was not explicitly addressed by the management system. Finally, there exist also some spatial restrictions: to limit the impact of trawling on juvenile shrimps and avoid conflicts with the inshore small-scale fishery, trawling is forbidden in inshore waters less than 30 m depth. This rule is more restrictive than the spatial limitation applied to trawlers in European waters. All in all, the economic dynamics of the fishery has been characterized by a diminution of the fleet size, to concentrate the fishing activities on a reduced number of profitable vessels. In addition, it will be noted that the profitability has declined in this sector due to aquaculture growing globally. This results in lower prices for shrimp. Nevertheless, despite this low effort level, the whole shrimp stock has strongly decreased between 1990 and 2009, which seems to constitute a paradox. Newfoundland has been closed and most other major stocks have been heavily overexploited despite extensive and intensive management efforts (Healey and Hennessey 1998). Regulation may be incompatible or inadequate with the goal of making some fishery sustainable. This suggests that other factors, like environmental shocks, could explain the above statement. The French Guiana sea fishing area may be indeed affected by, e.g., the large Guianan rivers and some climatic phenomena like ‘El Niño’ and ‘La Niña’. The temperature, which can be considered as a general proxy of global climatic changes, may also play an important role here. Hence, a more efficient management of this fishery would consist in a bio-economic approach accounting for the environmental trends and the economic context, in accordance with the new framework of the ecosystem-based fisheries management. The knowledge of the present biogeographical limits is thought to make it possible to indentify sensitive species (Hart and Reynolds 2002). Climate mapping is currently used to predict the future distributions of species. Actually, bioclimatic models are used to assess potential changes in species distributions and to identify those species that may be most vulnerable to climate change. Ishimura et al. (2013) studied a three-agent game-theoretic bioeconomic model of the Pacific sardine stock’s abundance and biomass distribution that accounts for decadal-scale climate change. These models attempt to match the current distribution of a species with a number of climatic variables, producing an envelope that describes the climate within a species current range. Then, potential changes in distribution under various climate scenarios are estimated with the parameters of the envelope (Mooney 1991; Rogers and Randolph 1993; Huntley 1994; Mack 1996; Beaumont and Hughes 2002). This method is based on the assumption that range and abundance are determined first and foremost by the physiological tolerances of individual organisms. Physiological tolerance can be defined as following. The species are adapted to a given range of environmental conditions defining an envelope, with an optimal environmental window, around the mean value of the range. Hence, species abundance may follow some Gaussian distribution within its envelope such as abundance declines toward the edges of the species range (Hengeveld and Haeck 1982; Brown et al. 1996; Maurer 1999). Moreover because physiological tolerances limits are reached on these edges, species abundance may show more rapid responses to small shifts in climate than near the midpoint of the range (Gaston 1990; Lawton 2000). In local communities, the mean abundance and temporal variability may then depend on the range position. The purpose of this paper is thus in a first step to investigate the effects of some environmental phenomena on the working of the French Guiana shrimp fishery under a statistical viewpoint. To do so, we propose an empirical analysis of a harvest production function where output depends on an effort variable (the number of days at sea) and the stock level. Besides, we introduce additional pure environmental variables to correct a specific simultaneous bias problem, which in turn enables to highlight the role that these variables play in improving the explanatory power of the model. We have chosen some variables of which data were available: the Niño and Niña phenomena, the sea surface temperature, and the flow of the Amazon, Aprouague, Comte, Maroni, and Oyapock rivers. The output elasticities with respect to the usual and environmental inputs are then analyzed in detail. The paper is organized as follows. The second section introduces methods with variables’ description and production functional form. The third section summarizes the main results and discussion. The last section entails some concluding remarks.",10

Dhamija,Surendra S. Yadav,PK Jain,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The EU ETS (Dhamija et al. 2015) draws on the US sulfur dioxide trading system for much of its inspiration, but relies much more heavily on decentralized decision (Kruger et al. 2007; Meyer 2000) making for the allocation of emission allowances and for the monitoring and management of sources. Since 2005, the EU ETS has operated independently from the Kyoto Protocol, but it has been linked to International Emissions Trading (IET) in 2008. In this framework, the ’Linking Directive’ provides the recognition of Kyoto project credits from 2008 for compliance use within the EU ETS. The CITL has been connected to ITL since October 16, 2008. To further provide flexibility to the Kyoto Protocol several other mechanisms have been introduced: (1) the exchange of allocated quotas between countries, which constitutes the tradable credits market itself, (2) the gain and exchange of extra credits for abatement projects conducted in (a) Joint Implementation (JI) in developed countries and (b) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in developing countries and (3) the possibility to bank unused permits during 2008–2012 for future utilization in forthcoming years. One allowance exchanged on the EU ETS corresponds to one ton of \({\hbox{CO}}_2\) released in the atmosphere and is called an European Union Allowance (EUA). 2.2 billion allowances per year during phase I (2005–2007) and 2.08 billion allowances per year during phase II (2008–2012) have been distributed. With a current value of around 8.5 Euro per allowance, the launch of the EU ETS thus corresponds to a net creation of wealth of around 17 billion Euro per year. When phase II started in January 2008, the European Commission had confirmed its functioning until 2020. Power generation contributes to more than 50 % of emission reductions in the EU ETS (Alberola et al. 2008). Electricity generation from coal is cheaper than from natural gas, but coal is nearly twice as carbon-intensive as gas. So there should be intricate relationship between fuel switching and the carbon price. The EU-wide cap is set at 2.04 billion tonnes of \({\hbox{CO}}_2\) in 2013 and will reduce by 1.74 % each year, delivering an overall reduction of 21 % below 2005 levels by 2020. For the power sector, allowances are primarily auctioned meaning that the majority of allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System will not be allocated for free. Sectors that are considered to be at risk of carbon leakage will receive 100 % of their allowances for free. Sectors that are not considered at risk of carbon leakage will receive 80 % of their allocation for free in 2013, declining annually to 30 % in 2020 and 0 % (i.e. full auctioning) in 2027. The scheme has been expanded in phase III (Dhamija et al. 2015) to include petrochemicals, ammonia and aluminum sectors; nitrous oxide emissions from acid production; and PFC emissions from the aluminum sector. Aviation emissions were also included in 2012, both for flights within Europe and those flying in and out of Europe. The European Commission is currently assessing the need for additional rules to prevent market abuse. The EU ETS has indeed been plagued by fraud cases in the area of value-added tax and registry phishing. However, interference with the market price through market manipulation or insider dealing has so far not been detected. One of the reasons for this could be the good degree of a liquidity that the system has achieved through allowing intermediaries and financial firms to participate in the trading of emission allowances from the very outset. The EU ETS covers carbon intensive installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 20MW across 30 countries (European Union’s 27 Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and 41 % of the EU’s \(\hbox{CO}_2\) emissions. As per the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has set its emissions reduction targets to 8 % by 2012 compared to 1990 levels. This goal has been converted into further emissions reduction sub goals at the levels of EU Member-States, which is termed as ’Burden Sharing Agreements’. The EU ETS is a compliance market in which each installation of the approximately 12,000 covered installations needs to surrender each year a number of allowances equal to its verified emissions and this number is fixed (Alberola et al. 2009) by each member state in its National Allocation Plan (NAP). The EU ETS includes power and heat generation sector, combustion plants, oil refineries, coke ovens, iron and steel plants and factories making cement, glass, lime, bricks, ceramics. The EU ETS is set up to proceed in three phases. The pilot phase (phase I) went from 2005 to 2007, and is usually termed as a ’warm-up’ period prior to the full-fledged introduction of the Kyoto Protocol. This has succeeded in attaching a price to carbon and changing the culture of corporations in a very short time. The impact of carbon came on the board room agenda and built into company strategies. Second, a reliable monitoring, reporting and verification system, which is the backbone of any functioning ETS, is now in place. Third, management systems have been set up and operational experience has been gained. Fourth, the EU ETS has been instrumental in spurring the development of CDM projects, which generate Certified Emission Reductions (CER). Phase 1 was a test phase and not conceived to result in major emission cuts. Yet, around 200 million tonnes of \(\hbox{CO}_2\) or 3 % of total verified emissions were abated due to the ETS at very low transaction costs. The phase I suffered from the problem of “over-allocation,” which ultimately led to the price volatility and low first period price. As a response, inter-phase banking of allowances was introduced from 2008, when phase 2 started, and allocation plans were tightened. Phase II went on from 2008 to 2012, alongside with Kyoto Protocol (the UN policy framework till date), and the third phase from 2013 onwards aims to reduce emissions by 20 % by 2020 (along with increasing energy efficiency by 20 % and increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix to 20 %, hence the ’20-20-20’ target). The three main characteristics (Dhamija et al. 2015) of the EU ETS are The allocation is (mostly) free during phases I and II according to some preexisting benchmark of emissions (i.e. ’grandfathering’) and phase III constitutes a radical shift to auctionable allowances. The EU ETS sets up National Allocation Plans (NAPs) and takes care of its functioning, accounting etc. EU Commission administers Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which oversees and rationalizes national registries (accounting bodies of the member states for allocations) and has been connected to the Kyoto Protocol’s International Transaction Log (ITL). The ambit of EU ETS is gradually widening with the inclusion of additional sectors such as petro-chemicals and aviation in 2012–2013. The scheme has been expanded in phase III (Dhamija et al. 2015) to include petrochemicals, ammonia, and aluminum sectors; nitrous oxide emissions from acid production; and PFC emissions from the aluminum sector. Aviation emissions were also included in 2012, both for flights within Europe and those flying in and out of Europe. The European Commission is currently assessing the need for additional rules to prevent market abuse. The EU ETS has indeed been plagued by fraud cases in the area of value-added tax and registry phishing. However, interference with the market price through market manipulation or insider dealing has so far not been detected. One of the reasons for this could be the good degree of a liquidity that the system has achieved through allowing intermediaries and financial firms to participate in the trading of emission allowances from the very outset. Pressure is also increasing on the EU to raise its emission reduction ambitions as companies have banked a large amount of surplus emission allowances into phase III. The Commission has made a study that moving to a higher target is economically feasible but companies warn of consequences for their international competitiveness if other major economies do not move along. In case other developed countries committed themselves to comparable emission reduction targets, the EU would revise some of those rules, in particular with respect to free allocation/carbon leakage and consider the adoption of a higher reduction target. This could also involve a loosening of limits for the use of international emission credits. Phase IV is being envisaged to commence on 1 January 2021 and finish on 31 December 2028. On 22 January 2014, the European Commission proposed two structural reform amendments to the ETS directive (2003/87/EC) of the 2008 Climate Package: The linear reduction factor, at which the overall emissions cap is reduced, from 1.74 % (2013–2020) to 2.2 % each year from 2021 to 2030 thus reducing 43 % of EU \(\hbox{CO}_2\) emissions in the ETS sector as compared to 2005. The creation of a 12 % “automatic set-aside” reserve mechanism of verified annual emissions (at least a 100 million \(\hbox{CO}_2\) permit reserve) in the fourth ETS period from 2021 to 2030, thus creating a quasi-carbon tax or carbon price floor with a price range set each year by the European Commission’s Directorate General for Climate Change. On 24 October 2014, at the meeting of the European Council, the Heads of Governments of EU Member States approved the “Market Stability Reserve (MSR)”, which would change the amount of annually auctioned \(\hbox{CO}_2\) permits based on the amount of \(\hbox{CO}_2\) permits in circulation. This would address imbalances in supply and demand in the European carbon market by adjusting volumes for auction. The European Parliament and the European council are said to have reached an agreement in September, 2015, which sets the starting date of the MSR to 2019, puts the 900 million backloaded allowances in the reserve and reduces the reaction time of the MSR to 1 year. BlueNext (formerly Powernext Carbon) is the market place dedicated to \(\hbox{CO}_2\) allowances based in Paris. Likewise, European Climate Exchange (ECX) is the market place based in London for future and options trading. NordPool, which represents the market place common to Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and is based in Oslo; the European Energy Exchange (EEX), based in Leipzig, trading spot and derivatives products for emissions allowances rights; and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), based in the US, which is also trading European futures and options emissions rights. The price of products exchanged on these market places are strongly correlated, which is also a feature of stock markets. The futures contract is a deliverable contract where each member with a position open at cessation of trading for a contract month is obliged to make or take delivery of emission allowances to or from national registries. The unit of trading is one lot of 1000 emission allowances. Each emission allowance represents an entitlement to emit one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent gas. Market participants may purchase consecutive contract months from December 2008 to December 2020. Spreads between two futures contracts may also be traded. Delivery occurs by mid-month of the expiration contract date. Based on demand and supply fundamentals, following factors have been identified by Christiansen et al. (2005), Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) and Alberola et al. (2008) as the price determinants in the EU ETS: policy and regulatory issues; market fundamentals, including the emissions-to-cap ratio, the fuel-switching, weather and production levels. Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) and Alberola et al. (2008) were the first to analyze econometrically the relations between energy markets and the \(\hbox{CO}_2\) price. Based on phase I spot and futures data, the former group of authors establish that carbon prices in the EU ETS are linked to fossil fuel (e.g., oil, gas, coal) use. By using an extended dataset, the latter group of authors emphasizes that the nature of this relationship between energy and carbon prices (Dhamija et al. 2015) varies depending on the period under consideration and the major influence of institutional events. In addition, Keppler and Mansanet-Bataller (2010) have studied the causal relationship between \(\hbox{CO}_2\) allowance and electricity variables (such as clean dark, clean spark spreads and the switching price) during the first phases of the EU ETS. Benz and Trnck (2009) have used the GARCH models for the price dynamics for \(\hbox{CO}_2\) emission allowances. The price of \(\hbox{CO}_2\) allowances under the EU ETS is strongly influenced by institutional decisions. The EU ETS has been created by the Directive 2003/87/EC, which stipulates that the EU Commission and specifically the Director General for Climate Action (DG CLIMA) can intervene to amend the functioning of this environmental market scheme. As in any other market, the participants fully react to news arrival, any policy intervention from the regulator in EU ETS has an immediate and ultimate impact on the carbon price (Mansanet-Bataller and Pardo 2009; Daskalakis and Markellos 2009; Conrad et al. 2012). The influence of institutional decisions can be captured using dummy variables. 
Managi et al. (2013) find a positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy prices after structural breaks, suggesting a movement from conventional energy to clean energy. Chevallier (2012) analyzes in detail the relationship between three energy variables (crude oil, coal and Natural gas) and the EUA returns and finds that all these energy variables are significant predictors of EUA returns. Power producers may benefit by switching from coal to gas depending on the price of the carbon price to minimize the electricity production cost by changing the share of coal and gas in their electricity mix. Switching enables them to reduce their emissions at low cost. Depending on relative marginal abatement costs, it may be cheaper to switch for a less carbon-intensive fuel like gas instead of using coal and buying permits. 
Clean dark spread (expressed in Euro/MWh) is the difference between the price of electricity at peak hours (\(\hbox{elec}_t\)) and the price of coal (\(\hbox{coal}_t\)) used to generate that electricity, corrected for the efficiency of the coal plant and the costs of \(\hbox{CO}_2\) (\(\hbox{eua}_t\)): where \(\rho _{\rm coal}\) is the net thermal efficiency of a coal-fired plant (i.e. 35 % according to Reuters), and \(\hbox{EF}_{\rm coal}\) is the \(\hbox{CO}_2\) emissions factor of a conventional coal-fired power plant (i.e. 0.95 \(\hbox{tCO}_2\)/MWh according to Reuters). 
Clean spark spread (expressed in Euro/MWh) represents the difference between the price of electricity at peak hours (\({\hbox{elec}}_t\)) and the price of natural gas (\({\hbox{gas}}_t\)) used to generate that electricity, corrected for the efficiency of the natural gas plant and the costs of \(\hbox{CO}_2\) (\(\hbox{eua}_t\)): where \(\rho _{\rm gas}\) is the net thermal efficiency of a natural-gas-fired plant (i.e. 49 % according to Reuters), and \(\hbox{EF}_{\rm coal}\) is the \(\hbox{CO}_2\) emissions factor of a conventional natural gas fired power plant (i.e. 0.41 \(\hbox{tCO}_2\)/MWh according to Reuters). 
Switching price (switch, expressed in Euro/MWh) represents the representative price at which both Clean Dark and Clean Spark spreads become equal: As long as the carbon price is below this switching price, coal plants are more profitable than gas plants, even after taking carbon costs into account. Chevallier (2012) analyzes the relationship between CDS, CSS and SP and the EUA returns and finds that CDS, CSS and SP are significant predictors of EUA return series. Cold and hot temperatures, constituting the most important dimension of weather (Roll 1984), also impact the carbon price because they change the energy demand (Dhamija et al. 2015). For example, cold winters entail increased use of heating, and thus extra need for power generation. On the other hand, hot summers entail extra need for air conditioning, which also increases the need for power generation. More power production will be achieved by more fuel use and hence more \(\hbox{CO}_2\) emissions. This increases demand for \(\hbox{CO}_2\) allowances, which in turn increases its price. So, a broad European temperatures index can be treated as an appropriate carbon price driver. Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models are expressly designed to model and forecast conditional variances. The model has the two important properties: First, “Auto regression”, i.e which uses previous estimates of volatility to calculate future values and second, “Heteroscedasticity”, i.e. the probability distributions of the volatility varies with the current value (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011). While ARIMA models deal with serial correlation pertaining to error terms, ARCH models deal with the fact that variance of prediction errors is not a constant but differs from period to period. During the 1980s, Engle (2003) worked on improving time-series analysis. Statistical techniques then in use mostly treated volatile variables, such as stock prices, as constants, even though such variables can change significantly from day to day and week to week. Engle (2003) after observing the variance of stock returns, developed a statistical technique known as ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity), which uses previously observed patterns of variance to predict future volatility. The theoretical framework described in this section is adopted from Tsay (2005) A univariate stochastic process Y is said to be homoscedastic if the standard deviations of terms are constant for all times t. Otherwise, it is said to be heteroscedastic (see Fig. 1 adopted from http://www.riskglossary.com). Homoscedastic vs. heteroscedastic A process is unconditionally heteroscedastic (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011) if unconditional standard deviations \(\sigma _t\) are not constant. It is conditionally heteroscedastic if conditional standard deviations \(\sigma _{t|t-1}\) are not constant. For example, stock or bond returns tend to be conditionally heteroscedastic. These prices exhibit non-constant volatility, but periods of low or high volatility are generally not known in advance. New Delhi electricity prices, on the other hand, exhibit unconditional heteroscedasticity. The prices tend to have higher volatilities during the summer than during other seasons. If a process is unconditionally heteroscedastic, then it is necessarily conditionally heteroscedastic. The converse is not true. All these notions extend to higher dimensions. A multivariate stochastic process Y is said to be homoscedastic if its covariance matrix is constant for all times t, etc. Let \(r_{t}\) be the log return of an asset at time index t. In the volatility study \({r_{t}}\) is either taken as serially uncorrelated or with minor lower order serial correlations (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011), but it is a dependent series. The conditional mean and variance of \(r_{t}\), given the information set available at time \(t-1\) as \(I_{t-1}\), are specified as Since serial dependence of \(r_{t}\) is weak, we can say that \(r_{t}\) follows a simple time series model like stationary ARMA(p, q) model. The model becomes where p,  and q are non-negative integers and \(e_{t}\) are innovations or error terms, \(e_t \sim N(0,\sigma _t^2)\). This is the mean equation for \(r_{t}\). The order (p, q) of an ARMA model may depend on the frequency of the return series. The variance can be specified as The major assumption behind the least square regression is homoscedasticity, i.e. constancy of variance. If this condition is violated, the estimates will still be unbiased but they will not be minimum variance estimates. The standard error and confidence intervals calculated in this case become too narrow, giving a false sense of precision. ARCH and related models handle this by modeling volatility itself in the model and thereby correcting the deficiencies of least squares model. The ARCH models (Engle 1982; Tsay 2005), characterized by mean and volatility equations, are specified as where \(\epsilon _{t}\) denotes the error term and T is the sample size. This is called ARCH(p) model. The next step is to check the ARCH effects by using residuals of mean equation. We can apply the usual Ljung-Box statistics Q(p) to the \(\{ e^2_t \}\) series (McLeod and Li 1983) or apply the white’s test of significance of \(\alpha _i = 0 (i = 1,\ldots ,p)\) by F-statistic under the null hypothesis \(\hbox{Ho}: \alpha _1 =\cdots = \alpha _p= 0\). This F-statistic is distributed as \(\chi ^2\) distribution. If ARCH effects are found significant we can use the PACF of \(e^2_t\) to determine the ARCH order. After specifying the volatility model we perform the joint estimation of the mean and volatility models. Last, we evaluate the fitted model and further refine it. The standardized residuals, \(\tilde{e_t} = \frac{e_t}{\sigma _t}\), can be seen to check the adequacy of a fitted ARCH model. We can evaluate the QQ plots of \(\tilde{e_t}\) and \({\tilde{e_t}}^2\) to check validity of mean and variance equations, respectively. After finding the parameters of the model, prediction can be done. Bollerslev proposed a useful extension, known as the generalized ARCH (GARCH) model. The \(e_t\) follows a GARCH(p, q) model (Bollerslev 1986; Tsay 2005) if In addition to ARCH conditions, we also have \(\beta _j \ge 0\), and \(\sum _{i=1}^{\hbox{max}(p,q)} (\alpha _i + \beta _i) < 1\). The constraint on \(\alpha _i + \beta _i\) implies that the unconditional variance of \(e_t\) is finite, whereas its conditional variance \(\sigma ^2_t\) evolves over time. The \(\alpha _i\) and \(\beta _j\) are ARCH and GARCH parameters, respectively. Similar to ARCH models, GARCH models also observe volatility clustering, leverage effect and heavier tails (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011). Specifying the order of a GARCH model is not easy and only lower order GARCH models are used in most applications. IGARCH models are unit-root GARCH models. An IGARCH(p, q) model (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011) can be written as where additional constraints are \(\sum _{i=1}^p \alpha _i + \sum _{j=1}^q \beta _j = 1\) and \(1 > \beta _j > 0\). Often the return of a security may depend on its volatility. In these cases, we use GARCH-M or GARCH in mean model (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011). A GARCH(p, q)-M model can be specified as The constant parameter k is called the risk premium parameter. An EGARCH model is specified as For \(e_t \sim N(0,\sigma ^2_t)\) the standardized variable \(\frac{e_{t}}{{\sigma }_{t}}\) follows a standard normal distribution and consequently \(E(\frac{|e_{t}|}{{\sigma }_{t}}) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi }}\). The parameters \(\alpha _i\) capture the leverage effect. For good news (\(\frac{e_{t-i}}{{\sigma }_{t-i}} > 0\)) the impact of innovation \(e_{t-i}\) is \((\alpha _i + \gamma _i)\frac{e_{t-i}}{{\sigma }_{t-i}}\) and for bad news (\(\frac{e_{t-i}}{{\sigma }_{t-i}} < 0\)) it is \((-\alpha _i + \gamma _i)\frac{e_{t-i}}{{\sigma }_{t-i}}\). If \(\alpha _i\) becomes 0, \(\ln (\sigma ^2_t)\) responds symmetrically to \(\frac{e_{t-i}}{{\sigma }_{t-i}}\). To produce a leverage effect \(\alpha _i\) must be negative. The fact that the EGARCH process is specified in terms of log-volatility (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011) implies that \(\sigma ^2_t\) is always positive and, consequently, there are no restrictions on the sign of the model parameters. The \(\alpha\) parameter represents a magnitude effect or the symmetric effect of the model, the “GARCH” effect. \(\beta\) measures the persistence in conditional volatility irrespective of anything happening in the market. When \(\beta\) is relatively large, then volatility takes a long time to die out following a crisis in the market. The \(\gamma\) parameter measures the asymmetry or the leverage effect, the parameter of importance, so that the EGARCH model allows for testing of asymmetries. If \(\gamma = 0\) , then the model is symmetric. When \(\gamma < 0\) , then positive shocks (good news) generate less volatility than negative shocks (bad news). When \(\gamma < 0\), it implies that positive innovations are more destabilizing than negative innovations. A TGARCH(p, q) model as proposed by Glosten et al. (1993) can also handle leverage affects model (Dhamija and Bhalla 2011) by assuming the following form: where and \(\alpha _i, \gamma _i\), and \(\beta _j\) are non-negative parameters satisfying conditions similar to those of GARCH models. It can be seen that a positive \(e_{t-i}\) contributes \(\alpha _i e^2_{t-i}\) to \(\sigma ^2_t\), whereas a negative \(e_{t-i}\) has a larger impact \((\alpha _i + \gamma _i) e^2_{t-i}\) with \(\gamma _i > 0\). 
Managi et al. (2012) reveal that conventional indexes do not outperform Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) indexes and investors are able to pursue environmental and social goals without a significant sacrifice in terms of risk and return combinations. The authors further find that financial markets do acknowledge environmental information, and the environmentally friendly firms outperform those that are not. Konar and Cohen (2001) find that bad environmental performance is negatively correlated with the intangible asset value of firms. Therefore, it is imperative for the companies to model and assess the risk and returns associated with the carbon prices vis-a-vis the carbon abatement policies. Kumar et al. (2012) find that rising oil price encourages substitution towards alternate energy sources from the conventional energy source. The authors also find that carbon price return is not currently a significant factor for stocks of clean energy firms. This might be because the carbon price has been lower and is not able to create inducement for substitution from conventional fossil fuels to clean low carbon technologies. The reasons for this can be related to imbalances in the market like over-allocation and supply surplus, etc. It is hoped that the new initiatives like MSR, etc. would address imbalances in supply and demand in the European carbon market by adjusting volumes for auction. Consequently, the carbon price returns might become a strong determinant for stocks of clean energy firms. It is hoped that rising prices of conventional energy and pricing the carbon emissions would encourage investments in clean energy firms. 
Benz and Trnck (2009) and Paolella and Taschini (2008) show that carbon prices may be adequately modeled by the class of GARCH(p, q) models. If we choose to fit an ARMA model first and then fit a GARCH model on the ARMA residuals, the ARMA estimates will generally be inconsistent. (In a special case where there are only AR terms and no MA terms, the estimates will be consistent but inefficient). This will also contaminate the GARCH estimates. In the first stage of ARIMA estimation there is an effective assumption of conditional homoscedasticity. It is contradicted in the second stage when we explicitly model conditional heteroscedasticity using a GARCH model. Two-stage estimation can only be done if one can consistently estimate the conditional mean model in the presence of conditionally heteroscedastic errors. First, the conditional mean model is estimated, ignoring that the errors have a GARCH structure. Second, a GARCH model on the residuals from the conditional mean model is estimated. Then the conditional mean model is re-estimated using the fitted conditional variances to weight the data points. That could be done iteratively until convergence. However, this will not be as efficient as estimating an ARMA-GARCH model in one stage. The studies experimenting with volatility of EUA returns so far analyze some subset of the EUA data set and do not take multicollinearities between variables into account. This may bias the standard errors of the estimated parameters. The current study expressly addressees this issue and extends the existing literature by comprehensively analyzing the data from all three phases of EU ETS and also the Rolled Over series. The concatenated series (i.e. EUA Rolled Over Series) analysis, in addition to the separate phase analysis, can tell us about the stability of volatility estimation. The current study inspects the correlations between variables and adopts principal component analysis to avoid multicollinearities between variables. Dhamija et al. (2015) use European Climate Exchange (ECX) Dec 2007, Dec 2012, Dec 2015 expiry and the rolled over Dec 2015 expiry future contracts of European Union Allowance (EUA) as predicted variables and National Allocation Plan (NAP) Announcements, energy variables (brent oil, coal, and natural gas), averaged extreme Europe temperature and German Stock Exchange (DAX) index (an indicator of economic activity) as predictor variables. The study uses ARIMA Errors Modeling and establishes MA1, MA11, MA13 and brent as significant predictors for EUA phase I; AR1, AR6, AR7, AR18, RC1, brent and dax as significant predictors for EUA phase II; AR2, AR4, AR13, AR17, MA11, MA12, MA23, RC2, brent, coal and dax as significant predictors for EUA phase III and AR1, AR2, AR4, AR6, AR13, AR17, MA12, MA17, RC2, brent, coal, dax and temphot as significant predictors for EUA Rolled Over Series. 
Dhamija et al. (2015) show that although ACF and PACF of residuals have no significant lags, the time series plot of residuals and squared residuals show some clusters of volatility. ARIMA used by them is a method to linearly model the data and the forecast width remains constant because the model does not reflect recent changes or incorporate new information. In other words, it provides best linear forecast for the series and thus plays little role in forecasting model nonlinearly. Therefore, to update the model, users need to incorporate new data and estimate parameters again. The variance in ARIMA model is unconditional variance and remains constant. In order to model volatility, ARCH/GARCH method comes into play. If there are clusters of volatility in squared residuals, ARCH/GARCH is a method to measure volatility of the series, or more specifically, to model the noise term of ARIMA model. ARCH/GARCH incorporates new information and analyzes the series based on conditional variances where users can forecast future values with up-to-date information. The composite ARIMA-GARCH model, which does not assume the constant volatility should outperform the ARIMA model which assumes the constant volatility of residuals. Sparks and Yurova (2005) conclusively establish this in their empirical research of 31 large company stocks wherein they take daily log returns computed for a 10-year time period. We now extend and explore further the work of Dhamija et al. (2015) by jointly estimating the ARIMA-GARCH models for forecasting both the conditional returns and the conditional volatilities simultaneously. We experiment with various GARCH variants to arrive at the best forecasting model. This study uses the same EUA data as used by Dhamija et al. (2015) for forecasting conditional returns, i.e. EUA data from 22 April 2005 (launch date of EU ETS) till 30 June 2015. Functions ugarchspec and ugarchfit in package rugarch (Ghalanos 2014) allow specifying and estimating ARMA-GARCH models simultaneously for a variety of GARCH model variants. Different GARCH models thus obtained are compared using various performance metrics like mean square errors (MSE), log likelihood and information criteria (e.g., AIC or BIC). Final selected best model is expected to have different orders from the study of Dhamija et al. (2015), where they forecast using ARIMA only and hance assuming the constant volatility.",17

The accumulated resources associated with buildings and infrastructure construction (the stocks of accumulated iron products, concrete, timber, and so on), however, differ substantially over cities (Tanikawa et al. 2015). In Japan, particularly, since World War II, vast quantities of roadways and urban structures have been built, resulting in a massive accumulation of resources in cities (Tanikawa et al. 2015). It is unclear, though how efficiently this accumulated investment of resources has been utilized. Fifty years ago, Wolman (1965) described cities as organisms that have a metabolism: materials and energy are fed into cities and waste matter is discharged from them. Based on the analysis framework of Wolman (1965), the field of research into the metabolism of cities has since been developed further. A seminal study is Fischer-Kowalski (1998), which considers the metabolism of cities from many different perspectives, such as those of biology, ecology, social theory, cultural anthropology, and social geography, and points out the importance of analyzing the flow of materials and energy in a socioeconomic system. Inspired in part by these prior studies, a variety of studies in recent years have analyzed the flows of energy, water, resources, and waste matter in a socioeconomic system (e.g., Haberl 2001; Duchin and Levine 2013; Ding and Xiao 2014; Mogheir and AlTatari 2014). In addition to these flow analyses, dynamic studies that consider the accumulation of materials in a city are also very important for analyzing the metabolism of cities. An example of a study aimed at estimating the stock of resources accumulated in a society is Hashimoto et al. (2007). They found that the estimated quantity of building waste in 2000 greatly exceeded the actual stock of building waste, and this gap was designated as “missing stock”. Tanikawa and Hashimoto (2009) applied a spatiotemporal model, specifically, a four-dimensional geographic information system (4D GIS) model, to the central parts of Wakayama City in Japan and the city of Manchester in England. Zheng et al. (2012) estimated the accumulated resources of 31 provinces in China between 1978 and 2008 in the form of residential buildings, roadways, and railways based on a material stock computation, and showed that China’s resource stock increased from 3.2 billion tonnes in 1978 to 39.6 billion tonnes in 2008. Furthermore, Tanikawa et al. (2015) used GIS data and prefectural-level data to construct long-term time-series data on the stock of accumulated resources in Japan resulting from the construction of buildings and infrastructure (roadways, railways, airports, dams, sewerage systems, and sea ports). A number of other studies attempting to estimate the stock of accumulated resources in a society have also been performed around the world in the recent years (e.g., Matthews et al. 2000; Müller 2006; Müller et al. 2011; Pauliuk et al. 2014). The sources of the change in material stock have been examined by various approaches. Fishman et al. (2015), for example, performed a factor decomposition analysis relating to the accumulation of buildings and infrastructure and Schandl and Schulz (2002) analyzed the change in the relationship between metabolism and land utilization in English cities since 1850 using regression analysis. Although these two studies found that population and land utilization are important factors for material stock accumulation of cities, they did not reveal how those factor inputs (i.e., labor and capital) have been efficiently used for production activities in cities. In addition to material stock, it is also important to quantitatively analyze production efficiency, to assess the sustainability of a city’s metabolism. Related studies analyzing the efficiency of a city’s metabolism are as follows. Browne et al. (2009) estimated the ratio of waste discharge to product consumption (waste discharge/product consumption) in the Irish city of Limerick, and Zhang et al. (2013) estimated the ratio of waste displacement to resource displacement (waste displacement/resource displacement) within an area of the city of Beijing, China. West and Schandl (2013) analyzed changes in the quantity of material input per unit of production between 1970 and 2008 in Latin America and the Caribbean countries and demonstrated that the efficiency of production declined over this period. Although, as shown above, the efficiency of a city’s metabolism has been analyzed, most of these studies did not show, which city has used factor inputs efficiently or inefficiently. Managi (2003) applied a data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique to the problem of analyzing the efficiency of production resulting from the social and private capital stock and human capital of Japanese prefectures from 1955 to 1995, showing that the productivity resulting from these factor inputs increased substantially during the Japan’s postwar ‘high growth’ period from 1955 to 1975. This analysis uses the data of the social and private capital stock in monetary terms. To assess the efficiency of a city’s metabolism more straightforwardly, however, both private and social capital stock in physical terms have to be considered in the DEA framework. This study employs a DEA framework using long-term panel data of the physical stocks of buildings and infrastructure (roadways and railways), labor force, and gross output of 46 Japanese prefectures during the period of 1970 to 2010. This study analyzes the change in the efficiency of production resulting from the labor force and stock accumulation in Japan’s prefectures for the study period to evaluate how this efficiency has changed over the years. Also, by identifying prefectures where production efficiency has increased or decreased, the study explores possible ways of improving production efficiency in relation to the stock of resources in Japan. This study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology. Section 3 describes the data and results. Finally, Sect. 4 gives concluding remarks.",2

One recent UN-backed study estimated the monetary value of the global environmental damage caused by human activity in 2008 at $6.6 trillion (equivalent to 11 % of global GDP), attributing $2.15 trillion to the top 3000 public companies alone.Footnote 1 In the search for the potential causes of this harm, it is often argued that environmental policy suffers from a serious underdeterrence problem (e.g., Faure 2009). The recent policy initiatives by the European Commission that proposes the intensified criminalization of offences against the environment are, thus, logical and widely embraced responses to this crisis. The ratification of EU directive 2008/99/EC introduced a general policy criminalizing environmental offences in the European Union. The rationale for this development is that criminal prosecution provides access to the full sanctioning regime of criminal law, in contrast to standard regulatory procedures. This access may be beneficial by the application of the classic economic theory of deterrence: Increasing the level of the expected sanction for harmful activities reduces their attractiveness, thereby reducing the level of harm (Goeschl and Jürgens 2014). This paper analyzes policy initiatives that introduce harsher sanctions for creating environmental hazards, exploring the associated welfare repercussions in a setting with imperfect product market competition and free entry into the industry. The consideration of a market setting is warranted, because corporations are the predominant actors in the context of offences against the environment (e.g., Faure 2009). More specifically, we study market outcomes for an industry, in which firms are engaged in Cournot competition and are subject to a design standard—that is, a prescription regarding the production technology employed by the firm. Despite the fact that much of the environmental economics literature focuses on emission taxes and tradeable permits, the real-world regulation of environmental risk continues to be dominated by the use of standards (Endres 2011; Hueth and Melkonyan 2009). In many industries and for many products, environmental standards in the form of performance and design standards are applied as the main policy instrument. Performance standards directly control pollution by regulating its total allowable level (e.g., by imposing a cap for emissions). In contrast, design standards, the focus of this paper, demand the fulfillment of specific technological requirements (such as the use of at least a minimum level of emission-control inputs) without defining a maximum allowable level of pollution. A prominent example of a design standard is the European Union council directive 96/61/EC, which regulates plant licenses for most industries, mandating that a license should only be granted when the plant makes use of the best available technology. Similar regulations referring to the state-of-the-art can also be found in Germany, the UK, and the USA (Endres 2011, p. 109). In our setup, one technology is regarded as the best among those available, and is, therefore, mandated by the environmental protection agency. This green technology is associated with less pollution for a given level of output when compared to a brown alternative, but has higher adoption costs and incurs potentially higher marginal production costs. The design standard is enforced by a fine for non-compliance, imposed only probabilistically, because perfect monitoring of technology adoption is prohibitively expensive.Footnote 2 This implies that firms may adopt the brown technology when the benefits from doing so overcompensate the expected fine. A firm benefits from choosing the brown technology by not only saving adoption costs, but also by attaining a weakly higher price-cost margin and market share. In our analysis, we assume that firms differ in their costs for adopting the green technology and will incur marginal costs based on the kind of technology adopted. In addition to firms’ decisions, regarding the kind of production technology to use and the level of output to produce, we allow for an endogenous number of firms. Our analysis contributes in two different ways to the literature. First, we explore the imperfect compliance of firms with a design standard. Second, we consider the adoption decision in conjunction with firm interaction in an imperfectly competitive market.Footnote 3
 Our research interest is with the welfare effects of an increase in the expected sanction for non-compliance with a design standard. Our main finding is that a marginal increase in the level of the expected fine need not be welfare-increasing. Indeed, for an illustrative example, we establish that there is a broad range of levels for the expected fine, in which the level of welfare falls when the expected fine is increased. This implies that making the enforcement of an imperfectly enforced regulation marginally more strict may backfire in our framework.Footnote 4 The reason for this counter-intuitive finding is that the level of the expected fine affects not only the share of compliant firms in equilibrium, but also both the output levels and the number of firms in the industry. While the output of active firms is increasing with the level of the expected fine, this need not hold for total output. In fact, comparing the extreme cases of an ineffectively enforced design standard and a perfectly enforced one, our framework predicts that the latter will have fewer firms in equilibrium and a lower amount of total output. Such repercussions have a bearing on consumers’ surplus, which are complemented by changes in the level of environmental harm. How environmental harm is influenced by the changes resulting from a marginal increase in the level of the expected sanction for non-compliance is—inter alia—determined by how firm-level pollution responds to the increase in firm-level output. In fact, our example clearly shows that a marginal increase in the level of the expected fine may imply an increase in the harm done to the environment, as brown firms will increase their output in response to a possible decrease in the number of firms. However, we show that the narrower policy goal of inducing a greater share of adopting firms is attained by a higher level of the expected sanction for non-compliance with the design standard. Increasing the expected sanction has a direct and an indirect effect regarding the share of green firms. The direct effect is due to the fact that a higher level of the fine motivates a greater share of the firms in the industry to adopt the green technology for a given number of firms in the market. The indirect effect may be counteracting the direct effect and stems from the change in the equilibrium number of firms in the industry. For this indirect effect, it holds that when the higher level of the expected fine leads to in fewer firms in the industry, the share of green firms will decrease (for a given value of the expected fine). This follows from the fact that a reduction in the number of firms in the industry makes the lower marginal costs associated with the brown technology more profitable. In the numerical example, we will refer to illustrate our model, the direct effect is always the dominating influence. We also find that there is a critical (strictly positive) level of the expected fine that must be surpassed to induce the first firm to switch to compliance, that is, there is a range of levels of the expected fine for which the share of firms producing with the green technology is zero. Our results carry the following policy implication: although a basic economic-theory-of-crime perspective would seem to support the recent policy initiatives that raise the possible environmental sanctions, these should, perhaps, be regarded more skeptically.Footnote 5 The consideration of industrial organization aspects, such as an endogenous number of active firms, blurs the picture when it comes to conjectures about likely welfare effects, making it much more difficult to ensure the beneficial nature of simple prescriptions about the strictness of the enforcement of regulations. Our paper is related to three strands of the literature. Specifically, we relate to contributions that study standards, papers that explore the repercussions of imperfect compliance with environmental policy, and studies focusing on environmental liability as a mean to induce technical change. Our framework builds on the model proposed by Besanko (1987), who similarly focuses on standards in the environmental context. Whereas that study compares perfectly enforced design and performance standards, the present analysis considers imperfectly enforced design standards; our main interest is the comparative-statics analysis of an increase in the expected fine implemented to support the design standard. Like Besanko (1987), Helfand (1991) seeks to compare the relative merits of different kinds of standards. A more recent contribution is provided by Hueth and Melkonyan (2009), who consider regulation by standards when there is asymmetric information between firms and regulators regarding the cost and efficacy of different technologies. Somewhat more closely related to the focus of our paper, Farzin (2003) studies the repercussions of tightening emission standards, meaning that firms must abate a greater proportion of their emissions. This may also be interpreted as an increase in the strictness of regulations. Paralleling this paper in another regard, his framework is also one, in which firms compete in quantities and market entry is accounted for; like our study, Farzin’s analysis lends itself to a possibility result. His main argument is that a stricter enforcement standard may induce more firms to enter the industry—in contrast to what many industrialists would claim—when the demand shifts outside with the strictness of the emission standard. In Farzin (2004), the setup by Farzin (2003) is used to discuss the welfare-maximizing environmental standard. Despite the fact that the focus on the demand channel yields an analysis quite different from ours, counter-intuitive findings related to ours emerge. For example, in Farzin (2004), an increase in the strictness of the environmental standard may lead to higher industry pollution due to the standard’s effect on demand with its implication for the number of firms. In our setup, we have green and brown firms (distinguished by their production technology). Raising the expected fine (i.e., making environmental policy more strict) increases the share of green firms, but may also lower the number of firms, inducing green and brown firms to produce more. The higher production by the remaining brown firms may then more than offset the other effects with respect to total emissions. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, the consideration of the welfare effects of increasing the expected sanction for non-compliance with a design standard is new to the literature. The fact that firms may not comply with environmental policies has been considered in a number of studies, such as Keeler (1991), Malik (1990), Rousseau and Proost (2005, 2009), and Sandmo (2002). For example, in a scenario with tradeable emissions permits, non-compliance also implies interesting feedback effects via the permit price, a theoretical finding validated by laboratory experiments (Murphy and Stranlund 2006). How policies ought to optimally respond when actors could be non-compliant has been discussed, for example, in Montero (2002) and Macho-Stadler and Perez-Castrillo (2006). The potential importance of imperfect compliance for dynamic incentives (that is, incentives concerning R&D and technology adoption) has only recently been taken up. Villegas and Coria (2010) and Arguedas et al. (2010) provide related analyses on the adoption incentives of firms when there is imperfect compliance with environmental policy, in frameworks, in which firms act in perfectly competitive product markets. Complementing the aforementioned papers, we provide an exploration of imperfect compliance with a design standard, focusing on the marginal influence of an increase in the penalty for non-compliance on market outcomes and welfare. Moreover, previous analyses of imperfect compliance and many studies on technology adoption have abstracted from industry aspects, whereas we explicitly consider the interaction of firms in a setting characterized by Cournot competition and free entry.Footnote 6
 A recent strand of the literature explores the potential of environmental liability as a mean to induce technical change. For example, Endres et al. (2007) consider three different liability rules in a setup, in which investment today can lower abatement costs tomorrow. Under the negligence rule, the firm faces either a standard defined in terms of abatement only or in terms of both abatement and investment into the improvement of the technology. Disobedience with behavioral standards makes the firm liable for the environmental harm. In contrast, the expected sanction for non-compliance with the design standard is not tied to environmental harm in the present contribution. There are also papers in this field that consider heterogeneous firms. In Endres and Friehe (2011), there is one firm that uses an advanced technology and another that does not. The focus is on the diffusion and adoption incentives under strict liability and negligence. The standards defined under negligence relate to abatement and not, as in the present contribution, to the technology applied. Finally, our contribution is related to papers that study the design of optimal environmental taxation under conditions of imperfect competition and free entry. In this literature, it has been shown that the optimal environmental tax is less than marginal external harm in an industry with a fixed number of firms (to account for the restriction of output); the tax may be greater than marginal external harm when there is an endogenous number of firms in the industry (see the contributions by Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas 1995 and Lee 1999, and the survey by Requate 2005b). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We present the model in Sect. 2, and characterize the market equilibrium and the welfare effects from higher expected fines in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, as a benchmark for comparison, we consider the scenario, in which the policy maker can directly determine firms’ technology choice instead of doing so indirectly by adjusting the level of the fine. The conclusion is drawn in Sect. 5.",3

The purpose of the project was to act as a provision against global warming, to revitalize the economy and to promote the spread of terrestrial digital televisions; under the program, purchasers of green electrical appliances could earn electrical appliance Eco-Points. The idea was for the points to be exchanged for environmentally friendly products and services, but in actuality, exchange for prepaid cards that met certain environmental conditions was most common. The definition of a green electrical appliance is a “television compatible with digital terrestrial broadcasting”, an air conditioner or a refrigerator with four or more stars on their unified energy saving label, as seen in Fig. 1. After December 2010, the points granted decreased by nearly one-half. Furthermore, after January 2011, this program was limited to replacement purchases for products with a unified energy saving label of five stars, and the system for additional recycle points was repealed. Uniform energy-saving label (MOE) The Home Appliance Eco-Point System is a subsidy system utilizing an environmental label; it is considered a system combining an environmental general information provision policy (the eco labels) and a subsidy policy. Coad et al. (2009) noted that regarding green technologies, consumers are diverse; some have an intrinsic motivation and others have an extrinsic motivation. They claim that a combination of the two policies is most effective, as information provision policies are effective for the former set of consumers, and financial incentive schemes prove effective for the latter. Moreover, while the ultimate purpose of the Home Appliance Eco-Point System is to lower electricity consumption, a significant characteristic of this program is that it is attempting to accomplish its goal not through behavioral changes of consumers (adjusting their air conditioner’s temperature settings, lowering standby power consumption, etc.) but rather through purchasing behavior of energy-efficient electrical appliances. To achieve its objectives, because the premise of the program is the purchase of new, expensive electrical appliances, the cost effectiveness of the system must be sufficiently taken into account. Moreover, it is necessary to implement the policy by taking into consideration not only the diversity involved in the energy conservation behavior of consumers but also in their purchasing behavior in buying electrical appliances. Furthermore, one must evaluate the energy saving effects during the use of electrical appliances as well as consider the environmental effects spanning the lifecycle of the product from the time of manufacturing to disposal. With regard to promoting the spread of energy-efficient durables, Markandya et al. (2009) have compared the cost-efficiency between levying an energy tax and imposing a subsidy on durables, and found that it differs for each type of durable. Gaspar and Antunes (2011) note that as consumers’ purchasing behavior of electrical appliances and energy efficiency are diverse, it is necessary to come up with the ideal eco-label that appeals to every type of consumer. Datta and Gulati (2014) have empirically shown that in the case of high efficiency clothes washers, policies such as subsidies to increase the share of eco-label product are cost effective. Owing to the diversity of consumer electrical appliance purchasing behaviors and energy-saving behaviors, there are many previous studies demonstrating the challenges in formulating consumer policy. For example, Yamamoto et al. (2008), based on a consumer questionnaire survey from the perspective of behavioral economics, noted that purchase of household electrical appliances and electricity consumption cannot always be said to be rational and are susceptible to the influences of human psychology. Based on a social cognitive theory study, Thogersen and Gronhoj (2010) noted that factors such as socio-structural environment and social norms have the effect of inducing consumers’ energy-saving behavior. In Japan, after the Great East Japan Earthquake, while people became more conscious of voluntary energy conservation, Tanaka and Ida (2013) explained that encouraging energy conservation through electricity rate adjustments has its limits; hence, ways to further enhance consumers’ awareness must be considered. Mizobuchi and Takeuchi (2015a) examined the influence of additional and replacement purchases of energy-efficient air-conditioners on power savings and showed that additional-purchase can save energy significantly but that replacement cannot. They suggest the rebound effect that negates the energy-saving effects of a new air-conditioner. The same thing is also suggested by Davis et al. (2014) for the large-scale appliance replacement program in Mexico. Leathy and Lyons (2010) empirically revealed that energy use is greatly affected by an appliance’s ownership. Furthermore, Rapson (2014), through developing the dynamic structural model of demand, verified the behavior of consumers using up present air conditioners in anticipation of future energy efficiency. Estimates based on this model have led to a new understanding of new consumer behavior. It can be said that the method of empirically capturing the diversity of consumers according to the estimated values of the demand function is an effective approach for efficient policy making. Apart from life cycle assessment (LCA), a method that evaluates the environmental effects of a product from the mining of its raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, use, recycling, to the eventual stage of disposal, there are also studies attempting to determine the direction of policy involved in the spread of electrical appliances and to verify the consequences of the policies applying this method. Using information from the results of LCA analyses on electrical appliances and product prices, Barba-Gutierrez et al. (2009) evaluated each product’s eco-efficiency and concluded that several appliances cannot be said to be eco-efficient and require redesign. Hertwich and Roux (2011) analyzed the state of demand of household electric and electronic equipment and calculated the resulting life-cycle greenhouse gas emission (GHG). While the GHG load from major appliances has attracted attention, they reveal that replacement purchases of small electronic equipment are frequent and that the GHG load at the time of manufacturing them is large; they argue for the importance of policies that reduce the GHG load during manufacturing and reduce the possibility of replacement purchases of electronic equipment. Murray (2013) noted that purchasing energy-efficient equipment, in the hope of decreasing energy consumption, may result in the “rebound effect”, where the energy consumption reducing effect may be offset by the equipment’s life cycle energy usage. Because this effect is particularly large in low income classes, when targeting this class, environmental policies that encourage changes in consumer behavior are thought to be more effective. Of the various research tasks that can be considered for policies promoting the spread of energy-efficient electrical appliances, Japan’s Home Appliance Eco-Point System has attracted attention for being a policy combining an information provision policy with a subsidy policy. Despite the unique features of the system, many empirical studies have not analyzed its policy effect. Morita and Arimura (2015) showed that the Eco-Point system promoted CO2 reductions from the purchase of energy-efficient refrigerators. They noted that the Japanese government overestimated the effects of the system in terms of CO2 reduction but also noted that other effects of the system, e.g., economic effects and a firm’s behavioral change, should be evaluated. Mizobuchi and Takeuchi (2015b) estimated households’ electricity demand functions and analyzed the power-saving effects of energy-efficient air conditioners that were promoted by the Eco-Point system. They make a point that there is a trade-off between consumers’ energy-efficient investment and energy-saving behavior. While these previous studies have evaluated the effects of the Eco-Point system as a whole, our approach distinguished the two sides of the system, namely, a side as an information provision policy and as a subsidy policy, and evaluated each effect. Furthermore we pay attention that the diversity among consumers may make it difficult to assess the general impact of the policy. Thus, in this study, we use the micro data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications’ Family Income and Expenditure Survey with the aim of verifying the effectiveness of the policy by closely observing consumers’ response to it. As noted in previous studies, consumers are diverse, and that diversity is also influenced by social structure. Because consumer behavior can be finely classified into various attributes in addition to age and income class, the true state of “diversity” can be verified in detail based on the micro data. This study was conducted under an environmental economic policy research grant of the Ministry of Environment (MOE). The grant is designed to fund analyses of the effects of current environmental policies and promote the strategic implementation of future ones. Section 2 below will present the aggregated results of the effects of the Home Appliance Eco-Point System that characteristically appeared according to various household attributes. In subsequent sections, we will quantitatively demonstrate the policy effectiveness of the Home Appliance Eco-Point System by measuring the demand function. We demonstrated the quantitative indicator of equivalent variation, and consequently, we can demonstrate the change in consumers’ degree of satisfaction because of the Home Appliance Eco-Point System. In Sect. 3, we will explain these estimation methods; in Sect. 4, we will summarize the estimation results; and in Sect. 5, we will summarize our conclusions.",6

Many Japanese people have been skeptical about the use of nuclear energy as the country’s power source. Subsequently, all of the country’s nuclear power plants are out of operation until the plants have been inspected thoroughly. On the other hand, the Japanese economy has suffered from high electricity prices due to the shutdown of the nuclear power plants, as Japan had to import expensive natural gas from foreign countries. There appears to be no national consensus regarding future nuclear energy plans. In response to public anxiety about the remaining idle nuclear plants, Japan’s nuclear safety standards have become stricter than before the Fukushima nuclear accident. In line with the Electricity Utilities Industry Law (1964), a nuclear reactor is required to undergo scheduled inspections. According to the law, scheduled inspections must be conducted on each reactor after 13 months of operation. Four months after the Fukushima nuclear accident, in July 2011, the Japanese government required electricity power companies to conduct stress tests on their nuclear reactors under scheduled inspections as a step towards resuming operations. In September 2012, a new organization in charge of regulating nuclear power, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA), was launched. In April 2013, the NRA proposed new safety standards requiring many improvements to nuclear plants by electric power companies. For instance, the standards require construction of sturdy buildings for emergencies, replacement of wiring, and installation of improved ventilation systems. The standards took effect from July 2013. To resume operation of the idle nuclear reactors, electric power companies have to take measures to meet the standards and pass the NRA’s inspections. Even if an electric power company passes the NRA’s inspections, the local governments of the areas where the nuclear power reactors are located are required to give permission for the suspended reactors to resume activity. By June 2015, all nuclear reactors in Japan remained idle. Thus, Japan has to manage balancing its electricity supply and demand without operating nuclear power reactors. The electricity shortage has been met by a corresponding increase in fossil fuel power generation. Although Japanese people do not have a common perspective on nuclear power policy, the government has prepared plans and laws to restart nuclear power reactors. In 2012, the government introduced a 40-year time limit for the lifespan of a nuclear reactor. In exceptional cases, a nuclear reactor that meets safety standards can be allowed to operate for up to 60 years. In 2015, a consultative committee approved Japan’s energy mix to 2030. In the plan, nuclear power accounts for a share of 20–22 %. In 2015, the NRA approved the restart of two reactors at Kyushu Electric Power Co.’s Sendai nuclear plant in Kyushu. They are the first reactors to pass the stricter new standards introduced since the accident in Fukushima. Economic and environmental impacts of nuclear power phase-out would strongly depend on the potential of Japan’s renewable energy supply as well as the capacity of fossil fuel electricity supply. Given the limited effect of the renewable portfolio standard that was introduced from 2003, the government decided to adopt a solar photovoltaic (PV) feed-in tariff (FIT) to address climate and energy issues by promoting renewable energies in Japan. Under the FIT system, introduced in November 2009, electric power company must purchase electric power generated from solar PV at a fixed price and concurrently pass on the costs to their customers. The FIT system was applied only for surplus electricity; electricity generated by solar PV must be consumed first. The purchase rates at the time were 48 yen/kWh for residential use and 24 yen/kWh for non-residential use. The purchase duration was 10 years. Following the Fukushima nuclear accident, the Japanese government decided to pursue renewable energy more aggressively. The Act on Special Measures Concerning the Procurement of Renewable Electric Energy by Operators of Electric Utilities was passed in August 2011. Under this law, the FIT target was expanded to include wind, geothermal, biomass, and micro-hydro resources. Table 1 shows the purchase prices for the various renewables under the enhanced FIT in 2015. Purchase prices are revised and determined every year to cover the renewable power generation cost and to determine appropriate profits for investors. One important feature of this act is that all the electrical power generated from renewable energy—not merely the surplus—is purchased by the power companies. The generation of renewable energy increased sharply after the revised FIT came into effect. In 2009, when FIT was first introduced, the share of renewable energy was 1.4 %; this increased to 3.2 % in 2014 following the expansion of the FIT. The purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of the national and long-term impacts on the economy and environment (in terms of carbon dioxide, CO2, emissions) of nuclear power scenarios and the implications for renewable energy in Japan using a multi-region (country), multi-sectoral, recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database version 8.1. The reason this study uses the global CGE model, in which import and export prices are determined endogenously, is to assess the impacts on trade-intensive industry. It is difficult to capture a change in international competitiveness of industry by a standard single-country model owing to the assumption of a “small country”. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the main structure of this study’s CGE model. Section 3 describes the data to build the model. Section 4 presents the simulation scenarios, the results of the economic and environmental impacts, and implications of Japan’s nuclear power scenarios for renewable energy. Section 5 concludes.",11

Arimura,Kazuhisa Koakutsu,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Industrialized countries have been responsible for the majority of historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, future emissions are largely expected to come from emerging and developing countries (IEA 2014). In climate negotiations leading up to the Kyoto Protocol, it was recognized that mechanisms and emission reduction targets should be introduced to drastically stabilize and reduce the GHG emissions of industrialized countries (Annex I countries). At the same time, technology transfer of GHG-mitigating technologies to developing countries was identified as an important tool by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure that rapid expected development is achieved sustainably in non-Annex I countries (Haščič and Johnstone 2011; Popp 2011; Wang 2010; Schneider et al. 2008; Dechezleprêtre et al. 2008; IPCC 2000). Along with emissions trading schemes and Joint Implementation (JI), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one of the three market mechanisms proposed in the Kyoto Protocol and formalized in the Marrakesh Accords 2001. In the CDM, proponents from Annex I countries can finance and implement projects to reduce GHG emissions in non-Annex I countries in return for emission credits, or Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) (Lecocq and Ambrosi 2007). In addition to emission reduction, CDM is expected to contribute to technology transfer. In the CDM, technology transfer is defined as “a broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongst different stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, NGOs and research/education institutions” (IPCC 2000). Technology transfer is typically divided into two categories: embodied (or coded) and disembodied (or tacit). Simply stated, embodied transfers involve flows of machinery, whereas disembodied transfers are related to know-how and experience (Glachant et al. 2013; Popp 2011; Hall and Helmers 2010). Some argue, however, that CDM has not generated technology transfer as much as was expected initially, and this is especially the case with India. Dechezleprêtre et al. (2009) find that the ratio of technology transfer in CDM projects is the smallest in India among the four major hosts of CDM, i.e., China, Brazil, Mexico and India. One possible explanation for the low share of technology transfer in India may be higher costs than those in other countries. This is an issue worth examining empirically. During CDM negotiations, the so-called “low-hanging fruit problem” was raised as a potential cause of reluctance to host CDM projects by host countries. It presumes that low-cost abatement options are used up by investors from Annex I countries in the period before binding emission reduction targets apply to non-Annex I countries. By the time non-Annex I countries agree to emission reduction targets, many low-cost abatement options will have been used up (Popp 2011; Narain and Van‘t Veld 2008; Bréchet et al. 2004). From this reasoning, abatement costs are expected to increase, which could be captured by either: (1) time passing, or (2) number of projects that are in operation. Alternatively, it could be argued that abatement costs decrease over time as more CDM projects are implemented in similar sectors due to learning effects. The reasoning behind potential learning effects could be increased efficiency of the CDM process, mainly due to capacity building and reduction of regulatory bottlenecks in the CDM Executive Board and the Designated National Authorities (DNA) in charge of project permitting at the domestic level, accreditation of Designated Operational Entities (DOE) in charge of project validation, and increases in the accepted methodologies for calculating emission reductions (Lecocq and Ambrosi 2007). Research on these CDM hosts has been limited due to data restrictions. Rahman et al. (2009, 2012), however, identified that available data allow for empirical analysis while controlling for project size (in terms of abatement), project type, credit starting year, duration and methodology. By extending their work, this study aims to empirically examine GHG abatement costs of projects conducted under the CDM. Specifically, by constructing datasets from publicly available sourcesFootnote 1, we empirically analyze two areas. First, we investigate the impact of technology transfer on CDM costs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine technology transfer as a factor that influences CDM costs. If technology transfer increases the costs of CDM, it will explain the limited technology transfer in Indian CDM. Further, if we find that transfer of some technology is more costly than others, this cost variation in technology transfer can be a factor of “neglected environmental technologyFootnote 2”. Second, we scrutinize the cost structure of CDM to test for learning effects versus “low-hanging fruits”. If we find that the first is greater than the latter, it would suggest that we should promote CDM or a similar mechanism to promote GHG abatement in developing economies. We depart from the previous literature in examining this issue by controlling the impact of technology transfer on CDM costs. This research focuses on CDM projects conducted in India. India is the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide, emitting approximately 2.07 billion tons in 2013 (Olivier et al. 2014). As of April 2014, India hosted 1494 CDM projects, second only to China (IGES 2015). Total CERs to be generated during the first crediting period (2005 until 2012) are estimated at 278.6 million (UNEP Risoe 2014), while post-2012 emission reduction potential is estimated at 307 Mt-CO2 in 2020 (GIZ 2014). Another motivation to focus on India is that attention to CDM analysis so far has primarily focused on China. The remainder of this research is structured as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes selected literature and is divided into cost structure, technology transfer and low-hanging fruits. Section 3 covers data sources and provides variable definitions, and summary statistics. Section 4 introduces the econometric model applied in this paper and the model specifications and discusses estimation results. Section 5 concludes with major findings and policy implications.",5

The main factor is the greenhouse gas generated by human activity due to an increase in energy consumption and especially fossils fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil). About 66.5 % of all primary energy and around 66 % of electricity consumption is derived from fossils fuels.Footnote 1 Their combustion represents 99.4 % of CO2 emissions in 2013. The exponential increase on energy consumption and polluting emissions having adverse effects on environment, we can mention: rising temperatures, drought, floods and altered ecosystems… Along with the rest of the world, the Mediterranean region is facing several energy and environmental challenges such as a high demand of energy, a large dependence on fossil fuel, an increased volatility of oil prices and the severe negative effects of carbon emissions on the environment. On the one hand, according to the Energy World Organization, energy consumption in the Mediterranean region will be based on oil in 2030; on the other hand, the south shore of the Mediterranean is the most vulnerable regarding global warming due to its dependence on climate sensitive economic sectors (like agriculture, tourism…). So it is crucial to find solutions to deal with this issue. During the last decades, efforts have been undertaken and the Mediterranean countries tried to implement different actions and strategies to resolve the energy and environmental problems and develop renewable energy and energy efficiency. We can mention the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development (MSSD), the Mediterranean Solar Plan (MSP) and recently the Renewable Energy Solution for the Mediterranean (RES4MED). Undeniably, the Mediterranean region has a strong production capacity of renewable energy, especially solar and wind. However, electricity generation mix is still predominated by fossil fuels. The economic debate over the role of energy consumption and economic growth on environment is diversified and we can categorize the studies into three strands: the relationship between pollutants and economic growth, the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth and a last one that focuses on the relationship between energy consumption, polluting emissions and economic growth. The first one focuses on the relationship between economic growth and polluting emissions. Regarding the empirical studies of Grossman and Krueger (1991), Dinda (2004) and Tsurumani and Managi (2010) which expose the three effects: scale, technique and composition effects. The scale effect has a negative impact on the environment, because it reflects an increase on emissions driven by an increase in production. The technique effect reflects the impact of economic growth on the environment, it can be positive or negative, it depends on the degree of the stringent environmental regulations, which promote a new production method that respects the environment further. The third effect is the composition effect and it is the consequence of the structural transformation of an economy when income grows. The impact can be positive or negative, it depend of the degree of transformation from energy-intensive economy to technology-intensive economy with cleaner activities. The clear effect of these three effects generates the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The second stand of research focuses on the nexus between energy consumption and economic growth. Since the pioneering study by Kraft and Kraft (1978), empirical findings are mixed and sometimes controversial for the same countries (Liz and Van Montfort 2007; Belloumi 2009; Tsani 2010; Omri 2013). The energy policy implications may be significant, depending on the kind of causal relationship between variables. Finally, based on the two types of previous analysis, a new line of research emerged has focused on the relationship between economic growth, CO2 emissions and energy consumption (Ang 2008; Halicioglu 2009; Arouri et al. 2012). There is no consensus on empirical results. Some authors have also sought to define the role of renewable energy in this relationship, their main objective is to analyze the role of renewable energy to reduce pollutant emissions and enhance growth (Menyah and Wolde-Rufael 2010; Apergis and Payne 2009b; Salim and Rafiq 2012; Shafiei and Salim 2014). The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship and the direction of causality between economic growth, carbon emissions, renewable and non-renewable electricity consumption for 14 Mediterranean countries, over the period between 1980 and 2011. The goal is to analyze the effect of renewable and non-renewable electricity consumption and CO2 emissions on growth using Generalized Method of Moments and the Vectoriel Error Correction Model. The empirical finding can conduct policy decision makers in term of growth development while limiting CO2 emissions by exploiting the potential on renewable energy in the Mediterranean region. We organize the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 describes Materials and methods. Section 3 reports the empirical results. In Sect. 4, we discuss our results. Finally, we conclude by some policy recommendations in Sect. 5.",21

This has led materials to be considered “the backbone of the economic production and consumption systems” (Bahn-Walkowiak and Steger 2015). As such, materials are on the agendas of academia, the private sector and policy making, while their role in the political process has changed over time. Initial discussions on materials emphasised their physical limits (Meadows et al. 1972; Tilton 2001), which was later complemented by environmental (Rockström et al. 2009) and strategic concerns (Graedel et al. 2012). Starting from the early 1990s, the economic and environmental implications of material use have been recognised on a global level: “Reducing the amount of energy and materials used per unit in the production of goods and services can contribute both to the alleviation of environmental stress and to greater economic and industrial productivity and competitiveness.” (UN 1992). Since then, the claim that increasing material productivity improves competitiveness while reducing environmental pressures is at the centre stage of contemporary resource efficiency, circular economy and raw materials policies in the European Union (EU) (EC 2008, 2011, 2015a).Footnote 1 In particular, the environmental benefits from reducing material use and improving material productivity are reflected in a broad literature in industrial ecology (Voet et al. 2005; Kagawa et al. 2014; Wei et al. 2015) and environmental economics (Tietenberg 2000; Nakano and Managi 2012). The interdisciplinary literature provides evidence that increasing material productivity improves competitiveness (e.g. Bleischwitz et al. 2007; Bleischwitz and Steger 2009; Schröter et al. 2011; Bassi et al. 2012) and relevant macroeconomic indicators (e.g. Distelkamp et al. 2010; Walz 2011; Meyer et al. 2011). However, there are two limitations in the current literature. First, it fails to clarify the concept and measurement of competitiveness on the macroeconomic level. Second, it lacks to take the endogeneity of material productivity into account.Footnote 2 Such shortcomings are particularly relevant, as major financial resources are allocated according to previous studies (EC 2014a) and a range of environmental policies around the world are motivated by those investigations (OECD 2016; UNEP IRP 2016). This paper first reviews the concept of macroeconomic competitiveness and identifies six conventional macroeconomic indicators to approximate it, while acknowledging that no optimal measure exists. Second, using a panel data set for the EU’s 28 member states between 2000 and 2014, the causal impact of material productivity on each of the six indicators is estimated. Material productivity is instrumented with the number of deaths from natural hazards, which are shown to be both relevant and valid. The results suggest that increasing the material productivity rate causes (1) the wage rate to increase, and (2) with lower confidence, the current account rate to improve, while the other indicators are insignificantly affected. The causal impact is robust and relevant for the wage rate, raising the question whether higher wages increase or decrease competitiveness. Additionally, the paper discusses policy options to reduce the magnitude of potential rebound effects and thus environmental pressures. Overall, these findings call for more caution when making the claim that increasing material productivity improves macroeconomic competitiveness in the EU. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on macroeconomic competitiveness and material productivity. Section 3 describes the modelling approach and instrumentation strategy in detail. Section 4 introduces the data, Sect. 5 outlines the results, Sect. 6 discusses the findings, and Sect. 7 concludes.",19

A product of path dependency driven by quasi-irreversible positive feedback mechanisms, the resulting lock-in of the automotive mode, produces an extensive, durable form of market failure. This is characterised by a high-cost transport system and large negative externalities in the form of congestion, environmental degradation and a general decline in the quality of urban life. While there is a rich literature on technological and emerging new social norms (e.g. the sharing economy) which can contribute to making transport systems more sustainable (Handy and Lawell 2015), literature extensively reviewed by Beaudoin et al. (2015), there is considerably less focus on examining the underlying causes of this form of market failure and how they can be reversed. Therefore, studies are needed which recognise the path-dependent nature of AML and the likely changing motivations for automotive use over time in an environment where largely uncosted negative externalities become increasingly pervasive. For policy makers, then achieving a more rational and cost-effective allocation of urban transport resources will depend on an understanding of these underlying drivers of AML and how it might be reversed. The current literature (see, for example, FHWA 1997; Alpizar et al. 2003; Suryo et al. 2007; Yagi and Mohommadian 2008; Fukuyama et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014) has focussed on the way in which commuters make trade-offs at a particular point of time, but without factoring the influence of all major externalities, nor do these studies allow commuters to factor in the longer-term consequences of their trade-off decisions in terms of the continuing growth of (or reduction in growth of) externalities. The contribution of this paper is, therefore, to firstly provide a measure of the relative importance to urban commuters of the key negative externalities produced by AML. A second contribution is to measure the potential for AML’s reversal by gauging commuters’ willingness to forego automotive transport as a trade-off for lessening over a defined future period, the effects of the key negative externalities (and in particular congestion and pollution) through improved public transport. Given the extent and severity of the automobile’s negative externalities, it is hypothesised that Jakarta commuters will show a higher level of willingness to switch modes than indicated in the current literature. Equally, the willingness to make this trade-off will reflect a diminishing importance of income-driven aspirational demand for the automotive mode and a greater emphasis by commuters on modal utility. A choice modelling experiment contained in a survey of commuters in Jakarta, Indonesia, is adopted as a particularly appropriate methodology to provide a measure of, firstly, the relative importance they attach to key negative externalities produced by AML. Secondly, it provides a means of assessing commuters’ willingness to trade off automotive transport for improved public transport and reduced negative externalities over a specific time frame. The study’s outcomes indicate that congestion and time lost are the key negative externalities and that there is a high level of willingness to effect a modal trade-off if their effect can be lessened by a greater use of public transport. Importantly, this study indicates a particularly high level of willingness to pay to effect such changes and the importance of providing commuters with the longer-term consequences of choices. Such findings have important implications for urban transport policy. They indicate that commuters are quite willing to entertain higher taxes and charges for automotive use if this can be compensated by improved public transport. Section 2 of this paper outlines the background to the evolution of AML and the relevant literature on the development of the theory of path-dependent growth, market failure and the associated phenomenon of lock-in—and specifically automotive modal lock-in. Section 3 describes the aims of the paper in terms of using the choice experiment to indicate the potential for commuters to change transport modal preferences and thereby play a role in reversing AML. The paper’s methodology in the use of a discrete choice model and derivation of a willingness to pay (WTP) is set out in Sect. 4. Use of the conditional logit model is discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 discusses the outcomes of the choice modelling experiment in terms of commuters’ willingness to trade off automotive for public transport use. The paper’s conclusions are set out in Sect. 7.",1

These mechanisms have the potential to accelerate global warming due to their self-enforcing character (e.g., Wolff et al. 2015).Footnote 1 The most important feedback mechanisms in the climate system are: 
Snow and ice albedo feedback Albedo is the fraction of the incoming solar radiation which is reflected from the earth back into space. Hence, the lower the albedo, the higher is the atmospheric temperature. Snow and ice have a high albedo, whereas water and land surface uncovered by snow or ice have a much lower albedo. Consequently, as snow and ice melts due to increasing temperatures, more of the sun’s energy is absorbed. This leads to a further warming which in turn melts even more snow and ice implying a further decrease in albedo and further rising temperatures (IPCC 2013). 
Ocean carbon sink feedback Oceans absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide depending on the atmospheric CO2 concentration, the water temperature and biological processes triggered by plankton. As global warming can affect all parts of the atmospheric-ocean carbon exchange chain, long-term projections are difficult. However, it is obvious that an increase in water temperatures reduces the oceans’ uptake capacity (Arora et al. 2013; Heinze et al. 2015). Consequently, with increasing temperatures a larger share of CO2 emissions remains in the atmosphere leading to a further warming. 
Permafrost carbon feedback Permafrost is permanently frozen soil which often contains large amounts of organic carbon. When the soil thaws due to rising temperatures, the carbon content will become unlocked and be released to the atmosphere as CO2 or CH4. These additional emissions lead to further increasing temperatures and a further thawing of permafrost soils (see Sect. 2 for more details). Evaluating the economic consequences of climate feedback mechanisms is a relatively new challenge. So far, these mechanisms have been omitted almost completely in the integrated assessment of climate change and the economy.Footnote 2 In the present paper we focus on the permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) which is one of the most studied and best understood climate feedback mechanisms. We show how to incorporate the PCF into the mathematical setup of the well-known integrated assessment model DICE-2013R (see Nordhaus 2013) and derive some empirical results.Footnote 3
 Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are a popular tool when studying the economics of climate change (e.g., Hof et al. 2012). The major components of those IAMs are a neoclassical growth model and a climate module that is linked to the economic model. Important characteristics of those IAMs are their intertemporal formulation and the incorporation of a long time horizon. Since greenhouse gases have a long residence time in the atmosphere (often more than 100 years), this model setup is necessary for a meaningful assessment of climate change. Taking into account the mitigation costs and potential climate damage costs, one major subject of study in IAMs is the economically optimal emission mitigation path. Although we are aware of massive reservations against these models, we do not agree with the part of criticism that climatic feedback loops are “largely unknown” (Pindyck 2013, p. 870). On the contrary, we try to improve the model results by integrating the PCF to slightly reduce the simplifications of DICE-2013R. The use of DICE-2013R for this paper has several reasons. Since the development of the first version of DICE (Nordhaus 1994), it is probably the most popular IAM in the economics of climate change and its codes are publicly available.Footnote 4 Due to its popularity, DICE entails the advantage that our results are comparable with those of many other studies using the same model family. This is particularly important since climatic feedbacks are closely related to tipping pointsFootnote 5 and potential catastrophes which have been assessed in a couple of studies within the DICE framework. For example, Mastrandrea et al. (2001) and Keller et al. (2004) show that optimal emission mitigation increases when uncertainty and potential catastrophes are included in the DICE-94 model. Ackerman et al. (2010) present a similar analysis for DICE-07, and Rezai (2010) introduces an upper limit for the atmospheric carbon absorption to account for potential catastrophes. Moreover, Lemoine and Traeger (2014) use DICE-07 to analyze the impact of multiple tipping points that reinforce each other’s economic impacts. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the PCF in more detail by summarizing the current state of theory and empirical evidence. In Sect. 3 we show how to incorporate the PCF into DICE-2013R and how to calibrate the new PCF-related parameters. In Sect. 4 we discuss some empirical results derived from our extended model, and in Sect. 5 we summarize the paper.",2
20.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,19 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-017-0187-4,Adoption incentives and environmental policy timing under asymmetric information and strategic firm behaviour,January 2018,Alessio D’Amato,Bouwe R. Dijkstra,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Which environmental policy instrument gives the highest incentives to develop and adopt cleaner technologies? Which environmental policy instrument is best able to deal with asymmetric information about abatement costs of newly introduced production techniques? Should environmental policy be set before the firms have chosen their abatement technology (commitment) or afterward (time consistency)? These are among the most crucial and widely analyzed issues in environmental policy. To the best of our knowledge, however, so far, only D’Amato and Dijkstra (2015) have addressed all three questions together and only under the assumption of non-strategic firms. In this paper, we extend the analysis to strategic firm behaviour. We model the technology adoption choice by a single polluting firm which is subject to regulation through price-based or quantity-based controls. Environmental regulation of a single firm, with increasing marginal damage of pollution, may seem unrealistic. One could think of a large polluter by a small lake or on a small island. More importantly, this is the simplest setup that allows us to study a strategic regulatory environment, where one firm’s decisions make a large difference to the aggregate outcome. This is the polar opposite of D’Amato and Dijkstra (2015) multi-firm industry. Regulation of an industry with several large firms, the more realistic case that falls in between the two extremes, can be studied next. We will assume increasing marginal damage to allow for a non-trivial comparison between taxation and emission quotas. If marginal damage was constant, the regulator would always be able to implement the first best with taxation (under commitment and time consistency) by setting the tax rate equal to marginal damage. We find that with emission quotas, except for very specific fixed costs ranges, commitment leads to higher welfare than time consistency, as the former generates larger incentives to invest than the latter. Indeed, time consistency under emission quotas effectively punishes investment, because it results in a lower quota. Surprisingly, under time consistency, the regulator does not gain much from the information learnt from the firm’s investment decision. Conclusions are reversed when dealing with emission taxes: time consistency is shown to yield higher welfare in most of the fixed costs ranges under scrutiny; this can be explained accounting for the larger incentives to invest taxation provides. Finally, we also compare quotas and taxes for quadratic abatement cost and damage functions. Concerning commitment, we find that quotas yield, in most of the scenarios concerning fixed costs, higher welfare than taxes. However, we cannot rank the instruments for the time consistency scenario. Our analysis is linked to several strands of the literature. Since Downing and White (1986) and Milliman and Prince (1989), an attempt has been made to compare the relative merits of different environmental policy instruments in terms of their incentives for R&D into and adoption of new abatement technologies. This literature has been surveyed by Jaffe et al. (2003) and Requate (2005a). 
Weitzman (1974) was the first to systematically address the relative performance of price and quantity regulation under uncertainty in environmental policy or indeed any area of policy.Footnote 1
 
Moledina et al. (2003) compare taxes and tradable permits with grandfathering in a two-firm industry. The regulator does not know the firms’ abatement cost and does not take into account that the firms will try to manipulate her beliefs and policy. The authors show that firms will underabate under taxation to obtain a lower tax rate. The result for tradable permits is less clearcut. On one hand, both firms benefit from a high permit price, because this will prompt the regulator to issue more permits. On the other hand, the permit buyer (seller) prefers a low (high) permit price. The literature on the timing of government policy, starting with Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Fischer (1980), has almost unanimously found that with perfect information, commitment is always at least as good as time consistency. This result has been challenged by several papers on environmental policy (Amacher and Malik 2002; Arguedas and Hamoudi 2004; Requate 2005b; Moner-Colonques and Rubio 2016). Let us now consider papers that combine at least two of the three issues just reviewed. Combining innovation and policy timing, Requate and Unold (2001) and Requate and Unold (2003) study the case where the regulator sets the emission tax rate or the number of tradable emission permits, either before (commitment) or after (time consistency) many small firms in the industry have chosen between the conventional and a new abatement technology. Both instruments yield the first best in both scenarios when firms are heterogeneous (Requate and Unold 2001), but commitment to a tax rate does not always yield the first best when firms are homogeneous (Requate and Unold 2003). 
Amacher and Malik (2002) also compare commitment and time consistency but only for emission taxation of a single firm choosing its abatement technology. They show that welfare may be higher with time consistency. Amacher and Malik (2001) show that unlike emission taxation, an emission quota always implements the first best with commitment. Our paper builds on Amacher and Malik (2002) to include asymmetric information. We find that with taxation, time consistency usually yields higher welfare. Due to asymmetric information, commitment does not implement the first best with an emission quota, and time consistency can yield higher welfare in this case as well. Combining asymmetric information and innovation, Mendelsohn (1984), Krysiak (2008), and Storrøsten (2014) examine the choice between price and quantity instruments under commitment. In all three papers, technology choice is continuous: a firm can invest to reduce the intercept and [in Krysiak (2008) and Storrøsten (2014)] the slope of its marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve. Mendelsohn (1984) considers a single firm, with asymmetric information about marginal abatement costs and investment costs. Krysiak (2008) models an industry with many ex-ante identical small firms who discover their marginal abatement costs after their investment decision. Storrøsten (2014) adds product demand uncertainty to this. All three papers find that endogenous technical change reduces the slope of the long-run MAC curve, making quantity regulation more attractive. In our paper, with linear MAC and marginal environmental damage (MED) functions, we also find that quotas are generally better than taxes under commitment. This is because quotas offer higher investment incentives, and the MAC curve is relatively flat. 
Yao (1988) assumes that asymmetric information concerns the firms’ innovation capacity. The game consists of two periods and involves a single player (the “industry”). In period one, the regulator sets the period-one emission standard. Then, industry chooses a research investment level. The game is repeated in period two. Yao (1988) finds that the industry underinvests in period 1 in an attempt to reduce the regulator’s confidence in its ability and to obtain a more lenient standard in period 2. The regulator partially counteracts this effect by setting a stricter standard in period 1. Finally, we shall discuss three papers that combine all three elements of innovation, uncertainty, and policy timing. Malik (1991) compares commitment and time consistency for quota setting for a single firm in a two-period model, where the period-2 damage function is revealed in period 2. The advantage of time consistency is that the regulator has perfect information when she sets the quotas. The disadvantage is that the firm underinvests in abatement capital in period 1 to obtain a more lenient period-2 quota. 
Tarui and Polasky (2005) study a simplified version of Malik (1991) game with only a single period and without costly enforcement. However, they analyze taxes as well as quotas. Commitment would result in the first best if there were no uncertainty about damages, because the firm has a continuous investment decision. With time consistency, the result is again that the firm underinvests with quotas and overinvests with taxes. When abatement costs and damages are quadratic, taxes are welfare-superior to quotas. D’Amato and Dijkstra (2015) introduce asymmetric information into the Requate and Unold (2001) model discussed above: firms differ in their fixed costs of adopting the new abatement technology, but all firms in the industry either have high or low variable cost of using the new technology. The cost realization is revealed to the firms, but not to the regulator. Time consistency allows the regulator to infer the cost realization both with emission taxation and with tradable permits, and to implement the first best, as with complete information (Requate and Unold 2001). However, unlike with complete information, the regulator cannot implement the first best with commitment. In this case, the welfare comparison follows a modified Weitzman (1974) rule: tradable permits lead to higher welfare than emission taxation if the weighted slope of the MAC curve is flatter than the MED curve. Intriguingly, the slope of the high-cost MAC is weighted with the probability that the costs are low and vice versa. We apply the D’Amato and Dijkstra (2015) model to the regulation of a single firm. The game structure in our paper is also close to Tarui and Polasky (2005), but uncertainty enters in the form of asymmetric information on abatement costs, as in Moledina et al. (2003). Unlike Moledina et al. (2003), we assume the regulator realizes that the firm may try to manipulate her beliefs and policy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 shows the main structure of the model. In Sect. 3, we compare commitment and time consistency with quotas. In Sect. 4, we do the same for emission taxation. In Sect. 5, we compare quotas and emission taxation. Section 6 concludes.",5

Biologically diverse land provides many economic and non-economic services, which are essential for human survival. Ecosystem services are one category of these services that help maintain and improve the productivity of the agricultural sector. These services include photosynthesis, soil generation and preservation,Footnote 2 pollination of crops, recycling of nutrients, filtering of pollutants and waste assimilation, flood control, climate moderation, operation of the hydrological cycle, disturbance regulation and biological control.Footnote 3 In ecosystem terms, ecosystems are fundamental ‘factors of production’.Footnote 4 But these contributions of biologically diverse land are not reflected in the market system. Ecosystem functions have strong public goods characteristics, and so are often undervalued in the private sector’s production process. In the words of Costanza et al. (1997), “because ecosystem services are not fully captured in the market or adequately quantified in terms comparable with economic services and manufactured capital, they are often given too little weight in policy discussions”. Failure to include ecological benefits of biodiversity-rich land results in higher level of depletion of biodiversity and deforestation.Footnote 5
 There are two major arguments in the debate on the causes of the biodiversity depletion: one emphasizes population and poverty factors as the causes of biodiversity loss, while the other attributes the loss of biodiversity to market and institutional failure [see, for example, Angelson (1999)]. This paper—by emphasizing population and poverty factors as well as market and institutional factors—contributes to explaining how both arguments are valid. Poverty in this paper is represented in the form of low labor productivity. Institutional and market factors are represented by the absence of any real asset market other than developed land and absence of market for ecosystem services. Several researchers, such as Eichner and Tschirhart (2005), Eichner and Pethig (2006) and Eichner and Pethig (2009), have modeled ecosystem services and its contribution to the economic system. These authors mainly used ecological-economic modeling to show how inefficiency occurs due to property rights, externality and market failures and how policy tools like tax can correct the problem. Kraft (2008) has shown how ‘land owners have the incentives to maximize the production of food, fiber and energy commodities, but little incentives to provide the flow of ecosystem services that benefit other lands and the members of the public’. Our paper is in line with these papers, but in a different setting and modeling. In this paper, we analyze the pattern of land conversion and biodiversity loss by formulating a model that includes the ecosystem services in the agricultural production function as a weak complement. Furthermore, we try to capture the dynamics of land conversion, ecosystem services and savings. In the paper, we assume that individuals can save only in the form of land, and it is cleared mainly due to its demand as old-age security. Ecosystem services are also flow of services originating from undeveloped land. To capture these intergenerational aspects of land conversion, the paper uses an overlapping-generations model. The model thus formulated is meant to explain how the absence of asset markets other than land affects the pattern of land conversion in the biodiversity-rich South or the developing countries. As most developed countries have well-established diversified asset markets, the model is not suitable for developed countries without more modifications. Rather, this paper focuses on the developing countries only. Inclusion of ecosystem services in the production process imposes a limit on the growth of agricultural production. The contribution of the paper is in explaining how poverty and demographic and institutional factors affect the biodiversity-rich land and ecosystem services and the explanation leads to few policy suggestions. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the model is presented, Sect. 3 presents the competitive equilibrium in a single period, Sect. 4 presents the existence and uniqueness of the competitive equilibrium under infinite time horizon, Sect. 5 presents the properties of the competitive equilibrium under infinite time horizon, Sect. 6 explains the optimal exploitation of ecosystem services, Sect. 7 discusses some possible policy tools and Sect. 8 concludes the paper.",2
20.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,28 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-017-0189-2,Investigating the non-linearity between national income and environmental pollution: international evidence of Kuznets curve,January 2018,Cristian Barra,Roberto Zotti,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Air pollution and its reduction, primarily caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the environment, is recognized as one of the main themes at the heart of the international debate for climate change as well as a major public concern that governments are trying to solve in the agenda of the 21st century policy. To reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change, the growing economy of countries has prompted governments to make interventions through intergovernmental negotiations and binding agreements—one of the most important is represented by Kyoto protocol signed in 1997—with the idea of providing constraints to the environmental pollutants as well as providing a multi-year emission reduction process and working schedule. Although the concerted effort, global warning and climate change are still ongoing world-wide concerns. As President Barack Obama remarked “there’s one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate” (United Nations Climate Change Summit 2014). The relationship between environmental quality and economic growth has been intensively empirically analyzed over the past 2 decades; one of the most important and widely supported lines of research focused the attention on the emissions–income nexus using the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) concept.Footnote 1 More specifically, according to the EKC hypothesis, economic growth can be beneficial to environmental conditions after that the economy has reached a sufficient level of economic growth. Grossman and Krueger (1995) first propose and test the EKC hypothesis arguing that the relationship between environmental pollution and national income follows an inverted U-curve; in other words, pollution levels initially increase as a country develops and then eventually decline. Scale, composition, and technique effects could be blamed, according to Antweiler et al. (2001) and Coxhead (2003), to explain this non-linear relationship. Indeed, on one hand, pollution increases as the size of the economy increases meaning that economic growth and, as a consequence, exhibits a negative impact on the environment. This is generally known as scale effect. Emissions are also affected by the composition of output, meaning that environmental degradation might increase as the production structure of an economy moves from the agricultural to the industrial phase and subsequently starts to fall with the structural change from an energy-intensive economy to a technology-intensive economy, based on services and knowledge; this is known as composition effect. The amount of resources and the tightness of the environmental policies influence the effect of the structure of industry. These two effects are mitigated by the effects of technological changes on environmental quality, such that the amount of pollutant emissions per unit of output may decrease due to the higher quality of techniques and to higher energy efficiency levels. Technical progress, indeed, includes any improvement in the production technique, which results in less use of inputs and in the adoption of less polluting technologies in the production process of goods; in other words, such advances in technology over time seem to be the main causes of improved environmental quality (Shafic and Bandyopadhyay 1992). Institutions such as environmental regulations are also improved with increasing per capita income and might play an important role, too. The structure of the industry, for instance determined by the degree of trade openness and freedom, could increase production and income and as a consequence affect environmental pollution through both a scale and a technique effect; moreover, the scale effect (i.e., increase in production and, therefore, in GDP) and a direct composition effect (i.e., more industrial orientation of the economy), positively affecting CO2 emission, could be also counterbalanced by the technique effect (i.e., more stringent environmental regulations and more environmentally friendly production methods) and by an indirect composition effect (the higher is the increase in income, the more stringent are the regulations, the less comparative advantage in capital-intensive goods production). The distinction of the three effects is important as it is the net effect of these three channels that generates the EKC curve. Indeed, even though economic growth can be beneficial to the environment, after a certain point does not give reasons for a policy conservative behaviour. Specifically, the emphasis upon the technique effect is extremely important, underlining the effect of more stringent environmental regulations, which, in turn, might promote the employment of more environmentally friendly production methods. In case, the technique effect is not enough to reduce emissions, the policymakers probably need to put more effort to make their environmental policies more rigorous inducing a higher technological change (see Tsurumi and Managi 2010; Managi et al. 2009 for a valuable discussion). Over time, an increasing number of studies analyzed the economic growth–environmental pollution nexus within the EKC framework, even though the empirical results appear to be very ambiguous and mixed. Following the first empirical findings on the EKC existence by Grossman and Krueger (1995) and Selden and Song (1995), evidence supporting an inverted U-shaped function for CO2 emission has been found (Hettige et al. 1992; Cropper and Griffiths 1994; de Bruyn et al. 1998; Heil and Selden 2001; Lindmark 2002; Martinez-Zarzoso and Bengochea-Morancho 2004; Vollebergh and Kemfert 2005; Cole 2005; Galeotti et al. 2006; Jalil and Mahmud 2009; Narayan and Narayan 2010; Shaw et al. 2010; Kasman and Duman 2015). Part of the literature is, instead, still skeptical of the optimistic view that economic growth naturally leads to improvements in environmental quality, and does not show evidence in favour of the environmental Kuznets curve (see for instance Kunnas and Myllyntaus 2007; Halicioglu 2009; Aslanidis and Iranzo 2009; Luzzati and Orsini 2009; Jaunky 2011). Pollutant emissions have also been found to be monotonically increasing with income levels (Shafik 1994; Holtz-Eakin and Selden 1995; Iwata et al. 2011). Mixed evidence has been found by Coondoo and Dinda (2008), Lee et al. (2009), Dutt (2009) and Zanin and Marra (2012). Halkos and Psarianos (2016) found support of the EKC hypothesis in the case of non-OECD countries both in a static and dynamic analysis and in the OECD countries in a dynamic analysis and an N-shape curve for the full sample in static and dynamic models and for OECD countries in static specification. For an extensive and careful review survey of the studies testing the EKC, see Stern (2004) and Dinda (2004).Footnote 2
 This paper contributes to the literature providing a new international evidence of the nexus between environmental degradation and national income, giving a particular attention to the non-linearity of this relationship and to the effect of Kyoto agreement on the estimation. Specifically, a large heterogenous sample consisting of 120 countries has been analyzed (see Sect. 3 for more information about its composition). We first test, using the recent technique suggested by Lind and Mehlum (2010), the existence of the inverted U-shaped between per capita CO2 emissions and per capita real GDP; this test gives the exact necessary and sufficient conditions for examining the existence of a U-shaped relationship in both finite samples and for a large class of models. Second, to take into account the issue of (non) stationarity of CO2 and GDP, and to see whether these variables follow a stationary trend, we apply the panel unit root test suggested by Im et al. (2003). Third, through a two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991), and paying particular attention to the non-linearity of the national income–environmental pollution relationship and to the effect of the Kyoto agreement, we investigate the existence of a Kuznets curve for CO2 emissions as well as the impact of national income, electric power consumption, trade freedom, and urban population on environmental pollution. Finally, to check whether different sub-samples or panels could affect the results, we repeat the analysis by selecting countries according to their geographical location and income distribution. To anticipate our results, first, we find a strong evidence of a non-linear relationship between national income and environmental pollution, validating the Kuznets’s hypothesis; once we have taken into account the (non) stationarity of CO2 emissions and GDP, no evidence of environmental Kuznets curve has been found, being the relationship between national income and environmental pollution positive and monotone. Results also show that as population and industrial output expand, more pressure will be put forth the environment, leading to more emissions, calling for more strict environmental and energy conservation policies. The rest of paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology to assess the nexus above described. A description of the data is presented in Sect. 3, while Sect. 4 presents the empirical evidence and some robustness check; finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",36

While there has been concerted public pressure for better coverage there has, on the other hand, been an equally strong public concern over the perceived negative externalities of cell phone towers. There is a substantial body of literature on the health impacts of cell phone towers (see, for example, Gandhi et al. 2015; Szmigielski and Sobiczewska 2000). However, only few studies have examined their impact on the property market, the findings of which are inconclusive. Therefore, this study uses a more robust methodology—the spatial hedonic property (HP) valuation technique—to avoid the deficiencies in previous studies by considering the possible effect of different types of towers. As such, it is the first Australian study of the impacts of cell phone towers on property markets. Cell phone towers need a location from which transmissions can cover as large an area as possible with a minimum of physical obstacles. There is a wide range of structures used for cell phone telecommunication towers including free-standing self-supported structures, monopoles and existing structures.Footnote 1 Self-supported towers are commonly three- or four-legged angular structures which usually have the most marked visual impact. Monopoles can be categorized as single or armed monopoles. The latter tend to have a larger visual impact than the single monopole. The use of existing structures, such as buildings, bridges and lampposts is common in populated areas and, therefore, has minimal visual impact. Existing research and reports suggest that long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields can cause cancer and other long-term health problems (Gandhi et al. 2015; International Agency for Research on Cancer 2011; Szmigielski and Sobiczewska 2000). The possible health effects due to living near cell phone towers also have been extensively studied. The extent of the adverse health impacts depends on the strength of the electromagnetic field which is relatively low in telecommunication antennae (Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency 2011). Valberg et al. (2007) concluded that the research on impact of cell phone antenna on human health was inconclusive. Notwithstanding these findings, there remains a public perception that exposure to telecommunication tower electromagnetic fields may have an adverse impact on human health. This is reflected in increasing public pressure, legal actions and public awareness programmes directed against their installation. For example, in Australia, residents of the Brisbane suburb of Brookfield launched a well-publicized campaign against the installation of a cell phone tower.Footnote 2 This growing public unease, therefore, increases the likelihood of a negative effect on property values of houses located in close proximity to the towers. Existing studies do not sufficiently take into account the varying effect of different types of cell phone towers. In addition, previous studies have rarely taken into account the importance of a neighbourhood’s varying characteristics which could both reduce or increase the negative impacts on the housing market of proximity to towers. Nor has previous research focussed on spatial heterogeneity in their analysis. Therefore, this study is motivated by our intention to overcome the methodological deficiencies of previous hedonic studies. In summary this paper seeks to answer the following research questions: do cell phone towers affect nearby property value in Australia? Do the existence of other amenities discount any negative impacts of cell phone towers? To the best of our knowledge there are no such Australian studies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the relevant literature and is followed in section three by an explanation of the empirical methodology used. The results of the case study are then discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 sets out the conclusions and policy recommendations.",3

For instance, Eurobarometer (2011, p 76) reported that 72% of respondents are ready to buy environmentally friendly products even if they cost more.Footnote 1 Despite stated intentions, the market share for products that carry an organic label remains relatively small. For example, the estimated market share of organic coffee in Germany and Italy is 3 and 0.5%, respectively.Footnote 2
 One potential reason for the discrepancy is that consumers find that the organic assortment provides a weak match with their preferences in other dimensions. A consumer may, for instance, value an organic label but also value a particular brand, and if that brand does not offer an organic variety then consumers will choose non-organic varieties even if they are keen to buy organic: the brand trumps the organic characteristic. In this article, we provide a systematic examination of the role brand-organic partnerships play in determining the market share of organic products. New product introductions will partly crowd out sales of incumbent organic products (“market stealing”) and partly expand the organic market share (“market expansion”). We use a structural model of demand to examine the market stealing and market expanding effects of new product introductions in the organic coffee segment. We are also interested in identifying the consumers from which a market expanding effect would come from. Is it the most avid organic shoppers or consumers with a more moderate organic profile? We study this issue using the retail coffee market in Sweden. We use a consumer-scan-panel of Swedish households’ coffee purchases and observe the coffee varieties that households buy at the bar-code level as well as a number of demographic variables. We focus on coffee purchases because it is a market segment with a large number of differentiated products where brands are easy to identify, and its importance as a commodity. Once a year participating households fill in a questionnaire and answer whether they, to the extent feasible, try to buy organic products when shopping. We are thus able to relate a measure of the preferences regarding organic products to the same household’s actual shopping choices. The source of data is the market research firm GfK. To systematically investigate coffee choice, we estimate a discrete choice, conditional logit, and model of demand. We establish that household willingness to pay is in line with their survey responses: households that said they try buying organic products have—as demonstrated through the shopping choices they made in the market—higher choice probabilities for organic coffee products. We use the demand estimates to evaluate counterfactual product introductions: we introduce a synthetic organic product to all shopping trip choice sets, and use this synthetic product to explore all possible brand-organic alliances. For each counterfactual setting, we brand the synthetic product with one of the 35 brands observed in the data and then predict the resulting counterfactual organic market shares for each brand. The counterfactual experiments indicate that the effects on organic market shares from introducing new synthetic organic products depends crucially on the brand that new products enter with. The organic market share increases by up to a maximum of around 20–60% among a handful of the brands. However, organic market shares increase by a negligible amount in most brand-organic instances. The actual organic market share observed in the sample is around 5%. Choosing the right brand partner could boost the market share of organic coffee from 5% to a 6–8% at most, illustrating the potential importance of the choice of choosing the right brand to partner with for an organic label that wants to increase organic market shares. Access to the stated shopping behavior regarding organic products also allows us to explore the role of different types of consumers for expansion of the organic segment. The counterfactuals show that for the keenest organic shoppers, introducing a synthetic organic product will have relatively little effect on organic market shares; the largest predicted increase in market share is around 3 percentage points (which can be related to the in-sample market share of 45% for this group). Among these self-professed organic shoppers the introduction of a new synthetic organic product results in relatively few shoppers switching from non-organic to organic coffee. The successful new organic products largely steal market share from other organic products in this consumer segment. In contrast, amongst moderately keen organic consumers, the introduction of the synthetic organic product increases organic market shares by up to a maximum of 8 percentage points. Set in relation to the in-sample market share of 13% for these consumers this is a large market expanding effect. These consumers value the organic label, but they also value their brand. From the point of view of the organic label, it is in this niche that there is a large potential for market share gains. Finally, our demand estimates show that less keen organic shoppers put a negative value on the organic label and here the product introductions are associated with virtually no market stealing and only little market expansion. Taken together, these results suggest that the best co-branding partner, from the organic marketer’s point of view, is determined by the moderately keen organic households, and not the keenest organic households. It is these consumers where the co-brand partnership can have the largest impact on inducing consumers to change their choice from non-organic to organic. We relate to several literatures. The demand for organic products has been examined empirically by a number of researchers. Van Doorn and Verhoef (2015) use, as we do, revealed preference data to investigate the supply side factors and consumer characteristics to identify the barriers and drivers of organic purchases. They find that organic products are less popular in vice categories, categories with high promotional intensity but more popular in fresh as opposed to processed categories. On the consumer side, they find that environmental and animal welfare concerns increase organic purchases. In a related study, Ngobo (2011) seeks to identify the determinants of organic purchasing, although his data does not include consumer attitudes. Griffith and Nesheim (2010) combine consumer-scan-panel and survey responses using data to elicit bounds on willingness to pay for organic produce. The environmental economics literature has also studied demand for organic products. For example, Brooks and Lusk (2010) gauge the social-welfare benefits of organic labeling initiatives; and Bjørner et al. (2004) study the willingness to pay for eco-labeled toilet paper, paper towels and laundry detergents. We also relate to articles that try to determine the extent of market stealing and market expansion of new products. For example, Berry and Waldfogel (1999) use a structural model to examine the welfare effects of entry in the US radio market. Methodologically, the current article is close to that work, even if the questions posed are distinct. We are not aware of any previous studies that apply, as we do, supply side counterfactual exercises to examine the interaction between branding and organic labeling.Footnote 3
 One lens through which to view our results is as an examination of interaction between brands (co-branding or brand alliances), see van der Lans et al. (2014) or Cunha et al. (2015). A central question in this literature is the optimal choice of co-branding partner. For example, Geylani et al. (2008) study a setting in which brands face uncertain consumer beliefs. They suggest that it is not necessarily optimal for a brand to partner with a brand that is strong on the attribute of interest but rather to partner with a moderately strong brand. This shares some of the flavor in our study that the main market share gains are to be had among the consumers with a self-professed moderate tendency to shop organic products.",3
20.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,23 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-017-0195-4,Psychological influence on survey incentives: valuing climate change adaptation benefits in agriculture,April 2018,Uttam Khanal,Clevo Wilson,Robert Gifford,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"This study examined how psychological influences can affect the way people say that they value the environment. It sought to determine whether the use of survey incentives influences the respondents’ answers in a choice experiment study valuing climate change adaptation. In stated preferences analyses, the use of choice experiments for valuing the benefits of environmental goods and services has increased substantially in the recent years. In a choice experiment, respondents are asked to choose the most-preferred alternative among different bundles of goods and services, which are described in terms of their attributes and levels (Hanley et al. 1998). A number of pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors such as cultural values and beliefs (Price et al. 2014), altruistic attitudes, and the socio-demographic context (Clark et al. 2003) can influence the importance that individuals place on environmental goods and services. Although studies devote significant attention to experimental design, questionnaire development, and econometric estimation of welfare measures (e.g., Bech et al. 2011; Carlsson et al. 2012; Hensher 2006; Louviere et al. 2008), the impact of the context of face-to-face interviews is given little consideration. In recent decades, the response rate for surveys has been falling considerably (Battaglia et al. 2007; De Leeuw and De Heer 2002). To combat this, researchers have offered cash or in-kind incentives to potential respondents to motivate increased levels of participation (Cantor et al. 2008; Moyer and Brown 2008). These incentives are prepaid or promised. Prepaid incentives are an unconditional upfront payment given to the respondent, whereas promised incentives are given upon the completion of the interview as a reward for the respondents’ time and effort. Prepaid incentives do motivate respondents to participate in surveys (Ryu et al. 2006; Trussell and Lavrakas 2004). Incentives offered before the interview motivate respondents to invest more effort into answering the survey questions (James and Bolstein 1990). According to social exchange theory, providing prepaid incentives helps to build a positive relationship between the researcher and the respondent, and consequently, they may respond more honestly to the questions. Social exchange is based on the norm of reciprocity (Gouldner 1960). When respondents receive an incentive before the interview, they feel more compelled to give something back in return. This feeling of obligation to the researcher may lead the respondent to focus more on pleasing the researcher (Dillman et al. 2009) and, as a result, respondents may provide more researcher-favored responses to survey questions than they otherwise would have (Medway 2012). For example, in one mail survey, respondents who received a prepaid incentive provided comments that were more favorable toward the survey sponsor than those who did not receive an incentive (James and Bolstein 1990). Also, prepaid incentives may alter the quality of the answers respondents give to survey questions. The majority of studies on incentives have focused on the effect of incentives on the response rate. Fewer studies have examined the effect of incentives on item non-response (Cantor et al. 2008; Goldenberg et al. 2009; James and Bolstein 1990) and responses to open-ended questions (James and Bolstein 1990). The decision whether to use a survey incentive is relatively difficult because the norm of reciprocity must not become a compulsion to respond (Ahlheim et al. 2013). Despite the large body of literature on the effect of incentives on survey research, relatively few studies have examined the effect of incentives in stated preference studies. In a contingent valuation study, Hidano et al. (2005) found a reciprocity effect on respondents’ cognitive effort, but the amount of money paid to the respondents did not affect their level of reciprocity. Ahlheim et al. (2013) using contingent valuation techniques analyze the effect of incentives on stated willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental improvement in Southwest China and found that incentives influenced respondents’ inclination to state a positive WTP, rather than zero. However, incentives did not increase average WTP significantly, compared to a reference sample. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has examined the effect of incentives in studies using choice experiments (Gajic et al. 2012). These researchers considered the cost-effectiveness of cash versus lottery incentives in a web-based study. The prepaid cash incentive generated higher response rates than a high-value lottery and therefore was the most cost-effective incentive option. However, the effects of incentives on response behavior and welfare estimates were not examined. In the present study, our interest lies in investigating the impact of prepaid survey incentives versus no incentive on response behavior and mean WTP estimates in a face-to-face choice experiment. The empirical context of the study concerned the benefits of climate change adaptation (CCA) in rural agricultural lands in Nepal. Individual preferences and behavioral responses to climate change adaptation and mitigation have received increasing attention in the recent years (de Jalón et al. 2013; Gifford 2011; Islam et al. 2013, 2016; Rajmis et al. 2009; Whitmarsh 2009). However, most of these studies were conducted in developed countries. The present study also seeks to better validate the survey methodology used to measure farmers’ preferences for adaptation programs that enhance the capacity and resilience of agricultural systems to the adverse impact of changing climate. The rest of the paper is organized as follows; the next section describes the choice experiment approach with details on choice attributes and experimental design. This section also presents study sites and data collection. Section 3 presents the results on the impact of incentives on the respondents’ behavior and willingness to pay estimates. Section 4 presents the discussion and conclusions of the study.",6

Walter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The relationship between investment and clean technology has become an important topic in the regulatory and environmental literature. Much of the new environmental research has shifted to identifying the incentives of firms to undertake development of clean technology in the context of environmental regulation. Initiating an emissions tax is a common approach to internalize the negative effects of production emissions. However, with the development of new emission-reducing technology identifying the best policy becomes even more challenging. Large emissions taxes may erode a firms’ profit, but increases the benefits of developing clean technology. Conversely, smaller tax rates allow firms to enjoy higher profits, providing firms additional resources to develop clean technology. If we view clean technology development as a special case of innovation,Footnote 1 the effects of environmental regulation can extend beyond a firm’s emissions, but influence the development of clean technology. Several papers have evaluated the relationship between innovation and competition. Arrow (1962) showed that the incentive to invest maybe greater under monopoly than in a competitive setting. However, Schumpeter (1934) showed a positive relationship between innovation and market power. This demonstrates a glimpse of how challenging it is to identifying firm’s incentive to innovate. Contemporary work such as Lambertini and Mantovani (2009) has started to evaluate how R&D structure affects innovation. Goel and Hsieh (2006) show environmental policy can influence emissions in the context of monopolies. This shows the importance of analyzing how environmental policy impacts investment in clean technology. Contemporary research has expanded on previous findings by including important characteristic into the market framework, such as: evaluating the transfer of environmental technology between countries (Iida and Takeuchi 2011), licensing technology (Kim et al. 2012) and how regulation affects a firm’s decision to develop clean technology “in house” or license it (Heyes and Kapur 2001). Previous literature has overwhelmingly shown how environmental policy incentivizes clean technology development. This research points out an important relationship between taxes and investment, which facilitates a strategic approach, such as those by Requate (2005), Ulph and Ulph (2007) and Greaker and Rosendahl (2008). Thus, our understanding of a firm’s decision in the face of environmental policy helps identify optimal tax policies (Kurtyka and Mahenc 2011). Work by Canton et al. (2008) indicates the challenges of identifying optimal tax rate in the presence of imperfect competition, while showing the relationship between abatement and production. Although the strategic approach can also include a myriad of details, the development of technology is frequently limited to the static case. As revealed by Beladi et al. (2013), a dynamic approach has the benefit of showing the long-run environmental implications of a policy. Furthermore, studies by Malueg and Tsutsui (1997) and Cellini and Lambertini (2009) show how important a dynamic approach is to R&D, while Furman and Stern (2011) show empirically the cumulative effects of knowledge and the importance of institutes. By incorporating a dynamic structure into the development of clean technology, we obtain better understanding of a firm’s response to regulation. Using an optimal control and dynamic game approach, we can determine a firm’s investment “path” in the presence of a given policy, as opposed to the firm’s one-time investment decision. While the static approach can provide an insightful “snapshot,” the additional details provided in a dynamic setting are paramount in the context of cumulative effects, such as those exhibited by R&D. As discussed by Jorgensen et al. (2010), models that include the dynamics of R&D and technology provide better insights into the effects of environmental policy. Feichtinger et al. (2016) highlights the richness obtained by a dynamic approach. They construct a non-cooperative differential game, where firm decides to undertake R&D projects for emission abatement, in the presence of a (constant endogenous) Pigovian tax policy. The authors’ results show the existence of an open-loop equilibrium and show a concave relationship between investment and the number of firms thus creating an inverted-U investment curve. The purpose of this study is to identify firm’s clean-tech investment strategy in response to an emission tax when R&D is represented dynamically, which has the benefit of capturing explicitly the cumulative effect of R&D investment within an environmental framework. To our knowledge, no one has examined the effects of an exogenous emission tax on a firm(s) investment in abatement technology within a dynamic framework. The closest work is that by Feichtinger et al. (2016), who incorporates dynamic analysis in the context of an emission tax, but due to the use of an endogenous emission tax and production capacity, their results yield an inverted-U strategy for investment in abatement technology. Our framework will allow us to focus on the effects an emission tax can have on firm(s) decisions, and identify their responses. We examine three different investment strategies (competition, cooperation, and merging) under duopoly, and identify each firm’s optimal R&D response in the context of firm emissions, environmental damage, and social welfare. Furthermore, our research shows the relationship between emissions tax rate and firm’s clean-tech investment, thus providing details about incentives created by emissions taxes. In contrast to the traditional static analysis, which does not allow for temporal or cumulative effects of R&D, our dynamic analysis has implications for emission tax policy and cooperation in environmental innovation to improve overall welfare. Relative to the static case, the dynamic approach incorporates additional investment that occurs beyond the initial period. This stream of investment means that the static approach under-estimates the level of investment, abatement, and production that will occur with the implementation of an emission tax. The key findings of the present study are as follows: (1) as an emission tax or the level of emissions decreases, the incentive to invest in clean technology decreases. (2) A welfare-improving emissions tax policy requires that the tax rate adjust with the development of clean technology. (3) Emissions per unit of output and total environmental damage are lowest when firms cooperate in R&D, relative to the scenarios when they compete in R&D or merge into a single entity. (4) A forward-looking firm increases total surplus and has lower environmental damage than a myopic firm. (5) Social welfare is at the highest level under the cooperative R&D regime. The remainder of the paper has the following structure. Section 2 presents the set-up of each firm’s dynamic optimization problem and the dynamic movements of emissions and investments, and discusses emission tax implications. In Sect. 3, the steady-state solutions are calculated for the three alternative regimes: R&D competition, R&D cooperation, and the merging into a single entity. Section 4 evaluates and compares the three different regimes in terms of their effects on environmental damage, firm profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",2

If Japan is going to meet its NDC target for 2030, there must therefore be a shift towards renewable energy. Policies to promote the uptake of renewables are required to stimulate this transition. In this paper, we consider a market-based policy, a carbon tax mechanism, as a means to stimulate renewable investment in the power sector, under different nuclear share assumptions. The same carbon tax is used as an incentive to reduce emissions outside the power sector. We also look at different ways that the Japanese government could use the revenues generated from the carbon tax to stimulate the economy. This analysis shows that reducing carbon emissions does not necessarily mean additional costs to Japan’s economy and a double dividend, where emission reductions and higher rates of economic growth can happen at the same time, is possible. The analysis is carried out using the E3ME model, a large-scale, global, macro-econometric E3 (energy–environment–economy) model with a detailed bottom-up sub-model of the technologies in the power sector (FTT). Our modelling approach is based on policy simulation and empirical behaviour rather than the more commonly used optimization method. As such, the results from this paper provide additional evidence from an alternative modelling approach for estimating the macro-economic impacts of climate policies in Japan.",9

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently stated that “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century… Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions” (IPCC 2013, pages 15 and 17). Additionally, the 2014 US National Climate Assessment Report concluded “[c]limate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present” (Melillo et al. 2014, page 2). The increased certainty that human produced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a driver of the recent changes to average global temperature, coupled with the fact that the impacts resulting from this change are now occurring in the present, has led to increased calls for international action to take place which addresses climate change. Amid the current discussions surrounding the need for international climate change cooperation and action, more research is needed to assess public support for and perceived value of taking action. This is particularly true in the case of the US and China as the world’s two leading GHG polluters, the two largest economies and the two countries perhaps most entangled in controversies over past international climate policies. This study applies the contingent valuation method (CVM) to data from surveys conducted among American and Chinese citizens to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for climate change mitigation policy action in these two important countries. Furthermore, the study compares the attitudes towards climate change mitigation and WTP between adults and college students as the “next generation of adults” who will ultimately be most affected by climate change impacts and potentially bear the majority of costs. It also adds to the growing empirical literature of WTP studies examining climate change in the US and China. Several results of interest are found. US students, although more accepting of climate change science and indicating higher concern, have no differential WTP from US adults. Chinese students, on the other hand, have a higher WTP for climate change action than their parents. Although Americans on average have a higher nominal WTP (both students and adults), the Chinese WTP relative to income is more than double that of their American counterparts (for both students and adults). This finding is different from Carlsson et al. (2012) that the WTP as a percentage of income is similar for both China and the US. Perhaps most importantly, it shows that students are much more accepting of the science and evidence of climate change, as well as exhibiting a higher WTP to reduce its potential impacts than adults in China, but not the US. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on American and Chinese attitudes regarding climate change, as well as provides a general background on CVM and previous WTP estimates for climate policy action. Section 3 describes the survey methods and sample frame. Section 4 details the WTP study design and data analysis techniques employed. Section 5 presents the results of the analysis. Section 6 concludes.",8

Environmental philanthropy along religiosity spectrum,April 2018,Maryam Dilmaghani,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"As early as in the 1960s, White (1967) traced the modern day ecological crisis to the anthropocentrism of “Judeo-Christian” faiths, which has shaped much of the Western values. White (1967) implies that religious involvement has a negative impact on environmental concern. This contribution generated a sustained scholarly interest for the following decades (Dunlap and Van Liere 1984; Hand and Van Liere 1984; Kinsley 1994; Woodrum and Wolkomir 1997). Starting in the 1990s, with the initiatives of several religious organizations, the thesis of the greening-of-religion in general, and Christianity in particular, emerged (Van Dyke 1996; Tarakeshwar et al. 2001; Hitzhusen 2007; Hitzhusen and Tucker 2013; Wilkinson 2010, 2012; Berry 2013; Whitney 2015). The empirical investigations of the success of these initiatives, therefore the accuracy of the greening-of-religion thesis, have been limited to mostly US data, and are deemed inconclusive (Wardekker et al. 2009; Clements et al. 2014; Taylor et al. 2016). However, exploring the link between religiosity and environmental concern remains important, for at least two reasons. First, a growing body of research examines the link between norms regarding morally or socially desirable behavior and pro-environmental action (Lorenzoni et al. 2007; Gifford 2011; Markowitz and Shariff 2012; Whitmarsh et al. 2013; Stoknes 2014). Informal social norms have been shown to significantly influence individuals’ attitude and behavior towards environment (Schultz and Tabanico 2007; Goldstein et al. 2008; Van der Werff et al. 2013; Rickard et al. 2014; Steentjes et al. 2017). Throughout the history, religions have successfully established and enforced norms of behavior, some of which costly or limiting to the individual believers, such as bans on drinking or smoking, fasting requirements, and dress codes (Iannaccone 1992, 1994; Stark and Iannaccone 1994, 1997). In fact, many scholars trace the emergence of religion to the evolutionary needs for abiding social norms regarding collectively beneficial behavior (Norenzayan and Shariff 2008; Henrich 2009; Norenzayan 2013). Consequently, it is important to create empirical evidence as to whether religious initiatives to the benefit of environment have created any consistent norm of conduct. Second, religion is recognized as a form of social capital and a powerful force in resource mobilization (Putnam 1995; Owen and Videras 2007; Putnam and Campbell 2010; Bekkers and Wiepking 2011b; Wiepking et al. 2014). For instance, the American civil rights movement is inherently linked to religion and had heavily drawn upon the American churches for resource mobilization (Inglehart 1990; Harris 1994; Zald 2000; Smith 2013). Religious involvement fosters the skills necessary to defend a cause, negotiate compromises, or administer fund-raisers, which are transferable to environmental activism (Martinson and Wilkening 1987; Christenson et al. 1988; Peterson 1992; Putnam 1995; Greeley 1997; Putnam and Campbell 2010). Consistently, the link between religiosity and philanthropy in general has been largely found to be positive (Wilson and Musick 1997; Berger 2006; Lim and MacGregor 2012), even in societies advanced in secularization (Ruiter and De Graaf 2006; Vermeer et al. 2016). From this perspective, religious involvement presents an untapped potential for the policymakers who desire promoting bottom-up environmental activism. The present paper examines the link between religious involvement and environmental philanthropy. The contribution of this paper to the literature is threefold. First, the literature on the religion-environment nexus is dominated by US data. This paper uses a large, nationally representative Canadian survey, conducted in 2013. Second, most of the past literature is focused on attitudes towards environment. This study examines the link between religiosity and actual philanthropy, directed towards environmental organizations. Environmental philanthropy is quantified by the amount of donations made to environmental causes and the number of hours volunteered for environmental organizations. Third and perhaps most importantly, acknowledging the weight and the growth rate of the secular groups, this paper pays a special attention to the association of secularity with environmental philanthropy. A brief preview of the results is as follows. In a sample restricted to Christians, the very religious, those scoring the highest possible in all religiosity measures, contribute the least amount of money to environmental organizations. The unchurched believers, those who report no affiliation with organized religion but engage in religious practices on their own, are found to be the most generous towards environmental causes. Conversely, the strictly seculars, who have no public or private tie with either religion or spirituality, are found no different from those with average level of commitment to Christianity. The analysis also shows that religious attendance negatively associates with environmental giving, but positively predicts environmental volunteerism. These findings illustrate the intricacy and the ambivalence of the effects of religious involvement on pro-environmental orientations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section is devoted to a review of related literature. Section 3 presents the data and the methodology. The results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 contains a discussion and the concluding remarks.",7
20.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,08 December 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-017-0203-8,Convergence in global environmental performance: assessing heterogeneity,July 2018,Runar Brännlund,Amin Karimu,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The impact of economic activity on the environment is attracting
 increasing attention from policy makers, firms and the academia. This is partly due to the increasing evidence of the negative impact that human activity has on the environment. The aim of this study is to construct environmental performance index that explicitly accounts for only good output (output proxy with GDP) and bad output (CO2 emission), and to assess if environmental performance converges globally and within sub-groups of countries. Environmental performance index in this study is defined as the amount of good output per unit of bad output for a given set of inputs and level of technology. Convergence in global environmental performance has the following implication; first, it has the implication for burden-sharing among countries regarding carbon emission reduction, technological transfer and support in achieving global environmental commitment. Furthermore, convergence in global environmental performance could influence the negotiations of global climate agreements. It will also provide the basis for a fairer climate-negotiating framework, where relatively poor environmental performers will take a greater share of the climate agreement commitment relative to good environmental performers, which in the process may result in many countries joining the agreement. The literature on emission is large and extensive that includes studies focused on the dynamic properties of emissions, how they change over time as a result of changes in income, income distribution, technical development etc., in the environmental Kuznets curve type of studies (e.g., Levinson 2002; Dinda 2004; Stern 2004; Lieb 2004; Kijima et al. 2010; Tsurumi and Managi 2010; Sugiawan and Managi 2016). A recent strand in the literature is related to finding an appropriate measure for environmental performance (EP), as an assessment tool for economic and environmental policy, and to assess if EP converges across countries and over time for a given country. Whether there is convergence or not in EP across countries has implications for future global emissions negotiations, such as the Kyoto protocol in terms of quota allocations and also on regional level negotiations. Therefore, having an appropriate measure of EP and consequently providing evidence for convergence/divergence is extremely important. The majority of the studies in this strand of the literature measures EP either using CO2 emissions as a ratio of population, CO2 emissions as a ratio of GDP or energy consumption. Recent papers in this line of research includes: Strazicich and List (2003), Ngugen (2005), Aldy (2006, 2007), Ezcerra (2007), Panopoulou and Pantelidis (2009) Camarero et al. (2008), Westerlund and Basher (2008), Brock and Taylor (2010), Camarero et al. (2013), and Brännlund et.al (2015). These studies implemented various econometric methods from both parametric and non-parametric approaches to address the question of convergence in environmental performance measured simply as per capita CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions as a ratio of GDP or energy consumption. However, according to Ramanathan (2002), these studies only provide a partial picture of environmental performance, as they only consider the emissions originating from economic activities. There are other existing approaches in measuring environmental performance, as an alternative to these measures. These other approaches in measuring EP are diverse, but can be grouped into three main perspectives: (1) the product cycle analysis/assessment, (2) the environmental accounting perspective, and (3) the production theory framework. Each of these approaches focus on different aspects of EP, albeit with different strengths and weaknesses, which are well-documented in Tyteca (1996) and Olsthoorn et al. (2001). Our focus in this paper is to propose to use a simple but relevant theory for measuring EP, that is based on production theory, inspired by recent work that includes: Färe et al. (2006), Zaim and Taskin (2000), Zofio and Prieto (2001), Zaim (2004), Zhou et al. (2006) and Picazo-Tadeo and García-Reche (2007), and further test for conditional beta convergenceFootnote 1 in environmental performance. Therefore, our paper makes three key contributions to the literature. First, we propose to use a simple theory in measuring EP that explicitly considers that the production process simultaneously results in both good and bad outputs. This framework is based on Färe et al. (2006). Second, based on this, we calculate, in the first step, an EP index for each country for a sample of 94 countries for the period (1971–2008). In the second step, we use the EP index in a regression analysis to test for β-convergence in environmental performance. As far as we know, we are among the first to do this based on a production theory framework at the global level. The only papers in the literature that studied convergence based on the production theory framework are Camarero et al. (2008) and Brännlund et al. (2015), but unlike our paper, Camarero et al. focus only on a sample of OECD countries, while Brännlund et al. focus on Swedish industries. Hence our work can therefore be seen as an extension of Camarero et al. (2008) on two fronts; it extends to a global sample, and it looks specifically at it from a β-convergence perspective as done in Brännlund et al. (2015) for Swedish industries. Third, we also consider heterogeneity in the rate of convergence, both between groups of countries, in line with “club” convergence, and also between countries. This is important for both regional and international negotiations regarding burden-sharing in global environmental emissions, especially CO2 emissions. It is important to know the contributions to growth in CO2 emissions by regions and by countries to aid the negotiations in burden-sharing of global CO2 emissions. We also use econometric techniques that accommodate both country and time-specific effects that help to reduce spillover effects (cross-sectional dependence) from common shocks, and therefore reduce the possible bias that spillover effects can generate on the estimated parameters and also reduce possible cofounding effects. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section two provides the theory and method for measuring the EP index, and section three provides details on the empirical approach for the study. The data is presented in section four, and the results are presented in section five. Section six, finally, contains some concluding comments and policy implications from the study.",12

Stanley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Regulation that addresses ozone pollution has been a priority in environmental policy for several decades. The potential public health consequences of ozone exposure (among other detrimental environmental effects) as well as the transboundary nature of the pollution create a role for regulatory measures (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2013b). Krewitt et al. (1999) assessed past emission reduction strategies and found benefits to exceed costs; however, the benefits were not evenly distributed across Europe. For pollution like ozone, the environmental effects of emissions are not geographically limited to the source point. Reconciling the distribution of costs and benefits of environmental policy across localities, regions, and countries is crucial in developing successful policy. More recently, Hickmann (2014) notes the importance of national interest in developing such policies. For example, ozone depletion policy in the United States has historically had greater success than measures attempting to mitigate climate change. The cost of pollution abatement and adherence to emissions standards are often points of contention. In particular, concerns and debate exist over the economic impacts of environmental regulation (see Becker and Henderson 2000; Berman and Bui 2001, among many others). This study focuses on ozone regulations and standards because of the prevalence of US counties in nonattainment for ozone, past focus in the literature, and developments in the realm of regulations and standards for ozone. The present analysis looks at the potential economic effects of nonattainment status—an environmental regulation in the US counties in violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were designated “nonattainment”, while those who met the standard were labeled “attainment”. Nonattainment counties are subjected to stricter environmental regulation and potential penalties for remaining in violation of the NAAQS, such as mandated technology improvements, penalty fees, or diminished funding from the federal government. A more-detailed account of the NAAQS and nonattainment status is given in the next section. Much of the literature on economic effects of nonattainment status investigates outcomes such as employment (e.g., Greenstone 2002, or Walker 2013) and firm location (e.g., Henderson 1996, and List et al. 2004). The present analysis also focuses on similar outcomes, but operates from a different perspective than much of the previous research. The analysis focuses on county-level effects while most past work pertains to effects at the firm level. The time period studied is also more recent than period studied in most previous research. In investigating the main research question, this study employs a regression discontinuity (RD) design. RD design is a technique that can be utilized to determine the effect of a policy or treatment by looking at those just above and just below a threshold that determines treatment. Here, counties have roughly the same level of ozone pollution, but differ in nonattainment designation. Assuming these entities around the threshold are similar in most other regards aside from the treatment (here, nonattainment status), an RD regression will yield an estimate of the local average treatment effect. One can also check to see if there is an effect of distance from threshold; in the present case, there could be differential effects based on how close a county’s pollution level is to the threshold. RD design can improve upon other econometric methods (e.g., ordinary least squares) by better controlling for unobserved differences and reducing omitted variable bias. This study finds nonattainment status to have a negative, statistically significant effect on employment in affected industries—specifically highly polluting industries with regard to ozone. The evidence is mixed regarding differential effects based on pollution levels relative to the designation threshold. With regard to potential spillover effects, the analysis finds no statistically significant effects for countywide conditions across all industries. This evidence suggests that any county-level economic effects of nonattainment status are limited to polluting industries, and such results support findings in past work such as Walker (2013). For polluting industries, the main regressions show estimated impacts of nonattainment status of roughly 24% lower employment compared to such industries in similarly polluted counties. This estimate is similar to the 16% decline seen in Walker (2013). The estimated effect of nonattainment status on number of polluting-industry establishments is about 9%, but statistically insignificant. The literature is more ambiguous on nonattainment status effects on industry location. Work such as McConnell and Schwab (1990) and Levinson (1996) find little to no effects of nonattainment status on industrial firm location; however, List et al. (2004) finds a significant effect of nonattainment status on plant births in the state of New York. Henderson (1996) also finds significant effects of nonattainment status on firm location, estimating that a county switching to attainment would see 7–9% growth in heavily polluting establishments. Additional research into factors that influence polluting firm location may be beneficial. The results of the present analysis also fit with a line of literature assessing industrial attitudes toward environmental regulation. Chen (2016) analyzes union and industrial worker attitudes toward environmental regulation. First, union members show positive feelings toward increased environmental regulation. Further, the study finds no evidence that workers in heavily regulated industries are hostile toward environmental regulation, nor does regulatory strictness affect such attitudes. In the present analysis, the results imply that economic consequences are primarily limited to polluting industries. If workers in such industries are indeed not opposed to environmental regulation, this could be a sign of accepting net gains to social welfare (e.g., cleaner air) regardless of personal cost (i.e., potential job loss). Displaced workers being able to find work in the same county but a different sector could also lessen the perceived cost of job loss. Further research into this relationship may be useful. Next, I provide more-detailed background information on nonattainment status. I then describe the data in Sect. 3. I thoroughly discuss the methodology in Sect. 4 and provide the results of the analysis in Sect. 5. This is followed by a conclusion section.",2
20.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,24 November 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-017-0205-6,Effectiveness of two pricing structures on urban water use and conservation: a quasi-experimental investigation,July 2018,Shyama Ratnasiri,Clevo Wilson,Robert Gifford,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"In recent years, the demand for urban water has been growing globally due to the pressure of economic growth and population expansion. As a result, water utilities have increasingly implemented a range of demand management strategies to conserve water. While traditional methods of education and conservation programs are still playing a role, rate structures have frequently been used as a conservation tool. In particular, in the recent past, pricing policies involving IBT schemes have been adopted in preference to uniform pricing schemes. The literature on urban/residential water demand has proliferated over time with a changing scope and emphasis including the development of novel econometric techniques. Even though the direct emphasis of these studies is usually not on water conservation itself, many focus on traditional demand models and its variants that indirectly have important implications for water conservation. In particular, these studies explore the responsiveness of demand to price changes, a measure that can be used to devise effective water conservation policies. These studies range from some of the earliest (e.g., Gottlieb 1963) to most recent (e.g., Zhao et al. 2016 and Hung et al. 2017). Furthermore, the literature has extended into studies of non-price tools such as water allocations, use restrictions, public education and free quotas (Nieswiadomy 1992; Dandy et al. 1997; Renwick and Archibald 1998; Andersen 1999; Renwick and Green 2000; Gaudin 2006; Kenney et al. 2008). Studies that compare both price and non-price measures include Martínez-Espiñeira and Nauges (2004) and Olmstead and Stavins (2009). In this strand of literature, researchers are interested in comparing various rate structures to determine the most effective for water conservation. A study that directly explores this issue in detail is Nieswiadomy and Cobb (1993) which employs a non-experimental means to elucidate the nature of water pricing and finds the IBT scheme is more ‘conservation-oriented’. During the last few decades, several studies have been conducted to explore the same question from a different perspective, i.e., whether consumers respond to average or marginal price of water. For example, among many, Stevens et al. (1992) compared the price elasticity between different tariff schemes and concluded that price elasticities were not statistically different across the various price specifications. Foster and Beattie (1981), Schefter and David (1985), Nieswiadomy and Molina (1989) and Timmins (2003) have included both increasing and decreasing block schemes to explore the elasticities. Hewitt and Hanemann (1995) used a discrete choice modeling framework to produce a different set of price elasticities. Olmstead et al. (2003, 2007) employed a piecewise-linear budget constraint created by block pricing to determine the demand elasticities of households facing different tariff schemes. They concluded that behavioral responses to price structure may lead to observed differences in demand. The literature in this area of research is still growing. However, two comprehensive surveys (i.e., Arbués et al. 2003; Worthington and Hoffman 2008) are noteworthy.Footnote 1
 Flowing from the above discussion, our study attempts to explore the conservation implications of the IBT employing a quasi-experimental approach. Nataraj and Hanemann (2011) also exploited a natural experiment—an introduction of a three tired pricing scheme—to explore the demand for water and conservation. Their study is the first to add a quasi-experimental approach to the existing water demand literature whilst other studies have typically used non-experimental methods of utility pricing.Footnote 2 This approach is considered methodologically superior given it circumvents the problem of omitted variable bias that arises from unobserved, location specific characteristics in cross-sectional data. The longitudinal studies can avoid this problem to a certain extent; however, they often fail to control for other factors that change concurrently with prices (Nataraj and Hanemann 2011). Our study is distinct from Nataraj and Hanemann’s (2011) as the unit of analysis is almost identical in all other aspects, differing only in the pricing scheme. This, then, is an ideal methodology with which to compare different pricing policies (see, for example, Reynaud et al. 2005 and Olmstead et al. 2003 for further details). In this regard, our study adds to the literature by addressing the exact nature of the relationship between rate structure changes and residential water demand. Consequently, the present study enables us to empirically identify the most effective scheme between two rate structures in terms of urban water conservation. This is an important policy-relevant outcome that has not been addressed explicitly in the literature. This study also sheds light into the wider debate on the role of water pricing on economic efficiency.Footnote 3 This is achieved by exploring the conservation gains associated with the IBT particularly when municipal utilities face constraints in water availability. Essentially, the outcomes of the study assist policy makers in considering the extent of conservation gains against negative economic consequences—including efficiency loss—arising from use of an IBT. We obtained data from the BCC, Queensland, Australia, where an IBT scheme for residential water use was introduced in 2006. This introduction, which is similar to a quasi-experimental setting, is important for comparing the effectiveness of the two pricing schemes. Therefore, we considered data recorded for the first six quarters of the period 2005–2008 under a uniform rate and data recorded for the next ten quarters under an IBT scheme to test our hypothesis of the ‘conservation-orientedness’ of the two pricing schemes.Footnote 4
 The key results of the study suggest that moving to an IBT produces a significant negative effect on water consumption, indicating that an IBT structure is more ‘conservation-oriented’ than a uniform pricing policy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the data and methodology used in the econometric estimation of the models. Section three presents the results and section four discusses the implications of the results and concludes the paper.",14

Dhamija,Surendra S. Yadav,PK Jain,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) was envisaged after drawing lessons from US sulfur dioxide trading system (Alberola et al. 2008), and consequently, incorporating decentralized decision making (Kruger et al. 2007; Meyer 2000) for allocation/auction of emissions allowances and proper monitoring of emitting sources. One European Union Allowance (EUA) gives the owner the right to release one ton of \(\mathrm {CO}_2\) in the atmosphere. The EI ETS covers carbon intensive installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 20MW across 30 countries (European Union’s 27 Member States, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) and 41% of the EU’s \(\mathrm {CO}_2\) emissions. Each installation out of total 12,000 installations covered under EU ETS, needs to surrender each year a number of allowances equal to its verified emissions and this number is fixed (Alberola et al. 2009) by each member state in its National Allocation Plan (NAP). The EU ETS includes power and heat generation sector, oil refineries, factories making cement, glass, lime, bricks and ceramics, combustion plants, and coke ovens, iron and steel plants etc. The EU ETS is envisaged to proceed in three Phases. The trial phase (phase I) went from 2005 to 2007, and is like a ‘warm-up’ period before full fledged implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. This has succeeded in sensitizing the companies regarding environmental issues by prising the carbon. The phase I, suffered from the terrible problem of “over-allocation,” leading to low carbon price and volatility due to the excess supply of EUAs in the market. To counter this, inter-phase banking of allowances was introduced from 2008, when phase II started, and allocation plans were tightened to deal with surplus supply and lack of demand issue. Phase II (2008–2012) went alongside with Kyoto Protocol, and the third Phase from 2013 onwards aims to reduce emissions by 20% (Chevallier 2012) by 2020 (along with increasing energy efficiency by 20% and increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix to 20%, hence the ’20–20–20’ target). 2.2 billion allowances per year during Phase I (2005–2007) and 2.08 billion allowances per year during Phase II (2008–2012) have been distributed. With a current value of around 8.5 Euro per allowance, EU ETS (trial phase and phase II) has created a wealth of around 17 billion Euro per year (Chevallier 2012). The EU ETS has been expanded in Phase III to include PFC emissions from the aluminium sector; nitrous oxide emissions from acid production; and ammonium, ammonia and petrochemicals sectors. Aviation emissions were also included in 2012, for all flights flying in the Europe zone. The EU ETS has been marred by frauds such as registry phishing and value-added tax frauds. However, good degree of liquidity achieved through financial intermediaries, has so far prevented crimes for e.g., insider trading, etc. The EU is contemplating to make the emission reduction targets more ambitious as most of the companies companies have already banked huge surplus of allowances into phase III. The concerns are that raising the emission targets would adversely affect the competitiveness unless other countries become parties to the agreement and commit to comparable emission targets. Phase IV is being envisaged to commence on 1 January 2021 and finish on 31 December 2028. The European Commission, on 22 January 2014, proposed following two structural reform amendments. The linear reduction factor, is to be increased, from 1.74% (2013–2020) to 2.2% each year from 2021 to 2030 thus achieving the reduction target of 43% compared to 2005 level. A 12% “automatic set-aside” reserve mechanism of verified annual emissions is created in the fourth ETS period from 2021 to 2030, effectively as a carbon price floor with a price reset each year. On 24 October 2014, the Heads of EU Member States approved the “Market Stability Reserve (MSR)”, which would change the amount of annually auctioned \(\mathrm {CO}_2\) allowances (Dhamija et al. 2016; Dhamija 2017) based on the amount of \(\mathrm {CO}_2\) allowances in the circulation. This would address imbalances in supply and demand by adjusting volumes for auction. The European Parliament and the European council has agreed on September, 2015 for setting the starting date of the MSR to 2019. This mechanism puts the 900 million backloaded allowances in the reserve and reduces the reaction time of the MSR to one year. BlueNext is the market dedicated to EUA allowances based in Paris. Likewise, European Climate Exchange (ECX) is the market based in London for future and options trading. NordPool, a common market for Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and based in Oslo; the European Energy Exchange (EEX), based in Leipzig, trading spot and derivatives for emissions allowances; and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), based in the US, also trading futures and options, are few other markets. The prices of these markets are strongly correlated, which is a standard feature like that of stock markets. The futures contract is a contract where each participant with an open position at the close of trading for that contract is obliged to make or take delivery of emission allowances to or from national registries. The trading unit is a lot of 1000 emission allowances. Market participants may purchase consecutive contract months from December 2008 to December 2020. Delivery takes place by mid of the month of the contract expiration date. Based on demand and supply fundamentals, the factors identified by Christiansen et al. (2005), Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) and Alberola et al. (2008) as the price determinants for EUA EU ETS are: market fundamentals including the emissions-to-cap ratio, weather and production levels, the fuel-switching and regulatory and policy issues. Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) and Alberola et al. (2008) analyzed the relations between energy markets and the EUA price. Based on Phase I data, the Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) establish that EUA prices are linked to fossil fuel use. Later, using an extended dataset, Alberola et al. (2008) further verify this relationship between energy and EUA prices. They find that this relationship varies depending on the period under consideration. Benz and Trnck (2009) use the GARCH models for the price dynamics for EUA. Managi and Okimoto (2013) find a positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy prices after structural breaks, suggesting a movement from conventional energy to clean energy. Chevallier (2012) analyzes the relationship between three energy variables (crude oil, coal and Natural gas) and the EUA returns and finds that all these energy variables are significant predictors of EUA returns.",16

According to a report of the US Environmental Protection Agency (2007), motor vehicles release half of the emissions of smog-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) in the United States and passenger vehicles release 90% of the carbon monoxide found in urban air. Furthermore, as the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China notes, motor vehicle emissions have become a major source of air pollution in China. In 2013, motor vehicles were responsible for up to 90% of the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and 70% of the emissions of carbon monoxide in China’s urban air. Air pollution is not the only environmental problem of daily consumption. Residential waste and indiscriminate use of pesticides also cause serious water and soil pollution. To tackle these environmental problems, governments have implemented various regulations such as environmental taxes (waste collection fees and fuel tax) and environmental product standards. Environmental product standards enable governments to restrict the sales of products that do not meet the required environmental standards. A typical instance of (prohibitive) environmental product standards is the China Compulsory Certification, which lays down a series of (environmental and safety) standards on both Chinese manufactured and foreign imported products. Another prominent example is the EU prohibition on the use and import of ozone-depleting substances. Furthermore, with the concern about global climate change, especially after the signing of the Paris Agreement, several countries such as China, France, UK have announced that they are working on a timetable of phasing out gasoline and diesel cars to meet the emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement. Conventional wisdom opines that in an open economy, environmental regulations would affect not only the quality of environment, but also inter-regional capital flows and firm locations. Many empirical studies such as Keller and Levinson (2002), List and Co (2000), and List et al. (2004) find that firm locations are influenced by the stringency of environmental regulations. On the other hand, inter-regional factor transfers or firm locations also have an impact on the effect of environmental regulation. This study attempts to investigate the theoretical link between environmental regulations, especially environmental product standards and firm locations. There are three questions we ask: Do the (prohibitive) environmental product standards actually protect environment? How do these standards affect firm locations? Is there any interaction between environmental regulations and firm locations? These questions are important because they relate to how to evaluate the effect of (prohibitive) environmental product standards. Moreover, revealing the interaction could also help us to indicate the possible results of environmental regulations. To answer these questions, we introduce environmental product standards and consumption externalities into an NEG (New Economic Geography) framework with international capital flows. This study employs the model developed by Ottaviano (2001), which has two asymmetric regions, two production sectors (agriculture and manufacturing), and two production factors (capital and labor). Emissions of pollutants are associated with consumption of manufactured products. When the government in the large region unilaterally introduces environmental product standards and prohibits firms that do not comply to sell in the domestic market, firms may divide on complying with the standards and change locations. Firms that do not comply with the standards (D-firms) will not stay in the regulated region owing to trade cost. Firms that comply with the standards by incurring extra costs (C-firms) can serve both markets and remain in both regions. In addition, accepting the share of environmental product standards (represented by the share of C-firms) would fluctuate with trade cost. Consequently, we find that unilateral environmental product standards could reduce firm share and emissions in a regulated region. Moreover, when the share of C-firms is endogenously determined, it increases with trade liberalization. Several studies have theoretically investigated the link between environmental regulation and firm location. Markusen et al. (1991) examine the relationship between optimal environmental policies and trade cost within an imperfectly competitive market. Sanna-Randaccio and Sestini (2012) analyze the impact of unilateral climate policy on firms’ international location strategies in an international oligopoly model. Other studies examine the effect of environmental regulations within the NEG framework. Elbers and Withagen (2004) discuss the impact of an emission tax on labor agglomeration when pollution affects labor immigration. Zeng and Zhao (2009) examine pollution havens effect in an NEG model with cross-border pollution. Ishikawa and Okubo (2016, 2017) compare the impact of emission taxes and emission quota policies on emissions and firm agglomeration. However, these studies consider production-generated pollution rather than consumption-generated pollution. There are some studies which discuss environmental regulations towards consumption externalities in an open economy. Copeland and Taylor (1995) analyze optimal environmental polices within a perfectly competitive model with consumption externalities. Fischer and Serra (2000) examine the choice of a minimum standard in a Cournot competitive model with consumption externalities. Haupt (2000) considers the impact of environmental product standards on environmental R&D in a two-country monopolistic competition model with differentiated products. Toshimitsu (2008) investigates the relationship between social welfare and environmental product standards using an international duopoly model. Similar to Toshimitsu (2008) and Ishikawa and Okubo (2010) compare the effects of environmental regulations with negative consumption externalities in an international duopoly model. Ishikawa and Okubo (2011) explore the impact of environmental product standards on firm locations in an NEG model developed by Martin and Rogers (1995). Introducing unilateral environmental product standards into an asymmetrical two-country model, they show that the standards may fail to protect the regulated country’s environment. This study relates closely to Ishikawa and Okubo (2011). However, in contrast to Ishikawa and Okubo (2011), our analysis addresses some contributions in following aspects. First, the main finding in Ishikawa and Okubo (2011) is that environmental product standards would fail to protect implementing country’s environment unless no firm locates in implementing country. In this paper, we investigate the role of the degree of compliance of environmental product standards and the impact of changes in trade cost on environment. We show that unilateral environmental product standards can improve not only the environmental quality of regulated regions, but also that of unregulated regions when the share of firms complying with the environmental standards is high enough. Second, there is a counterintuitive assumption in Ishikawa and Okubo (2011), which claims that the wage rate in the region having a larger population is higher than that in another region. The only diversification force is wage difference, so the discussion of Ishikawa and Okubo (2011) is confined to the situation where wage rate is lower in smaller region. Our model relaxes this assumption by introducing the price competition. Thus, we examine the impact of environmental product standards on firm locations more generally. Third, as Ishikawa and Okubo (2011) employ a CES-type of monopolistic competition model developed by Martin and Rogers (1995), due to the form of utility function, the characterization of firm locations in equilibrium is too complicated to be analytically resolved. In particular, the impact of changes in trade cost on firm locations could not be analyzed. On the contrary, owing to the properties of Ottaviano (2001)’s formulation, our model could consider the role of trade cost in firm locations. Finally, Ishikawa and Okubo (2011) claim that when firms can freely choose whether they comply with environmental product standards, the share of C-firms (or acceptance of standards) and the location of firms cannot be simultaneously determined in the equilibrium. On the contrary, our study suggests that they can be determined simultaneously. Moreover, when the firm share is determined endogenously in the interior equilibrium, the share of firms complying with environmental standards increases with trade liberalization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we construct the basic model, and analyze the equilibrium without environmental regulation. In Sect. 3, we explore the equilibrium under emission standards and discuss firm locations and emissions in the new equilibrium. We extend the model with endogenously determined firm type in Sect. 4, and present our concluding remarks in Sect. 5.",1

These attributes increase their populations’ vulnerability to economic shocks, and have hampered the islands’ capabilities to match rising global living standards. Unfortunately for households in these small atoll islands, many of the same geographical features that raise vulnerability to economic shocks also contribute to heightened exposure and vulnerability to climatic shocks. These countries, in particular, have seen their circumstances change with the rise in sea levels, and the increase in damage caused by climatic hazards (in particular for the Pacific island countries, cyclones). For the islands’ poorest people, these dual economic and climatic threats pose an even greater challenge. Even though poverty has been well researched globally, less attention has been given to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and specifically to the PICs. This is surprising as the low-lying atoll island nations in the Pacific—Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Republic of the Marshall Islands—lie at the frontlines of climate change. The World Bank (2014) acknowledges that, “although the aggregate or macroeconomic impacts of negative shocks have been relatively well studied, much less is known about the impacts on household well-being, in large part because of data limitations”. This paper aims to fill that gap by focusing on hardship and vulnerability facing households in the context of low-lying SIDS. In this paper, we consider the case of Tuvalu, and in particular, the conditions of the population which are likely to relate to rising hardship resulting from climate change. To date, there have been few previous empirical studies on hardship and vulnerability in Tuvalu, or on any other atoll country. Since disaster risk is the confluence of the hazard itself, exposure to the hazard, and the vulnerability of the exposed population, it is paramount to examine the current state of exposure and vulnerability in the affected countries. This is our intent in this paper. Specifically, we aim to explain how and which households in Tuvalu are particularly exposed and vulnerable to climatic shocks. Knowing these factors will assist in devising policies that reduce vulnerability and contribute to more effective disaster risk management (DRM), a crucial and potentially the most important component of climate change adaptation. Using detailed expenditure survey data encompassing one-third of the nation’s population, the study is able to take a micro-perspective of the household, presenting empirical evidence of hardship and vulnerability to shocks that complements the macroeconomic analysis done elsewhere (e.g. Noy 2015, 2016; Cabezon et al. 2015). The work sheds further light on how households are facing and coping with disasters currently. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses the context of Tuvalu, Sect. 3 provides a short survey of the relevant literature on the measurement of poverty and hardship, Sect. 4 discusses Tuvalu’s exposure to disasters, Sect. 5 outlines the empirical methodology, Sect. 6 describes the data, Sect. 7 explains the empirical results, while conclusions are presented in Sect. 8.",8
20.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,28 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0213-1,"Inclusive wealth, total factor productivity, and sustainability: an empirical analysis",October 2018,Masayuki Sato,Kenta Tanaka,Shunsuke Managi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A promising approach for assessing sustainable development focuses on the change of capital in each country. This idea is introduced by Pearce and Atkinson (1993) and called the “capital approach”. After 20 years of research on sustainability assessment using the capital approach, some systematization has been achieved. One of them is summarized in Inclusive Wealth (IW). As Yamaguchi (2016) provides the conceptual detail on IW and related indicators, modifications of theoretical foundation are needed for a more detailed discussion, e.g., optimality of economy, inequality, and population change. However, it is common in capital approach that sustainability, defined as non-declining inclusive wealth, is to maintain man-made capital, human capital, natural capital, and all other types of capital that are sources of human well-being. Non-declining inclusive wealth implies the possibility of non-declining human well-being. The amount of wealth is calculated as the weighted sum of the shadow prices of all types of capital. How the amount of inclusive wealth changes with respect to time—its time differentiation—is sometimes termed “genuine savings” (GS).Footnote 1 The concept of GS is the same as the original capital approach given by Pearce and Atkinson (1993). This concept aims for capturing factors overlooked by the traditional accounting framework. The traditional national accounting focuses on GDP. In addition, the traditional TFP focuses only on the contribution of man-made capital and labor force toward GDP. However, because inclusive wealth does not coincide with GDP, TFP should be measured as the contribution toward inclusive wealth. In addition, for the adjustment of IW by TFP, we need to consider broader capitals as input factors, because IW includes not only economic variables (man-made capital), but also other variables (human and natural capital). Arrow et al. (2004) also suggested that TFP plays an important role in using GS to assess sustainability. Arrow et al. (2004) found the contribution of TFP to inclusive wealth growth rate (i.e., GS per inclusive wealth) to be between − 0.40% (Middle East/North Africa) and 6.33% (China). In addition, Arrow et al. (2012) found the contribution to be between − 2.12% (Venezuela) and 2.71% (China). In both studies, the researchers adopted TFP using the traditional growth accounting techniques (i.e., capital and labor as inputs, and GDP as an output). However, such a GDP-based TFP ignores the effects of human capital and natural capital, which are key variables in their capital approach. As a research considering natural capital, Xepapadeas and Vouvaki (2009) found that the externality of natural capital is important in TFP estimations, which drives the traditional TFP downwards.Footnote 2 However, this research also assumes GDP as output, and the TFP in that paper cannot be used for adjustment of IW. On the other hand, this paper focuses on the effects of TFP on inclusive wealth. By doing so, this paper estimates TFP with consideration of how man-made, human, and natural capital, as well (we call it IW-based TFP). The concept of IW-based TFP is used to show a relationship between capital assets (input) and GS (output). Each country might have different GS values, despite having the same capital assets. On this point, we examine how the level of sustainable development (i.e., the amount of GS) differs among countries with identical input bases. That is, we analyze how these countries differ with respect to the effective utilization of capital assets. Some countries use their endowed capital efficiently with appropriate productivity changes and future-oriented stock consumption schemes, while others do not use their capital as efficiently. As a result, this research provides the sustainability indicator with more careful attention to TFP. In this study, we apply capital asset time-series data to estimate each country’s IW-based TFP, which reflects the change in productivity for man-made, human, and natural capital. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic concepts and previous studies on GS indicators. In Sect. 3, we discuss the model and the data. Section 4 describes the results and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",11
20.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,03 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0214-0,Intellectual property rights protection in the presence of exhaustible resources,October 2018,Takeo Hori,Hiroaki Yamagami,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A scarcity of exhaustible resources is considered a barrier to economic growth, whereas technological change is considered an important factor that breaks this barrier. Accordingly, increasing numbers of studies have constructed growth models that incorporate exhaustible resources and technological change. Stiglitz (1974) uses an exogenous growth model to examine the technological growth rate that overcomes the scarcity of exhaustible resources.Footnote 1 Barbier (1999) employs an endogenous growth model with exhaustible resources to address the same issue. More recent studies use an endogenous growth model with exhaustible resources to examine public policies for attaining perpetual growth and/or optimal growth paths [e.g., Grimaud and Rougé (2003), Grimaud and Rougé (2005), Groth and Schou (2007) and Pittel and Bretschger (2010)]. In particular, these studies focus on fiscal policies such as a resource tax or a subsidy on research and development (R&D) activities. In their analyses, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of innovators of new technologies are assumed to be perfectly protected or omitted. In the real world, IPR protection is not perfect, and therefore, newly developed technologies are often imitated.Footnote 2 Hence, IPR protection plays an important role in innovation. Moreover, many countries face difficulties in introducing new fiscal policies because of increasing cumulative debt and expenditure on social security. Fiscal policies tend to call for political debate on stimulating R&D activity using subsidies and taxes. However, IPR protection does not need fiscal debate. Therefore, we focus on IPR protection as a fundamental innovation policy that can be used to overcome resource scarcity.Footnote 3 If IPR protection alone can sustain perpetual growth and/or achieve an optimal allocation, other policies that are frequently examined in the literature on exhaustible resources may be superfluous. Furthermore, the literature on IPR protection tends to ignore the issue of resource scarcity, in spite of the fact that most economic activities depend on exhaustible resources, either directly or indirectly. Thus, it is worthwhile examining how resource scarcity affects IPR protection policies that promote perpetual growth and optimality. We assume that an exhaustible resource is an essential production factor, as in Stiglitz (1974) and Barbier (1999), among others. As such, we construct a quality-ladder Schumpeterian growth model (cf., Grossman and Helpman 1991, Chapter 4), in which the technological growth rate is determined endogenously. A single final good is produced using intermediate goods. To produce the intermediate goods, firms employ labor and resources.Footnote 4 Research firms conduct R&D activities by employing labor. If firms succeed in their R&D activities, the quality (or productivity) of their intermediate goods improves. Using this model, we show our primary result that strengthening IPR protection accelerates output growth. We then derive the minimum strength of IPR protection that attains perpetual output growth. The minimum level depends on the resource intensity in goods production. Stiglitz (1974) shows that as the resource intensity increases, greater productivity growth is required to overcome the increasing resource scarcity.Footnote 5 Based on this result, it may seem that IPR protection should be strengthened to sustain perpetual output growth if goods production becomes more resource intensive. However, we show that this conjecture is not necessarily correct. Indeed, we show that if production is sufficiently resource intensive, relatively weak IPR protection is sufficient for perpetual growth. This is because higher resource intensity leads to a greater use of resources, relative to labor, in goods production, and thus, greater labor employment in the R&D sector. We also identify a case where even the strongest IPR protection cannot sustain perpetual growth. In this case, additional policies, such as an R&D subsidy, should be introduced. By considering a policy mix that includes IPR protection and an R&D subsidy, we show that these are not necessarily perfectly substitutable options. An R&D subsidy does not promote R&D effort without a minimum strength of IPR protection. This point differentiates our study from those of Grimaud and Rougé (2003, 2005, 2008), who allow for an R&D subsidy only under perfect IPR protection. We also show that the optimal level of IPR protection becomes higher than that in the model without exhaustible resources. Intuitively, when production depends on exhaustible resources, so does consumers’ utility, although indirectly. Optimality then requires a significant use of resources in the current period, and therefore, a high exploration rate of the resources. This can be attained by strengthening IPR protection, because this would accelerate labor employment in the R&D sector and increase resource use in the production sector. Thus, ignoring exhaustible resources may result in inefficient IPR protection and innovation policies. In addition, we examine a case where an IPR protection policy cannot attain optimality on its own.Footnote 6 In this case, an appropriately designed policy mix with an R&D subsidy is needed. Furthermore, we extend the model by introducing a pollution stock, which accumulates with the use of exhaustible resources. Focusing on the steady state, we show that pollution externalities do not affect the optimal level of IPR protection. This result arises because the depreciation rate of the pollution stock is higher than the growth rate of resource use. Then, the growth rates of the pollution stock in the centralized and decentralized economies become identical at the steady state, as long as IPR protection is set at the optimal level of the economy without the pollution stock. Many authors have examined endogenous growth models by introducing exhaustible resources. For example, Barbier (1999), Scholz and Ziemes (1999), and Grimaud and Rougé (2003, 2005, 2008) construct R&D-based endogenous growth models with exhaustible resources, similar to our model. More recently, authors such as Di Maria and Valente (2008), Pittel and Bretschger (2010), and Bretschger and Smulders (2012) incorporate exhaustible resources in models of directed technical change or transformation in industrial structure.Footnote 7 Some of these authors conduct policy analyses that focus on fiscal policies, assuming either perfect IPR protection or not treating it explicitly in their models. Therefore, this study bridges the gap between those using endogenous growth under resource scarcity and those introducing fiscal policies by showing that fiscal policies are needed only in certain cases. In addition, the existing literature on IPR protection does not investigate its role in an economy that faces resource scarcity.Footnote 8
 
Gerlagh et al. (2009, 2014) provide examples that consider a policy mix, including IPR protection, in a framework of environmental externalities. They focus on an emission abatement sector using a dynamic partial equilibrium model with an endogenous change in emission abatement (i.e., end-of-pipe) technologies. However, their approaches are limited in terms of the policy mix because the emission abatement sector demands these technologies only when environmental regulations are imposed, and research firms develop new technologies only when monopoly rents are assured by IPR protection. In contrast, our study considers exhaustible resources that do not cause externalities, and thus, focuses mainly on IPR protection. As such, we examine whether IPR protection can attain perpetual growth and optimality on its own. We regard other fiscal policies as secondary instruments that complement IPR protection. Furthermore, we allow for a general equilibrium containing households and production sectors, and show that there is a trade-off between the production and R&D sectors in terms of labor. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we construct an R&D-based endogenous growth model with exhaustible resources and show the socially optimal growth rates of output and resource extraction. In Sect. 3, we derive the equilibrium, examine the perpetual growth of output with respect to patent breadth, resource intensity and R&D subsidy, and investigate the optimal policy. In Sect. 4, we extend the model by introducing negative externalities from the pollution stock, which accumulate through the use of exhaustible resources. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",1
20.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,18 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0215-z,The impact of trade in environmental goods on pollution: what are we learning from the transition economies’ experience?,October 2018,Natalia Zugravu-Soilita,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, one cannot validate the thesis that trade openness yields both economic and environmental gains. Nevertheless, the case for this thesis seems particularly strong for environmental goods (EGs), which can play an important role in the diffusion of ecological technologies. In this study, we consider as “environmental” those goods produced for the purpose of environmental protection (i.e., preventing, reducing, and eliminating pollution and any other degradation of the environment) as well as resource management (i.e., preserving and maintaining the stock of natural resources and, hence, safeguarding against depletion).Footnote 1 All increases in the availability of EGs through trade openness would represent an opportunity for a “win–win–win” relationship between trade, the environment, and development (Yu, 2007), that is (1) trade in EGs should be facilitated through either the reduction or the elimination of both tariff and non-tariff barriers, allowing for further technology transfers; (2) environmental technologies would, thus, be more widely available, at lower costs, facilitating compliance with stricter environmental regulations; (3) new employment opportunities and added value in eco-industrial, eventually export-oriented, activities should contribute to economic development. Taking into account this triple-win scenario and, thus, considering that EGs could play an essential role in sustainable development, Paragraph 31(3) of the Doha mandate, agreed to by all Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, calls for a reduction (or, as appropriate, elimination) of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on EGs and environmental services. If trade gains from the reduction/removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on EGs are more or less appraised (e.g., World Bank 2007; Hufbauer and Kim 2010; Jha 2008; Balineau and de Melo 2011; Sauvage 2014; Nguyen and Kalirajan 2016),Footnote 2 no empirical study provides an estimation of potential gains (or losses) in income from increased trade in EGs, and the empirical literature on the impact on pollution of trade intensity in EGs is still scarce (e.g., Wooders 2009; de Alwis 2015). Generally based on simplistic models, the existing studies are likely to highlight overly optimistic conclusions about the impact of trade liberalisation of EGs on pollution. Moreover, they rarely discuss the channels through which trade in EGs may influence the quality of the environment. For instance, de Alwis (2015) argues that opening trade in EGs would be associated with declining SO2 emissions, regardless of income levels in the 62 countries considered, and that this negative effect on SO2 emissions would be stronger in the capital-abundant countries. Building policies on such results may be misleading, because only direct effects are explored and no assumption is made about the possible endogeneity problem in the relationship between trade in EGs, income (and/or environmental regulation), and pollution.Footnote 3 It is important, therefore, to analyse not only direct climate change impacts (i.e., on GHG emissions), but also broader (direct and indirect) environmental impacts (e.g., on the quality of water, in addition to air pollution). We should recall that economic literature investigating changes in pollution (e.g., Grossman and Krueger 1993; Copeland and Taylor 1994, 2005; Kagohashi et al. 2015; Levinson 2009; Managi 2011) suggests considering total emissions in a country as the sum of emissions from each economic activity/sector, which may be further written as the total output—i.e., the scale effect—multiplied by each sector’s share in this output—i.e., the composition effect—and the sectors’ emission intensity—i.e., the technique effect. All else being constant, the scale effect measures the increase in emissions when scaling up economic activity (represented by GDP). The composition effect, commonly proxied by the capital-to-labour ratio, reflects the rise (reduction) of pollution due to increased resources devoted to more polluting (cleaner) sectors. Indeed, capital-abundant countries, which have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive activities, are empirically found to be more pollution intensive (see Mani and Wheeler 1998; Antweiler et al. 2001; Cole and Elliott 2003, 2005; Managi et al. 2009). The technique effect is generally captured through per capita income, following insights from the Environmental Kuznets Curve (e.g., Antweiler et al. 2001) and/or various proxies for emission intensities, such as measures of pollutant emissions (e.g., Xing and Kolstad 2002), energy use (e.g., Zarsky 1999; Eskeland and Harrison 2003; Cole et al. 2005), pollution abatement costs (e.g., Keller and Levinson, 2002; Henderson and Millimet 2007; Manderson and Kneller 2012), and indices of environmental regulations’ stringency (e.g., Javorcik and Wei 2004; Ben Kheder and Zugravu 2012; Zugravu-Soilita 2017). Finally, a country’s trade openness (both overall and, in particular, trade in EGs) can affect pollution by (1) increasing economic growth through tariff reduction (scale effect); (2) shifting production from pollution-intensive to more ecological goods, or vice versa (composition effect); and (3) promoting the diffusion and the use of technological innovations (technique effect). Thus, trade is a key variable in explaining the changes in pollution and, together with income and environmental regulations, it should be treated as endogenous (see Harbaugh et al. 2002; Copeland and Taylor 2004; Frankel and Rose 2005; Kagohashi et al. 2015; Managi et al. 2009). In this study, our focus is not on the overall trade openness of a countryFootnote 4 but on the environmental impact of trade in a distinctive category of products—the EGs—that are supposed to have a direct technique effect on emissions because of the scope of their final use (see Sect. 2). Indeed, increased availability of EGs through trade liberalisation should make it much easier and, eventually, less costly for firms to comply with environmental standards. Hence, polluting firms in the developing countries, mainly importers of EGs, should probably increase their pollution-abatement efforts because of the reduced prices resulting from decreased import tariffs (ICTSD 2008). Moreover, this reduction in environmental compliance costs could encourage local governments to establish more ambitious environmental regulations—i.e., an indirect environmental regulation-induced technique effect on pollution. Literature investigating the environmental policy design in the context of EGs’ trade liberalisation is mainly theoretical and quite rich (e.g., Feess and Muehlheusser 1999, 2002; Copeland 2005; Canton et al. 2008; Greaker and Rosendahl 2008; David et al. 2011; Nimubona 2012; Sauvage 2014). Although stringent environmental regulations should lead to more environmental R&D by domestic firms and increased export market share of the domestic eco-industry (see Costantini and Mazzanti 2012; Feess and Muehlheusser 2002), Greaker (2006) and Greaker and Rosendahl (2008) suggest that this increase in demand for EGs from the domestic polluting industry may benefit foreign eco-firms at the expense of the domestic eco-industry. Thus, governments of small open economies wishing to develop new successful export-oriented eco-firms would not be likely to set especially stringent environmental regulations. Moreover, Nimubona (2012) shows that reduced trade tariffs on EGs might actually reduce the stringency of pollution taxes, which can result in increased pollution levels. The author suggests that, when (reduced) import tariffs on EGs cannot sufficiently extract rents generated by stringent environmental regulation for an imperfectly competitive eco-industry, the “government regulator in an EG-importing country strategically lessens the stringency of environmental regulation to maximise domestic social welfare”. In addition, recent theoretical studies (Perino 2010; Bréchet and Ly 2013; Dijkstra and Mathew 2016) find that, despite increasing the expected cleanliness of production, EGs’ trade liberalisation may finally increase overall pollution though a ‘backfire effect’ (rebound effect exceeding 100%), that is, total pollution would increase because more production is allowed by the government enjoying the opportunity for cleaner production (i.e., the trade-induced scale effect offsetting the technique effect). Furthermore, if production of particular EGs is pollution intensive, countries enjoying these EGs’ export opportunities from trade liberalisation could also see their pollution increase (i.e., the trade-induced composition effect). We will further qualify the last two adverse effects as direct scale-composition effects from trade in EGs. Finally, exporters of EGs should benefit from getting new markets as the result of tariff reductions; this would contribute to economic development by creating more employment and income in eco-industrial activities, allowing for an indirect income-induced technique effect of trade in EGs on pollution. Indeed, income can have a technique effect on environmental quality through two channels: first, it can have a direct effect via consumers’ richness and their willingness-to-pay for the environment, thus reducing pollution during consumption; second, it can have an indirect effect via environmental policy, i.e., by requiring more environmental protection and, therefore, stricter environmental standards. We should then mention that EGs’ import tariffs can play at least two roles in countries that are either not producing EGs or are non-competitive producers. First, EGs’ import tariffs can contribute to welfare improvement because they permit the importing country to retain a portion of the revenues of international eco-industrial firms. Second, according to the literature on the determinants of foreign direct investments, tariffs can lead to technology transfer via investments into eco-industrial activities.Footnote 5 Thus, removal of tariff barriers in a net EG importing country can lead to a loss of income and, thus, to a lower demand for environmental quality. The originality of this study relies on the empirical investigation of the causal, both direct and indirect, effects of trade intensity in EGs on air and water pollution (CO2, SO2, and BOD) by treating trade, environmental policy, and income as endogenous and, thus, adopting the instrumental variable approach in a system of simultaneous equations. The contribution of this study is to highlight some political implications (e.g., in terms of EGs’ trade liberalisation), enabling us to see the good (or bad) of EGs’ trade intensity by investigating its overall environmental effect, each of its direct scale-composition or technique effects, and its indirect environmental regulation- and income-induced effects. Moreover, we estimate these effects for specific categories of EGs, for example, cleaner technologies and products, end-of-pipe products, and environmentally preferable products (see Sect. 2). For instance, one can expect stronger direct technique effects for imports of end-of-pipe products (as the latter represent direct additional capacity in pollution abatement at home), but higher indirect income-induced effects for exports of such goods (enjoying new/increased markets for high value-added activities). Since trade liberalisation of EGs is expected to increase both imports and exports of EGs, with different (even opposite) channels at work, focusing on a specific flow (EGs imports or exports) would prevent us from estimating the overall environmental effect of trade intensity in EGs.Footnote 6
 We have chosen to work on a sample of countries from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union for several reasons. First, although the Member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) represent the major share of the EGs’ market, the fastest growth rates during the last decade occurred in the developing and the transition economies (Kennett and Steenblik 2005). Since EGs’ import tariffs are relatively low in the industrialised countries, an alternative approach to obtain highly ‘visible’ effects on pollution of EGs’ trade openness (i.e., stronger statistical inference) would consist of finding a ‘natural experiment’ for trade in the EGs–pollution relationship. For instance, the investigation of transition economies from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), between 1995 and 2003, should enable a proper identification of the effects of trade liberalisation, because these countries opened their economies quickly and consistently and experienced strong reductions in pollution levels during the same period (e.g., an 18% decrease in CO2 from industrial activities). In addition, increased EGs’ trade intensity because of the collapse of the Soviet Union and, thus, rushed openness to the world economy due to exogenous factors (unrelated to pollution levels) should be less subject to endogeneity bias. Finally, as stressed in Sect. 2, empirical investigation of EGs’ trade has some limits linked to difficulties in defining and classifying the EGs in the international harmonised system (HS). HS categories at the six-digit level do not allow the designation of specific goods that are really deemed climate friendly, and some designated goods present the ‘double-use’ problem (i.e., the existence of products with multiple uses, some of which are not environmental). Moreover, six-digit HS codes experienced some revisions (1996, 2002), and countries around the world adopted the new codes (some countries still use old codes) to different degrees (delays). Our dataset focused on the transition countries enables us to avoid biases related to aggregation and unobserved heterogeneity.Footnote 7
 Consequently, and more precisely, this study seeks to investigate the impact on CO2, SO2, and BOD of trade intensity in EGs in the transition economies between 1995 and 2003 using instrumental variables for trade intensity in EGsFootnote 8 in a system of three simultaneous equations that explain pollution, environmental regulation stringency, and per-capita income. We employ a theoretical framework inspired by Grossman (1995) and Antweiler et al. (2001) for the pollution equation (distinguishing between scale, composition, and technique effects), the main theoretical assumptions of some recent studies on environmental policy design (e.g., Damania et al. 2003; Fredriksson et al. 2005; Greaker and Rosendahl 2008), and the endogenous growth literature (see, for example, Mankiw et al. 1992; Frankel and Romer 1999) for income equation. This paper is structured as follows. Following this introduction of our research objectives and the literature on trade in EGs, Sect. 2 presents definitions of EGs and stylised facts about our country sample. Section 3 specifies the model to be estimated, and Sect. 4 presents the estimation strategy and data. We discuss the basic empirical results, some robustness tests, and extended empirical findings in Sects. 5 and 6. The last section presents our conclusions and the policy implications.",20

To achieve this overall target, the EU Member States have committed themselves to national renewables’ targets (European Commission 2015a). In October 2014, the EU further enhanced the scope of its climate and energy targets for both 2020 and 2030; its 2030 policy framework sets a minimum target of 27% in respect to renewable energy sources as well as energy savings by 2030 (European Commission 2014). At EU level, renewable energy’s share of the gross final energy consumption has grown over time, e.g., from about 9% in 2005 to roughly 16% in 2014 (European Commission 2015b). Moreover, on the technological side, the development is rapid. The number of renewable energy patent applications filed for at the European Patent Office (EPO) has increased annually by more than 20% in the recent years, while the average increase for other technologies only was around 6% (EPO 2016). However, the renewable energy outcomes in individual EU Member States are heterogeneous, with substantial capacity and patenting increase in some countries and far more modest developments in others (IEA 2014a; Strömberg 2013).Footnote 1 These diverging pathways may give rise to concerns about an unfair burden-sharing among EU countries. Such concerns are likely to be a particularly thorny issue, if they are accompanied by diverging efforts to develop the associated new technology, e.g., through private as well as public research and development (R&D) activities. The objective of this paper, therefore, is to investigate whether or not per capita renewable energy patent applications in the renewable energy field have converged (or diverged) across EU Member States. The econometric analyses rely on data on per capita patent applications in 13 EU countries during 1990–2012. In this empirical context, convergence (Latin convergere—meet, unite) would imply that countries with lower initial per capita patent application production levels would experience relatively higher growth rates in patenting activity than other countries, thereby eventually closing in on the countries that have been forerunners in this field. Since the knowledge generated in one EU country is largely a public good from which several countries can benefit at the same time, one could argue that convergence among the countries in terms of patenting outcomes is not important. However, there are both political and economic arguments for why such convergence may be desirable. The political motives relate to the importance of maintaining public acceptance for the financial burdens that consumers in the EU carry when the energy system is transformed. This transformation largely derives from key EU directives, and it requires the participation of all Member States. For instance, evaluations of the prospects for wind power expansion have stressed the importance of public acceptance in combination with political stability and legal aspects (e.g., Söderholm et al. 2007). If some countries perceive that other countries are free-riding on their development efforts, and that they, therefore, have to carry a disproportional part of such efforts, the overall EU energy and climate policy targets will potentially be more difficult and costly to achieve (Corradini et al. 2015).Footnote 2
 The economic arguments for convergence in patenting outcomes are multifold. In order for a country to respond to changes in external constraints, it needs to be equipped with adequate scientific and technological knowledge, i.e., a country needs so-called absorptive capacity. Here absorptive capacity concerns countries’ abilities to absorb knowledge developed abroad (Antonelli 2008; Antonelli and Quatraro 2010; Costantini and Crespi 2008a, b; Dosi et al. 1988; Fagerberg et al. 2005; Rennings, 2000). Hence, international technology flows crucially depend on the destination country’s ability to comprehend—and make use of—external knowledge (Mancusi 2008). The ability to generate value from the presence of technological spillovers, such as knowledge on how to adopt, adapt and implement new renewable energy technology, will in turn be a function of the country’s experience in relevant R&D (Cohen and Levinthal 1989). The importance of absorptive capacity may, therefore, support a scenario of convergence of renewable energy development activities across countries. Following Kerstens and Managi (2012), the issue of convergence/divergence has important implications for growth theory where there is a possibility that there is non-convexity in the production function. In production analysis convexity is typically assumed. However, several empirical studies point at a possibility of industries where convexity does not hold (e.g., Tone and Sahoo 2003). Kerstens and Managi (2012) found that non-convexity may exist in the petroleum field and hence possibly in other fields (such as electricity generation), hence we should not take the convexity for granted. Hence, if the convexity in the production possibility set cannot be taken for granted, then there are reasons to expect the possibility of divergence instead of convergence. Bosetti et al. (2008) found that the strongest technological free-riding effects with regard to renewable energy occur among high-income countries. These countries are more able than low-income countries to expose themselves to the international exchange of new ideas and, thus, gain greater benefits in terms of potential investment savings. Countries that are less developed economically and technologically often face barriers that prevent them from absorbing international knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, the speed of innovation in the renewable energy sector will be higher, if more countries are engaged in R&D and invention activities (Costantini and Crespi 2013; Costantini et al. 2015). Given the urgency of addressing the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the relatively rapid development of low-cost, carbon-free technologies will be of great value. The research question, namely whether or not renewable energy patent applications per capita have converged or diverged, is addressed empirically by performing several types of convergence tests. Conditional β-convergence is tested first, i.e., convergence after the differences in the steady states across countries has been controlled for. This type of conditional convergence is tested by regressing average growth rates on the initial level (while controlling for other exogenous factors). Thereafter, a distributional dynamics approach is employed to test for so-called σ-convergence (the narrowing of the distribution), i.e., to show whether the dispersion of per capita renewable energy patent applications across the EU countries tends to decline over time. In the next step, we analyse how the distribution changes over time. Finally, the γ-convergence (i.e., movement within the distribution) test results are presented, revealing the changes in an index of rank concordance. The main contribution of this paper is its novelty—in terms of data, time period and estimation approach—with respect of investigating convergence in an important field of sustainable economic growth, i.e., the development of renewable energy technology. This issue has so far not been investigated in the form proposed. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, previous environmental convergence research and technological change literature are reviewed. Section 3 presents the methods applied. Section 4 presents the data used, and discusses the use of patent applications as a proxy for invention activities. Section 5 synthesises the empirical findings from the various convergence models and discusses the results. The paper ends with Sect. 6, which summarises the key conclusions and outlines suggestions for future research.",12

Leakage would then erode the effectiveness of climate regulations and undermine national industrial interests, i.e., competitiveness. Carbon leakage is one of the main arguments against more ambitious climate policies. Despite an intuitive appeal, empirically evaluating the leakage mechanism has proven difficult. The same applies to the impact of environmental regulation and international trade flows more generally, i.e., ‘pollution havens’, of which carbon policy leakage is a special case. An issue at the heart of this discussion is the impact of environmental regulation on the location of pollution-intensive production. Counter-intuitive empirical findings have undermined efforts to build the consensus required to develop appropriate policy responses. In this paper, we examine the impact of increasing energy prices on firm offshoring activities. Changes in offshoring activities are one measure of carbon leakage: domestic climate policy increases the cost of domestic energy and induces firms to substitute towards cheaper inputs produced in a foreign region unconstrained by climate policy. This would then lead to an increase in imports. This increase in imports results in carbon leakage if firms substitute towards imports that have a higher carbon intensity than in-house or domestically produced inputs. The magnitude of this offshoring effect is an open empirical issue.Footnote 1 We develop a simple model of trade in intermediate inputs, which illustrates that energy-intense firms may decrease imports if it is sufficiently difficult to substitute between domestic- and foreign-sourced inputs as domestic energy prices rise. Two countervailing forces determine the firm’s import response. The first is the substitution effect, where higher domestic energy prices induce firms to substitute towards foreign-sourced inputs for a given level of firm output.Footnote 2 This effect alone would lead a firm to increase its imports, for a given level of the firm’s output. The second is the scale effect, where higher domestic energy prices result in higher production costs that reduces the firm’s optimal level of output, which in turn results in a reduction in firm demand for foreign-sourced inputs. The strength of the scale effect increases when a firm cannot fully mitigate the domestic factor price shock by substituting towards foreign-sourced inputs. This would be the case if substitution between domestic and imported factors was difficult due to the cost of reconfiguring supply chains, for example. Moreover, energy-intensive firms have a higher exposure to domestic energy price shocks, suggesting that the scale effect could dominate for these firms. Imports by the most energy-intense firms would thereby decrease with a domestic energy price increase. Contrasting the relative importance of the scale and substitution effect for different firm energy intensities is a novel empirical issue and is the focus of our study. We test our prediction with rich firm-level data covering the universe of Swedish manufacturing firms, and the products imported by each firm described at the six-digit combined nomenclature (CN) product level over the period 2001–2008 inclusive. An uncommon feature of the data is that we observe firm-level annual expenditures on, and quantities of, purchased electricity, which allows us to compute the unit value electricity price (EP) for each firm. We exploit an unprecedented rise in EPs from 2003 onwards as the EP paid by Swedish firms quickly caught up to the European OECD average due to several factors. This increase began with a particularly dry summer in 2002, which constrained hydro-power production in the winter of 2003. This rise in EPs was sustained due a combination of factors, such as sporadic closures of nuclear power production in Sweden, the impact of the Emissions Trading System, and also the gradual integration of the Nordic electricity network with continental Europe. Since the electricity market in Sweden is deregulated and firms can hedge, the sharp and sustained rise in spot market prices resulted in a corresponding, albeit heterogeneous, increase in EPs paid by Swedish firms, including heavy, energy-intensive manufacturing industries exposed to import competition. Our empirical approach exploits idiosyncratic, EP variation between firms and within firms over time, variation in the electricity intensity of individual firms, and the heterogeneity of imported products to identify the impact of the electricity price increase on imports. This makes it possible to construct a highly dis-aggregated estimate of the domestic electricity use avoided by a firm through the use of imported products, disentangle the effects that determine a firm’s import decision, and identify the impact of the electricity price increase on the quantity of imports at the product level. Swedish electricity is produced predominantly without fossil fuel, e.g., hydro-power and nuclear power. An increase in importing resulting from higher electricity prices is, therefore, likely to increase global emissions as production is moved abroad to jurisdictions where electricity production is more carbon-intensive. Hence, our study clarifies a mechanism through which a change in the domestic energy price affects imports, and the potential for carbon policy leakage. This study is the first, that we are aware of, to examine this particular leakage mechanism using firm-product-level data. Our regressions show that for the most electricity-intense firms,Footnote 3 an increase in a firm’s EP results in a decline of the firm’s imports. In the top electricity intensity quartile, a 30% increase in the firm’s EP leads the firm to decrease the quantity of an imported product by 5%. This effect is statistically significant, although the economic magnitude of the effect is small. This suggests that the scale effect dominates the substitution effect for energy intense firms. In contrast, for firms in the second electricity intensity quartile, a 30% increase in the firm’s EP leads the firm to increase the quantity imported product by 2.5%. There are several potential reasons why we find quantitatively small impacts. First, the largest and most electricity-intense firms likely engaged in hedging strategies that insulated themselves against the rise in electricity prices. Second, firms may not have believed the increase in electricity prices to be permanent and thus opted to not pursue any adaptations. In this sense, our estimates may be viewed as a lower bound on impact of a carbon tax on leakage. A third reason is that firms may pass-through the marginal cost shock. Our paper contributes to the literature on carbon leakage by studying a channel that acts through firm-level offshoring of intermediate stages of production. There is relatively little evidence of the importance of this channel. An exception is a recent contribution by Cole et al. (2017) using Japanese firm-level data to study the “pollution outsourcing hypothesis”.Footnote 4 In their study, it is outsourcing that causes a reduction in the carbon emissions of the firm. In contrast, our study uses the increase in electricity prices to estimate the firm’s propensity to import inputs. Evidence of carbon leakage via trade flows and pollution havens more generally is inconclusive in the previous studies. Larger and more significant trade flow effects are found for less pollution-intensive industries, see Ederington et al. (2005), Levinson and Taylor (2008), and Levinson (2010). An explanation that has been put forward is that pollution-intensive industries tend to be relatively immobile, while less pollution-intensive industries tend to be more labor-intensive and geographically “footloose”. We examine this mechanism and find some support for this effect, although it does not affect the robustness of our findings. There are a few econometric studies of carbon leakage. The evidence for climate policy leakage is an open empirical question that ex post-studies of leakage are few, and that ex ante studies lead to widely differing results (Monjon and Quirion 2010). Econometric studies have not revealed the carbon leakage predicted by ex ante, computable general equilibrium models (Branger and Quirion 2014). Aldy and Pizer (2015) infer the impact of a future unilateral 15 USD per ton \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) price on domestic US production and net imports using variation in historical energy prices, an econometric approach that is similar to ours, although their analysis uses sector-level data. Their data cover 450 US industries at the 4-digit industry level. They find small effects on net imports. They also find that energy-intensive firms do not respond to higher energy prices by proportionally consuming more imports. An econometric analysis by Aichele and Felbermayr (2015) estimates the degree of carbon leakage resulting from the Kyoto Protocol with sectoral trade data and emission data covering fifteen sectors and forty countries. Their estimates suggest that Kyoto has led to leakage: an increase of 8% in the embodied carbon of imports from non-committed to committed countries.Footnote 5 They find the largest leakage effects in the more carbon-intensive sectors.Footnote 6 In contrast, Chevallier and Philippe Quirion (2017) conduct an econometric analysis of carbon leakage resulting from the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) on the cement and steel sectors. They find no evidence that the EU ETS has had any effect on net imports in these energy-intensive sectors. The econometric study of carbon leakage is conceptually distinct from studies of carbon leakage using calibrated simulations of future climate policy (computable general equilibrium models). These approaches have been deployed to provide aggregate ex ante estimates of leakage, and predictions vary with the parameterization of the models. There are a large number of papers in this area of the literature, and most studies find that climate policy will result in some positive level of leakage, especially for energy-intensive trade-exposed primary good sectors, e.g., the metals, cement, glass, and chemicals. Branger and Quirion (2014) review this literature. Our results are complementary to Baylis et al. (2014), who show analytically that a carbon cost shock can lead to “negative leakage”. While our empirical results provide support for the idea of negative leakage, the mechanism that we test differs from their work. In Baylis et al. (2014), the negative leakage mechanism is a general equilibrium effect: the taxed sector substitutes away from carbon into clean inputs, the clean input becomes more scarce, shrinking the other sector and thereby reducing its emissions. We focus on a mechanism where substitution between domestic inputs and “dirty” foreign inputs is difficult, which affects the firm’s marginal cost and thereby the firm’s demand for foreign inputs. This is a firm-level effect, but, in aggregate, it could lead to negative leakage. The paper continues with a conceptual framework in Sect. 2, followed by a description of the Swedish electricity market in Sect. 3. The data and descriptive statistics are discussed in Sect. 4; the empirical specification and the main results of the analysis are described in Sect. 5. The conclusion is drawn in Sect. 6.",7
21.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,05 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0220-2,Discriminatory tax and subsidy on environmental behaviors,January 2019,Yoshinori Wada,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines the consumption tax and subsidy on green and dirty products in the market. In our model, consumers behave differently in terms of environmental awareness, and a firm can supply a variety of products that affect differently environmental change, and the tax or subsidy is set. This setup of our model has often been employed in previous studies on environmental tax and subsidy. Cremer and Thisse (1999) suggest that an ad valorem tax may improve welfare, even though the quality creates a positive externality. Morage-Gonzalez and Padron-Fumero (2002) investigate uniform and non-uniform product charges, and technology subsidization in the duopolistic market. Bansal and Gangopadhyay (2003) show that while a discriminatory subsidy policy reduces total pollution and enhances aggregate welfare, a discriminatory tax policy may increase total pollution and reduce welfare. Lombardini-Riiponen (2005) reveals that a uniform ad valorem tax with an emission tax or a subsidy to consumers choosing the green goods can lead to the social optimum. Bansal (2008) indicates that as the level of negative externalities increases, the optimal policy shifts from a tax to a subsidy policy. Matsukawa (2012) discovers that an emission tax always dominates a subsidy, by applying a discrete–continuous model of consumer choice. These preceding studies found types of desirable environmental policies, but did not examine precisely the relationships between private companies and public bodies, who set policy instruments in the market, and did not contemplate difficulties in dealing with consumers’ environmental awareness. We will analyze theoretically the relationship between a private firm and a regulator, and consumers’ environmental awareness as hidden characteristic. To investigate optimal taxation or subsidization for environmentally aware consumers, we develop the model in Mussa and Rosen (1978) that investigates the monopoly’s pricing behavior with product differentiation, by incorporating externalities and policy instruments into their analysis. Our model illustrates current manufacturing industries in which products are highly differentiated and environmental technology is highly developed by dominant firms. Furthermore, our analysis deals with an environmental regulatory practice in which private companies are obliged to report environmental qualities within their products and consumers are taxed or subsidized. Baron and Myerson (1982) analyze a regulatory policy by applying an incentive scheme, in which a regulator as principal and a regulated monopoly as agent are designed. Baron (1985) analyzes a nonlocalized pollution externality, in which a public utilities’ commission and an environmental protection regulator are principals and they provide different types of regulation to a monopolist as agent. He assumes that the environmental protection regulator acts as a von Stackelberg leader and hence can choose its pollution control policy as if it knew the agent’s hidden information, because the public utilities’ commission as a follower designs an incentive contract subject to the agent’s hidden information. This approach of sharing hidden information in Baron (1985) is applied to our analysis of implementing policy instruments. Thomas (1995) and Aggarwal and Lichtenberg (2005) also investigate desirable environmental policies in the incentive scheme and suggest the importance of policy combination. Their analysis considers properly hidden information, however, their regulatory setting does not reflect current tax or subsidy policies on consumption in the market. We reveal that a higher rate of a subsidy should be chosen not for eco-friendlier consumers, but for less eco-friendly consumers and a combination of a tax and subsidy is optimal when a low level of negative externalities exists. Such retrogressive subsidization for eco-friendly behaviors differs from the current progressive tax benefit policy in the Japanese automobile industry, in which automobile taxes are discounted more for eco-friendlier cars. On the other hand, studies that analyze environmental policies and prosocial behaviors might support our theoretical result. For example, Kallbekken et al. (2011) reveal that the behavior of Pigouvian tax aversion is generally observed and inequality of revenue recycling may inspire support for Pigouvian tax. Ariely et al. (2009) suggest that the tax benefit for hybrid cars damages the signaling value vested in hybrid cars and therefore is not a desirable policy to facilitate the adoption of a new environmentally friendly technology. Banerjee and Schogren (2012) contemplate the crowding out effect of monetary rewards on prosocial behavior and show that good reputation makes the landowner contribute more than the optimal level of private land for species protection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the basic framework of the model for price discrimination with externalities and discriminatory policy instruments. Section 3 derives the optimal incentive scheme and Sect. 4 characterizes the discriminatory policy instrument and derives welfare loss caused by an optimal uniform policy instrument. Section 5 summarizes our findings and points out the ways of developing our analysis.",3
21.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,11 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0221-1,Natural disaster mitigation through voluntary donations in a developing country: the case of Bangladesh,January 2019,Shibly Shahrier,Koji Kotani,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Voluntary donation is regarded as one of the major sources for public goods provision in many developed countries. For instance, in USA, the government has implemented complacent tax policy to voluntary donation for promoting philanthropy since 1917. This illustrates that philanthropy is an important activity in USA and has played a vital role to provide various social needs along with the government (Brown and Lankford 1992; Beldad et al. 2015). Likewise, in Europe, many types of charities have been organized to meet diverse social challenges (Wright 2001; Wiepking 2009; Bauer et al. 2013; Beldad et al. 2015). Voluntary donation activities have taken different forms in developed countries, and a number of researches have analyzed various voluntary donations in USA and Europe (Brown and Lankford 1992; Wright 2001; Wilhelm et al. 2008; Wiepking 2009; Bauer et al. 2013; Wiepking et al. 2014; Beldad et al. 2015). However, only a few number of works have studied voluntary donation behaviors in developing countries. It is important to characterize voluntary donations in developing countries mainly for two reasons. First, it adds some extra knowledge to the literature since voluntary donation behaviors in developing countries could be different from those of developed countries. For instance, the necessity of research focusing on developing countries is pointed out by Henrich et al. (2010). Second, it might contribute to some imperative public problems in developing countries. For instance, natural disaster and climatic changes are the major threats for many developing countries, and collective disaster mitigation plan is claimed to be urgent (Emanuel 2005; Schiermeier 2011b, a). In the process of mitigation planning and implementation, local people’s cooperation is essential, and disaster mitigation cannot be sustainable without their voluntary participation and donation (Mileti 1999; Dorcey and McDaniels 2001; Godschalk et al. 2003; Pearce 2003). Therefore, we characterize voluntary donation behaviors in a developing country, Bangladesh, for natural disaster mitigation. In any voluntary activities, labor and money donations are the most conventional practices (Bauer et al. 2013). These two are important measures for people’s cooperation to disaster mitigation activities. Moreover, voluntary labor donation is expected to be high considering an economic structure in the disaster-susceptible area of developing countries such as Bangladesh. This expectation is in line with other disaster mitigation or recovery cases in other countries. For instance, labor donation was a major force for the recovery of the 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan and the 2004 Tsunami of the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia (see, e.g.,Munro et al. 2017, for the details of economic incidences and situations in great Tohoku earthquake in Japan). Despite its importance, labor donation for natural disaster mitigation has not been addressed in the literature. Thus, we incorporate labor donation in addition to money donation in the analysis. A notable number of past works characterize voluntary donation behaviors in USA and Europe, considering labor and money as the two major channels (see, e.g.,Menchik and Weisbrod 1987; Brown and Lankford 1992; Duncan 1999; Feldman 2010; Cappellari et al. 2011; Bauer et al. 2013). These studies generally find a positive relationship between income and money donation as well as between income and labor donation. Consequently, the overall donation is identified to increase in USA and Europe when household income rises. The same tendency applies to education in the sense that more educated people donate more of both labor and money for charitable activities. Another focus in the literature on labor and money donations is the effect of price of donations. Brown and Lankford (1992) discover a complementary relationship between money and labor donations with respect to the price of money giving (opportunity cost for time such as wage) in USA. Duncan (1999) develops a theoretical model in which labor and money donations are perfectly substituted with respect to the price of money giving in the equilibrium, whereas his empirical result shows that labor and money donations change in the same direction, i.e, complementarity. On the other hand, Feldman (2010) has found that labor and money donations are substitutes. In European contexts, Cappellari et al. (2011) find complementary relation between labor and money donations, whereas Bauer et al. (2013) establish substitutability relation with respect to opportunity cost of time. In summary, labor and money donations have a tendency to change in the same direction with respect to income and education, but not necessarily with respect to the price of money giving in USA or European countries. In the context of natural disaster mitigation, there are only a few works that analyze voluntary donations toward collective disaster mitigation. Markantonis et al. (2013) elicit willingness to pay for avoiding the damage of severe flooding in Greece, and find that experts and hunters are willing to pay more than farmers. Luo and Levi (2013) analyze the determinants to induce participation for collective disaster mitigation programs in China. They report that farmers usually pay a lot of attention to non-engineering practices of mitigation rather than to engineering practices. Their actual willingness to participate is identified to be quite low, although education and professional skills can positively influence the decision to participate. Similar to Markantonis et al. (2013), Ghanbarpouret al. (2014) elicit and analyze people’s willingness to pay toward flood management in relation to risk perception and socioeconomic factors in Iran. They conclude that the willingness to pay is higher for those who have high income and high level of risk perception.Footnote 1 
 Islam et al. (2016) have analyzed the relationship between the willingness to pay for flood controls and perceptions to climate change, demonstrating that people who have correct perceptions to climate change tend to have the higher willingness to pay.Footnote 2 No past literature has addressed voluntary donations to natural disaster mitigation, considering both labor and money donations within a single framework. Also, there is no previous research to characterize voluntary donations toward disaster mitigation in the developing countries, such as Bangladesh. Nevertheless, given increased threats of natural disasters and climatic changes, organizing a collective countermeasure by means of voluntary donation is urgent and an important policy agenda.Footnote 3 Given this state of affairs, we examine voluntary donation behavior in a developing country, and characterize both labor and money donations with a specific eye on natural disaster mitigation. To this end, we conducted an open-ended contingent valuation (hereafter, CVM) survey of 1000 households and elicited: (1) willingness to pay money (hereafter, money donation) and (2) willingness to donate labor (hereafter, labor donation) to collective cyclonic disaster mitigation in a cyclone-susceptible area of Bangladesh. Since voluntary activities have never been organized for disaster mitigation and such data are not available in Bangladesh, we rely on elicited labor and money donations as a proxy of real donations to cyclonic disaster mitigation. For valuing public goods such as the demand for disaster mitigation, use of CVM has been established to be one of the best ways (see, e.g., Mitchell and Carson 1988; Alberini and Kahn 2009; Cooper et al. 2004; Martin-Ortega et al. 2011; Markantonis et al. 2013; Ghanbarpouret al. 2014; Proufoun et al. 2016; Hamed et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2016; Verbic et al. 2016; Khanal et al. 2018). With these data, we analyze labor and money donations in relation to major socioeconomic variables, such as income, education, family structure, age and occupation, using bivariate probit and Tobit regressions.",4

One side of the spectrum argues that taking environmental aspects into account will come at the expense of economic activity; the opposing side claiming that considering environmental issues will unlock additional growth potential (e.g., Porter and Van Der Linde 1995; Jaffe et al. 1996). As part of this debate, materials have received increasing attention because of their vital role in production processes as well as their association with environmental pressures (UNEP IRP 2011; Bahn-Walkowiak and Steger 2015). As such, materials feature prominently in policy making, especially in the context of the European Union (EU). One stream of material policies in the EU focuses on their strategic role as inputs to the production function (EC 2008, 2010). Another stream relates materials to environmental pressures (EC 2011a, 2015a). Irrespectively of different foci, material policies in the EU are motivated by combining both economic and environmental objectives. Specifically, material policies aim to increase the material productivity of firms which is claimed to improve firms’ competitiveness and reduce associated environmental pressures. This assertion has gone hand-in-hand with substantial capital being directed into investment projects intending to improve material productivity.Footnote 1 The existing literature finds that material productivity positively affects competitiveness (and associated measures) while reducing environmental pressures (Fh-ISI et al. 2005; Bleischwitz et al. 2009b; Schmidt and Schneider 2010; Ecorys 2011; Schröter et al. 2011; Bassi et al. 2012; AMEC and Bio IS 2013; Cooper et al. 2016; Gilbert et al. 2016). However, such investigations have two main shortcomings. First, they fail to systematically account for dynamic effects and heterogeneity across firms, sectors, and countries, as findings are largely based on case studies, thus limiting the results’ transferability. Second, empirical studies lack to adequately address the potential endogeneity of material productivity, which could arise because material productivity is argued to increase firms’ competitiveness, while more competitive firms are also more likely to be more material productive (Videras and Alberini 2000; Calantone et al. 2002; Aghion et al. 2005). Not addressing endogeneity causes coefficients to be biased and inconsistent (Angrist and Pischke 2009). In this paper, we address the first shortcoming by considering the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for the years 2006–2008, which comprises over 52,000 firms across 23 sectors of the so-called business economy and 12 EU member states.Footnote 2 We address shortcoming two by applying an instrumental variable approach using the availability of public financial support for eco-innovations (i.e., innovations with an environmental benefit) as an instrument for material productivity improvements. Interpreting our results in the spirit of the local average treatment effect (LATE) Theorem, our findings provide evidence for a positive and causal impact of increases in material productivity on microeconomic competitiveness for those firms that had an eco-innovation stimulated by public funding. However, the effect is limited to certain sectors and countries, raising the concern that not all firms, sectors, and countries are likely to benefit from increasing material productivity. We further show that such material productivity improvements also reduce the firms’ carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint, thus achieving both economic and environmental objectives for particular firms, sectors, and countries. Hence, we provide empirically robust evidence in support of eco-innovations, in particular those leading to material productivity improvements, since they are likely to be beneficial for firms’ competitiveness (in particular in some material-intensive sectors and a few European economies) as well as firms’ environmental performance. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and identifies channels linking material productivity and microeconomic competitiveness. Section 3 describes the modelling approach and instrumentation strategy. Section 4 introduces the data and Sect. 5 outlines the results, including robustness checks. Section 6 provides evidence for the environmental benefits of material productivity increases, Sect. 7 discusses the findings, and Sect. 8 concludes.",14

While this share was less than that of the industrial (33.7%) and transportation (17.7%) sectors, it is noteworthy that household emissions dramatically increased by 39.2% from 1990 to 2015, in sharp contrast to the rise in emissions from other sectors (− 15.6% for industrial and 3.9% for transport). The primary reason for this change is the increasing demand for household electricity. EDMC (2016) shows the changes in the share of household energy consumption from 1970 to 2014. Electricity accounted for approximately 48.7% of the total energy consumption in 2014, followed by oil (19.8%) and city gas (19.7%); more specifically, electricity demand in 2014 recorded its highest increase since 1970 (the shares of electricity, oil, and city gas in 1970 were 25.0, 31.2, and 16.1%, respectively). The use of air conditioners accounts for a significant proportion of household electricity consumption, especially in summer and winter.Footnote 1 In fact, electricity consumption by air conditioners during peak summer and winter hours was estimated to be about 60% (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 2013) of household electricity consumption. Energy efficiency of home appliances has improved considerably in the past few decades in Japan. Figure 1 shows the transition of both the Annual Performance Factor (APF)Footnote 2 and the electricity consumption of representative new energy-efficient air conditioner models in each year. There has been significant reduction (45.3%) in the electricity consumption of new air conditioners in Japan between 1995 and 2016, as Fig. 1 shows. Even though the change in the last decade was modest (7.5% between 2006 and 2016), the technology is improving steadily towards lower consumption of electricity. The transition of energy efficiency and electricity consumption of new air conditioners in Japan. The data are from the Japanese Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (2016). Line chart indicates the values of an Annual Performance Factor (APF) that represents the degree of energy efficiency of representative new energy-efficient air conditioner models in each year with a capacity of 2.8 kW. Bar chart indicates the electricity consumption, which is calculated based on APF assuming usage is 18 h from 6 a.m. to midnight of summer (from 2 June to 21 September) and winter (from 28 October to 14 April) in conventional wooden-framed houses in Tokyo area When households replace their electric appliances with new ones, one might expect power savings. Based on this expectation, policymakers often encourage the replacement of household electric appliances with more energy-efficient ones, using policy instruments such as a subsidy program. However, scholars have asserted that replacement of old appliances by energy-efficient equipment may induce additional energy services consumption by the rebound effect: the gap between the expected saving effect from the technological improvement and the actual saving after the energy-efficient investment (Sorrell and Dimitropoulos 2008; Gillingham et al. 2016). Allcott and Greenstone (2012) emphasized that the results of many engineering or observable analyses of energy-efficient investment have been plagued with this well-known bias. While there are many studies examining the existence of the rebound effect based on household energy consumption (Dubin et al. 1986; Metcalf and Hasset 1999; Haas and Biermayr 2000; Davis 2008; Mizobuchi 2008; Sorrell et al. 2009; Rapson 2014; Davis et al. 2014), a limited number of studies focus on the rebound effects of air conditioners. Dubin et al. (1986) examine the rebound effect of the air conditioner and heat insulation using data from randomized field experiment (504 households) conducted by the electric power company in Florida. They found that the actual conservation by insulation is 13% lower than engineering estimates for cooling and 8–12% lower for heating. Rapson (2014) estimates the efficiency elasticity of the air conditioner from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), using data from households that have replaced air conditioners within the past 2 years and households that have not replaced them. He finds that the efficiency elasticity of the electricity demand used for the air conditioner was between 12 and 30%. Davis et al. (2014) evaluated the effect of a large-scale program for electric appliance replacement in Mexico, using data of 1.9 million households. They found that replacement of refrigerators reduced electricity consumption by 8%, although this reduction was only one-quarter of what they had expected ex ante. On the other hand, they found that households that had replaced air conditioners increased their electricity consumption. Most of the above-mentioned studies used the randomized control trial (hereafter, RCT) methodology. However, social psychologists have pointed out that the RCT methodology can be misleading because it might invoke the Hawthorne effect. In particular, under the RCT methodology, people participating in experiments may be conscious of being observed and this could affect their behavior. For example, in an RCT for evaluating a given educational program, the stakeholders, namely, the school management representatives, teaching staff, parents, or guardians of the children, etc., will visit the classroom during the experiment. The presence of these visitors may make the students of the class conscious and thus motivate them to increase their efforts to study harder than usual. In this case, the educational program may be erroneously found to have a significant effect (due to the Hawthorne effect), even if the program had no direct effect in reality. This study examines the existence of the causality effect of power saving by replacement with energy-efficient air conditioners. We compare the seasonally electricity consumption between two household groups: the one that replaced their air conditioners with more energy-efficient ones in the previous 2 years and the other that did not. Since the allocation between the treatment group and the control group is not random in our study, several socio-economic characteristics may affect the replacement behavior. Thus, we employ the propensity score matching (hereafter, PSM) method to adjust the covariates (i.e., socio-economic characteristics) of the treatment and control groups. Moreover, to control the effects of unobservable factors, we combine the difference-in-differences (DD) method with the PSM and estimate the causality effect more rigorously. Most of the empirical studies on the rebound effect so far use RCT and regression models. As far as the authors are aware, there is no study yet that estimated the rebound effect using DD combined with PSM. There are several advantages in this approach. First, using the PSM, a pseudo-randomized comparison can be performed without performing a randomized comparison experiment and the possibility of the Hawthorn effect can be eliminated too. Second, the DD method does not require assumption of model linearity as in conventional regression analysis. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the analysis conducted using the PSM and the DD methods. In Sect. 3, we describe the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the results of our empirical analysis, and Sect. 5 discusses the estimated rebound effect. Section 6 concludes the paper and offers policy implications.",9
21.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,29 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0225-x,Taxes versus emissions trading system: evaluating environmental policies that affect multiple types of pollution,January 2019,Boon-Ling Yeo,Andrew Coleman,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Agriculture, particularly the production of livestock-based products, is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) pollution in the form of nutrient runoff into surface and ground water. In recent years, there has been an extensive research effort to find ways to mitigate the amount of pollution generated from agricultural production. Scientists, farmers, and ecologists now have a much better understanding of the ways the quantity of these pollutants are affected by different farm management practices and the ways these practices can be modified to reduce pollution. It is increasingly well understood, for example, that different feed mixes can alter the quantity of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and the N content of urea and manure waste produced by cattle [see for example, Stewart et al. (2009) and Rotz et al. (2010)]. There is increasing evidence that different sized cows and different breeds of cows produce different amounts of GHGs, and that these differences also depend on diet (Rotz et al. 2010; Grobler et al. 2014). Different farm management practices, e.g., the stocking rate of livestock, the amount of N fertilizer applied to fields, or the extent that animals are confined or grazed on open fields, also generate different quantities of the two pollutants. Sophisticated analytical tools such as the US Integrated Farm System Model allow researchers and farmers to simulate ways that they can change management practices over the whole lifecycle of cattle to simultaneously alter production, pollution or profit targets (Stewart et al. 2009; Stackhouse-Lawson et al. 2012). Governments are interested in implementing environmental policies that provide farmers with the appropriate incentives to manage pollution levels. In the Netherlands, for instance, dairy farmers can be fined or even prevented from farming for generating too much N pollution, while farmers in New Zealand have to adopt and comply with nutrient waste management systems (Powell et al. 2010). New Zealand is also contemplating incorporating GHG emissions from the agricultural sector into its emissions trading system. Are there optimal policies that governments can adopt to manage multiple types of agricultural pollution? There is an extensive literature of how regulations, taxes, and emissions trading schemes can be used to control pollution. However, most environmental policies are only designed to control one type of pollution at a time even though the agricultural sector produces multiple types of pollution. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of policies that control one pollution depend on their interactions with other policies (Goulder 2013). Unless these interactions are understood, sub-optimal outcomes will occur. This paper develops a model that explores how environmental policies applied to two forms of pollution may affect agricultural pollution levels, input-use, and land-use. One of the pollution types–GHG–is subject to a tax or a charge that is independent of local pollution quantities. The other pollution type, N, is either subject to a tax or a local cap-and-trade program. The model analyzes how the land use and input choices of heterogeneous profit-maximizing farmers, and their associated pollution outputs, depend on the parameters of the environmental policies. The focus of the paper is the way pollution control mechanisms affect pollution levels when pollution prices are at arbitrary levels, for as we show, it may be difficult to set them at optimal levels. The paper shows that the effects of a tax on one type of pollution (e.g., GHG emissions) not only depend on the environmental policies applying to the second type of pollution (e.g., N runoff), but also depend on the extent that production inputs are complements or substitutes, and the extent that relative pollution intensities differ across the various agricultural activities. If nutrient pollution is taxed, an increase in the price of GHG emissions (\(P_\mathrm{G}\)) induces individual farmers to reduce their most carbon polluting inputs, substitute towards farm inputs that produce less GHG emissions, and consider a different type of farming. Each of these options reduces GHG emissions, but nutrient runoff will not necessarily decline. If the two farm inputs are complements and farmers do not change activities, nutrient runoff will fall when \(P_\mathrm{G}\) increases. But if the inputs are substitutes, an increase in \(P_\mathrm{G}\) can increase the level of nutrient runoff if farmers substitute towards relatively nutrient intensive inputs to reduce GHG emissions. For example, North American dairy farmers using feedlots can reduce methane emissions by grazing more or adding oilseed dietary supplements to their feed mixture, but this increases N2O emissions and the N content of urea and manure waste (Boadi et al. 2004; Rotz et al. 2010). Nutrient runoff can also increase if farmers switch to activities that produce high levels of nutrient runoff but low levels of GHG emissions. This could occur, for example, if farmers switched to fertilizer-intensive arable farming such as oilseed farming (Muhammed et al. 2018).The amount that nutrient runoff can increase is limited, for once \(P_\mathrm{G}\) is so high that farmers no longer use the most carbon intensive input, further increases in \(P_\mathrm{G}\) lead to reductions in the remaining input, reducing both types of pollution. If nutrient runoff is controlled by a local nutrient trading scheme (NTS), changes in \(P_\mathrm{G}\) have a different effect on pollution levels because the price of nutrient discharge, \(P_\mathrm{N}\), adjusts endogenously to offset the effects of a change in \(P_\mathrm{G}\). When the price of nutrient discharge is positive, increases in \(P_\mathrm{G}\) have no effect on the aggregate level of nutrient pollution but GHG emissions decrease by a smaller amount than when nutrient runoff is taxed. The reduced responsiveness of GHG emissions to its own price occurs because there is less substitution between inputs, whether inputs are complements or substitutes. If the price of emitting GHG emissions is sufficiently high that the price of nutrient discharge falls to zero, because so few inputs are used, then the NTS has no effect on either nutrient runoffs or GHG emissions. When taxes and emission trading schemes (ETS) are used to control pollution, socially efficient outcomes are achieved when the pollution charge is equal to the marginal damage caused by the pollution (Baumol 1988). If a local NTS is adopted, the interdependence of \(P_\mathrm{N}\) and \(P_\mathrm{G}\) means it is possible but difficult to control pollution optimally, because \(P_N\) depends on \(P_\mathrm{G}\) and the permit cap will need to be changed whenever \(P_\mathrm{G}\) changes to ensure \(P_\mathrm{N}\) equals the marginal damage. The relative merits of an NTS or a tax on N will depend on the relative costs of altering the permit cap or the N tax whenever \(P_\mathrm{G}\) changes, or the damage done if these changes are not made. If the marginal damage from nutrient runoff varies little with the quantity of local emissions, it is likely to be more efficient to tax both types of pollution than to have a local NTS as the permit cap will need to be changed whenever \(P_\mathrm{G}\) changes. In contrast, if both pollutants are taxed and the taxes are set equal to the marginal damage of each type of pollution, a change in the marginal damage of GHG will not require the tax on nutrient pollution to be changed. Thus, a pollution tax will require less management to achieve efficient pollution outcomes, and may be preferred for this reason. This is not true if the marginal damage of nutrient runoff varies significantly with the quantity of local emissions. In this case, an NTS may be more attractive than a nutrient tax as both the optimal nutrient pollution tax and the quantity of nutrients depend on \(P_\mathrm{G}\) and both an NTS and a nutrient tax will require active management to ensure that pollution charges are equal to the marginal damage costs. A government may be content to have a NTS in these circumstances to ensure that the quantity of emissions does not exceed a certain level, even if it cannot guarantee the pollution charge is equal to the marginal damage. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the existing literature that addresses the multi-pollutant control problem. Section 3 develops a model of an individual profit-maximizing farmer who considers pollution prices to be exogenously determined. The analysis examines farm input use and output levels when farmers do not switch farm activity, in which case farm input use and output levels are continuous functions of prices. Section 4 analyzes the aggregate pollution outcomes of a set of farmers with different land use when (1) there is a tax on both types of pollution emissions; and (2) there is a tax on one type of pollution, but a tradable pollution permit scheme on the other. The aggregate consequences of farmers’ choices are also derived under the assumption that farmers do not switch activities. The way that changes in land-use are induced by changes in pollution charges is considered in Sect. 5. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results.",4

In liberalized energy markets, the circumstances can ,however, often be unfavorable for renewable energy sources—until, recently, these technologies have typically had higher generation costs than the incumbent technologies, and especially if the price of carbon dioxide emissions is low. Moreover, there is also path dependence in the direction of technological and institutional change, which locks the economy into the use of older fossil fuel-based energy technology (Arthur 1989; Unruh 2000; Acemoglu et al. 2012). For these reasons, there is a need to better understand the process of technological innovation in the renewable energy field, and the ways through which various types of public policies can promote this process. The empirical research linking energy and environmental policy and innovation constitutes a growing literature stream, and overall, the results from such studies indicate a positive effect of public policy on innovation (e.g., Brunnermeier and Cohen 2003; Lanjouw and Mody 1996; Noailly and Batrakova 2010; Popp 2002). The previous research specifically addressing policy-induced innovation in the renewable energy sector is scarcer, and some of it is based mainly on qualitative or theoretical analysis (e.g., Menanteau et al. 2003; Foxon et al. 2005; Sagar and Zwaan 2006; Fischer and Newell 2008). A number of recent empirical studies use quantitative data to investigate technological change in the energy sector and the role of energy prices and policy. For instance, Lanzi and Sue Wing (2011) find a positive relationship between energy prices and innovation in the renewable energy sector. This result was confirmed in Verdolini and Galeotti (2011), which address the innovation impacts of energy prices on different types of energy technologies while also accounting for international knowledge spillovers. Other important quantitative studies addressing renewable energy innovation include Walz et al. (2008), Karmarkar-Deshmukh and Pray (2009), Johnstone et al. (2010), Rübbelke and Weiss (2011), Noailly and Smeets (2012), Peters et al. (2012), Nesta et al. (2014), Emodi et al. (2015), and Costantini et al. (2015). Most such research employs patent counts as proxy for innovation, and the recent work has also introduced novel methodological approaches.Footnote 1 Many of the available studies, however, use aggregate data for the renewable energy technology sector, and, therefore, tend to downplay the heterogeneity of various technologies. Some of these technologies are technically and commercially relatively mature (e.g., hydropower), while others, such as ocean energy, are less developed, but they may, nevertheless, show great potential. This, thus, suggests the existence of differential policy impacts across various types of technologies (see also Nicolli and Vona 2014; Lee and Lee 2013; Fujii and Managi 2016; Schmidt and Sewerin 2018). In this paper, we address the relationship between public policy support to renewable energy and innovation in the empirical context of solar photovoltaics (PV). We consider the public policies targeting solar PV in 13 different countries since the late 1970s. These policies include technology-push policies in the form of public R&D support to solar PV as well as two different types of demand-pull policies: feed-in tariffs (FIT) and renewable energy certificates (REC). A FIT scheme is a price-based support in which the producers of renewable electricity sell at a pre-set (guaranteed) price per kWh generated over a given time-period (e.g., Couture and Gagnon 2010). A REC scheme involves an obligation for retailers to purchase a predetermined amount (in MWh) of renewable electricity. Each MWh of renewable electricity produced in power plants eligible for certificates yields one certificate that can be sold. In this way, a market for the certificates is established where the price of these equals the premium revenue (per MWh) that renewable electricity producers must receive to fulfill the obligation. By focusing on the above policies, we acknowledge that solar PV innovation may be induced both through basic knowledge generation that private companies can make use of, as well as by the various learning processes on the production side (learning-by-doing, learning-by-using, etc.). FIT and REC schemes both support the generation of solar PV, and thereby also learning. Still, the innovation impacts of these two deployment policies will also vary due to differences in design. A particularly important design issue is whether the policy is technology-specific or technology-neutral, i.e., whether or not it specifies which technologies (or applications) should be supported. The previous research has argued that technology-neutral deployment policies can lead to an early lock-out of promising technologies (Azar and Sandén 2011; Schmidt et al. 2016; Lehmann and Söderholm 2018) (see also Sect. 2.1). In this context, it is important to note that FIT levels have typically been differentiated with respect to the technology supported, while the existing REC schemes have very seldom involved separate targets for different types of renewable energy technologies (IEA 2004, 2012a, b). In the frequently cited work by Johnstone et al. (2010), the differential relationships between renewable energy policies and patenting activity are analyzed in a cross-country setting. For instance, the study supports the notion that FIT and REC schemes could have different impacts on innovation. The results indicate that only the FIT schemes induce innovation in solar energy technology, while the REC schemes instead appear to favor innovation in the more mature technologies such as wind power. In another highly relevant paper, Peters et al. (2012) also investigate the differential effects of policy on solar PV patents, however, in their case focusing on the distinction between domestic and foreign technology-push and demand-pull policies. Their results suggest that public R&D support primarily has had a domestic effect, while both domestic and foreign demand-pull policies have stimulated solar PV innovation. The present paper draws on this important work, but it also develops the analyses of Johnstone et al. (2010) and Peters et al. (2012) in at least three important respects. First, Johnstone et al. (2010) focus on solar energy as an aggregate, thus addressing also solar thermal innovation (e.g., innovations in residential solar thermal systems applied for heating and cooling). At the first glance, our sole focus on solar PV may appear like a marginal research contribution, but it permits us to establish more valid links to the two renewable electricity support schemes (both focusing on electricity generation), as well as to the targeted public R&D efforts. In fact, our empirical results shed some new light on the differential impacts of FIT and REC schemes, respectively, and not the least their interaction (see further below). Moreover, while Peters et al. (2012) also address solar PV, they only use a rough proxy for measuring the impact of demand-pull policies (i.e., capacity additions). For this reason, their study does not permit an assessment of the differential effects of REC and FIT schemes. Second, in contrast to both Johnstone et al. (2010) and Peters et al. (2012), we provide a more detailed assessment of the role of public R&D support by acknowledging different ways of operationalizing this policy variable. Specifically, our analysis considers both the role of direct public R&D expenditures with lagged impacts, as well as a specification in which the public R&D expenditures instead add to a knowledge stock (with a depreciation rate and time lag).Footnote 2 Third and finally, a few previous cross-country econometric studies—including Johnstone et al. (2010) and Peters et al. (2012)—devote attention to the potential interaction between public R&D efforts on the one hand and policy instruments stimulating the diffusion of and thus learning in renewable energy technologies on the other.Footnote 3 One exception includes Lindman and Söderholm (2016) with their limited application to wind power and FIT schemes.Footnote 4 In the present paper, we, therefore, add to this research by testing whether the (marginal) impacts of increases in the public R&D support to solar PV will differ depending on the presence of either FIT or REC schemes, respectively. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the differential impacts of various types of renewable energy support policies on innovation in solar PV technology. In doing this, we address the roles of public R&D expenditures, FIT schemes, and REC schemes, as well as the interaction between public R&D support on the one hand and the two renewable energy production support schemes on the other. Technological innovation is measured using the counts of patent applications filed under the so-called Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). These patent data can be disaggregated to specific technological areas, and in the solar PV case, we focus on patents related to novel designs of PV systems, cell and cell materials, modules, and grid connection. The empirical analysis builds on a detailed panel data set of 13 countries over the time-period 1978–2008. We specify reduced form of negative binomial (NB) regression models in which the dependent variable, solar PV patent application counts, is explained by the stringency of the different renewable energy policies, their interaction, as well as a selection of control variables (see further Sect. 2.2). Based on the estimation results, we calculate elasticities of patenting activity with respect to (marginal) changes in the independent variables, thus permitting us to comment on important differential effects of the respective policies and policy interactions. Specifically, in the empirical section of the paper, we: (a) re-examine the often made claim that FIT schemes are more innovation-promoting than REC schemes in the renewable energy sector (e.g., del Río and Bleda 2012; Johnstone et al. 2010); (b) investigate whether R&D support induces more solar PV innovation than demand-pull policies through FIT and REC schemes; (c) test the null hypothesis that a marginal increase in public R&D expenditures to solar PV will have the same impact on patenting activities regardless of whether FIT or REC schemes are in use. We conduct a number of sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of the results. Solar energy is a promising renewable energy source; the solar energy reaching Earth during a single hour roughly corresponds to the amount of energy used by all human activities during 1 year (e.g., IEA 2010). Our sole focus on solar PV permits the use of clean patent categories, thus avoiding innovations in non-electric solar systems applied for residential heating and cooling and, therefore, facilitating the matching with relevant policies.Footnote 5 During more than a decade, solar PV has been the fastest growing renewable energy sector in terms of installed capacity (Kirkegaard et al. 2010). The global PV market grew by an average rate of 49% each year during the period 2003–2013, and the global cumulative installed PV capacity reached more than 135 GW in 2013 (IEA 2014a). According to IEA (2014b), the bulk of this capacity was distributed among the following countries (in 2013): Germany (with a 25% market share), China (14%), Italy (13%), Japan (10%), USA (9%), Spain (4%), and France (4%). During recent years, though, the Chinese solar PV sector has become by far the largest in the world. In 2017, Chinese solar PV capacity amounted to 131 GW, now representing over 30% of the global aggregate at 402 GW. Solar PV systems can either be grid-connected or stand-alone (off-grid) systems, and the grid-connected systems have so far dominated the global scene (e.g., REN21 2010). The major explanation behind this soar in solar PV penetration has been substantial reductions in the costs of this technology. These cost declines can, in turn, be attributed to a fall in core manufacturing costs such as for material and labor, and not least in capacity-related costs for machinery and equipment (Reichelstein and Sahoo 2018). Substantial innovation over the life cycle of solar PV technology explain these developments, not least in the form of early product innovations followed by a significant process innovation. Huenteler et al. (2016) conclude that the latter focus on the production process suggests a predominant role of the economies of scale in manufacturing, learning-by-doing, and innovations in production equipment. While the development of large-scale production processes largely has been responsible for the observed cost reductions in solar PV technology, the implementation of domestic demand-pull policy instruments has over the years made the higher production levels possible (Kirkegaard et al. 2010). FIT and REC schemes have thus both been key policy instruments to stimulate solar PV market growth (see also Timilsina et al. 2011; Campoccia et al. 2009; Dusonchet and Telaretti 2010; IEA 2004). It is frequently argued that FIT schemes have played a particularly important role, since these guarantee a specific remuneration for certain time-periods, and since the support levels have been based on technology-specific generation costs (e.g., Mendonça 2007; Fouquet and Johansson 2008; Langniss et al. 2009; Klein et al. 2010; Huenteler et al. 2016). In contrast, in most REC schemes, the remuneration varies over the years due to demand and supply changes in the certificate markets. In these schemes, all renewable technologies thus compete and receive the same level of support (per kWh) (IEA 2004, 2012a, b). In brief, for our purposes, the solar PV case is motivated, since it is a very promising renewable energy technology, which already plays a key role in the transition to a carbon-free economy. In fact, in recent years, solar PV has been more and more competitive without subsidies in many countries and applications. In this sense, it is a policy success. Still, there have been profound variations in the use and the stringency of policy support across countries and over time, thus permitting a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between these policies and innovation. In the next section, we briefly present some key theoretical points of departure of the empirical analysis, with a special emphasis on the policy interaction effect. This section also outlines the model specifications as well as the relevant econometric challenges in estimating these models. Section 3 presents the relevant data sources and definitions, including a discussion of the pros and cons of the chosen patent data as innovation proxies. In Sect. 4, we outline the empirical results, including the results from robustness tests. Section 5 discusses and elaborates on the key implications of the empirical results, while Sect. 6 presents some concluding remarks and a number of important avenues for future research.",25
21.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,26 October 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-018-0229-6,Addressing multiple externalities from electricity generation: a case for EU renewable energy policy beyond 2020?,April 2019,Paul Lehmann,Jos Sijm,Hector Pollitt,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Specific policies to promote electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES-E) have been frequently found to undermine the cost-effectiveness of an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in mitigating climate change (e.g., Amundsen and Mortensen 2001; Böhringer and Rosendahl 2010; De Jonghe et al. 2009; Fankhauser et al. 2010; Hindsberger et al. 2003; Jensen and Skytte 2003; Linares et al. 2008; Meran and Wittmann 2012; Paltsev et al. 2009; Requate 2015).Footnote 1 This observation has been confirmed in numerous studies evaluating the EU’s climate and energy package for 2020 (Aune et al. 2012; Bernard and Vielle 2009; Boeters and Koornneef 2011; Böhringer et al. 2009a, b, 2016; Böhringer and Rosendahl 2011; Capros et al. 2011; Kretschmer et al. 2009) as well as beyond 2020 (European Commission 2014a; Flues et al. 2014; Jägemann et al. 2013; Knopf et al. 2015; Möst and Fichtner 2010; Unteutsch and Lindenberger 2014). Even though the excess cost of additional RES-E policies may be quite small—in fact, it may be less than 1% of total electricity system costs (e.g., Knopf et al. 2015)—these results may suggest that specific RES-E policies should be abolished and that only an ETS can mitigate climate change cost-effectively. However, such conclusions would rest on the assumption that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the only externality related to electricity generation and that this externality is properly addressed by the ETS. It has been shown that specific RES-E policies may be welfare-increasing if technology market failures and dynamics are considered (e.g., Fischer and Newell 2008; Gawel et al. 2017; Jaffe et al. 2005; Kalkuhl et al. 2012; Kverndokk and Rosendahl 2007; Lehmann 2013; Lehmann and Söderholm 2018; Schmidt and Marschinski 2009). Moreover, RES-E policies can be a second-best means for mitigating GHG emissions if the first-best emissions policy cannot be properly implemented or is subject to regulatory uncertainty (e.g., Gawel et al. 2014; Kalkuhl et al. 2013; Lecuyer and Quirion 2013; Palmer and Burtraw 2005; Ulph and Ulph 2013). More generally, RES-E policies may be necessary to overcome socio-technical path-dependencies and lock-ins in the electricity sector (Foxon 2011; Lehmann et al. 2012; Strunz 2014; Unruh 2000). We aim to contribute to these debates by assessing how a policy mix of an ETS and a RES-E policy performs in a setting in which electricity generation produces multiple externalities. Externalities that are related to electricity generation next to the GHG externality include, inter alia, (1) impacts of fossil fuel extraction (e.g., ecological damages from open-cast coal mines or fracking), transportation (e.g., pollution of aquatic ecosystems by oil spills) and combustion (e.g., health impacts from air pollution) (Epstein et al. 2011; IPCC 2011), (2) hazards associated with the operation of nuclear electricity plants and the final storage of nuclear wastes (Heyes and Heyes 2000; Yamazaki and Takeda 2017), and (3) risks of sudden supply interruptions for fuels imported from politically unstable countries (Bohi and Toman 1996; Gillingham and Sweeney 2010; Johansson et al. 2012). If these externalities cannot be fully internalised by first-best policy approaches, e.g., because of a lacking political will or because an externality is caused by economic activities outside an administration, policy choices have to be made in a second-best setting (Lipsey and Lancaster 1956). Some authors argue that in such a setting RES-E policies may provide benefits in terms of mitigating multiple externalities from non-renewable electricity generation next to climate change (Edenhofer et al. 2013a, b; Fischer and Preonas 2010; Lehmann and Gawel 2013). The underlying assumption is that the externalities mentioned above can be mitigated by substituting non-renewable fuels with RES (IPCC 2011; McCollum et al. 2011; Ščasný et al. 2015; Siler-Evans et al. 2013)—even though RES-E generation may produce its own external costs in terms of social and ecological impacts (e.g., IPCC 2011; Kerr 2010; Mattmann et al. 2016; Zerrahn 2017) and system integration (Friesenbichler 2016; Hirth et al. 2015). However, the above studies do not provide a thorough analysis as to whether RES-E policies can actually deliver these expected benefits. Moreover, it is unclear how they compare to other policy approaches, e.g., a single emissions policy adapted to mitigate multiple externalities—given that the reduction of GHG emissions may also generate ancillary benefits in terms of other externalities (e.g., Pittel and Rübbelke 2008). Assessing the benefits of RES-E policies with respect to mitigating multiple externalities requires understanding how these policies trigger substitution processes between fuels both within the electricity sector as well as across sectors (Borenstein 2012). Fuel substitution can be expected to be a function of interactions on the diverse markets for fuels, carbon, electricity and other goods. Hence, externalities and corresponding mitigation efforts may be connected through markets—which has been referred to as “interacting externalities” (Ren et al. 2011).Footnote 2 Our study looks at these interaction processes to investigate under which conditions implementing RES-E policies next to an ETS may actually bring about additional benefits from mitigating multiple externalities—and when multiple externalities should be better addressed by a (tightened) ETS alone. We do not mean to show under what conditions a policy mix of a RES-E policy and an ETS is a second-best approach to addressing multiple externalities, nor what the corresponding second-best policy levels would be, as this would require a comprehensive cost–benefit analysis of all available policy options. Instead, we investigate whether such policy mix does at all provide benefits in terms of addressing multiple externalities from electricity generation in comparison to a single ETS and should therefore be considered when looking for a second-best policy. Our analysis builds on two modelling approaches. We start with a simple analytical partial equilibrium model where non-renewable electricity generation produces a second environmental externality next to GHG emissions, and both externalities may interact through electricity and carbon markets. In this model we examine how changes in the two policies under consideration, the ETS and the RES-E policy, may affect the two externalities. We complement this analysis by a quantitative modelling approach combining the top-down, global macro-economic model E3MG and the bottom-up, global electricity sector model FTT:Power. Within this context, we will examine specific scenarios for EU climate and energy policy beyond 2020. This modelling approach will also allow us to examine substitution effects not only within but also beyond the electricity sector. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the analytical model. Section 3 introduces the quantitative model setting, the policy scenarios and the model results. Based on the analytical and quantitative results, Sect. 4 discusses whether and under which conditions RES-E policies may actually be a useful complement to an ETS to address multiple externalities. Section 5 concludes.",9

It is important to evidence the impact of environmental innovations on employment. Indeed, innovation could lead both to direct impact and many indirect effects. From one hand, process innovation produces a labour-saving effect, while product innovation is generally labour-friendly. On the other hand, process innovations could determine decreasing prices, a higher demand and production, and these effects could compensate the job losses (Vivarelli 2014). However, these mechanisms depend crucially on the different institutional and socioeconomic contexts. In this paper, we explore the innovation effects on employment in Russia, because job-creation process is a very relevant feature of policy to sustain economic growth (Aldieri et al. 2018b). Empirical evidence concerning the employment effects of innovation focuses attention on innovation generated in own economic activity, but the studies about the effects from external innovation are scarce (Aldieri and Vinci 2018a, b) and this paper tries to overcome this gap in the literature. Indeed, we consider not only own innovation but also outside innovation. The main contribution of the analysis to the literature is to explore whether the environmental innovations (EIs) have labour-saving effects or labour-friendly ones. To achieve this objective, we consider the labour demand equation (Aldieri and Vinci 2018a, b; Aldieri et al. 2018b), in such a way that we identify both, where the dependent variable is log-number of employees and the explanatory variables are log-value added, log-wages, log-physical capital stock, log-R&D capital stock, and log-spillovers capital stock, and the set of variables that quantifies different types of environmental innovations are: share of organizations engaged in reducing CO2 ‘footprint’ (total CO2 production) EI; share of organizations engaged in replacing materials with less hazard substitutes EI; share of organizations engaged in reducing soil, water, noise, or air pollution EI; and share of organizations engaged in recycling waste, water or materials EI (all shares of organizations are calculated to the total number of organizations implementing environmental innovations). We can identify two streams of literature to investigate the economic relationship between two units: we could consider jointly the travel time and the distance between the units (Enrìquez et al. 2017) or their proximity may be computed on the basis of geographic coordinates, and then this measure is used to weight some common investment (Orlando 2004; Aldieri and Cincera 2009; Aldieri et al. 2018a, b). The assumption of second case is that the proximity between the regions is decreasing at a greater distance (Bottazzi and Peri 2003). It is possible to assume that knowledge flows between the units are not decreasing at larger distance but related to other features, such as technological proximity (Jaffe 1986). Since we have no information about the technological fields of regional firms, we compute geographical spillovers as the weighted sum of R&D capital stock, where the weight is relative to distances between administrative centers of all regions (federal subjects) of the Russian Federation based on the haversine formula (Orlando 2004; Aldieri and Cincera 2009; Aldieri et al. 2018a, b). Since we have a low number of observations, we estimate a least squares dummy variable corrected (LSDVC) estimator. The paper is developed in the following way. Sect. 2 reviews the main findings on the impact of environmental innovations on employment. Sect. 3 describes the data and presents the theoretical framework. Sect. 4 deals with the empirical analysis and the results, while Sect. 5 discusses the policy implications of the analysis and provides some remarks concerning further research.",4

Sariful Islam,Md. Manjur Morshed,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Two-third of the world’s population suffers from extreme scarcity of safe drinking water (WHO and UNICEF 2017; Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2016). Among them, millions of people in developing countries are confronted by severe water-borne diseases due to contamination in drinking water (Khan et al. 2013; Muhammad et al. 2011; Emmanuel et al. 2009). One of the major sources of such contaminations is salinity intrusion, wherein maximum permissible limit of salinity in drinking water is less than 0.025 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) per litre (WHO 2012). Extensive scientific literature reveals salinity contamination above recommended limit has acute effects on human health and environment (Rahman et al. 2017; Khanom 2016; Khan et al. 2011a, b; Chang 2007). Evidence shows a high level of salinity intake through drinking water is associated with high blood pressure, skin diseases, diarrhoea, miscarriage, and other respiratory diseases (Talukder et al. 2016; WHO 2015; Khan et al. 2014a, b, c; He et al. 2013; Aburto et al. 2013; Ministry of Environment and Forest 2006). Excessive salt intake through drinking water aggravates chronic congestive heart failure and gastritis (Nishida et al. 2004; WHO 1978). Considering this important public health concern, over the last few years, World Health Organization (WHO) puts more emphasis on identifying the long run health impact of consuming a high level of salinity in drinking water as a priority for investigation (WHO 2008). In particular, water supply in the coastal areas of the world is vulnerable due to climate change-induced salinity intrusion. Bangladesh is considered one of the forefront victims of global climate change. The south-western coastal region is exposed to continuing sea-level rise over the last few decades (Das et al. 2017; Sultana and Thompson 2017). Bangladesh has experienced an average 4–8 mm sea-level rise per year, which equals to a rise by 8–16 mm within 20 years (Germanwatch 2014). The resultant of sea-level rise is swelling salinity and contaminating both surface and groundwater aquifers of coastal drinking water which has induced severe health hazards to over a 40 million people (Talukder et al. 2016; Rasheed et al. 2014; Khan et al. 2014a, b, c; Minar et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2011a, b). Alarmingly, salinity contamination in river water of the south-western region amounts to as high as 4 g per litre in the rainy season and 13 g per litre in the dry season, whereas seawater contains 35 g per litre of water (Khan et al. 2008, 2011a, b, 2014a, b, c). Recent researches depict that a large number of population residing in south-western coastal region intake 5.2–16.4 g of salt (NaCl) per day through drinking water, which is much higher than the WHO’s recommended allowable limit (Rasheed et al. 2016; Khan et al. 2014a, b, c). Furthermore, it is estimated that over half of total people living in this area are adversely affected by such severe level of salinity in their drinking water (Talukder et al. 2017; Khanom 2016; Hoque 2009). Therefore, the crisis of safe drinking water is creating dreadful health consequences in this area. A number of studies have examined the causal relationship between excessive dietary salt intake and potential health risks in the south-western coastal region of Bangladesh. Researchers identified that women consuming saline-contaminated tube-well water were exposed at higher health risk than those who used pond and rainwater (Benneyworth et al. 2016; Khan et al. 2014a, b, c). Similarly, Khan et al. (2011a, b) found a higher risk of gestational hypertension and (pre)eclampsia in women living in south-western coast compared to non-coastal Bangladesh. Moreover, increased salinity is particularly injurious to pregnant women and young population (Talukder et al. 2016), which implies long-term health burden and associated increased health costs in these areas. Hence, exacerbating the health status induced by salinity exposure leads to an increase in the health cost of the people living in this region through the increase in their yearly sick days followed by an increase in their medical as well as averting expenditure. Surprisingly, from our extensive literature survey, studies focusing on households’ health cost for salinity contamination of drinking water in Bangladesh are almost missing. Only a few studies estimated the households’ health cost and willingness to pay (WTP) for arsenic-free, safe drinking water in Bangladesh. A study by Maddison et al. (2005) shows the annual estimated health cost of arsenic contamination in tube-well water is USD 2.7 billion, while some other studies found households spend about 5–10% of their disposable income per year for mitigating purposes, depending on the severity of arsenic contamination (Khan et al. 2014a, b, c; Khan and Haque 2010; Akter 2008), whereas Ahmad et al. (2005) suggest that households’ average WTP is too low to develop arsenic-free water supply without heavy government subsidy. Therefore, sourcing safe drinking water with/without government subsidy is an issue of sustainable management of water investments and interventions in Bangladesh. Given the dearth of literature, this study is, perhaps, the first attempt to measure the health cost of salinity contamination in drinking water and to assess the viability of managing alternative water sources of safe drinking water in Bangladesh. To estimate health cost, revealed preference-based WTP approach has been used. This approach includes both cost of illness (i.e., sum of wage loss due to working day loss and mitigating expenditure) and avertive expenditure (Afrin et al. 2017; Mahanta et al. 2016; Roy 2008; Freeman III et al. 2014; Alberini and Krupnick 2000; Harrington and Portney 1987). Therefore, WTP approach helps to compute the entire sum of costs in the form of wage loss, averting and mitigating expenditure associated with salinity-induced health hazards for millions of people in the south-western region of Bangladesh. This is because aggregate social welfare through provisioning freshwater access and its sustainable management is one of the major policy concerns in Bangladesh. One of the grand policy initiatives is the Bangladesh Delta Plant (BDP) 2100 that envisions water and food security with a goal (2) to “ensure water security and efficiency of water usages” while developing a coping mechanism to climate change, natural disasters, and other delta issues (van Scheltinga 2016). Therefore, this research can contribute to the BDP’s long-term strategies for interventions and investments to solve the water problem, particularly for the coastal areas of Bangladesh. In the south-western region, most of the inhabitants rely heavily on groundwater (tube-wells), rivers, and ponds as a source for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing, and all other daily chores. However, tube-wells and pond sand filter (PSF) are the prime sources of drinking water, where approximately 66% of rural people use these sources for meeting their water demand (Rahman et al. 2017; Bernier et al. 2016; Harun and Kabir 2013). In fact, the use of tube-wells is no longer sustainable due to a high level of salinity contamination and the presence of arsenic in the drinking water. On the other hand, the majority of PSFs are severely damaged due to lack of maintenance (Harun and Kabir 2013). A laboratory tests show that the collected samples of drinking water from each household contain 868 mg L−1 sodium chloride, which is almost 3.5 times higher than WHO recommended safety standard. Therefore, using revealed preference-based WTP, this paper intends not only to estimate the health costs of salinity contamination in drinking water but also to assess the viability of initiating PSF project at large scale with community fund in the south-western coastal region of Bangladesh. Revealed preference-based WTP approach accounts acute health effects only, since chronic health diseases are the consequences of several exposures/reasons, and isolating the effect of single exposure on these diseases is difficult. Therefore, accounting cost for chronic diseases would lead to the overestimation of health cost (Atreya 2008). In addition, this approach cannot account the cost of disutility associated with exposure-induced illness and labour cost serving to the ill people (Atreya et al. 2012). Despite such limitation, this approach is often preferred to other stated preference approaches, i.e., contingent valuation (CV) and choice experiment (CE). This is because revealed preference-based WTP is the most conservative and popular approach of estimating health cost of any exposure considering all the aspects of expenditure (Das et al. 2017; Chowdhury and Imran 2010; Alberini and Krupnick 2000; Dickie and Gerking 1991; Cropper 1981; Grossman 1972). Meanwhile, we discussed how salinity contaminated drinking water affects households’ health cost (e.g., workday loss, averting, and mitigating behavior). Later on, we estimated the health cost of salinity exposure. This calculation sets three separate equations for three outcome variables, estimated by the negative binomial and Tobit models. Finally, we evaluated a project intervention for supplying safe drinking water to the coastal community and found that the benefit of this project is substantial. Therefore, this study not only adds new pieces of information about health cost of salinity contamination in literature but also explores how community people can manage this problem sustainably with their own finance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology. Section 3 reports the analysis and results. Finally, conclusion and policy implications are presented in Sect. 4.",6

Bellon,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The world is currently experiencing a heightened rate of species extinction which has been considered reminiscent of historical mass extinctions (Barnosky et al. 2011). Extinction risks differ among species, with some species facing higher risks than others, i.e., endangered species. The need to save endangered species has been justified on both moral and utilitarian grounds. Man-made changes to the planet have greatly contributed to this current trend which leads to a moral argument for efforts to save endangered species. Another moral argument is that maintaining species is part of protecting a long evolutionary process (Rolston 1985). The loss of a species also risks significant utilitarian losses to humans. In the context of protected species, which may not be hunted and processed into commodities, people still may find value in conserving species in a variety of other ways; for example, recreationally, by providing information, or simply through the pleasure gained from knowing a species exists (Norton 2014). Species are also constituent parts of valuable ecosystems and should not be valued individually out of context. Protecting species can be important in maintaining the ecological integrity of an area (Fortin et al. 2005), with effects such as making an ecosystem more stable in the face of shocks, as well as unintuitive ecological benefits for humans, such as controlling zoonotic diseases (Levi et al. 2012). However, simply maintaining the existence of a species, while ignoring population density, may not be enough to maintain the ecological processes which they take part in (Valiente-Banuet et al. 2015). Factors such as how asynchronous they are with other species in the environment can cause some species to have greater effects on ecosystem stability than others (Blüthgen et al. 2016). Despite this, the ecological effects of losing a species are hard to predict with the current information, suggesting the need for a broad conservation approach to conserve not just the species, but the ecosystems that they are part of. In USA, the need to protect endangered species has long been recognized and legislated by the US Congress with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The act lists vulnerable species, and is intended to halt and reverse trends towards their extinction through legal protections and resource allocation. The ESA is enforced by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Initially, decisions for listing were not based on any specific scientific criteria until 1982, when Congress passed an amendment to the ESA which prohibited favoritism in listing species. This resulted in a high correlation for most taxonomic clades between level of endangerment and probability of listing (Cash 1997). However, unbiased listing is not enough to ensure unbiased protection. The amount of funding received affects whether being listed has a positive effect on recovery (Ferraro et al. 2007; Miller et al. 2002). In fact, being listed with low funding can actually harm a species’ recovery. For example, banning development of the habitat of a listed species can create a perverse incentive for landowners to prematurely develop their land (Lueck and Michael 2003). It is, therefore, important to consider which characteristics of a species influence funding and ask whether these are the factors which we want determining conservation outcomes. A crucial factor for determining funding for conservation of an endangered species under the FWS is its priority ranking (NOAA 2012). The priority ranking of a species is calculated based on the degree of threat (high, medium, and low), recovery potential (high and low) and degree of taxonomic distinctiveness (monotypic genus, species, and subspecies). The previous research suggests that the priority ranking does not have a significant effect on actual funding for vertebrates (Mahoney 2009; Restani and Marzluff 2002), though evidence to the contrary exists (Metrick and Weitzman 1998). In contrast, attributes such as whether a species is considered a higher form of life form have correlated positively with funding (Metrick and Weitzman 1996). A theorized, but previously untested factor that could bias the funding, and, therefore, conservation outcomes for a species, is charisma (Mahoney 2009; Metrick and Weitzman 1998). According to the Oxford Dictionary, charisma is defined as “compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others” (n.d.) and it is usually associated with a human quality. Although there is no set definition in the context of animal species, it has been used, nonetheless, in this context. Lorimer (2006) defines it as some combination of fame, societal perceptions of the animal, esthetics, and potential to generate satisfaction. We do not hope to nail down a definition in this paper, but think whatever the exact determinants of charisma are, which could vary from beautiful coloration to being associated with a popular cartoon, charisma will increase the likelihood that any given person will devote some time or effort towards the animal. The general US population’s perceived charisma of a species has the potential to translate into funding misallocation through the effect of lobbying for more popular species, regardless of attributes like ecological value or greater need. This paper examines whether charisma and the priority ranking affect the total amount spent on a per species basis by the U.S. Federal Government in 2013 (USFWS 2013). This was done using an econometric approach with cross-sectional data which should be sufficient to assess the effects these variables have, while avoiding the need to account for differences in budgets, political climate, or organizational structural over time. In this study, we use the number of Google hits for a specie’s common name as a proxy for charisma. Different societies may have different views on which species are charismatic, with likely components of charisma varying, e.g., Tanzanian vs. British school children’s negative vs. positive views on large African mammals (Bowen-Jones and Entwistle 2002). Therefore, we used searches resulting from Google set for the region of the US, which should largely be made up of websites aimed, at least, in part, towards American interests. The Internet has previously been used as a proxy for charisma with numbers of pictures of African species posted to certain social media sites being used to address tourism potential (Willemen et al. 2015). Furthermore, including a charisma variable in our regression approach should also correct for any omitted variable bias resulting from not doing so and improve the model’s estimation of correlated variables’ effects.",15

Because there is in general no international regulator that would control emissions-based externality by efficient tax instruments, international environmental policy is commonly delegated to an authority that is subject to lobbying. Thus, it is instructive to examine how emission permit trading affects emissions and aggregate welfare. This study is motivated by the following experience. In the environmental policy of the European Union (EU), command-and-control instruments dominate over incentive-based instruments (Wråke et al. 2012), because they do not involve fiscal policy. The command-and-control policy can be implemented in three stages (Goulder 2013). First, the regulator specifies total pollution allowed for all the facilities in the regulatory program. Second, the regulator distributes the allowances. Third, the system provides for trading in the allowances. This study considers the usefulness of the third stage. In the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS), lobbying by the interest groups plays an important role. Binder and Neumayer (2005) and Fredriksson et al. (2005) examine lobbying by environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGO). In contrast, I do not make a sharp division between household and producer lobbies. I rather assume that emissions are by-products of (carbon) energy and that an industrial lobby represents households that receive income from the same industry. Then, each lobby cares about both aggregate emissions (as a consumer) and the needs for the industry. Gullberg (2008) considers whether interest groups lobby towards their friends or foes. In my approach, there is no such distinction; each industrial lobby cares about the emissions of all industries, not only those of its own. In the EU-ETS, many emission permits are auctioned and not granted free of charge to the industries. Because the combination of lobbying and auctions would lead to a very complicated game theoretic model, I have to leave that extension for future studies. 
Caplan and Silva (2005) examine emission permit trading in a federation of regions, showing that Pareto efficiency can be established with the help of inter-regional redistributive transfers. Holtsmark and Sommervoll (2012) consider emission permit trading when the (local) governments grant permits for the domestic firms. They show that the anticipation of such trading changes the governments’ behavior so that emissions actually increase, decreasing efficiency. I assume, on the contrary, that there are no redistributive transfers and that there is a regulator that grants emission permits. Hintermann (2011) and Meunier (2011) consider the imperfections in the emission permit markets, while I show that severe coordination problems appear between the regulator and the industries already with competitive markets. To examine the problem of the usefulness of emission permit trading, I construct a game theoretic model where a self-interested regulator grants emission permits for industries, as being influenced by the lobbies that represent the income earners in those industries. I apply common agency theory, where several principals influence a single agent by offering contributions that are conditional on the latter’s behavior (cf. Grossman and Helpman 1994; Dixit et al. 1997; Aidt 1998). The remainder of this document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the structure of the economy. Sections 3 and 4 examine environmental policy with nontraded and traded permits, respectively, and section 5 considers the effects of emission permit trading. Section 6 summarizes the results.",
21.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,14 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-019-00237-7,International recycling firm joint ventures and optimal recycling standards,July 2019,Yasuyuki Sugiyama,Patcharin Koonsed,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The efficient use of resources is one of the important problems in the modern world. Many countries have therefore put into practice the 3Rs: reduce–reuse–recycle. In recent years, in a trend toward building recycling societies, international joint ventures (JVs) between local and foreign recycling firms have emerged. For example, to stimulate the recycling of electric appliances in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, an international JV was established between the Panasonic Corporation, Hangzhou DADI Environmental Protection Engineering Co., Ltd., DOWA Holdings Co., Ltd. (DOWA), and the Sumitomo Corporation. This JV is known as the Panasonic DADI DOWA Summit Recycling Hangzhou Co., Ltd.Footnote 1 To promote automobile recycling in China, ALBA International Recycling GmbH of the ALBA Group formed a joint venture with the Shanghai Baosteel Iron and Steel Resources Co., Ltd., by co-owing the Shanghai Baosteel Auto Recycling Co., Ltd. This JV is one of the leading automotive recyclers in Shanghai. In addition, Sagama Vietnam, a member of Long Long Chemical Co., Ltd., has launched a JV for tire recycling in Vinh Phuc Province with the Russian firm Togliattiazot. This JV has plans to expand into Ho Chi Minh City. Such examples show that, to promote the recycling of products in an appropriate manner, local firms need to establish an international JV with foreign firms with advanced recycling technology. We then expect that recycling policies in host countries will have an impact on the formation and corporate activities of the JV. Considering this, the following questions may be raised: How will the recycling policies affect the formation and corporate activities of the JV? Then, how should the host country’s government implement recycling policies in the economy with or without the JV? Recycling standards represent one important recycling policy. For example, based on the extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy approach, the European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC stipulates the recycling of at least 55% of packaging waste. Elsewhere, the Japanese home electronics industry is required to maintain recycling standards of at least 50% under the 2001 Home Appliances Recycling Law.Footnote 2 Among previous studies analyzing waste and recycling, Sugeta and Shinkuma (2014) and Dubois and Eyckmans (2015) investigated the economic and environmental impact of a recycling standard.Footnote 3 Dubois and Eyckmans (2015) then showed that given a coordinated policy setting between two countries, recycling standards combined with excise duties on final goods or disposal taxes on recycling residuals could achieve the first-best welfare level. However, with an uncoordinated policy setting, it is possible to instigate a race to the bottom for recycling standards and taxes, or a race to the top for recycling standards and duties. Hence, in this paper, we apply their policy discussion to a host country with an international recycling JV and investigate the effect of not only the recycling standard, but also the excise duty as recycling policies of the host country. Through this analysis, we reveal the role of these policies with or without the JV.Footnote 4 Since we consider the case where local and foreign recyclers choose whether to form a JV with each other or compete with rival firms in the recycling market, we suppose an imperfectly competitive recycling market in the host country.Footnote 5 Eichner (2005), Sugeta and Shinkuma (2012, 2014), and Dubois and Eyckmans (2015) examined the situation where one or a few recycling firms operate and endogenously determine the price of recycled materials.Footnote 6 From the perspective of international JVs, our paper is also closely related to Abe and Zhao (2005), who analyze the formation of an international JV in the final goods sector and the environment.Footnote 7 In line with Abe and Zhao (2005), we construct a model involving the endogenous determination of the JV or Cournot competition between the Northern and Southern recyclers.Footnote 8 In this regard, to describe the technological differences between these recyclers, we suppose that the marginal cost of the Southern recycler is higher than that in the North. Under this model’s setting, we can obtain the following results in the case where the JV is formed: If the government of the host country (i.e., the Southern government) seeks to reduce the amount of waste by using only the recycling standard, a high recycling standard must be required. However, from the perspective of Southern welfare, the recycling standard will not be very high, because it decreases the local firm’s share of profits from the JV. Then, the greater the expansion of the gap between the marginal cost of the local and foreign recyclers, the lower is the optimal recycling standard. Here, the Southern government can utilize the excise duty to reduce waste. Assuming that the government sets the duty optimally, we find that waste may decrease even when the ex-ante recycling standard is low, as long as the market for final goods is large. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details our model. In Sect. 3, we examine the choice of recyclers between forming a JV and engaging in Cournot competition, while in Sect. 4 we investigate the impacts of a stricter recycling standard and the excise duty. Section 5 considers the Southern welfare. We then reveal the structure of optimal recycling standards and the relation between optimal excise duties and recycling standards. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks.

21.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,12 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-019-00238-6,Is willingness to contribute for environmental protection in Sweden affected by social capital?,July 2019,George Marbuah,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The existing literature on the environment has identified and highlighted several factors that drive people to make financial contributions toward the provision of a public good such as the environment (see Mitchell and Carson 1989; Meyer and Liebe 2010). Individuals’ willingness to contribute to the environment might be explained by a combination of socio-economic and demographic variables such as income, age, education, marital status, etc. An emerging strand of literature in environmental management has emphasised the critical role played by social capital in influencing pro-environmental attitudes (see Polyzou et al. 2011). Despite this recognition, studies in this area of research are limited but have been growing in the last few years. For example, recent evidence in the literature indicates that social capital is positively linked to willingness to contribute (WTC) for environmental goods, environmental regulation/policy and management success (see Gelissen 2007; Torgler and García-Valiñas 2007; Jones et al. 2009, 2010).Footnote 1 Rupasingha et al. (2000) assert that “when social capital is present, externalities are internalised, which has the effect of eliminating or reducing the free rider problem and misuse of public goods while at the same time increasing investments in public goods”. The theory behind social capital as it relates to the environment posits that the abundance of social capital (e.g. trust among individuals or communities or social connections in voluntary organisations) facilitates information sharing since trust is connected closely to cooperation. The information shared might relate to several issues that could lead to environmental awareness and, therefore, increase the willingness to contribute to environmental preservation. Beyond information effects, social capital can also work through peer effect. The utilisation of the stock of social capital might influence an individual’s environmental preferences due to reciprocity or the idea that other members with shared values (or norms) in the community will act similarly as he or she did in protecting the common good. Hence, if the common good is to make a financial commitment to authorities to improve environmental conditions, they will do so with the expectation that group members or individuals will replicate their act (see Sect. 2; Torgler and García-Valiñas 2007; Macias and Williams 2014 for more discussion). At the level of operationalisation, social capital can be measured in several ways. It is decomposed into cognitive and structural parts (Putnam 2000). The cognitive component refers to the predisposition of individuals to act in a way which is beneficial for society, while the structural aspect the interaction among individuals (e.g. Kaasa and Parts 2008). Different constructs of trust (e.g. social and institutional) are often used to measure the cognitive part while the density of networks (formal and informal) and civic engagement are applied to construct the structural component. In this paper, we consider both conceptualisations in measuring social capital as it explains the willingness to contribute toward the environment in the literature (see Torgler and García-Valiñas 2007; Jones et al. 2009; Halkos and Jones 2012). Explicitly, we construct through principal component analysis (PCA), three sub-indices of social capital: social trust, institutional trust and civic engagement and networks. In the final analysis, we construct one composite index of social capital including the three sub-indices by utilising all available information in nine set of indicators measuring different elements of social capital. This paper aims to empirically investigate the extent to which different social capital constructs are related to individual willingness to contribute for environmental protection in Sweden. We make no causalFootnote 2 inference in this paper. The hypothesis we test is that all things equal, social capital is positively related to an individual’s willingness to contribute for environmental protection. Ordered logistic estimation is applied to data obtained from the 2010 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) on Sweden. The Swedish ISSP survey reflects a nationally representative selected sample covering individuals aged 19–79 years residing in 93 municipalities in Sweden. We contribute to the social capital and environment nexus literature in the following ways. First, given the lack of studies with an explicit focus on modelling the link between social capital and the environment in Sweden,Footnote 3 this study contributes in filling some of the gaps by illuminating new evidence on this relationship. In particular, we show why in Sweden, a country noted for pro-environmental initiatives; social capital could be a key driver in individual decisions in support of environmental sustainability. To the best of our knowledge, the only study within the Swedish context closely related to our paper is Harring and Jagers (2013). Harring and Jagers (2013) looked into whether or not trust (i.e. interpersonal and institutional trust) explain carbon dioxide (CO2) tax payment on gasoline consumption among individuals in Sweden. The main finding is that both types of trust significantly promote carbon tax payment. Secondly, while acknowledging the interesting insights Harring and Jagers (2013) provide, we think their choice of social capital indicators is too narrow to fully help our understanding of its nexus with pro-environmental policy instruments. In this regard, we complement and extend Harring and Jagger’s study by providing suggestive evidence on how different constructs of social capital (i.e. social trust, institutional trust, civic participation and aggregate social capital index) explain Swedish public’s willingness to contribute toward environmental preservation via three different (payment) vehicles (i.e. higher taxes, higher prices and standard of living cuts). This approach is motivated by the argument in the literature that even though social capital in its aggregate form might influence willingness to contribute toward good environmental quality, individuals may react differently to different constituents of social capital in making decisions to sacrifice for the environment (e.g. Jones et al. 2009, 2010). Finally, our findings might be useful for environmental policy in Sweden. Paying close attention to particular features of social capital embedded in individuals and communities might enhance success in the design and implementation of environmental regulation. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature on the interface between social capital and WTC. The theoretical model, empirical strategy and data issues are contained in Sect. 3. Section 4 interprets the empirical results while Sect. 5 provides a detailed discussion of the findings. Section 6 ends the paper with some concluding remarks.",9
21.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,28 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-019-00239-5,"Neighborhood influences on the diffusion of residential photovoltaic systems in Kyoto City, Japan",October 2019,Takanobu Kosugi,Yoshiyuki Shimoda,Takayuki Tashiro,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Various solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems are currently available, ranging from residential to utility-scaled. Small-scale residential systems that can be installed on rooftops of detached houses are expected to play a leading role in accelerating the deployment of PV systems (IEA 2010). Empirical studies on the diffusion trends for residential PV systems have been carried out in response to the recent accumulation of data on such systems. Studies of this sort are important, as they contribute to the discussion of effective policy measures to further facilitate the deployment of PV systems by elucidating the factors affecting their installation and diffusion. Most published studies have explained the diffusion ratio of PV systems in municipal areas statistically, based on areal attributes such as: natural attributes such as amount of solar radiation; social attributes, such as the density and age of the population; and economic attributes, such as income level and subsidies for system installation (Li et al. 2012). Recent examples of such studies include Yoshida (2012) and Kwan (2012), who focus on solar radiation conditions as an explanatory factor; Drury et al. (2012) and Davidson et al. (2014), who focus on population age structure; and Zhang et al. (2011) and Nakata and Matsumoto (2014), who focus on system pricing, subsidies, and residents’ income level. In addition to these areal attributes, a recent set of studies attempted to perform spatial analyses focusing on the influence of system installations in neighborhoods and word-of-mouth communications between neighbors, i.e., the so-called neighbor effect.Footnote 1 The present study seeks to contribute to the knowledge regarding influences on the diffusion of PV systems, including the neighbor effect, by investigating residential PV installations in a Japanese city. This focus is based on a theory by Rogers (2003), who considers information exchange to be the essence of innovation propagation. Bollinger and Gillingham (2012) were the pioneers of studies analyzing the diffusion of residential PV systems spatially. Based on diffusion data for every zip code in California, United States (US), they showed that the installation of a system in a district increased the probability of additional installations in the same district. Subsequent spatial statistical analyses have been conducted for other countries, including Seki et al. (2013, 2014), who considered diffusion data for every prefecture and municipality in Japan, and Richter (2013) and Snape (2016), who investigated every postal code in the United Kingdom (UK). However, analytical capability is limited when diffusion data are available only at a low spatial resolution. The studies referenced above used diffusion data aggregated by municipality or zip/postal code, and, thus, the distances between the center points of such areas might range from a few kilometers (km) to many dozens. It is difficult for studies using lower spatial resolution data to assess the spread of information regarding PV systems through visual awareness of installations in the neighborhood or word-of-mouth communications with neighbors. Data analysis with spatial resolution high enough to address these issues is rare due to poor data availability. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few exceptions: a study by Müller and Rode (2013), who investigated Wiesbaden City, and later extended their target area to all of Germany (Rode and Weber 2016); and, studies focused on Connecticut in the US (Graziano and Gillingham 2015), and Shanghai, China (Zhao et al. 2017). These studies successfully conducted analyses at the smaller district level by referring to the position coordinates of individual system installations. The Rode and Weber (2016) analysis targeting all of Germany indicated that the neighbor effect on system installations within a radius of 1 km was statistically significant. A subsequent analysis by these researchers using extended time series data (Rode and Müller 2016) found a clear neighbor effect within a radius of 200 m, which weakened with the passage of time according to a detailed spatiotemporal analysis. Results of the study also indicated that system adopters tended to have higher income and to reside in large dwellings. Meanwhile, the Graziano and Gillingham (2015) Connecticut analysis demonstrated a statistically significant neighbor effect within a radius of four miles (≅  6.4 km), with especially high effects within one mile (≅ 1.6 km). It also showed that building density influenced the diffusion ratio in districts. A later study by these researchers (Graziano et al. 2019) found that the neighbor effect, living environment, and socioeconomic attributes affected the system diffusion ratio differently in different municipalities. Analyses taking other approaches to assessing the neighbor effect have also been conducted. These adopted spatial econometric models (LeSage and Pace 2009), which introduce spatial lag into the diffusion ratio, with regional attributes as independent variables to explain the ratio. This approach has advantages in that it can simultaneously examine the influence of the spatial distribution of various social attributes and of the neighbor effect through information exchange that cannot be explained by other attributes. Schaffer and Brun (2015) and Dharshing (2017) used attribute and PV diffusion values for each of some 400 counties in Germany. Schaffer and Brun (2015) adopted a spatial lag or spatial autoregression (SAR) model for cross-sectional data, while Dharshing (2017) adopted SAR and spatial error models (SEM) for panel data. Applying a more developed model enabled Balta-Ozkan et al. (2015) to investigate the spillover effects of social attributes on diffusion in nearby regions. They applied a spatial Durbin model (SDM) to data from 134 diffusion regions in the UK and showed that the diffusion ratio in a region was positively correlated with the ratio of detached houses and negatively correlated with the average number of household members, not only a single region but also in neighboring regions. While past studies have verified the existence of the neighbor effect in residential PV diffusion, only a few regions have been analyzed. Meanwhile, diffusion mechanisms may differ due to characteristics such as living environment. Thus, further study of a variety of regions is needed to obtain improved insights. While Japan is a top-ranking country in PV deployment, there are few studies exploring neighborhood influences on PV diffusion, mainly due to limited data. To date, residential PV diffusion data in Japan have been publicly available only as municipal-level aggregated numbers at the highest spatial resolution. Under a cooperative research agreement with the Kyoto City government, we were granted exclusive use (for research purposes) of census-block level data with higher resolution aggregated numbers of residential PV systems installed with subsidies from the city government. Each census block corresponds to a minimum unit of the data aggregation area adopted in the Japanese Population Census (Statistics Bureau of Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 2012). This enabled us to conduct an analysis with cumulative diffusion data aggregated for each of the 5215 census blocks, instead of the 11 wards currently publicly available. Kyoto City was once the capital of Japan. It currently has a population of 1.47 million and the city features many historical streets and buildings developed before World War II. The average area per census block is 158,400 square meters (m2), while the median is as small as 23,426 m2, corresponding to an approximately 150-m square, according to the census-block level geographic information data provided by the Statistics Bureau of Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (2013). This skewed distribution of census-block areas reflects a large number of small-area census blocks located in the central part of the city. The population density is 1780 people per km2 in the city overall, while more than half of census blocks contain dense populations of more than 10,000 per km2, according to the 2010 Population Census (Statistics Bureau of Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 2012). Compared to other major cities in Japan, Kyoto City strictly constrains the height of buildings. In this study, we consider that the factors affecting residential PV diffusion in a census block include economic factors and neighborhood influences consisting of the following factors: (1) the influence of social attributes relevant to demographic structure and living environment in the census block; (2) the influence of those attributes in nearby census blocks; and (3) the influence of the spatial interdependency of the diffusion among nearby census blocks that cannot be explained by other attributes. In this study, we define the neighbor effect as the third factor. This study analyzes the breakdown of neighborhood influences described above. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between diffusion ratios and social attributes in census blocks, while simultaneously considering their spatial impact. The analysis quantitatively verifies the impact of the spatial distribution of attributes, and the possible existence of the neighbor effect. In that sense, this study has similarities to Schaffer and Brun (2015), Balta-Ozkan et al. (2015), and Dharshing (2017), all of whom applied spatial econometric models. While this study will also apply such model-based analysis, it is expected to obtain clearer insights into the neighborhood influences within a radius of several hundred meters by taking advantage of the census-block level, high spatial resolution data for both the diffusion ratio and social attributes. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the data used for this study and then present a preliminary panel data analysis to verify the extent of influence of economic factors such as resident income level, which is assumed to be a primary factor for residential PV adoption, on PV diffusion using the 11-ward level data in Kyoto City. In Sect. 3, we present our spatial econometric analysis, based on the census-block level cross-sectional data, to investigate neighborhood influences including the neighbor effect on the PV diffusion. In Sect. 4, we discuss the causes of the neighborhood influences determined in the analysis with reference to relevant studies and insights from an analysis based on questionnaire surveys conducted in Kyoto City. Policy implications are also presented based on those analyses. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the study, summarizing the outcomes of the analyses as well as their limitations, and future research directions.",17
21.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,23 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-019-00240-y,Does financial openness cause the intensification of environmental degradation? New evidence from Latin American and Caribbean countries,October 2019,Matheus Koengkan,Renato Santiago,António Cardoso Marques,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are considered a significant contributor to global warming, which is the greatest potential cause for climate change, as well as one of the most significant challenges that human society currently faces. The environmental problems that can arise from the carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) growth led policymakers and scholars to discuss and develop strategies for reducing these emissions and, consequently, their impacts on global warming. Faced with these significant problems, many nations committed themselves to the decrease of their greenhouse gas emissions, signing the widely known “Kyoto Protocol”. For these countries to reach this goal, it is necessary to identify the significant determinants of CO2 emissions. In the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries, CO2 emissions have been growing since 1950, reaching 451 million metric tons in 2008. Looking at these countries’ performance, we see that Brazil and Mexico are among the 20 highest CO2 emitters in the world and, in 2008, these two countries accounted for 52.6% of the region’s CO2 emissions (Boden et al. 2011). However, several other countries in the region emit more than 10 million metric tons of CO2 annually, namely: Argentina (52.4), Chile (19.9), Colombia (18.5), Peru (11.1), Trinidad and Tobago (13.6), and Venezuela (46.2) (e.g. Boden et al. 2011). In the LAC region, liquid fuels account for 60.8% of total CO2 emissions, with coal being only a modest contributor, with 7.6% (Boden et al. 2011). Moreover, between 1971 and 2013, the gross domestic product (GDP) from the LAC countries had an average annual growth rate of approximately 3.0%, while energy consumption grew about 5.4% (Balza et al. 2016). In 1971, the LAC GDP per capita in US dollar was 668.60 US$, while in 2013 it was 10,157.60 US$ (World Bank Data 2018). Regarding LAC energy consumption, in 1971 it was 248 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE), and in 2013 it was 848 MTOE, with an increase of 8% in global electricity demand over this period (Balza et al. 2016). As we can see, both the regional GDP and energy consumption have more than tripled over the past 40 years. This fact was mainly due to several economic reforms and political transitions, which have led to a bunch of economic and social transformations on the LAC region in the last 40 years. Regarding the financial liberalisation in the LAC region, we can say that it went through a group of historical experiences over the past decade, which have defined the conventional wisdom on financial liberalisation and development in the region. The first one began in the 1960s and 1970s, during the period of import-substitution industrialisation, with the state controlling the financial sector. This situation is a resulted of substantial fiscal cost that is associated with mismanagement of public banks and financial sector (La Torre et al. 2012). The second experience began in the 1980s, the so-called “lost decade”, where the countries from this region suffered from an impressive inflation rise and stagnation in their economic growth, associated with the 1982–1989 debt crisis (Aizenman 2005). Indeed, the debt crisis changed the way the economic policy and management were handled in this region. The Brady plan is an example of the re-entry of capital inflows into the LAC countries in the early 1990s. This “fresh” start led the region to adopt a bunch of sweeping reforms. For example, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico passed schemes of deep trade and financial liberalisation, with the privatisation of significant portions of the public sector, and with the development of economic stabilisation programmes (Aizenman 2005). These reforms were based on the prerequisite that renewed external financing would stimulate the domestic saving, the investments, and consequently the economic growth of this region. The adoption of such reforms increased the LAC capital mobility from 40%, in the 1980s, to 75%, in the 1990s. These results have overcome the ones from other regions, such as Asia, where capital mobility went from about 40%, in the 1980s, to 60%, before the 1997 crisis, falling to 55% after the crisis. In the Middle East and North Africa, the increase in capital mobility was less pronounced, going from about 40 to 50% (Aizenman 2005). Indeed, it seems that the financial liberalisation in the LAC region has influenced the liberalisation in other continents. However, it also appears that these changes have had a significant impact on the LAC environment, since the region’s environmental degradation has more than tripled (Bhattarai and Hammig 2001). These characteristics (the LAC economic and social structures’ rapid transformation) make this region an exceptional place to research issues related with the impact of human activities (e.g. financial liberalisation, energy consumption) on environmental degradation. In recent decades, the impact of financial openness and financial liberalisation on environmental degradation (particularly, CO2 emissions) has received considerable attention from researchers. Several attempts have been made in the economic and ecological literature to determine the dynamic nexus between economic activity and environmental quality (Saidi and Mbarek 2017). In these attempts, several new variables, such as globalisation, trade openness, urbanisation, and financial openness (e.g. Jugurnath and Emrith 2018; Saidi and Mbarek 2017), have been introduced in the estimations to understand and explain this causality in a more detailed way. The results from previous studies point to some channels by which the financial sector can affect environmental quality. For example: (1) financial liberalisation increases the capital supply required by firms and households to invest and consume, and consequently leads to an increase in CO2 emissions (e.g. Sadorsky 2010; Bekhet et al. 2016) and (2) financial openness promotes the investment in green technologies, as well as high energy efficiency, thus improving environmental quality (Tamazian and Rao 2010; Tamazian et al. 2009). Based on this information, the central question of this article will be the following: What is the impact of financial liberalisation on the environmental degradation of the Latin American and Caribbean countries? The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of financial openness on the environmental quality of 21 LAC countries, over a period ranging from 1980 to 2014. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), in the form of an unrestricted error correction model (UECM), was used to decompose the total effects of the variables into their short- and long-run elasticities. Indeed, this investigation is motivated firstly by deepening of knowledge about the possible impacts of financial openness on environmental degradation. Second, the financial openness that is a proxy of globalisation process and environmental degradation has been widely discussed in several international conferences and has gained great concern on the respective subjects from the civil society and governments. Third, the LAC countries are in process of financial liberalisation, and this is made necessary the realisation of this investigation. This study can be considered a pioneer given that: (1) it uses a sample of LAC countries, which is a group not addressed in the literature on this topic; (2) it uses a financial openness variable, instead of the financial development index; (3) it uses the renewable energy consumption, which is essential to identify the effects of alternative energy sources on environmental degradation; (4) it includes impulse dummies to test the robustness of the model to economic shocks (an approach that is not common in investigations that research this topic); (5) it uses the Panel ARDL methodology (the previous literature just uses the ARDL bounds testing); and (6) it explains in a more complete way how the variables are related if compared with other investigations. Moreover, this study can be considered relevant for the following reasons: (1) the empirical findings of this investigation will contribute to the scarce literature on the impact of financial openness on environmental degradation; (2) there is a need to comprehend how these variables interact in the LAC countries; and (3) it will help the LAC policymakers in the development of appropriate economic, energy, and environmental policies for their region. This article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a summary of the literature; Sect. 3 describes the method and description of variables that were used in this article; Sect. 4 shows the empirical results and discussion; and finally, Sect. 5 presents the conclusions and the policy implications.",18

Resosudarmo,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Climate change is causing an increase in extreme weather and climate events, especially in developing countries. These countries are more vulnerable due to their geographic exposure, poverty, high dependence on agriculture, rapid population growth and limited capacity to cope with an uncertain climate. This leads to increased human exposure to natural disasters such as heatwaves, droughts, storms and floods, which are becoming more frequent as the world gets warmer (Stern 2007). Among these major weather events, floods have been recognised as a major cause of economic damage worldwide which, in turn, affects a large number of people (UNISDR 2002). More specifically, this phenomenon has become an annual event over the past few decades in many developing countries’ megacities, and has heavily impacted Asia, where there are large concentrations of people in urban areas (World Resources Institute 2015). In 2014, the level of urbanisation in developing countries was approximately 48.4%, and in the Asian region, the proportion of people living in urban areas was approximately 47.5% (UN 2014). Urbanisation in developing countries has brought on urban management challenges related to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate urban services (Cohen 2004). In some cities, urban expansion has been unplanned or inadequately managed, leading to rapid sprawl, pollution, and environmental degradation, accompanied by unsustainable production and consumption patterns (UN 2014). An apparent lack of capability in managing urban development, as a result of high rates of urbanisation and large populations, along with increasing climate variability and rising sea levels are typically suspected as the main causes of these floods. It is not uncommon that these floods annually cause serious natural disaster events in developing countries (UN and WB 2010). A study undertaken by the World Resources Institute (2015) considered Indonesia to be one of the countries with the greatest number of people exposed to flood risk, ranking 6th out of 164 countries in 2010. Jakarta comprises the largest urban area in Indonesia with a population density of approximately 14, 000 people per km2 (Yusuf et al. 2009). In Jakarta, the cause of flooding is due to not only increasing climate variability and rising sea levels, but also the extensive use of ground water, which has caused subsidence in several areas (World Bank 2011). Flooding is an annual disaster event in Jakarta and most of the time affects a significant number of residents in the city. However, nearly every 5 years when the El Niño phenomenon occurs, the city experiences considerable floods. For example, the 2007 floods were one of the most significant, inundating almost 36% of Jakarta city, in some areas to a depth of seven metres, resulting in over 70 deaths and 340,000 displaced people (Jha et al. 2012; Budiyono et al. 2016). In 2012 and 2017, Jakarta was again hit by considerable flood events. Due to growing concern over the impact of floods on Jakarta, local government and non-government organisations have been developing several intervention programmes, including better managing the risk of disaster, and the resettlement of urban poor populations at the lower end of the scale, up to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Baker 2011). Several of these activities are as follows. Since 2012, with World Bank support, the Jakarta government has developed projects under the “Jakarta Urgent Flood Mitigation Project” to dredge a number of vital floodways and retention basins, and rehabilitating embankments and mechanical equipment that are part of Jakarta’s flood management system. This project aims to keep Indonesia’s capital safer from floods with an investment of USD 139.6 million or Rp 2.5 trillion (World Bank 2016). However, some constraints have proved to be an obstacle to the success of these initiatives, such as the much-needed upgrades to the city infrastructure, the significant lack of research and data regarding floods to support decision making, and the absence of community engagement—both government and community—to take necessary action. The cost of the projects needed to mitigate floods in Jakarta is also not trivial. The Jakarta Water Management Agency estimated that the city needs Rp. 118 trillion (USD 9.2 billion)—approximately twice the total revenue of Jakarta government in 2015—to comprehensively mitigate the seasonal flooding in Jakarta (Tambun et al. 2015). Therefore, reducing the flood risk in Jakarta still remains a challenge to be tackled by the Indonesian government, as a key priority within disaster management. As has been mentioned already, although flooding is a significant occurrence for consideration by any government in developing countries, there has been little research and limited evidence of evaluating the cost to their megacities. Most research has focused on flood risk in developed countries, particularly the United States of America (USA), and has studied the impact of flooding on the price differential of property values and their relation to insurance costs (Carbone et al. 2006; Bin and Landry 2013; Bin and Polasky 2004; Bin et al. 2008a; Atreya et al. 2013). Until recently, only a few studies have analysed the economic damage and loss due to flooding, none of which demonstrate clear patterns in the annual damage costs caused by flooding. On one hand, Budiyono et al. (2015) identified areas of highest risk and assessed Jakarta’s risk using the damage scanner model. They found the annual expected damage due to river flooding in Jakarta to be approximately US$ 321 million per year, and obtained new estimates of economic exposure values for different land use classes (industry and warehouse, commercial and business, planned house, and density urban). While the study undertaken by Wijayanti et al. (2017) measured flood damage in Jakarta but distinguished between residential and business sectors, with reported values of US$ 1.3 million and US$ 9.2 million in 2013, respectively. Lastly, Wahab and Tiong (2017) make reference to the National Development Planning Agency’s formal estimates for direct flood damage in 2002 and 2007 floods as being Rp 5.4 trillion and Rp 5.2 trillion, respectively (Bappenas 2007, cited in Wahab and Tiong 2017). This is in the context of their proposed multi-variate residential flood loss estimation model to estimate direct tangible loss to buildings and contents for the residential sector after the 2013 January floods. The results show that as water flood level (expressed in water depth) increases, the building structure and contents losses (expressed in terms of US$) tend to rise, but the tangible loss for the residential sector in Jakarta city is greater in higher, rather than lower, income areas. In an attempt to fill the recognised research gap, this paper will apply a technique known as hedonic property value analysis (see “Appendix A” for more information on this method), using a combination of data obtained from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS), and flood-level data in Jakarta obtained from the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS). This paper will apply the hedonic price method to see whether the annual flood events have an impact on the housing valuesFootnote 1 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Since this is an annual event, though the size might vary annually, we can expect the housing rental market to be in its equilibrium condition. This study differs from the findings of previous papers, because we study an annual event of flood, as opposed to random flooding events. The main objective is to analyse whether the annual flood events are directly correlated with property values in Jakarta. The paper is divided into six sections, the background and motivation for the research; the use of the hedonic property value method in previous studies; the study area and data utilised in the paper; the empirical modelling; the results obtained from the data; and the concluding statements.",11
21.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,10 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-019-00243-9,Regulation of non-point source pollution under n-firm Bertrand competition,October 2019,Toshiharu Ishikawa,Akio Matsumoto,Ferenc Szidarovszky,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Nowadays, non-point source (NPS) pollution is a major source of environmental quality impairment in waters such as rivers or lakes, the ground and the air. As a result, NPS pollution is also a major health hazard all around the world; therefore, its reduction is an important goal of regulators and governments. A regulator can observe the ambient concentration of NPS pollutants, knows all potential polluters involved in emissions, however, is unable to identity individual contributions to the total pollution. 
It could be very difficult or costly to monitor at the point of origin as well as to measure the individual emissions with sufficient accuracy. In addition, weather uncertainty has a stochastic effect that accelerates the pollution dispersion. In consequence of the informational asymmetries between the regulator and the polluters, traditional environmental policy instruments such as emission taxes or tradable quotas cannot be used to regulate NPS pollution. Concerning NPS pollution control, Xepapadeas (2011) summarizes possible controls in three categories: the first is the input-based scheme that is designed to levy tax on the polluting inputs with which unobservable individual emissions are fully related, the second is the ambient scheme that relates the policy instruments with the ambient concentration of the pollution to be regulated and the last is the scheme with further information acquisition to transform the NPS pollution problem to a PS (point source) pollution problem. In this study, we theoretically consider the effectiveness of the ambient-based policy that Segerson (1988) advocates, focusing on a game-theoretic approach under which the payoff of one polluter depends on the actions of others. Accordingly, the ambient charge or tax is an environmental policy instrument designed to link with observation of NPS pollution. The regulator announces the charge or tax and a cut-off level of ambient concentration and encourages the polluters to pollution reduction by introducing associated penalties and rewards. In particular, if the deviation between the observed level and the cut-off level is positive, then all potential polluters pay tax proportional to the deviation. If negative, then they receive subsidy of a fixed proportion of the deviation. This study focuses attention on whether the ambient charge scheme can control NPS pollution under imperfect competition. In a Cournot framework where quantity competition takes place, it has been demonstrated that an increase of the ambient charge decreases the total level of NPS pollution, which we call a “good-natured” effect. See Raju and Ganguli (2013) for a duopoly case and Matsumoto et al. (2017) for an n -firm case. With this finding, we can expect that environmental policy such as the ambient charge can control NPS pollutions even in the Bertrand (i.e., price competition) market or industry. Nevertheless, the study of Ganguli and Raju (2012) that considers the ambient charge effect in a Bertrand duopoly numerically exhibits a “perverse” effect, that is, an increase in the ambient charge may lead to larger NPS pollutions. On the other hand, Matsumoto et al. (2018) analytically show an opposite result in the same duopoly setting that a higher charge can decrease the total level of pollutions. In the existing literature, however, it has not been revealed yet whether the ambient charge can be effective in an n-firm Bertrand market. The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the economic circumstances under which the ambient charge effect can be good-natured or perverse. As in the standard literature, we employ an n-firm linear model with product differentiation and without uncertainty. Despite this simplicity, it is not easy to determine the direction of the effect because derivatives of the total pollution level with respect to the ambient charge have cumbersome forms. To deal with this difficulty, we introduce a special function in parameters expressing the efficiency of the abatement technology of each firm. We then demonstrate the conditions under which the ambient charge effect is positive or negative. In particular, the followings are the main results: The effect is definitely negative in duopoly and triopoly. In the Bertrand market with \(n\ge 4\), the sign of the effect depends on the number of the firms involved, the degree of substitutability among the goods and heterogeneity of the abatement technology across the firms. In what follows, we introduce a basic model in Sect. 2 and discuss our main results in Sect. 3. Concluding remarks are given in Sect. 4.",5

The first model is as follows: Here, \(\ln \left( {{\text{Rent}}_{\text{i}} } \right)\) is the natural logarithmic value of a listed rental price per month of housing \(i\); \(D_{i}^{k}\) is a dummy variable indicating an apartment unit from which an incident at the closest stigmatized property is type \(k \in \left\{ {\text{Homicide, FireDeath, Suicide}} \right\}\); \({\text{Bld}}_{\text{i}}\) is a dummy variable indicating an apartment unit in a building that has a stigmatized property; \({\mathbf{X}}_{i}\) is a column vector of the control variables representing the characteristics of the apartment unit \(i\); \(\varepsilon_{i}^{1}\) is an error term; and \(\alpha_{1}^{k}\) and \({\varvec{\upbeta}}^{1}\) are the parameters to be estimated. Therefore, the treatments in this empirical setting are the rental housing units in apartment buildings with stigmatized properties, and the controls are those in buildings with no stigmatized properties. The second model adds the distance to the closest stigmatized property, i.e., \({\text{Dist}}_{\text{i}}\), to Eq. (1); then, the hedonic function to be estimated is as follows: Notably, \({\text{Dist}}_{\text{i}}\) is zero if \({\text{Bld}}_{i} = 1\). The coefficient of the cross-term, i.e., \(\delta_{2}^{k}\), indicates the percentage change in the rental price of an apartment unit as it is located farther from the building with the closest stigmatized property by 1 mile. If the stigmatized property has a negative externality in nearby buildings, the coefficient is expected to have a positive sign, because the rental price decreases as the event location becomes closer. The final model adds the cross-term of \({\text{Bld}}_{i}\) and \({\text{Year}}_{i}\), \({\text{Year}}_{i}\) represents the number of years that have passed since the occurrence of the stigmatizing event in the building of apartment unit \(i\), to Eq. (1) as follows: The coefficient of the cross-terms, i.e., \(\gamma_{2}^{k}\), indicates the percentage increase in the rental price of an apartment unit located in a building with a stigmatized property when the time passes by 1 year after the incident. If stigma diminishes over time, the coefficient should have a positive sign. The coefficient for \({\text{Bld}}_{i}\), i.e., \(\gamma_{1}^{k}\), represents the impact on the rental price during the year when the incident occurred (i.e., \({\text{Year}}_{i} = 0\)). Regarding the control variables, i.e., \({\mathbf{X}}_{i}\), we have information about the time to the closest train station, floor level, floor space, number of bedrooms, total number of stories in the building, age of building, and dummy variables representing the types of leasing contract, building types and structures (Table 1). The squared values of the continuous variables are also included in \({\mathbf{X}}_{i}\). To address the effect of multiple stigmatizing sites located near housing \(i\), the number of stigmatized properties within the associated range from housing \(i\) (\(\# {\text{Events}}_{i}\)) and its squared value are included in \({\mathbf{X}}_{i}\). Furthermore, we use two types of regional-dummy variables to address the unobservable local area-specific effects; one variable indicates the municipality, and the other variable indicates the area sharing the same closest train/subway station. In total, 51 municipalities and 565 closest station districts are included in the study area in Tokyo. Addressing these regional fixed effects enabled us to control for various unobservable area-specific effects, such as unattractiveness and potential risk of criminal activities in the neighborhood, and thus, to the best of our ability, extract the externality of stigmatized properties.Footnote 9 The estimations are conducted with different sample sizes by restricting the samples to rental housing units located within 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 miles from the observed stigmatized properties. The number of observations increases from 12,170 to 37,447, 64,296 and 98,888, as the targeted radius extends from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 miles. Changing the coverage of the targeted areas may affect the estimation results in two ways. First, if the external diseconomy of a stigmatized property expands beyond the building, restricting the samples to those in a narrow range from the stigmatized properties underestimates the externality, because the control samples located close to the treatments are also negatively affected. Second, if a stigmatizing event does not occur randomly and is likely to occur in a poorer area, including samples in a larger area overestimates the externality by bringing in additional control observations whose rental prices are higher for other reasons. Table 2 describes the basic statistics of the walking time to the closest train station in minutes (WalkTime), floor level of the unit (FloorLevel), total number of floor levels in the building (Stories), floor space in a square foot of the unit (ft2), number of bedrooms in the unit (#Bedrooms) and year when the building is constructed (BuiltYear). The table shows the mean values of the variables separately for apartment units in buildings with stigmatized properties (Bld = 1) and apartment units in buildings without stigmatized properties (Bld = 0). We test whether the mean values of each variable are the same between the two groups (Bld = 1 versus Bld = 0). According to the P values obtained from the test, we find no significant differences between the buildings in terms of the unit characteristics, i.e., square footage and number of bedrooms. However, the building characteristics differ such that the apartment buildings with stigmatized properties tend to be closer to stations, higher and older than the apartment buildings with no stigmatized properties. It seems plausible that higher (which likely indicates larger) and older buildings tend to have more records of stigmatized properties when random occurrence is assumed. The fact that buildings with stigmatized properties tend to be closer to stations implies the possibility that mortality incidents are more easily exposed to the public and/or that apartment buildings are relatively large near stations. When the targeted radius is restricted from 0.5 to 0.1 miles, the differences in the building characteristics between two groups decrease, except for the difference in the means of BuiltYear which remain statistically significant at the 1% level. Table 3 describes the estimation results of Eq. (1). Columns [3-1], [3-2], [3-3] and [3-4] use samples lying within 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 miles from stigmatized properties, respectively. The numbers in parentheses represent the municipality cluster robust standard errors. The results of the coefficients of the other control variables are shown in Table 7 in the Appendix. Among the three types of mortality incidents, only the coefficients of homicide show negative and statistically significant signs at the 10% level. The coefficient of homicide shown in column [3-1] is − 0.0408, indicating that the rental price decreases by approximately 4% on average if a homicide occurred in the same building compared with the rental price within 0.1 miles of a similar apartment (conditional on observables) in an apartment building sharing the same closest station in the same municipality but without any recorded stigmatized properties. This impact is smaller than the impact on the stigmatized property, which is reported as a 20–30% discount in the web articles listed earlier (Suzuki 2013; Real Estate Japan, 2017, 2018). The coefficients of deaths by fire and suicide are nonsignificant, but they show the expected negative signs. The absolute values of the estimated coefficients increased as the targeted radius was extended. There are two possible explanations for this observation. First, homicide incidents may induce negative externality not only within the building but also in nearby apartment buildings, and thus, the magnitude of the coefficient decreases when the samples are restricted to only nearby apartment buildings. Second, homicide incidents may be more likely to occur in poor areas; therefore, including housing samples with farther distances from the stigmatized property as a control group overestimates the externality. To examine the possibility of the presence of external diseconomy outside the building, we estimate Eq. (2) to examine the relationship between the rent and the distance to the building with the closest stigmatized property. The coefficients shown in the bottom half of Table 4 describe the effect of the distance to the stigmatized property on rent. None of the coefficients are significant, and the magnitudes are very small. The negative externality outside the building is not supported by these results. Table 5 shows the estimation results of Eq. (3), which examines the impact of the time passed from an incident on the rent of a different unit in the same building. The coefficient Bld for homicide shown in column [5-1] indicates that the rent in the same apartment building decreases by approximately 10% immediately following a homicide incident. The coefficient of the cross-term of homicide indicates that the rent in the same building recovers by approximately 1.4% as each additional year passes from the homicide incident. These results reveal that homicide incidents cause a significant decrease in nearby rental prices within the building, but the negative externality is ameliorated gradually over time. A time attenuation effect is observed in other hedonic studies in different contexts. For instance, Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber (2013) examine the negative impact of shale exploration activity in Pennsylvania on neighboring properties and find that the impact diminishes over time. These authors argue that potential buyers are likely to perceive considerable risks associated with the exploration at the beginning, but perceptions of risk diminish as time passes. Guignet et al. (2016) study the impact of ground water quality on property prices in Florida and find that the property price devalued by 3–6% when contamination is revealed by tests conducted by the local government, but the negative impact lasts only up to a few years. The authors provide the following two explanations for this observation: “prices may rebound once contamination issues have been resolved and (…) information about contamination becomes less relevant and/or available to buyers and sellers over time.” In the context of stigmatized properties, there are two possible explanations for the diminishing externality over time. As time passes from an incident in a building, (1) potential buyers become less aware of the stigmatized property, and (2) the impact of psychological stigma is attenuated. The hedonic estimate in this study reflects the mixed effect of these two factors, i.e., awareness and psychological stigma of the incident. Therefore, the estimate can be regarded as the lower bound of the psychological stigma under which potential buyers are fully informed of the historical event in the building. In a related study involving incomplete information, Walsh and Mui (2017) examine the impact of a New Jersey property disclosure law requiring sellers to disclose any local threats that they are aware of to buyers. These authors find that the property price declined after the enforcement of the disclosure law in the area where contaminated sites were not widely known before the law, but the price did not change in areas where the contaminated sites were well known from the beginning. In our study, homicide incidents are likely more widely recognized by potential buyers than suicide and fire death incidents, potentially explaining why the estimates show significant negative signs only for homicide, but we cannot avoid the possibility that the other types of incidents have significant psychological stigma in the neighborhood. Based on the results, Table 6 shows the rental difference due to a homicide incident occurring in the same apartment building relative to the rent of an apartment building with no incidents. The numbers shown in the eight columns in the table depict the rental differences from 1 year to 8 years after a homicide incident. Compared with the rent in an apartment building with no stigmatized properties, the rent decreases by approximately 8–10% 1 year after the occurrence of an incident in the same building, but the difference diminishes to 3.3% after 6 years and becomes statistically insignificant after 7 years.",4

Although the literature is quite abundant on the subject, it is worth noting that most contributions are theoretical and do not lead to a consensus on the effects of environmental taxes on economic growth. Endogenous growth models have been used to analyze the effects of environmental taxes on growth rate.Footnote 1 An environmental tax can potentially operate through different mechanisms such as investment, education and R&D. Overall, to generate a positive growth effect, many studies incorporate environmental quality into the firm’s production function, as an externality, by assuming that a clean environment would improve the productivity of inputs or the efficiency of the educational system (Ligthart and van der Ploeg 1994; Bovenberg and Smulders 1995; Bovenberg and Heijdra 1998; Grimaud 1999; Hart 2004; Nakada 2004; Chen et al. 2009; Pautrel 2008; Aloi and Tournemaine 2011). By developing an endogenous growth model, in which pollution affects human capital depreciation and worker’s productivity, Gradus and Smulders (1993), Smulders and Gradus (1996), Van Ewijk and Van Wijnbergen (1994) and Pautrel (2008) show that a tax on emissions, via its effect on learning abilities, promotes long-run growth. Using a similar framework, Oueslati (2002) also highlights that labor–leisure choice plays a role in the transmission of the environmental tax effect in a two-sector model of endogenous growth. In more recent studies, Nong (2018) assesses the effects of energy taxes on the Vietnamese economy using a computable general equilibrium model. He shows that if the taxes on petroleum products and coal are increased jointly, a real GDP, exports and imports will decline at relatively high rates. The country will also experience relatively high inflation rates. In the same context, Lin and Jia (2018) study the impact of carbon tax on the Chinese economy by constructing the same model. However, they find that China can impose a high tax rate on energy industries and energy-intensive industries without significantly harming economic growth. They confirm that this policy will maximize emissions reductions and only have a small impact on China’s GDP. On the other side, and in the light of the wave of environmental tax reforms that started in the early 1990s in a number of OECD countries, the majority of theoretical researches assume that these reforms will generate a positive impact on environmental tax on economic growth (see Goulder 1995; Bovenberg and De Mooij 1997; Fullerton and Metcalf 1997; Bosquet 2000; Markandya 2005; Freire-González and Puig-Ventosa 2019). The basic idea is that a switch from different taxes to taxes on polluting goods can achieve a ‘double dividend’: (1) an improvement in the environment and (2) an economic benefit. They assume that the revenues generated from environmental taxes could be used to cut distorting taxes on labor and capital and thus reduce the excess burden of the tax system, with positive consequences for employment and investment and thus for economic growth. The empirical examination of the nature of the relationship between environmental tax and economic growth is an important issue for OECD countries, as it shows whether the use of tax as an instrument for environmental policy has any correlation and whether it will have a positive or negative correlation with economic growth. Despite the existence of numerous papers that focus on the use of theoretical models to examine the effects of environmental taxes on economic growth, there is a surprising lack of empirical work exploring these effects. According to our knowledge, only three econometric studies investigate the impact of environmental taxation on economic growth. They are presented in Appendix (A) with conflicting findings. While Morley (2010) finds that total environmental taxation is negatively associated with growth, Dökmen (2012) observes a positive relationship between those variables. On the other hand, Abdullah and Morley (2014) uses Granger causality tests to study the causal relationship between environmental taxes and economic growth. The results are shown in Appendix (A). The lack of structured data on environmental taxation may explain the scarcity of empirical studies on the subject. The data provided by the OECD contains only statistics about the revenue generated from environmentally related taxes but not about their rates. These revenues are measured in four units: millions of USD, a share of total tax revenues, per capita, and percent of GDP. However, these methods of measurement consider the revenue from taxes without taking into account the variations in the tax base. This may weaken the role that environmental taxation can play in the economy and does not reflect its real impact on the economic variables. This study proposes an alternative approach taking into account not only the revenue generated but also the variations in the tax base. Environmentally related taxes include seven categories: energy; motor vehicles and transport; ozone-depleting substances; water and wastewater; waste management; mining and quarrying, and other environmentally related taxes. This implies that environmentally related taxes are imposed on different tax bases. Therefore, it is difficult to construct a common base for these factors. For this reason and to apply our new approach, we focus our analysis on the most important category among them: energy taxes (see Sect. 2). The total final consumption of polluting energy productsFootnote 2 is considered as a base of these taxes. Therefore, the proxy that we construct to measure energy taxes is calculated as follows: energy tax revenues measured in million American dollars divided by the total final consumption of polluting energy products measured in ton of oil equivalent. This proxy is then used to achieve two objectives: First, examining the nature of the relationship between energy taxes and economic growth rate in the short term. The second objective is to test whether the effect of energy taxes on the economic growth rate is sensitive to the level of other variables, such as the initial level of a country’s richness, polluting energy use (as internal factors in the economy) and commercial openness of goods (as external factor in the economy). The novelty in this work lies in three aspects. First, we propose a new approach to measure energy taxes. Second, we provide the first empirical evidence on the sensibility of the effects of energy taxes on the economic growth rate for the level of other variables in the economy. Third, the analysis is based on a balanced dataset for a large sample of OECD countries, where the multiple imputation method was used to complete the missing data. This method has improved data quality and inferences validity. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the motivation for this study by providing an overview of trends in energy taxes revenues, total final consumption of polluting energy products, and GDP per capita growth rate in OECD countries over the last two decades. Section 3 presents the empirical model. Section 4 describes the data used. In Sect. 5, we discuss the empirical results. The last section concludes the paper by summarizing the main findings.",2

The reduction in rainfall, which affects water supply, together with higher temperatures have been associated with an increase in water demand for residential and non-residential uses (Nauges and Thomas 2003; Gaudin 2006; Hanemann and Nauges 2006). In other words, residential water demand is highly sensitive to seasonal variables. Water demand increases in the summer, because there are more outside uses such as watering gardens, filling swimming pools, and washing cars, and inside uses such as more frequent showers. In addition, social drivers such as the increase in per capita income associated with the process of economic development, is allowing households to rise their consumption of goods and services, including water. The two stylised facts suggest that the distribution of water consumption might be changing across time. Chile is among the longest north–south countries in the world. Its territory is long and narrow, stretching over 4300 km (2670 mi) from north to south, while its narrowest and widest points are only 90 km (60 mi) and 445 km (276 mi), respectively. The country comprises a wide range of climate zones across its large territory. It has a desert climate in the north, mediterranean climate in central Chile, and oceanic and tundra climate in the south. Chile is experiencing the effects of climate change. A study conducted by CONAMA (2007) showed that, since the decade of the 1970s, there is a decreasing trend in rainfall in Central, Southern, and Austral Chile, while temperatures have remained stable. The study predicts increases in the zero isotherm and temperatures in all regions of the country, while rainfall will increase in the north and decrease in the Central, Southern and Austral zones of Chile. Although Chile is not considered a developed country, it is the most prosperous nation of South America and it is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank. The country is one of the 35 members of the OECD and, together with Argentina, is the only Latin American nations in the group of Very High Human Development countries (UNDP 2016). Therefore, we believe that Chile, an emerging country with distinctive geographic characteristics, is an interesting place to study the dynamics of water consumption and their relationship with climate variability and economic development. This paper studies the process of convergence of residential water consumption in Chilean localities that is the process of equalisation of water consumption levels across geographic units. We want to answer two questions: (1) is there convergence in residential water consumption across Chilean localities? and, (2) which are the causes of convergence or divergence? As suggested before, if there were convergence, two main factors would seem to be the causes: the change in climate variables across the country and the increase in per capita income. To answer these questions, econometric models taken from the literature of economic growth were used to analyse a panel database of 348 Chilean localities from 2010 to 2015, containing data about water consumption levels, water prices, socioeconomic variables, and weather. Water consumption convergence and its determinants are important because, if localities with low levels of water consumption were converging to the levels of localities with high levels of water consumption—which it seems to be the case—total water demand will increase, putting pressure on water utilities which have to supply water, and it will cause a rapid increase in water prices that could seriously affect the water consumption of the households. To effectively address this problem, it is necessary to understand the causes of such convergence. Chile has localities with increasing and decreasing water consumption levels, but most of them are increasing their water consumption. Thus, the overall average is increasing, and this trend might continue in the future due to climate change and the rising living standards. However, convergence in water consumption across geographic regions might not occur with certainty, especially in the case of Chile, given that the country has a distinctive structural characteristic: its climate variability; so, it is not clear that water consumption levels of arid and rainy localities would be similar in the long run. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of the literature about economic convergence and water demand. Section 3 describes the data used in our research. Section 4 details the econometric approach used to analyse the data. Section 5 discusses the results of the analysis. Section 6 summarises the main results and conclusions of the study.",6

People’s attitudes and behaviours vis-à-vis environmental protection have become a fertile area in which to examine the importance of non-monetary incentives. In this field, for example, Halvorsen (2008), Hage et al. (2009) and Abbott et al. (2013) have shown that moral and social norms influence pro-environmental behaviours, while Brekke et al. (2003, 2010) and Czajkowski et al. (2017) have found that self-image is central to recycling behaviour. Owen and Videras (2006, 2007) and Videras et al. (2012), moreover, have explained that individuals who are more willing to behave according to civic and cultural norms and have more social ties are also more willing to protect the natural environment. In this paper, by pro-social behaviours, we mean the highest level of social cooperation that limits free-riding behaviour. Among the main environmental problems, we consider waste prevention, disposal and recycling, as the European Commission published several waste-related directives intended to reduce waste generation and increase waste recycling (Nicolli and Mazzanti 2011; Cecere et al. 2014). Our contribution to the literature lies mainly in the empirical analysis of the relationship between pro-social behaviours, the individual’s attitude regarding waste prevention and disposal and the individual’s recycling behaviour in Italy at the end of the 1990s, in a period which ushered in national environmental policy to make the Italian population aware of the importance of waste prevention, disposal and recycling (the so-called Decreto Ronchi, Legislative Decree 22/1997). Prior to this period, individual awareness of and behaviours related to environmental waste problems were conditioned primarily by individual culture and lifestyles. Starting from this legislative provision, gradually, the garbage collection system and the garbage pricing have been changed and consequentially, the individual behaviours have been influenced also from these changes. In specific terms, after a slight change of theoretical framework described in Czajkowski et al. (2017), we perform the first empirical assessment of the relationship between pro-social behaviours, waste concern and recycling behaviour for Italy considering the year 1998, because at the end of the 1990s, national environmental policy in Italy neither provided monetary incentives nor obliged its inhabitants to adopt pro-environment behaviours. Thus, it can be stated that attitudes to waste prevention and disposal and recycling behaviour were mainly influenced by non-monetary incentives. These contributions also represent the added value of our paper to the literature. In other words, previous studies on the relationship between non-monetary incentives and recycling attitude and behaviour did not analyse the relationship between pro-environmental behaviours, waste concern and recycling behaviour; did not consider Italy in the investigation sample and did not include a scenario in which national environmental policy did not influence individual’s attitude regarding waste prevention and disposal and the individual’s recycling behaviour. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 offers a brief review of the related literature, while Sect. 3 presents a small change of the model contained in Czajkowski et al. (2017). Section 4 describes the data and presents the empirical strategy. Section 5 illustrates the results, while the final section concludes.",7

Seriño,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Inequality in carbon emissions is one of the most relevant issues in designing climate change mitigation policies. The emissions inequality between developed and developing countries has been one of the biggest challenges hampering the process of forging international agreements towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions (Clarke-Sather et al. 2011; Heil and Wodon 1997). Developed countries fear that limiting their emissions will disrupt their economy, while developing and emerging countries argue that their growth should not be limited by any climate mitigation policies, because historically, their level of carbon emissions has been low (Heil and Wodon 1997; Duro and Padilla 2006). With these arguments, coming up with global climate mitigation policies has been very challenging. The current disparity in emissions across countries or regions is enormous. Take for example in 1960, according to the World Bank (2019), Europe emitted 5.765 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per capita, while East Asia and Pacific emitted only 1.162 metric tons of CO2 per capita. However, this disparity in emissions changed recently. Much of the increase in emissions was observed from developing East Asia and Pacific where the CO2 emissions per capita jumped to 6.294 tons, while Europe posted around 6.379 tons of CO2 per capita in 2014 (World Bank 2019). Over the last 2 decades, a greater share of the increase in global carbon emissions has come from developing countries, notably from China and other emerging economies (Seriño 2017). Though the problem is global, it is relevant to investigate the situation in the local context. Understanding emissions inequality has direct implication towards efforts in reducing carbon emissions at the household level. Any mitigation policies aimed at curbing carbon emissions have a different effect in a relatively equal society than in a more unequal one. Grunewald et al. (2017) mentioned that it is easier to arrive at a social consensus on environmental policies in a more equal society. Likewise, Boyce (1994) emphasized that greater inequality can be expected to further aggravate environmental degradation. Examining carbon footprint inequality can help us understand the distribution and burdens of emissions at the household level. Carbon emissions inequality is of particular relevance concerning sustainable development (Yang et al. 2017) and this topic remains largely unstudied dimension in mitigating climate change. In this vein, this paper investigates carbon footprintFootnote 1 inequality at the household level. The approach will be twofold. First, we investigate the inequality in the carbon footprint and its relationship to income distribution. We analyze the concentration of household emissions by ranking the households based on income and not on emissions. Second, we decompose emissions inequality into subgroups to see what drives emissions inequality. Decomposing household carbon footprint inequality is important because of its policy relevance. It allows us to study whether the change in emissions inequality is fueled by a reduction in the emissions gap between the rich and the poor households or whether the change is due to the homogeneity of lifestyles of households within the same-income group. The distribution of carbon footprint between households is an important policy issue, because households in the same region shall bear different responsibilities for reducing emissions (Xu et al. 2016). Decomposing emissions inequality will also allow us to scrutinize the contributions of different household consumption items to the total emissions inequality. Basing from the Philippine data on Family Income and Expenditure Survey for 2000 and 2006, we estimate the embodied carbon emissions from household consumption and investigate carbon footprint inequality. The focus of this paper is on emissions inequality, because it concerns about the distribution of emissions burden among households and results may elicit policy actions concerning environmental justice. According to Yang et al. (2017), household carbon footprint inequality has strong implications to environmental and social justice. No matter who you are, where you are, no matter how large or small is your emissions, everyone contributes alarming concentration of carbon emissions in the atmosphere (Groot 2010). The diversity of individual contribution implies that designing mitigation policies in reducing carbon emissions requires knowledge of distribution and extent of inequality. The rich and poor households have different abatement abilities and these mitigation policies should be distinct to households based on the extent of carbon footprint inequality (Xu et al. 2016). This paper may contribute to the existing literature in two major aspects. First, it will investigate emissions inequality from the household perspective. Household differences in emissions particularly from developing countries such as the Philippines is largely understudied. Considering differences in household consumption patterns, results of the study may present a practical approach for policy makers in intervening the usual trajectory of carbon-intensive consumption. Second, the decomposition of emissions inequality based on consumption sources can uncover dominant sources inducing wider disparity in emissions. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the recent studies concerning household emissions inequality; Sect. 3 describes the methodological approach employed including the sources of data; Sect. 4 presents the empirical findings and Sect. 5 provides the conclusion. Policy implications are also discussed in Sect. 5.",3

LaPlue,Christopher A. Erickson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Climate change, and its primary driver, greenhouse gasses (GHGs) have gained increasing public attention, and with reason. Even seemingly small changes in global temperatures can have dramatic consequences for economic development, the access to potable water and for food security (Stern 2008; Schlenker et al. 2006; Roberts and Schlenker 2010). The U.S. is the second largest global emitter of GHGs and was responsible for 14.5% of global carbon emissions 2014 (Boden et al. 2017), so changes in U.S. emission trends can have significant global effects. Furthermore, understanding the factors behind recent observed declines in U.S. emissions may have implications for major emitters. The increased attention and resulting public debate might lead a casual observer to conclude that economic growth is tightly correlated with growth in GHG emissions, and its largest component, carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the data reveal a decoupling of U.S. GHG emissions and GDP. Between 1970 and 2015, annual U.S. CO2 emissions grew 25%; however, the trend has not been monotonic. Between 1970 and 2005, CO2 emissions grew at an annual rate of 1.2%, but since 2005, have declined at an annual rate of 1.1%. During the same 45-year period, U.S. real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.2% (Fig. 1).Footnote 1 This paper analyzes the decoupling of these two trends using a new dataset created by combining National Income and Product Accounts data released by the BEA and EPA that allows us to allocate GHG emissions across 56 industries representing a broad share of U.S. economic activity from 1997 to 2015. The dataset facilitates analysis of the relative importance of changes in domestic industry output, emission intensity and industry mix, as well as an additional analysis of the role of trade on emissions.Footnote 2 Growth in U.S. GDP and CO2 emissions: 1970–2015. Source: EPA Air Quality Trends Report (2017). This figure presents the percent change, normalized to 0 in 1970, in total annual GDP, and CO2 emissions from all major U.S. sectors: residential, utilities, agricultural, commercial, industrial, and transportation This paper makes two contributions to the study of GHG emissions. The first is a detailed decomposition analysis of U.S. GHG emissions into three channels, facilitated by the development of a new dataset linking GHG emissions and industry-level output, covering all U.S. productive economic activity. The second is an investigation of the impact of industry-level international trade on U.S. GHG emissions. Various decomposition approaches have been used in related literature to investigate the factors underlying changes in environmental indicators. Two such approaches evaluated by Hoekstra and van der Bergh (2003) are a structural decomposition analysis (which makes use of detailed input–output data) and index decomposition analysis (which generally makes use of sector-level output data). Variants of both approaches seek to understand the meaningful economic channels underlying changes, over time, in an indicator variable of interest, for example, output or emissions. Levinson (2009b), in his seminal work, decomposed changes in several criteria air pollutants released by industries in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Similar analytical techniques have since been used to examine criteria air emissions of European manufacturers (Brunel 2017; Diakoulaki and Mandaraka 2007), and the CO2 emissions of manufacturers in India (Barrows and Ollivier 2016; Martin 2011), Spain (Butnar and Llop 2007), China (Zhang 2012; Su et al. 2013), and Japan (Cole et al. 2013). The recent release of more detailed GHG data by the EPA, and industry-level input–output account for 71 U.S. industries by the BEA allows us to investigate environmental consequences of changes both within and across industries. To provide a comprehensive summary of U.S. GHG emissions, the EPA aggregates emissions of several leading GHGs (including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and other fluorinated gasses) and provides the data as a “CO2 equivalent” measures (CO2e) which uses the global-warming potentials of the other measured GHGs to convert to a standardized measure (Hertwich and Peters 2009),Footnote 3 which is the emission measure used in the following analysis. We focus on 56 industries within four major sectors—agriculture, commercial, mining and manufacturing. These sectors in the aggregate are responsible for 95% of U.S. output (both final and intermediate goods) and 37% of U.S. GHG emissions.Footnote 4 Our approach begins with the industry output measures, and is thus more akin to index decomposition analysis, but combines aspects of the structural decomposition approach to analyze the influence of international trade. Following Levinson (2009b), we first decompose changes in CO2e emissions into scale, composition and technique effects. The scale effect arises from changes in aggregate economic output, and identifies changes in CO2e emission resulting from increased output, all else equal. The composition effect identifies the change in emissions resulting from the redistribution of production among industries either toward or away from relatively clean industries. The technique effect measures changes in emissions arising from changes in industries’ emission intensity. We find that the composition effect is responsible for roughly 35% of the decline in aggregate emission intensity, while within-industry changes to production techniques are responsible for the remaining 65%. This is consistent with findings in Levinson (2009b, 2015), Shapiro and Walker (2018) and Brunel (2017) who employed a similar analytical approach to study criteria air pollutant emissions by the U.S., and European manufacturing sector.Footnote 5 Environmental regulation has been cited as a plausible explanation underlying the declines in the aggregate emission intensities found by these studies. In contrast, direct regulation is not a plausible explanation for our findings as GHG emissions were subject to only sporadic state action and no federal regulationFootnote 6 prior to 2011 (Wallach 2012).Footnote 7 Alternative explanations, explored in relation to U.S. criteria air pollutant declines, include technological progress and competitive responses to increased international trade.Footnote 8 GHG emissions arise from a variety of activities. Emissions of GHGs associated with the residential, and transportation sectors have garnered significant attention over the past decade (Chong 2012; Jacobsen et al. 2012; Bento et al. 2013; Kirkpatrick and Bennear 2014; Holland et al. 2016). Other work has highlighted the role of hydraulic fracturing in driving down emissions of electricity producers by lowering the cost of relatively cleaner natural gas (Knittel et al. 2015; Holladay and LaRiviere 2017). A growing body of work, utilizing both decomposition and econometric analysis, has highlighted the importance of energy use, intensity, and substitution underlying changes in manufacturing emissions of both OECD and non-OECD countries (Agnolucci and Arvanitopoulos 2019; Tan and Lin 2018; Wang et al. 2018; Kim and Kim 2012; Dachraoui and Harchaoui 2006; Cole et al. 2005; Liaskas et al. 2000). Our analysis utilizes relatively detailed industry data on output and energy inputs to identify the relative importance of structural changes in relative industry output and industry emission intensity across industries to the observed changes in U.S. GHG emissions. The U.S. has published detailed toxic emission data for several decades. However, due in part to the historical lack of detailed GHG data, the relative importance of different potential factors driving GHG emissions across different sectors of the U.S. economy are less studied and understood. While various other studies have made use of more aggregated data with broader cross-country coverage (Wiedmann et al. 2007; Tukker and Jansen 2006), the additional industry-level detail leveraged in the analysis in this paper gives more precise insight into the relative importance of various channels driving recent declines in U.S. GHG emissions. A lack of similarly detailed GHG data for U.S. trade partners inhibits the application of our approach to assess the net global environmental effects of recent changes in U.S. supply chains and consumption patterns–the primary objective of decompositions based on multi-regional input–output models (Turner et al. 2007). Peters and Hertwich (2006) perform a related analysis for Norway, building a similarly detailed input–output dataset covering 49 industry groups, for both Norway and its seven largest trading partners, to investigate the GHG emissions embodied in Norway’s consumption. In contrast, our approach focuses on the drivers of underlying changes in U.S. CO2e emissions, and estimates how those emissions might have differed using a counterfactual analysis that considers emissions embodied in both imports and exports over the period. To extend our baseline decomposition results to investigate the relative importance of international trade for U.S. emissions, we make use of industry data on imports and exports collected by the BEA. Using import–export data facilitates further disaggregation of the composition effect due to domestic production, imports of intermediate or final goods, and exports. Our results indicate that substantial increases in exports and imports since 1997 have only driven a small portion (roughly six percent) of the observed compositional shift in U.S. production towards cleaner production. Furthermore, though offshoring of both intermediate and final goods has increased dramatically in recent years, total U.S. imports, of intermediate and final goods, represent roughly 290 million metric tons of off-shored emissions in 2015—equivalent to less than five percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in the same year. Related work has focused specifically on the environmental effects of trade. Zugravu-Soilita (2018), using a similar decomposition to the approach employed in this paper, and examining a large panel of less developed “transition economies”, finds evidence of trade-induced increases in CO2 due to a large-scale composition effect. Similarly, cross-country analysis by Frankel and Rose (2005) found significant evidence that more stringent U.S. environmental regulation drove CO2 emissions off-shore (a pollution haven effect), although the evidence of pollution havens was limited for the other pollutants studied.Footnote 9 Still, the link between trade and environmental outcomes remains somewhat in question. For example, work by Levinson (2009b, 2015), Shapiro and Walker (2018) and Brunel (2017) has found very little evidence of a link between increased trade and environmental outcomes. In contrast, recent finding by Barrows and Ollivier (2018) and Cherniwchan (2017) point to an important role played by trade potentially working through the industry-level technique effect, driven by firm-level choices regarding product mixes, and production technology, respectively. A growing literature (Wiedmann et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2007) seeks to trace out the global environmental consequences associated with changing production and consumption patterns. This literature emphasizes that understanding global GHG consequences of globalization should incorporate industry or even firm-level emission intensities of the global partners responsible for upstream portions of a country’s final consumption (Minx et al. 2009; Andrew et al. 2009; Huppes 2006). Understanding cross-country differences in the GHG intensity of consumption categories, for example, food, housing, transportation, etc., is important for understanding the factors driving changes in global GHG emissions (Hertwich and Peters 2009). Due in large part to the lack of similarly detailed industry-level output and emission data among U.S. trading partners, the current project is narrower in scope, focusing on providing more precise insights into the specific structural economic changes underlying observed changes in U.S. CO2e emissions, without seeking to fully investigate the global Ecological Footprint effects (Wackernagel and Rees 1996) of offshoring specific aspects of the U.S. supply chain to particular countries. Our findings indicate that recent expansions of U.S. imports and exports have contributed only a small portion of the observed declines in U.S. emissions of GHGs. Understanding the underlying dynamics that explain the increasing decoupling of U.S. GHG emissions from U.S. GDP is important for the design of effective and efficient environmental policies. Studying the influence of trade is particularly important for GHG emissions, because GHGs are uniformly mixing pollutants. Thus, GHG emissions at any location contribute equally to global temperature changes and related effects. Consequently, shifts in production to other jurisdictions with less stringent regulations do not actually generate any meaningful environmental gains (Holland 2012; Fell and Maniloff 2018). In fact, to the extent that production of similar products is more emission intensive in other parts of the world, the apparent U.S. gains could in fact mask an actual reduction in U.S. environmental quality. For example, Hasanbeigi et al. (2016) document substantial variation in the CO2 emission intensity of steel production across four of the world’s leading steel-producing countries. Their results indicate that steel production shifted from the U.S. to China could generate nearly 25% more CO2 emissions per tonne.Footnote 10 This concern is lent additional weight by Jiang and Green (2017), Peters and Hertwich (2006) and Shui and Harriss (2006) who link shifts in the global supply chain, to China and other southern-hemisphere countries, to a rise in global CO2 emissions. The uniformly mixing characteristic of GHGs makes efficient and effective regulation in a global setting quite challenging, theoretically, and motivates additional investigation regarding relative importance of changes in domestic production, as well as international trade and offshoring, to the observed recent declines in U.S. GHG emissions. If global trade imbalances and supply chain changes, specifically a rise in pollution havens, are contributing substantially to observed changes in GHG emissions, it lends additional weight to the need for cross-country policy responses. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the methods behind the decomposition theory that provides the basis for the analysis and discusses the data and its application.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the growing concern over rising fossil fuel prices and greenhouse gas emissions gave birth to the notion of a “nuclear renaissance”—a possible revival of the nuclear power industry. At the same time, the rise of concern about issues related to energy security and global warming unleashed the potential of new renewables (i.e., solar, wind, biomass and biofuels, geothermal, tidal, wave and ocean energy, etc.) in the electricity mix of OECD countries, because they were thought of as clean, indigenous and sustainable energy sources. There are potential synergies between nuclear energy and renewables: both of them are carbon-free energy sources that could be a major solution to greenhouse gas emissions; the aim of reducing the dependence on oil and gas imports can be achieved by promoting the use of nuclear energy and renewables. The Fukushima accident had a profound effect on the nuclear power industry. All Japanese nuclear reactors had been gradually shut down from 2011 to 2013. Japan has been mostly reliant on fossil fuel imports to fill the gap left by the shutdown of nuclear reactors (Ikegami and Wang 2016). In 2015, the Japanese government adopted a policy for nuclear energy to comprise 20–22% of the electricity mix in 2030. In Japan, five reactors have been allowed to restart since late 2016, but only three of them are currently operating. Following the Fukushima accident, Germany and Belgium sped up their plans to phase out nuclear power in 2022 and 2025, respectively. In Germany, terminating the reliance on nuclear power has been tied up with increasing the share of renewables (in total electricity production) to reduce oil and gas imports. Switzerland turned away from plans to build new reactors to replace the old ones. France passed a law in 2015 to limit further growth of nuclear capacity (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency 2017). Whether an increasing supply of renewable electricity could suppress nuclear energy consumption in OECD countries is a policy-relevant but sparsely studied issue. Jaforullah and King (2015) found that aggregate carbon emissions were negatively related to renewable energy consumption but were unrelated to nuclear energy consumption in the US over the period 1960–2007, and suggested that greater reliance on renewables, rather than the expansion of nuclear energy sector, should be encouraged, because renewables would be more likely to contribute to emissions reductions. A natural outgrowth of this observation is whether renewable electricity could overtake nuclear energy in the electricity mix of developed countries. A handful of studies focused on a hypothetical replacement for nuclear power by renewables in a single country through simulations of scenarios or a survey. On the other hand, cross-country studies on the impact of renewables on nuclear energy are sadly lacking. There is a dearth of cross-country evidence on this critical issue and as a consequence the wider possibilities of replacing nuclear energy with renewables are unknown. This paper aims to contribute to closing the gap. York and McGee (2017) claimed that in affluent nations with high levels of renewables, there was a tendency for renewables to squeeze nuclear energy out. We therefore pay particular attention to the suppressive effect of renewables on nuclear energy in OECD countries. Our paper is conceptually related to a branch of literature on income growth, carbon emissions, and nuclear (renewable) energy consumption. Apergis et al. (2010) examined the causal relationship between aggregate carbon emissions, nuclear and renewable energy consumption, and economic growth for 19 countries over the period 1984–2007. Sadorsky (2009) found that increases in real GDP per capita and carbon emissions per capita were the driving force behind renewable energy consumption in the G7 countries over the period 1980–2005. Baek and Pride (2014) found a significant and negative long-run relationship between the share of nuclear energy (in total electricity production) and carbon emissions per capita for Canada, France, Japan and the US over the period 1965–2007. Our paper differs from theirs in some important dimensions. First, we investigate the impact of renewable electricity on nuclear energy consumption in OECD countries while controlling for real GDP per capita, the proportion of carbon emissions from electricity production (to fuel combustion-related carbon emissions), and energy dependency (i.e., net energy imports as a percentage of energy use). Second, we adopt the heterogeneous panel data methods to explicitly account for cross-country dependencies and heterogeneity in the panel. Third, we try to establish whether renewables tend to suppress nuclear energy in electric power generation, which may help solve the puzzle that adding renewable sources of electricity has not been effective in reducing carbon emissions in affluent nations. We aim at providing some new insights into the long-run relationship between nuclear energy and renewables. Using a panel of 15 OECD countries [Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Hungary, Japan, Korea (Rep.), Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and the US] over the period 1991–2015, we investigate the impact of the increasing availability of renewable electricity on nuclear energy consumption. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, to find solid evidence that renewables tend to squeeze nuclear energy out in electric power generation. Second, to enrich policy discussions on to what extent renewables could replace nuclear energy in OECD countries. To ensure robust results, in our model specifications, we first consider the impact of the share of electricity produced from renewable sources in total electricity production (hereafter the share of renewables) on nuclear energy consumption per capita. We then turn to the impact of the share of renewables on the share of electricity produced from nuclear sources in total electricity production (hereafter the share of nuclear energy). Finally, we examine the results of both specifications and draw conclusions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The econometric model, estimation and testing procedures, together with the data, are introduced in Sect. 2. The main results are presented in Sect. 3, followed by additional results and discussion in Sect. 4. Section 5 ends with conclusions and policy implications.",

The proposal extends the burden-sharing framework designed in 2008 (Official Journal of the European Union 2009). This new burden-sharing is called by the EC as the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). The text proposes several new features of the European framework aimed at limiting GHG emissions for the period 2021–2030. As pointed out by Sartor et al. (2015), the proposal raises a new and critical challenge because it will be more difficult to comply with the 2030 targets than it was in 2020. This is mainly because the overall emissions cuts required are deeper in 2030 (− 30% with respect to 2005 levels) than they were in 2020 (− 10%). Moreover, the ESR, based on GDP per capita and not on abatement potentials, leads to the risk that a number of Member States (MS) may simply fail to meet their targets [see, for example, the analysis performed at the MS level by Sartor et al. (2015)]. If the EC still wants to use a GDP per capita rule for allocating a GHG budget across MSs, it requires the implementation of flexibility mechanisms to achieve the GHG abatement at a lower cost. The EC proposal acknowledges this issue and proposes a range of flexibility instruments (i.e., more than 15 flexibility options) that intend to augment cost-effectiveness. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the 2030 ESR and analyze the economic impacts of each of these flexibility options with respect to fairness and cost-effectiveness. I use the GEMINI-E3 model, which has been involved in the evaluation of the 2020 Effort Sharing Decision (Bernard and Vielle 2009; Böhringer et al. 2009), and more recently used in the assessment of the ESR 2030 within the context of the United Kingdom decision to leave the European Union (EU) (Babonneau et al. 2018). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the ESR proposal and details the flexibility mechanisms. Section 3 provides an overview of the computable general equilibrium model used to perform the simulations, and explains how the welfare cost is computed. Section 4 presents the scenario results. Section 5 concludes.",5

In the 2030 AfSD is embedded 17 indivisible SDGs and 169 targets the world aspires to attain by 31st December 2030 (Stock et al. 2018). Drawing from the challenges associated with the lack of early indicators to develop baselines to measure and monitor progress towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the United Nations became wiser (Nhamo 2017). This time, the SDGs are accompanied by globally agreed and regularly reviewed indicators developed by the UN Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDGs indicators (IAEG-SDGs) for each target (IAED-SDGs 2018). Although not so popularised in the lead to the 2030 AfSD ratification, Industry 4.0 (also known as the 4th Industrial Revolution, Industrial Internet or the Digital Factory (Ono et al. 2017; Deloitte 2015; PricewaterhouseCoopers—PWC 2016) remains a game changer in driving SDG implementation through ICT. Kamble et al. (2018) bring other synonyms to Industry 4.0 that include Smart Manufacturing, Smart Production or Internet of Things (IoT). In fact, SDG 9 links directly to Industry 4.0 as it aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation” (United Nations 2015: 14). Given the intertwining of the SDGs, with the call to consider all in one and one in all, SDG 9 both directly and indirectly links other SDGs as appropriate. A summary of the 17 SDGs and the 4Ps (People, Planet, Prosperity and Partnerships) is presented in Fig. 1. Source: Authors based on United Nations (2015: 14) SDGs for people, planet, prosperity and partnerships. What then is Industry 4.0? From Deloitte’s (2015: 3) perspective, Industry 4.0 harnesses “a further developmental stage in the organisation and management of the entire value chain process involved in the manufacturing industry”. From Industry 4.0, the world is looking into four major segments, namely the Internet of Data, Internet of People, Internet of Services and Internet of Things. At the centre of Industry 4.0 are twin pillars of Cyber Physical Production Systems (C2PS) and the Smart Factory (Brettel et al. 2014; Gorecky et al. 2014)). Such pillars link up to smart buildings, smart homes, social web, smart logistics, smart grids, smart manufacturing and smart mobility (Deloitte 2015; Kusiak 2018; Yin et al. 2018). From PWC’s (2016) view, Industry 4.0 can be unpacked by identifying three core areas of intervention. Such interventions include the digitisation and integration of vertical and horizontal value chains, digitisation of product and service offerings, digital business models, and customer access. To this end, some of the finer details included in Industry 4.0 as per the PWC (Ibid.) and Xu and Duan (2018) are mobile devices, cloud computing, the IoT platform, location detection technologies, advanced human–machine interfaces, authentication and fraud detection, 3D printing, smart sensors, big data analytics and advanced algorithms, and multilevel customer interaction and customer profiling. To sum up, Industry 4.0 constitutes a range of technologies that enable the development and growth of value chains leading to “reduced manufacturing lead times, and improved product quality and organizational performance” (Kamble et al. 2018). Most, if not all, highlighted Industry 4.0 elements speak directly to a number of SDGs (United Nations 2015). Such SDGs include SDG 7 that focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; SDG 9 with emphasis on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and fostering innovation; SDG 11 whose focus is on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; SDG 12 ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns; SDG 13 that calls for taking urgent action to combat climate change and its negative impacts; SDG 16 that promotes peaceful and inclusive societies; and SDG 17 that aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. In fact, from the 85 academic papers reviewed by Kamble et al.’s (2018), sustainable Industry 4.0 emerged as one of the six future research areas. From the authors’ perspectives, research in this space should consider energy sources, climate change, waste and overproduction and how ICT, especially sensing, detection, control and tracing analysis can be applied. All these highlighted research focus areas are part of the SDGs. Given the foregone, and taking a closer look on how to link the SDGs and technology policy, this paper focuses on elements of Industry 4.0, particularly, ICT that Haverkort and Zimmermann (2017) concur will change the game in Industry 4.0 and the related SDGs indicators. The work draws up 2015 country and regional baselines using three United Nations Tier I ICT-linked indicators across the 17 SDGs. The basis for undertaking this study is that a number of ICT-related indicators have been included in the SDGs indicator framework. In addition, Industry 4.0 remains closely linked to the successful implementation of SDGs to 2030. Hence, the ICT indicators are considered a good proxy to assess the readiness of countries towards Industry 4.0. Once a baseline has been computed, global leaders and other key stakeholders in industry, business, development, civil society and labour will be informed on how best to intervene to ready certain countries towards Industry 4.0-related pathways leading to 2030. Elements from Industry 4.0 that include use of robots, drones, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Intent of Places, Smart Metering, Smart Buildings, etc. are becoming part of our everyday lives in hospitals, disaster risk reduction, production, politics, logistics and many more sectors, the list goes on. In fact, no SDG may be achieved without the integration of ICT and aspects of Industry 4.0. The paper is informed by two questions: (1) at what levels were selected countries and regions in 2015 in terms of ICT readiness in relation to identified ICT-related SDGs indicators? (2) Is there a chance that the sample countries and regions will attain the 2030 ICT-related SDGs targets in the context of Industry 4.0? This last question speaks directly to the central theme of the 2030 AfSD that no one must be left behind (United Nations 2015). Countries from the southern hemisphere are usually left behind in many things, with many questions raised regarding their readiness for transitioning to new global and even national development agendas (Nhamo 2013).",30

The species that are listed in Appendix I (1045 species), II (34,608 species) or III (217 species)Footnote 1 on the bases of both their trade and biological status, are subject to the regulations that ensure that international trade is not detrimental to them. The trade in “specimens [Article I, (b)]” of Appendix I species that are recognizable by their products or themselves regardless of whether they are alive or dead, namely, parrots, snakes, great apes, big cat skins, rhino horns, and elephant ivory, are prohibited for “primarily commercial purposes [Article III.3, (c)]”. While trade bans could help some species populations recover, other species are further threatened by poaching and smuggling. This issue has raised concerns about what makes a difference from species to species and whether the CITES trade bans affect consumer behavior to reduce illegal trade in wildlife. To illustrate the underlying problems, this paper analyzes the consumer demand for elephant ivory in Japan. The populations of African elephants have declined sharply in many regions throughout the continent due to poaching for the ivory trade; the estimated numbers have dropped from 1,343,340 for the 4 years from 1976 to 1979 (Douglas-Hamilton 1979), to 764,410 in 1987 (Cumming et al. 1990). Great concern about the extinction of African elephants has led to the ivory trade ban by listing this species in CITES Appendix I in 1989. Soon, it was debated whether such a uniform trade ban could serve the sustainability of elephant conservation, considering the variety of elephant habitats, and whether governments should destroy their confiscated ivory to discourage the demand and illegal supply produced by poaching. The elephant populations in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were transferred to Appendix II at the 10th Conference of the Parties (CoP10) in 1997, because their populations were growing and might not have met the Appendix I criteria. These countries proposed that the revenue from the sale of ivory was to be used for elephant conservation and to compensate for the damage created by living with elephants, including crop damage, injuries and death, especially in areas where the elephant populations are growing. However, the commercial trade in ivory accompanied by the transfer of African elephants to Appendix II was previously decided to resume only under restrictive conditions. If it is approved and the required conditions are met, then the trade is legal; otherwise, it is illegal. Under the conditions approved by the CoP10, Japan imported 49,439 kg of raw ivory at 550 million yen (approximately US$ 4.9 million) from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in 1999.Footnote 2 In 2000, the elephant populations in South Africa were also transferred to Appendix II. According to Thouless et al. (2016), many of them are privately owned in South Africa in fenced areas, except for the large population in the Kruger National Park (NP). The habitats of the elephants are managed so that the damage costs from elephants are limited. South Africa proposed that funds received from the sale of ivory stock from the Kruger NP be used to cover management costs. The sale of government-owned ivory stocks in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe was also approved at the CoP12 in 2002. China and Japan made a joint bid in 2008. China imported 62,333 kg of raw ivory at approximately US$ 8.99 million and Japan imported 39,434 kg at approximately US$ 6.5 million from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe the next year (Wijnstekers 2018). After the two one-off trades, the legalization of the ivory trade remains controversial regarding whether it induces elephant poaching. Some southern African countries support legal trade through regulated markets to compensate for managing efforts. Kenya and most western and central African countries support uniform prohibition to prevent laundering from a partial legal trade. Ivory destruction has increased to “more than sixfold since 2011 (Biggs et al. 2017)”. 
Wiersema (2016) suggests that the CITES trade ban is incomplete in several respects including split listing between Annex I and II populations, and notes that incomplete bans would threaten endangered species because the demand would continue to increase. Using the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) data (2003–2013), Hsiang and Sekar (2016) empirically revealed that the experimental legal trade announced in 2008 corresponds with a drastic increase in the poaching rate by 66% and smuggling by 71% across Africa and Asia. While the coefficients for the effect of legal sales are significant for African sites, they are not for Asian sites. Hsiang and Sekar (2016) conclude that the legal sale of ivory increased black market ivory production, supposing that it had been induced by consumer demand. It is necessary to analyze the market conditions under which the trade bans work against the illegal hunting of endangered species. Onuma (2008) suggests that controlling the volume of the legal supply combined with the level of ivory confiscation efforts from poaching or laundering activities can be a solution for the sustainable use of elephant products. Biggs et al. (2013) explain the situation where “the trade ban has failed” for rhino horns. According to Onuma (2006), whether trade bans are effective depends on the price elasticity of demand. The demand for rhino horns is regarded as inelastic because of their medicinal use. 
Fischer (2004) formalizes a model of the stigma effect on law-abiding consumer demand, assuming that there are legal/illegal consumers and white/black markets, and finds that an increase in the legal supply would not necessarily lower the price and even laundering may occur, resulting in an ambiguous policy influence on poaching. Fischer (2004) also notes that stigma effects may be stronger for display goods such as worked ivory than consumed goods such as rhino horn powder. In the case of the rhino horn trade, the debate over whether it should be legalized is related to the anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE) (Courchamp et al. 2006). The AAE assumes that price has a positive correlation with species rarity, perceived rarity shifts the demand upwards, and if the price increases sufficiently high to exceed the harvesting cost, then it drives the declining species into extinction. Paradoxically, CITES-listed species could be perceived to be rare, which would cause an increase in demand because some people value products for their rarity (Hall et al. 2008). For elephant ivory, its distinctive character is durability, which serves as storage of wealth. Martin (1985) researched on the current and historical preferences for ivory in Japan and observed a stockpile of polished elephant tusks for interior display at high prices—around 1980, an ivory retailer in Japan had one sample that was priced at US$ 1100 for a whole 40 kg. This illustrates how such a large amount of imported ivory was consumed. Regardless of how high the price is, some consumers could purchase those ivory products because the very high price may prove that the product will become more valuable in the future. Products of simply polished raw ivory were bought for display and as a storage of their wealth. Imported goods of worked ivory were mainly used for display, which is directly related to conspicuous consumption. 
Veblen (1999) argues that price has a positive relationship with the utility of such display goods: “(t)he utility of articles valued for their beauty depends closely upon the expensiveness of the articles”. Veblen (1999) cynically points out that one owns such goods not because they are so beautiful in substance but because they are expensive. In other words, these items would be not be worth owning if they were cheap. Veblen (1999) also notes that owners are not conscious of the difference “between the aesthetic value and the invidious pecuniary value”. To summarize, the wealthy, especially the new wealthy, used to believe that price itself is worth. By the Veblen effect, we mean an increasing shift of the demand for a product because it is valued “for a higher rather than a lower price (Leibenstein 1950)”. The problem is how it is possible to reduce the price inelastic demand for wildlife products beyond market price mechanisms. At present, the Japanese ivory market has decreased so much that the ivory production sales in 2014 were one-tenth those in 1989 (Kitade and Toko 2016). With a total supply of 89 tons from the two one-off trades, the Japanese ivory market was reportedly in excess supply (CITES 2016). In 2016, the Cop17 agreed Resolution Conf.10.10 (Rev. CoP17) on “Trade in elephant specimensFootnote 3” to recommend that all countries with a legal domestic market contributing to poaching or illegal trade should close domestic markets as a matter of urgency. Prohibition would create illegal markets if there is any persistent demand. Whether a society can adopt it waits for various conditions to be met, such as changes in consumer preferences to appreciate “the non-use/preservation value (Burgess 1994)” of these species as open-access resources, rather than using their products. Quantities of imported worked ivory in Japan from 1970 to 2018 This paper examines how the trade ban affects the ivory demand in Japan, and contrasts consumer preferences for general consumption goods and services such as food, clothing, housing, household durables, and medical care. Although most studies focus on raw ivory in direct relation to elephants, this paper focuses on worked ivory,Footnote 4 which includes worked ivory from other animalsFootnote 5 as well, considering the demand substitution between those products. We were not able to obtain either consumption or production data on worked ivory made from imported raw ivory in Japan. We assume here that the imports of worked ivory represent the domestic consumption thereof. The Japanese customs agency is responsible for border control, so only legal imports are accounted for. Figure 1 shows that the imports in worked ivory of other animals partly surpass elephant ivory after the trade ban. We cannot tell whether the decreased imports in elephant ivory since the late 1980s as depicted in Fig. 1 are on the same demand function with a stable relation between price and quantity, or on another demand function caused by a change in the preference for elephant ivory. We apply the methods of econometrics. In the next section, we formalize a model incorporating Veblen effects. Section 3 analyzes the demand with respect to the model structure and the hypothesis tests. Section 4 represents the conclusion. The estimation results are presented in the tables in the appendix section.",1

Dayaratna,Ross McKitrick,Patrick J. Michaels,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The marginal social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, usually shortened to the social cost of carbon (SCC), is typically derived using integrated assessment models (IAMs). While over 20 global-scale IAMs have been developed, three are specifically tailored to aggregate benefit–cost analysis and thus are most widely used in SCC estimation (Weyant 2017). These are called Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE, Nordhaus 1993), Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation, and Distribution (FUND, Tol 1997; Anthoff and Tol 2013) and Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE, Hope 2006). Modified versions of these three models were used by the US Interagency Working Group (IWG 2010, 2013) for regulatory SCC estimates that have been particularly influential on climate and energy regulations in the US and elsewhere. While sharing many similarities, these IAMs also have some key differences. FUND, for instance, allows the agricultural sector in some regions to benefit from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilization, while the others set such benefits to zero. PAGE incorporates the possibility of catastrophic damages due to abrupt and extreme “tipping point” eventsFootnote 1 in the form of a long upper tail of costs at positive probabilities that the other models assume to be zero. These differences imply SCC estimates with a predictable ranking, from lowest to highest: FUND, DICE and PAGE. Common to all models is the fact that, because of the long time horizons of the computations (over 200 years), the choice of discount rate is very influential on the results (Anthoff and Tol 2013). The assumed structure of the damage function is also critical (Marten 2011), as is the choice of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), which represents the long-term temperature change from doubling atmospheric CO2, after allowing sufficient time for the deep ocean to respond to surface warming. Choices of these parameters dominate SCC estimates (Webster et al 2008; Wouter et al. 2012).Footnote 2 Anthoff and Tol (2013) further report that agricultural productivity and air conditioning energy demand are critical parameterizations for determining the SCC in FUND. Monte Carlo analysis of plausible ranges of a small number of parameters has yielded such a wide dispersion of SCC results that IAMs have been criticized as arbitrary and potentially meaningless (Tol 2017; Pindyck 2013). But as Weyant (2017) points out, the models are still useful when understood as “if–then” statements. Rather than seeking a single canonical SCC estimate, the models allow traceability from assumptions to implications. Thus increased precision of SCC estimates will not primarily come from increasing the complexity of IAMs themselves but from debating structural assumptions and reducing the uncertainty over key parameter values (Gillingham et al. 2018). Consequently, there is a need to bridge efficiently between empirical research on climate-related parameters and Monte Carlo IAM analysis. Here we focus on agricultural productivity and climate sensitivity. We do not explore the role of future extreme or abrupt events because of the lack of empirical basis for Monte Carlo simulations. The distributions in question are influential on simulated damages but difficult to specify with sufficient precision. Weyant (2017) notes that exclusion of just the top 1% of the damage estimates in the PAGE model causes the standard deviation of its SCC estimates to fall from $266 per ton to $56 per ton, but there is no observational basis for parameterizing either the probabilities of the events or the economic costs. In lieu of an observed distribution PAGE makes use of expert elicitations, the value of which are debatable, while FUND and DICE have been used to examine extreme events under special parameterizations (Link and Tol 2011; Nicholls et al. 2008; Cai and Lontzek 2019). For our purposes herein, we simply note that allowing for the possibility of low-probability catastrophic events will imply a higher SCC estimate, with the amounts entirely dependent on the scenario and the assumed probabilities. Because of the structural differences, it is not valid simply to average across FUND, DICE and PAGE in the hope of obtaining an unbiased mean. It is also factually incorrect to set CO2 fertilization to zero as is done in DICE and PAGE. We confine our analysis to the FUND model (version 3.8.1 as used by the US IWG 2013), since it has the appropriate structure to allow CO2 fertilization benefits, and we examine changes in the SCC based on new parameter distributions. We review research published long after the original calibration of FUND regarding agricultural productivity changes under higher CO2 levels to update the Monte Carlo simulation range. We also consider uncertainty regarding climate sensitivity, as did the IWG (2010,2013), Dayaratna et al. (2017), and Gillingham et al. (2018). While IAMs have been run under a customary ECS range derived from climate models, little attention has been paid to the many empirically based estimates published in the last half decade which have tended to be lower than the model-based range. Dayaratna et al. (2017) show that use of an empirically constrained ECS parameter distribution substantially reduces the SCC estimate from DICE and FUND, which we also find herein. We will examine results under a range of discount rates from 2.5 to 7.0%. The high end rate is above that typically used in long-term climate studies, but remains part of US Office of Management and Budget Guidelines so is commonly used for cost–benefit analysis (US Office of Management and Budget 2003). We primarily focus our discussion on the results under a 3.0% discount rate. Under the model-based ECS range, the choice of discount rate matters acutely, with a change from 2.5 to 5.0% sufficient to reduce the SCC by about 90% through 2050. However, under an empirically based ECS, the choice of discount rate ceases to matter. Such distributions still induce proportionately large changes in SCC and also causes sign changes, but the absolute changes are very small because the SCC itself collapses to a very small amount.",6

There might be many motives or underlying reasons to increase public expenditures when natural resource revenues are readily available, such as unnecessarily increasing public employment and wages (Atkinson and Hamilton 2003; Van der Ploeg 2011), giving public work contracts to supporters, and other populist or suboptimal policies. It is a well-established fact that so called “rentier states” are not subject to close citizen scrutiny since tax revenues comprise only a small fraction of public revenues. Therefore, these governments have a greater flexibility to spend public funds in extremely inefficient ways, especially in the absence of strong institutions and checks and balances. Given that capital formation has the vital role for the economic prosperity, for the countries with rich natural resources, the importance of successfully converting natural resource wealth into some forms of productive capital, such as physical or human capital, cannot be overemphasized. Along those lines, Van der Ploeg and Venables (2011) persuasively suggest that windfall revenues from natural resources should be directed to private and public domestic capital as opposed to foreign assets. Indeed, if a country deeply lacks the necessary domestic capital to increase its productive capacity, then investing in foreign assets might not be an optimal policy prescription or priority. Moreover, Atkinson and Hamilton (2003) claim that countries could escape from the resource curse if they use the revenues from natural resources in public investment. Accordingly, increases in public education, health, and infrastructure expenditures can play a crucial role by encouraging and supporting both physical and human capital formation. Conversely, a government can also fail to raise the capital formation by allocating fewer resources for human and physical capital formation purposes. It seems that natural resources are more likely to have an impact on the capital formation through public expenditures (Cockx and Francken 2014, 2016; Endrikat 2017; Karimu et al. 2017). Our main motivation is to empirically investigate the impact of natural resource rents on the size and some components of government expenditures, and to shed light on a possible transmission mechanism of the so-called resource curse. This study aims to contribute to the existing literature, in some important dimensions. First, unlike some previous studies, such as Cockx and Francken (2014, 2016), Bhattacarya and Collier (2013), and Karimu et al. (2017), we examine the impacts of resource rents on public total, education, health, and infrastructure expenditures to better capture the exact mechanism rather than focusing only on a specific expenditure component. Note that although the literature mostly utilizes the various output measures of education and health as proxies of physical and human capital, this paper mainly employs the measures of expenditures on education, health, and infrastructure as inputs of capital accumulation. Second, as suggested in some studies such as Arezki and Gylfason (2013) and Endrikat (2017), we test the importance of democracy level in explaining the effects of resource rents on public expenditure decisions by dividing our sample into two as democratic and autocratic countries. Third, since the literature, among others Isham et al. (2005), Stijns (2006), Yanıkkaya and Turan (2018), highlights and provides evidence for the argument that paying attention to the types of resource rents is crucial, besides total rents, mineral, natural gas, and oil rents are included in our specifications. Fourth, to obtain more robust results, we use a dynamic panel estimation method (Generalized Methods of Moments) as it is well suited for the issue at hand. Although some studies surprisingly do not consider the dynamic effects, ignoring these effects would be really misleading. Inclusion of the lagged dependent variable as a regressor would significantly matter. One of the real strengths of our paper is to use the dynamic estimation method. Additionally, GMM successfully tackles some important econometric problems such as endogeneity and autocorrelation. Fifth, our data span, covering the period 1980–2015, is much longer than that of similar previous studies, such as Cockx and Francken (2014, 2016) or Endrikat (2017). Our estimation results indicate that while total resource rents fail to boost total public and infrastructure expenditures, they significantly reduce the public education and health expenditures in the full sample. Our results also imply that it is important to include different types of rents in the estimations because unlike total rents and oil rents, both mineral and natural gas rents reduce total government expenditures. Moreover, at least in one case, the democracy level plays a decisive role. Additionally, we find that total resource rents exert a negative impact on the education expenditures in only autocratic countries. Most importantly, resource rents have a different impact on the human and physical capital formation, the main result obtained from this study. More precisely, resource rents have much more robust impact on the public expenditures closely related with human capital rather than physical capital. We review the literature in Sect. 2, explain our empirical model, estimation method and data in Sect. 3, present and discuss the empirical results in Sect. 4, and finally conclude in Sect. 5.",16
22.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,30 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-020-00265-8,Standards and social welfare in Cournot oligopolies,July 2020,Adriana Gama,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Environmental issues have become a serious and growing problem; since the 1950s, a wide literature has emerged to develop and analyze possible regimes to face pollution and improve the quality of the environment (Pearce 2002). Requate (2005, 2006) presents thorough surveys of many theoretical studies on several policies imposed to polluting firms, with the objective of reducing damaging emissions discharged to the atmosphere as a result of the production process. Such works analyze many market structures, including the Cournot oligopoly, which is the one that concerns this work.Footnote 1 In his surveys, Requate (2005, 2006) emphasizes the relevance of studying the implications on social welfare of the different policies used to reduce pollution; however, few works have been written on the subject. As a contribution to fill this gap in the literature, we compare the performance of two command-and-control regulatory instruments in terms of social welfare, when the abatement technology is exogenously given and under imperfect competition; such regimes are the emission and the performance standard. The first one provides the firms with an absolute emission cap that should not be exceeded; in contrast, the performance standard is a relative instrument, it sets the fraction of emissions that should be abated. The study of the emission and the performance standard is particularly relevant because compared to other market-based instruments, like taxes or tradable permits, standards are observed to be the dominant policy in practice (Harrington et al. 2004; Hueth and Melkonyan 2009; Viscusi et al. 2005); the performance standard is the most common, but also one of the least studied (Requate 2005). Besides analyzing which standard provides a higher social welfare, we compare other variables of interest, such as output, consumer surplus and profits. Specifically, we consider n symmetric and polluting firms that compete à la Cournot and are subject to environmental regulation. To comply with the regulation, the firms possess an exogenous abatement technology, which corresponds to an end-of-pipe cleaning technology. We abstract from any production cost to focus on the regulations and abatement technology effects. Then we analyze the performance of the industry under both standards, to see which one generates more production, consumer surplus, profits and social welfare. We study two different cases: when the regimes are exogenous and they incentivize the same amount of pollution, and when they are endogenously set to maximize social welfare. For the one-stage game, we show that the firms produce more with the performance standard but it is more profitable for them to face the emission one. It stands out that in the presence of market power, it is possible that the performance standard provides a higher social welfare than the emission standard, we provide a sufficient condition for that to happen. With perfect competition, it is always the emission standard that dominates. The difference in the equilibrium outcomes between regulatory instruments is due to the difference in the marginal abatement costs tacitly imposed by the regimes. By definition of the performance standard, when the firms increase their production, they have to abate only a fraction of it; on the other hand, if the emission standard is the regulation, the firms have to abate one unit of emission for every additional unit of production (we assume that one unit of production generates one unit of emission). Hence, the performance standard represents a lower marginal abatement cost for the firms, even though the cleaning technology is the same under both regulations. As a consequence, the firms produce more with this instrument, which benefits the consumers and may improve social welfare. In a similar study, Lahiri and Ono (2007) show that the performance standard is welfare-superior than a tax (they only consider the one-stage game), but they do not incorporate the emission standard in their study. Amir et al. (2018) study a similar setting to ours, but they add a stage where prior to competing in quantity, the firms invest in R&D to lower their abatement cost. This additional stage complicates the analysis of a general industry and, therefore, the authors restrict their study to a particular industry with linear demand and abatement cost. When the regimes are exogenous, the comparison of social welfare can go either way. If the instruments maximize social welfare, the performance standard dominates. For both games (exogenous or endogenous regimes), the propensity of the firms to produce and invest in R&D varies between the instruments and with the parameters. Works like Amir et al. (2018) or Montero (2002b)Footnote 2 suggest that a general ranking of the environmental regulations in terms of their effects on the equilibrium variables is not clear-cut when investment in R&D is included in the model. But when the abatement technology is fixed and cannot be modified by means of R&D, the analysis provides general conclusions for production and profits, and a guide to compare social welfare. Hence, our results are complementary to those of Amir et al. (2018) and Montero (2002b). Besides studying their effects on social welfare, there are several other ways in the literature to rank policy instruments. For example, by analyzing their cost-effectiveness (which policy improves the environment at the least cost), political and institutional feasibility, effects on income distribution, ease of monitoring, enforcement and administration, pre-existing taxes, and the incentives they provide to develop new and cleaner technologies.Footnote 3 The following section introduces the model, including the definitions of the command-and-control instruments under study. Section 3 presents the standard assessment, considering the cases where the regimes are exogenous (one-stage game) and endogenous (two-stage game); studying the one-stage game becomes really useful to analyze the two-stage game. Conclusions are in Sect. 4 and the last one contains the proofs.",2

The major subject of study is the economically optimal emission mitigation path, which accounts for mitigation costs on the one hand and climate damage costs on the other. The latter are represented by a damage function that describes the economic impacts of climate change. Typically, these damage functions are based solely on the absolute temperature increase compared to the pre-industrial level, but not on the rate of temperature increase, i.e., the increase in temperature that occurs per decade. However, as stressed several times in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (see IPCC 2014a), and as underlined by a growing body of literature from the natural and—to a smaller extent—from the social sciences, the rate of temperature increase is also an important driver of overall damages caused by climate change (see Sect. 2).Footnote 1 Consequently, neglecting such rate-related damages can lead to suboptimal emission mitigation caused by an underestimation of damages. This paper incorporates rate-related damages into the well-known DICE-2016R model by William Nordhaus (2018). Using the resulting model variant DICE-RD, we analyze the potential welfare effects caused by the rate of temperature increase for several scenarios. Each scenario compares the net output stemming from the optimal climate policy with the net output resulting from the reference policy that ignores rate-related damages. The differences in net output then can be interpreted as the economic losses that occur if rate-related damages are neglected. The present paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 illustrates the importance of rate-related damages by several examples from the literature. In Sect. 3, we justify the use of DICE-2016R, summarize the main criticisms of this model and compare it to other IAMs with special reference to the integration of rate-related damages. In Sect. 4, we shortly outline those parts of DICE-2016R that are important for our analysis, and in Sect. 5, we incorporate rate-related damages into the model. In Sect. 6, we discuss the results of our base scenario, and in Sect. 7, we present a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. In Sect. 8, we consider the case of a fixed temperature target, and in Sect. 9, we summarize our findings and highlight the need for further research.",7

GTR is referred to as a tax reform that proposes a reduction in the tax burden on factors of production, at the cost of new or higher taxes on environmental polluters. The DD hypothesis stems from the notion that a GTR can not only deliver environmental dividends but can also include economic benefits. The environmental dividend is achieved through a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), as is widely accepted in contemporary literature (Aldy and Stavins 2012). Albeit, an initial concern related to GTR was that lower energy consumption may lead to lower production and that the environmental benefit may come at the cost of economic growth. However, we now know that GTR can spur innovation in energy efficiency and in the sector of renewable energy (RE), which can address economic concerns and deter loss of economic growth (Stern and Stern 2007). In addition, recycling of tax revenue raised through GTR can entail further economic benefits, depending on the particular revenue recycle policy. This has been the mainstay of the DD hypothesis (Tullock 1967), and numerous types of revenue recycle schemes, and various forms of economic dividends of GTR have been studied over the past few decades in this regard (see Pearce 1991; Morris et al. 1999; Garbaccio et al. 1999; Jorgenson and Wilcoxen 1993). Further evolution of the DD prospect of GTR includes the potential for generating triple dividend (TD). The commonly used parametric definition of DD has been linked to the environmental benefits arising from lower emissions and further welfare benefits, driven by revenue recycle schemes (Giménez and Rodríguez 2010). However, there is no structured definition for TD; to date, it has been measured in numerous ways by different researchers. Pereira and Pereira (2014) measured TD as an improvement in employment and GDP, along with a reduction in GHGs emissions. Van Heerden et al. (2006) defined the third dividend as poverty reduction, alongside increased GDP and reduced emissions. Bovenberg and Van der Ploeg (1998) took a similar approach, where employment and an increase in income were considered as the second and third dividends, respectively. The literature on GTR-driven DD is relatively rich, but existing research on TD is scarce. In this meta-regression paper, we attempted to address this gap by presenting a holistic overview of the existing research findings, to measure the possibility of yielding a GTR-led TD. In our paper, we used the definition of TD provided by Bovenberg and van der Ploeg (1996), where a cleaner environment (reduction in emissions), a rise in overall consumption (increased GDP), and growth in private welfareFootnote 1 (employment growth) are defined as the three possible dividends of GTR. In this paper, we label these as the first (reduction of CO2), second (GDP), and third (employment) dividends of GTR, respectively. Furthermore, we also categorise our database between European and non-European countries. The purpose of doing so was to observe whether there was any noticeable difference between the two regions in terms of responding to policy measures. Our findings can aid policy makers in optimizing the GTR policies by making them suitable for the country in question based on its location. A number of noticeable differences between European and non-European studies have already been reported in a double dividend context (see Maxim and Zander 2019; Maxim et al. 2019), and the present study was conducted with the aim of discovering whether such differences also exist for TDs. In addition, the existing literature of meta-analyses on GTR (see Patuelli et al. 2005; Maxim et al. 2019) is primarily focused on the third dividend (employment). The dataset of Patuelli et al. (2005) includes studies prior to the year 2000. Most of the non-European studies are published after the year 2000 and follow in the footsteps of European studies. Our updated dataset includes all those relevant simulations. On the other hand, both the works of Maxim et al. (2019) and Maxim and Zander (2019) primarily focus on employment, and only in a very limited way on CO2 emissions. The novelties in our study are the inclusion of a third dividend (GDP) and a statistical analysis that includes all three dividends (employment, GDP and CO2 reductions). In our study, we used a multivariate analysis to include all three dividends as separate dependent variables. Hence, this is the first meta-regression paper of its kind to quantify the impact of GTR in a TD context. Additionally, in this paper, we critically analyse the performance of the second dividend (GDP) across European and non-European countries. Our initial hypothesis was that there would be differences across regional groups, as the economy and environmental policies in European countries are more coherent, this due to the strong presence of both the European Union (EU) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the database summary and an overall survey of the dataset applied in this study. Section 3 exhibits all the statistical analyses we conducted to perform the meta-analysis and reports the results. Section 4 provides concluding remarks and summarises the key findings.",4

As sea levels rise, pressure to armor the coast, in the form of seawalls and other protective structures, will likely grow (Caldwell and Segall 2007).Footnote 1 However, putting up a seawall in front of one’s property is a classic example of an action with a negative externality.Footnote 2 Seawalls protect individual properties but may impose negative externalities or costs on beachgoers and neighboring properties via accelerated beach loss. If such costs are greater than the private benefits, then seawalls might actually reduce social welfare. How do seawalls cause accelerated beach loss? First and most obviously, seawalls cause placement loss or the unavailability of the physical area beneath the actual seawall. Second, seawalls restrict the sediment and sand eroding down bluffs that would otherwise replenish and grow beaches. This is known as impoundment loss. Third, they magnify the power of retreating waves, carrying sand out to sea. These outgoing reflected waves strike the sea floor on each outgoing surge, creating a steeper undersea slope.Footnote 3 These steeper slopes then preclude the ability of incoming waves to bring new sand to replenish an already eroded beach. Water in front of the seawalls becomes deep and the shoreline moves landwards, resulting in moderate loss in beach width. This process, called passive erosion, has been observed and studied in different areas (Griggs 2005). Finally, seawalls often cause loss of nearby beaches. The new steep undersea slope prevents sand supply moving down the coast. As a result, neighboring beaches are starved of sand that would otherwise be supplied by shoreline currents (see Griggs and Tait, 1988, and Hall et al., 1990, for detailed case studies, and Griggs, 2009, for an accessible overview). It is well documented that people enjoy going to the beach (Bin et al. 2005) and that wide sandy beaches are highly valued (Pompe and Rinehart 1995; Pompe 1999; Landry et al. 2003; Landry and Hindsley 2011; Pendleton et al. 2012). Not surprisingly, some studies have found that panoramic view of the beach, greater beachwidth, and shorter distance to the beach have a positive relationship with property valuation (Brown and Pollakowski 1977; Edwards and Gable 1991; Parsons and Wu 1991; Parsons and Powell 2001; Bin et al. 2008a). Some studies employ hedonic valuation methods and find that beach width is positively associated with property value (Pompe and Rinehart 1995; Landry and Hindsley 2011). Others estimate the reduction in property values due to higher erosion risk (Kriesel et al. 1993; Pompe and Rinehart 1995; Bin et al. 2008b; Pompe 2008). Because beach proximity and erosion risk are so highly correlated, separate identification within a hedonic framework is potentially challenging. In a major contribution to the literature, Bin et al. (2008a) construct a three-dimensional measure of ocean view that varies independent of erosion risk to separately identify these effects. They find that a greater ocean view significantly increases property value and flood risk significantly lowers property value. In a similar contribution, Gopalakrishnan et al. (2011) correct for potential endogeneity in hedonic models using distance to the continental shelf as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of beachwidth on property values. They find that beach width contributes significantly more to property values than previously believed, with the coefficient of beach width being nearly five times as large as the OLS estimate. Despite this vast literature documenting the hedonic value of beach width and reduced erosion risk, it remains unclear whether seawalls themselves have a net negative or positive impact on social welfare. There are currently only two hedonic studies on the negative external cost of seawalls and/or other forms of coastal armoring. In the first, Kriesel and Friedman (2002, 2003) find that coastal armoring appears to lower property values a few rows inland. They find a negative and statistically significant correlation between property prices in the Southeast US and the degree of coastal armoring on nearby beaches. However, waterfront homes protected by a seawall tend to have higher values than waterfront properties that are unprotected. In the second study, Landry et al. (2003) conduct both a hedonic and a contingent valuation study of coastal armoring. They find a negative but statistically insignificant correlation between property prices on Tybee Island, Georgia, and a visible erosion structure at the nearest shore. Their contingent valuation study confirms that recreational beach visitors have a higher willingness to pay to visit beaches with minimal shoreline armoring (approximately 25% higher). Thus, the literature to date strongly suggests that people who value beaches do not like beaches with seawalls but there is not an overwhelming amount of evidence that seawalls are correlated with lower property values. Our goal in this paper is to test whether the presence of a seawall is correlated with higher or lower property values in coastal areas, holding all other determinants of value constant. Our paper is complementary to Kriesel and Friedman (2002, 2003) in that we use a very similar approach and data source, however, we use a different subset of the data from a different geographical location: California. In particular, we take data from San Diego and Santa Cruz counties, which offers variation in terms of the extent of spatial dependence in housing prices and differences in the valuation of beach and coastal armoring arising from differences in certain geographical attributes, such as altitude and distance to the water. In addition, we make a minor methodological improvement over the work of Kriesel and Friedman (2002, 2003) by estimating our model while testing and accounting for potential spatial dependence in the estimation procedure and the public good nature of locational attributes. Our work thus serves as both a replication test and an extension of their earlier findings. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the conceptual framework and the details of our empirical analysis. Sect. 3 presents the results and Sect. 4 discusses the implications of our findings.",2

Impacts of industrially-led production technologies of previous decades with disastrous impacts on the environment set forth the urgent need for new development paths under the scope of sustainability. This has led, since the 1970s, to a remarkable increase in the absolute number of technological solutions developed and promoted in response to the increased calls for a new vision of innovation (OECD 2012; Linton 2013). With the overarching aim of reducing environmental impacts as well as supporting green growth through increased resource productivity and pollution control, environmental technology nowadays retains a strategic role in long-term transformative changes towards sustainable development (Kuehr 2007; Fujii and Managi 2016; Su and Moaniba 2017). The notion of ‘environmental’ or ‘environmentally-sound’ technologies refers to interventions, which contribute to pollution reduction beyond existing practice or yield increased environmental benefits in comparison to existing technologies (Quitzow 2015). The amelioration of environmental quality through Environmental Technology is in line with the conceptual underpinnings of the ecological modernization current that highlights the integration of environmental legislation, cleaner industrial innovation and improved environmental performance of business entities (Diana et al. 2017). According to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (1992) ‘environmentally sound technologies protect the environment, are less polluting, use all resources in a more sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products, and handle residual wastes in a more acceptable manner than the technologies for which they were substitutes’. Relying on such conceptual perspectives, Kuehr (2007) provides a tentative definitional framework indicating that Environmental Technologies ‘reduce pollution at least in one environmental medium, only accepting the transformation of emissions into another form or into another medium as a short term measure to cope with harmful pollutants facilitating the continuous improvement of processes, products and services by the conservation of raw materials and energy and by the reduction of toxic substances, waste and emissions within the production cycle’. Drawing from Kuehr, Jabbour (2010, in Diana et al. 2017) denotes that Environmental Technologies delineate the development of software and hardware which, under the scope of new design concepts, operating procedures and equipment, allow for the integration of practices aiming to continuous environmental performance improvement primarily through interventions in the inputs and processes defining a given production cycle. Recent estimates of the global market for environmental technology goods and services value it at $1.05 trillion (International Trade Administration 2017). While the absolute number of environmental initiatives and programs is rapidly increasing, Environmental Technology adoption and diffusion leaves much to be desired and remains largely dependent on governmental intervention (Johnstone et al. 2010). Backed up by government ‘zero waste—zero emissions’ initiatives and incentives, some Environmental Technologies have become widely adopted: end of pipe technologies, non-fossil energy-production technologies, industrial conversion processes, ozone-monitoring systems in urban areas, etc. (Kuehr 2007). Environmental Technologies are increasingly recognized as fundamental in both reducing negative environmental externalities and costs of achieving environmental policy goals of energy security and ecosystem stewardship (Behling et al. 2015; Nuttall and Manz 2008; Harmon and Cowan 2009). In this respect, while numerous studies in the past have attached considerable attention in scrutinizing, mapping and classifying Environmental Technologies (Barnett 1993a, b; Almeida 1995; Jaffe et al. 2005; Albino et al. 2014; Hottenrott and Rexhäuser 2015; Goetzke et al. 2012; Rave and Goetzke, 2013) the analysis of socioeconomic parameters affecting Environmental Technology development and diffusion trajectories remains an issue that warrants further attention (Horbach et al. 2012; Dechezleprêtre et al. 2015; Ghisetti and Pontoni 2015; Lindman and Söderholm 2016; Fenton and Kanda 2017). Previous research indicates the role of effective government intervention and that Environmental Technologies are regulation-driven through the regulatory push–pull effect (Jänicke and Jacob 2004; Jaffe et al. 2005; Popp 2006; Del Rio Gonzalez 2009; Horbach 2008; Veugelers 2012; Quitzow 2015) in challenging dominant sociotechnical regimes and stimulating markets for environmentally-friendly solutions over incumbent technologies (Grin et al. 2010). Likewise, when both credible and comprehensive, the national regulatory framework has been pinpointed as a potential driver for market demand for environmental technologies (Jänicke and Lindemann 2010; Ashford and Hall 2011; Kemp and Pontoglio 2011). Complemented by financial incentives and investment security (i.e. government effectiveness) as well as high-quality human-knowledge capital (e.g. Horbach 2008), such institutional conditions may effectively support the conception, deploy and integration of new Environmental Technologies into social contexts and operations (Bruns et al. 2011; Jacob et al. 2014). Previous studies have also highlighted that economic motivations such as the foreign direct investment flows may act as key drivers of Environmental Technology innovation (Driffield and Love 2007; Popp 2011; Dechezleprêtre et al. 2011, 2013). Likewise, the emergence of a sizable demand (reflected by economic growth) favors the diffusion of Environmental Technologies usually characterized by increased fixed costs (Vona and Patriarca 2011). With these in mind, bringing empirical insights of understanding how socioeconomic factors influence environmental technology is essential to demonstrate what drives related patterns of country-level development, adoption and diffusion. A literature gap is apparent between the theoretical assumptions that shape Environmental Technology development and diffusion and empirical investigations of critical success factors which should be prioritized by countries wishing to promote Environmental Technologies. For Environmental Technologies to be sufficiently promoted in a timely manner and at appropriate scale, a better apprehension of underlying determinants and explanatory factors is needed. The present research note seeks to contribute to this direction and provide new insights of surrounding conditions affecting macro-level Environmental Technologies development and diffusion, a particularly relevant issue for developing nations and regions.",3

Since taxation influences resource allocation, general equilibrium methods become the natural analytical tool for policy evaluation. More specifically, computational general equilibrium (CGE) models combine a conceptual modelling platform with background empirical data. They have the distinctive advantage that is able to determine at the same time prices and quantities. These computational models go beyond the private demand and private supply scheme of the theoretical model versions and include descriptive aspects of real-world economies such as government policies and trade issues. The seminal paper of Shoven and Whalley (1984)is still the best description of the essentials and possibilities of these models. See also André et al. (2005), Kiuila et al (2019), Freire and Ho (2019) for detailed description of environmental policies using CGE models and Fullerton and Muehlegger (2019) for a discussion of the burden of environmental tax regulations. From an empirically oriented policy perspective, the CGE approach is usually quite convenient since these methods provide the combined overall effects that are of direct interest to policymakers. At the same time, however, the simultaneous determination of prices and quantities endows the results with a certain degree of opacity. The reason is that it is not easy to separate substitution effects from income effects when comparing two equilibrium states. A possible solution is the use of inter-industry models since in them prices and quantities do not interact. See Miller and Blair (2009) for the general theory of inter-industry models, and Roland-Holst and Sancho (1995) for a theory of price influence and transmission in this setting. A reinterpretation of these models in Sraffa (1960) offers an inspiring neo-ricardian perspective in price determination and income distribution in private property economies with no trade or government intervention. In this type of pure production economies, with a given and fixed productive structure, prices play the function of ensuring the reproducibility of all flows while maintaining the overall productive structure. We adopt this reproducible perspective here but we adapt it to an empirically rooted economy with an active government and other sources of final demand, like trade. In actual practice, governments intervene in the economy via taxation and expenditure policies. The combined use of these fiscal tools allows governments to steer the economy towards desirable social or environmental targets. See for instance Bardazzi (1996), Llop and Pié (2008), Gemechu et al. (2014), de Souza et al (2016) for specific environmental applications using the inter-industry setting. A critical part often overlooked in price determination is the dynamics of the wage rate in response to price changes. Taxation affects prices and therefore living conditions through the purchasing power of wage income. In any real-world economy, the actual wage rate is the result of many concurrent factors. In particular, of the power of the labor force to negotiate agreements that allow the wage rate to keep its purchasing power, in total or, most often, just in partial terms. The labor market is, possibly, the market that stands most distant from the frictionless market paradigm so common in economic theory. We try to tackle this situation using a simple, although quite representative in practical terms, behavioral rule of wages. We will assume that, at the economy-wide market level, wages follow an adaptive rule that tracks the evolution of prices. The goal of the rule is to have the purchasing power of salaries aligned with prices. Since bargaining power is not complete, the wage rate usually lags behind prices when they rise but it keeps its value constant, in nominal terms, when they do not. Therefore, we assume the wage rate to be downward sticky or rigid. For the rest of markets, we will assume that exchange values adjust with no impediments to reproduce the given structure of the economy. We examine the role of an eco-tax in this setting. The presence of a new tax on polluting activities will modify the whole set of exchange values since it will affect these activities’ production costs. Additionally, the eco-tax will also change the level and composition of tax collections. Since the government uses its tax revenue to finance its activities, specifically the full set of social transfers (pensions, subsidies, labor compensation, etc.) to workers and their families, any tax-induced change in prices will also have an effect in the set of flows that define the income structure of the economy. Indeed, the government usually adjusts these income transfers to the evolution of prices to keep constant their perceived social value. Besides these price-indexing adjustments, the government may choose to use its newly found eco-tax collections to reduce the public deficit (from the augmented tax burden) or, alternatively, it may choose to preserve the initial tax burden by recycling the eco-tax collections into lower tax rates in other tax categories. The meta-studies in Maxim and Zander (2019) and Maxim (2020) summarize the scope of these environmental tax recycling policies and their degree of success in different case studies for actually enacted or for just simulated eco-tax policies. The tax recycling approach has the advantage of keeping the size of the government constant in terms of its expenditures, combined tax revenues and public deficit. This policy option would be, quite naturally, the one causing the minimal distortion on the structure of the economy. However, some distortions, even if small, will persist. We will model any remaining distortion by scaling up or down the size of the economy while maintaining the basic structure as untouched as possible. This is the key to isolating price and quantity effects and it allows us to estimate price-induced income effects. These income effects, in turn, will drive the final consumption response and the corresponding adjustment in production levels. Technology wise, carbon emissions depend directly on production levels, and thus the link between eco-taxation policies and the subsequent carbon emissions. The proposed model therefore encompasses an economic side with an environmentally linked side and captures the eco-tax induced cost and income transmission mechanisms. We select Spain in 2015 for this case study for two main reasons. The first reason is that eco-tax policies in Spain have been quite timid in the past and ample room for new tax policy initiatives do exist (OECD 2019). In general, the implementation of eco-tax policies within the EU has not been stellar and just a few countries have taken up this policy tool in a limited way (Bosquet 2000; OECD 2019) and Spain is not one of them. Even without broad and active eco-tax policies, Spain’s per capita emissions are slightly below the EU average whereas its carbonization index is slightly above (Padilla and Duro 2013). Hence, room for improvement of environmental quality using eco-taxation tools exists and the possible effects of its adoption should be explored. The second reason, quite more pragmatic, is the availability of disaggregated interindustry and socio-economic data for 2015 which permits the convenient implementation of a multisectoral model that captures most of the active economic interactions. In the next section, we outline the main properties and novelties of the implemented inter-industry model both in economic and environmental terms. In Sect. 3 we formulate the two eco-tax policy strategies and define the nature of the undertaken simulations whereas in Sect. 4 we present and discuss some of the results both in environmental and welfare terms to appraise the possibility of double benefits that would follow the adoption of the eco-tax policies. Section 5 concludes.",1

Botes,Alberto M. Zanni,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Urban ‘beauty’ is an important aspect of city planning and has been found to be one of the determinants of economic growth (Carlino and Saiz 2020). Streets represent an essential component of public space and an important dimension of urban planning (Mehaffy et al. 2019). They are, in fact, the location where an ever increasing urban population (Ritchie and Roser 2019) live and spend most of their time (Weber et al. 2014); and the concepts of ‘placemaking’ (Chidambara 2019), ‘place value’, and ‘place quality’ (place being represented by buildings, landscapes, spaces, streets, as well as their users) are gaining considerable attention in the planning practice (Carmona 2019). There is, however, competition for scarce urban land (Salmond et al. 2016) and a consequent conflict among the preferences of various categories of direct and indirect users. There are different ways to make streets more beautiful, pleasant, and safe, and urban vegetation has been recognized to be an integral component of street design, with an important role in making cities more livable and attractive (Bonthoux et al. 2019). Trees are the most discussed element of urban greenspaces, and Salmond et al. (2016) present a useful categorization of their benefits using an ecosystem service approach. They distinguish, among others, regulating services (micro-climate, air quality and noise regulation, deposition and dispersion, and noise attenuation, but also dis-service like pollen and emission of biogenic volatile compounds) and cultural services (like recreation, aesthetic benefits, cognitive development, place values, and social cohesion). The ‘cooling impact’ on the micro-climate by both trees and urban vegetation is particularly important in tropical or sub-tropical urban areas (Shih 2017a, b). Consequently, benefits arising from urban vegetation (and other streets’ characteristics) generally have a positive impact on house prices (Liebelt et al. 2019), growth (Carlino and Saiz 2020), and well-being (Mouratidis 2018). But what value do people attach to urban vegetation? There are some studies that attempted to elicit that. For example, Brander and Koetse (2011) reviewed studies looking at the concept of urban ‘open space’, which includes parks but also sports fields and agricultural land (but not vegetation along streets), while Perino et al. (2014) reviewed UK studies looking at the value of accessible urban greenspaces. Efforts have focused on urban forests and parks (for example, Dare et al. 2015; Soto et al. 2018), while fewer are those paying their attention to a wider spectrum of urban nature components. That is the case of Weber et al. (2014) who looked at roadside vegetation other than trees in Germany, and Shackleton et al. (2018), who extended their analysis to private garden and street vegetation in South Africa. There are also studies looking at the Asian region. For example, using the i-Tree environmental accounting tool, Wang et al. (2018) elicited the values for a wide range of ecosystem services provided by urban trees in China. In a study among students in Manila, Lagbas (2019) found positive WTP for the services provided by urban parks, mainly their perceived capability of regulating air quality and temperature. WTP for different attributes of urban forests (the type of trees, gradient, and type of paving for walking trails) in Seoul were also computed by Hong et al. (2018) using a DCE application. Preferences and values for urban forests in Korea, and their potential to reduce the urban heat island were also analyzed by Kim et al. (2016). In a hedonic pricing application in Singapore, Belcher and Chisom (2018) found that, on average, tropical vegetation had a positive impact on most house prices (with a different impact in the case of vegetation with a high conservation value). Finally, in an interesting application in Honk Hong, and one very relevant to our approach, Ng et al. (2015) looked not only at urban trees but also at other streetscape characteristics, such as the spacing between buildings, and the ratio between street width and building heights. An interesting recent article (Fan et al. 2019) used the Taipei case to discuss sustainable urban development by employing two indicators, one measuring compactness, and the other accessibility to urban green space. Accessibility in terms of street connectivity (we further discuss this in the next section) is among the highest predictor of visits to Taipei urban parks, in accordance to a recent study by Chiang and Li (2019), who also found the evidence of decreased stress level among urban park frequent visitors. Mabon and Shih (2018a, b) discussed the role of urban greenspaces in the public debate about urban planning, focusing on their mitigation capabilities, and their impact on equity, by analyzing Taiwanese newspapers’ articles on the subject. In another useful approach, people’s preferences for various aspects of urban parks in Taiwan were analyzed by Wang et al. (2016). That study does not compute WTP figures for the different characteristics of urban greenspaces, but contains a detailed analysis of the issue and was the one that informed the construction of our questionnaire the most. We have seen above that evidence exists of positive preference towards various types of urban greenspaces in different regions of the world. Urban vegetation can also be, in certain contexts, a rather controversial subject. Land in dense cities is often scarce, and expensive, and conflicts often arise among different uses. Trees, as well as grassland, may be perceived by some as an obstacle to new commercial activities, and, therefore, a hindrance to economic development. This, interestingly, was revealed by a recent study in Taipei (Mabon and Shih 2018a). Also, in other areas of the world, mixed results have sometimes been obtained by studies looking at public preferences for urban trees in particular (Giergiczny and Kronenberg 2014; Wang et al. 2016) although in some cases possibly motivated by protest or distrust motifs (towards the survey instrument, the policy, or more generally, the government, like in Chen and Hua 2015; Lo and Jim 2015). Other elements of street design like sidewalks, traffic islands, cycleways, and, in general, the amount of space devoted to motorized traffic also have a profound effect on the efficiency, safety (Kondo et al. 2018) quality, and usability of this important part of urban infrastructure (Carmona et al. 2018; Creutzig et al. 2020). Studies giving a more holistic view of urban street environments are rare, and this also applies to those looking at the value of walking facilities. A particularly comprehensive and useful example for the understanding of the different issues at stake is the recent London-based study by Carmona et al. (2018), where the authors used rental prices and occupancy rates as proxies for the value of a series of street improvements. Another interesting example, with a more traditional economic valuation approach, is an early contingent valuation application in Japan, which found that respondents were willing to pay about US $30 per year for an improvement in sidewalks (Yamaguchi and Kawakami 2007). In some other cases, walking facilities and other placemaking dimensions were considered by studies looking at public transport accessibility (Yannes et al. 2010; Luckey et al. 2018). Different from the walking case, the provision of cycling facilities (separating cycling from motorized traffic) has been extensively analyzed in the literature. Their significant role in improving safety, and increasing cycling rates, is well understood (Marqués et al. 2015; Buehler and Dill 2016; Zhang et al. 2017; Aldred et al. 2017; Skov-Petersen et al. 2017; Frank et al. 2019). Furthermore, strong evidence of the link between infrastructure, active travel, and health exist (for example the recent paper by Mueller et al. 2018 looking at European cities). A growing number of studies have looked at the Asian region. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) looked at the impact of built environment dimensions (like land use, length of separated cycling infrastructure) in China, while Li et al. (2012) looked at the perceived comfort of separated cycling facilities in the same country. Fewer are the studies specifically estimating willingness to pay for cycling infrastructure improvements. Recently, Cantillo et al. (2019) studied the willingness to pay for cycleways among students in a Colombian city and found that preferences depended especially on the respondents’ current main mode of transport (with car and bus users willing to pay more). And, similarly to our study, Laird et al. (2013), and Lanz and Provins (2013) elicited the value of both cycling and walking infrastructure in rural Ireland and the UK, respectively (their attributes are different from ours and, especially for cycling, they consider more the recreational type of trips). The only study which we could find on Taiwan, which is of considerable interest, is the recent effort by Chiang and Li (2019). The authors looked at neighborhood characteristics such as access to stores, services and recreational facilities, type of walking and cycling infrastructure, and air pollution, among others, and found these to have a contribution to the enhancement of physical activity among the residents. Traffic and related pollution are an issue in Taipei (Chen et al. 2019), and better streets can certainly contribute to reducing the dependence on cars as the main mode of transport, which has been observed in several cities, including other Asian ones (Webb et al. 2018). We mentioned earlier the recent study by Chiang and Li (2019). The authors identify street connectivity (the number of turns necessary to reach the destination) rather than walking distance as the main determinant of frequency of visits to urban parks in Taipei. They consider that better street conditions (in particular, they point out the case of sidewalks being often blocked by parked motor vehicles) could increase accessibility. Finally, cycling infrastructure has also been considerably debated in Taiwan in recent years. The debate has focused on the difficulty for people cycling to mix with the high number of motorbikes and mopeds, and sidewalk cycling was recently identified as one of the determinants behind a resurgence of cycling in the city but, obviously, also a source conflict between people cycling and people walking (Mead 2016). The city administration is planning a considerable increase in the network of separated cycleways. These plans were recently recognized internationally, as Taipei has for the first time entered the well regarded Copenhagenize Index of The Most Bicycle-Friendly Cities of 2019 (Copenhagenize Design Co 2019). The discussion above has highlighted the importance of streets in general and (the benefits of) their design features on people’s well-being. We have seen that urban streets in Taiwan are under-studied and that previously, in the country, the discussion about urban vegetation has caused controversies. Moreover, Taipei has been recently recognized as having the potential to become a ‘cycling city’, and the current provision of cycling infrastructure, as well as walking infrastructure, has also been a source of debate. Finally, we have also highlighted the relative scarcity of studies encompassing a wide range of street characteristics. In this paper, we apply economic valuation techniques, DCE (discrete choice experiments), to analyze people’s preferences, and willingness to pay (WTP), for different elements of street design. We collected response data (129 individuals for 774 choice situations) around a street in Taipei, Taiwan, which is our case study. While similar studies (although not looking at the same range of street components, and not always computing economic values) based on European or Northern American cases exist, less numerous are the instances looking at Asia, and Taiwan in particular. This study is exploratory and represents the first attempt to look at the preference and values of a wide range of street design characteristics in Taiwan. Providing policymakers, as well as citizens, with some evidence about the preferences of the general population for urban greenspaces, as well as other important street features, especially in a country where the subject has raised some controversies in the past, can, therefore, be a useful addition to the debate. This represents our main contribution to the literature. Being this study the first attempt to elicit values for such a wide range of street characteristics, we decided to focus on one single location (using, therefore, a ‘case study’ approach) to have a better link between infrastructure and its users’ perception and preferences, and, therefore, reduce cognitive burden. This allowed us to extend the range of attributes under consideration. In the choice experiment, we directly compare the chosen street current situation and potential improvement situations. We believe that this has also had a role in reducing hypothetical bias. The sample is relatively small, but its characteristics make it satisfactory for this exploratory study. We discuss at length the choice of the street, the sample, and the limitations of our approach both in the methods and discussion sections.",2
23.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,01 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-020-00286-3,Promotion of residential water conservation measures in South Africa: the role of water-saving equipment,January 2021,Djiby Racine Thiam,Ariel Dinar,Hebert Ntuli,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Water scarcity is one of the biggest threats that can negatively affect not only economic development, but also environmental and human-health quality worldwide. These negative impacts are more severe for developing countries that face limited financial, technical, and regulatory capacities to allow mitigation of the water scarcity. Limited rainfall combined with mismanagement of available water resources and poor water supply infrastructures have led to disastrous situations that left many people—mainly the poor in the developing world—with limited access to water. Recent estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 2.1 billion people worldwide lack access to clean water services (WHO 2017). Addressing water scarcity requires a combination of supply and demand management measures that not only promote technological change to support widespread adoption of water-efficient equipment, but also changes in behavior that contribute to water conservation. In the residential sector, examples of such technological changes could include adoption of low-flow showerheads, low-flow toilets, water-saving devices in taps, toilets and showers, greywater collection systems, and in-house greywater treatment technologies. Examples of behavioral changes could include turning off running water while brushing teeth, turning off the shower when soaping up, using dishwashers and washing machines when loads are full, and capturing water in buckets while showering. Yet, no consensus has emerged when it comes to understanding the factors that drive adoption of water-saving technologies in urban households, especially in the developing world. The few examples that exist in the literature are focused on industrialized countries (Fuenfschilling and Truffer 2016; Ward et al. 2012)) and have mainly highlighted the institutional conditions and governance structures that support sustainable transition to water-saving technologies in the urban sector. In developing countries, most of the existing studies have examined the economic, social, and sanitary problems associated with the lack of access to water services (Fuente et al. 2016; Whittington et al., 2009; Banerjee and Morella 2011; Jeuland et al. 2011; Cook et al. 2016), as well as the implications associated with a change in water tariff on access to water by poor households (Nauges and Whittington 2010; Banerjee et al. 2010; Whittington et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2005).Footnote 1 A number of policy instruments have been suggested for the residential sector to address water scarcity. Instruments range from applying sound water pricing that accounts for scarcity of the resource (Dinar et al. 2015; Diakité et al. 2009; Howitt et al. 2002; Howe 2007; Huang et al. 2010) to implementation water restriction programs (Kenney et al. 2004; Howe and Goemans 2002) that limit the authorized volume of water use per day. Additional instruments emphasize the need to raise awareness through education and capacity building to make users more cautious about the economic, sanitary, and environmental consequences associated with water scarcity. Another type of non-price demand management approach that has not been fully investigated is adoption of water-saving equipment within residential households. The very few examples encountered in the literature are from developed countries, where public authorities provide incentive schemes to encourage adoption of water-saving equipment. Such incentives include low-flow toilet rebate programs, and free distribution of plumbing retrofit kits offered by the local water agencies in California to mitigate the various droughts encountered in the region (LADWP 2015). Other examples are current rebate programs offered to households, in Canada and Australia, willing to adopt water-saving equipment (Statistics Canada 2009; Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006). We are not aware of any study that investigates the factors that drive adoption of water-saving equipment by households in developing countries. This is despite the fact that some developing countries experience severe water scarcity. The purpose of this paper is, firstly, to investigate the factors that drive adoption of water-saving equipment within urban households in the city Cape Town, South Africa. Secondly, we analyse the preferences and scale heterogeneity of potential adopters by making use of the random utility theory (RUT) framework. The city recently experienced one of its worst drought seasonsFootnote 2 in four decades. Limited rainfall challenged water allocation decisions and placed many households in difficult situations that required a strict reshaping of water consumption behaviors. We construct a theoretical model that builds on disaggregated technology diffusion framework, which identifies the diffusion path of a water-saving technology within households. The model is tested using choice modeling, where results from latent class analysis (LCA) are compared with estimates from both multinomial and conditional logit models. The results of our analysis show that key technological attributes (lifespan of the technology and its ease of use by the purchaser, the bad smell and likelihood to generate waterborne diseases) can influence household adoption decisions. Beyond its academic contribution, our work offers policy relevance in guiding public policy decisions that attempt to improve water use efficiency within the residential sector in urban settings in the developing world. Despite the fact that Cape Town is a relatively well developed city, yet with a high level of inequality,Footnote 3 this work can provide insights to many cities that experience water scarcity. We show that a combination of technological and targeted socioeconomic policies that support education and information dissemination about the features of the selected technologies can help enhance the adoption of greywater technology in urban areas. The paper is structured as follows: Section Two provides an exhaustive review of the existing literature on adoption of efficient water use technologies in the urban sector. The methodology of this paper is presented in Section Three. Section Four describes the different stages undertaken to design the choice of experiments and the data used. The results and discussions are presented in Section Five. Section Six concludes the paper and provides key policy implications.",6

Evidence from the great east Japan earthquake,April 2021,Yuichi Ishimura,Kenji Takeuchi,Fredrik Carlsson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"On March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred off the Pacific coast of Japan triggered a massive tsunami. It heavily impacted areas in the three prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima, resulting in 19,729 fatalities, with 2559 people missing.Footnote 1 The tsunami destroyed numerous houses and buildings, and a huge amount of disaster waste was generated. It also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive isotopes and in turn radioactive waste. The amount of waste generated by the tsunami was considerably larger than the annual municipal solid waste in these prefectures. The affected prefectures and Japanese Ministry of the Environment compiled a plan to remove the disaster waste within three years, since huge amounts of disaster waste can hamper disaster recovery in affected areas (The Ministry of the Environment 2011). To facilitate the transfer of the disaster waste from affected to non-affected areas, the Ministry of the Environment asked municipalities about the possibility of accepting waste from Iwate and Miyagi prefectures. The disaster waste generated in Fukushima prefecture was not included in the wide-area treatment because of the radiation risk caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. When municipalities were asked about the possibility of accepting disaster waste immediately after the earthquake, 852 of 1592 municipalities were initially willing.Footnote 2 However, eventually, only 76 municipalities actually accepted disaster waste. It is likely that negative attitudes among municipalities subsequently increased as the risk of the radioactive contamination of disaster waste was recognized, regardless of its radiation level. This study investigates municipalities’ decision to accept the disaster waste resulting from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Using a spatial econometric model, we evaluate the characteristics of municipalities that were willing to accept disaster waste from affected areas. Moreover, we focus on the role of social factors, such as altruism, measured by volunteer activities and donations to disaster victims; reciprocity, measured by the existence of a nuclear power plant in the host communityFootnote 3; and the herding behavior, measured by the prefecture’s intention to accept disaster waste. When catastrophic disasters strike, the need for cooperation among municipalities and residents is significant. Thus, understanding the social factors that promote cooperation is important for policy interventions to aid disaster recovery. The tragic event of the tsunami provides a unique opportunity to explore the movement of waste between regions and municipalities. Several studies have investigated the determinants of the transfer of waste between states and countries. For example, Levinson (1999a, b) studied the influence of a waste disposal tax on the movement of hazardous waste between states in the United States. The findings reveal that factors, such as population size and density, land area, and the capacity of the disposal site have a positive impact on the amount of wide-area treatment, whereas factors, such as the distance between states and income, have a negative impact. This study contributes to the literature on the voluntary contribution to public goods by examining the effects of the abovementioned factors on governments’ disaster recovery decisions. The closest work to ours is that of Miyazaki and Sato (2017) and Ishimura and Takeuchi (2016) who investigated the factors that determine the acceptance of disaster waste following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Miyazaki and Sato (2017) found a strategic interaction among municipality mayors’ stance toward the acceptance of disaster waste. Ishimura and Takeuchi (2016) found that municipalities with greater support for disaster-stricken areas by residents are more positive in receiving disaster waste, and that tendency is more remarkable in eastern Japanese municipalities. However, there are three important differences between their work and ours. First, this study focuses on the impact of social preferences in the decision to accept disaster waste instead of political and economic reasons. While political and economic factors are important for the acceptance of waste, it is likely that social factors also play a significant role in times of crisis. Studies in psychology suggest that disasters can invoke both pro-social and anti-social behavior among individuals (e.g., Gantt and Gantt 2012). Based on economic experiments, Becchetti et al. (2012) found that being a victim of a natural disaster (e.g., a tsunami) has long-run negative effects on altruism. Meanwhile, Li et al. (2013) found heterogeneous effects depending on the age of the victim. Therefore, social preferences may contribute to the willingness to accept disaster waste, even though a negative perception is attached to the risk of environmental contamination. Second, this study investigates the impact of anxiety about the radiation risk on municipalities’ position on disaster waste acceptance.Footnote 4 As we describe in the following Sect. 2, after the risk of the radioactive contamination of tsunami waste was recognized in June 2011, the number of municipalities willing to accept the waste decreased dramatically. Thus, we analyze the changes in the characteristics of municipalities that accepted disaster waste before and after the detection of the radiation risk. Moreover, our study period runs from 2011 to 2013 and includes not only the period in which municipalities expressed their intention to accept, but also the period in which some actually accepted disaster waste from affected areas. By contrast, Miyazaki and Sato (2017) and Ishimura and Takeuchi (2016) only included data from 2011 or 2012 and did not consider these dynamics. Third, we consider the spatial correlation in municipalities’ stance on disaster waste acceptance using spatial econometric models, whereas Ishimura and Takeuchi (2016) did not capturer the spatial dependency in the municipalities’ attitudes. Ichinose et al. (2015) found a spatial correlation in policies for solid waste management among Japanese municipalities, suggesting that the policy of municipalities belonging to the same prefecture is often influenced under the umbrella of the prefectural government. Thus, it is important to consider the spatial dependences of local governments when deciding on disaster waste management. Miyazaki and Sato (2017) also found that spatial dependence exists among the stance of municipality mayors toward the acceptance of disaster waste following the Great East Japan Earthquake. However, they used data from 534 municipality mayors’ comments cited in newspaper articles found through a database search. By contrast, we use data from the official reports of 1592 municipalities collected by the Ministry of the Environment. Hence, the data used in our analysis are more comprehensive and more accurately reflect the stance of municipalities on their acceptance of disaster waste. The economic impact of the nuclear accident in Fukushima has been investigated by many previous studies. Tajima et al. (2016) explored the price responses of agricultural products after the Fukushima accident. Using a stated preference approach, Ito and Kuriyama (2017) estimated the willingness to pay to avoid food produced in Fukushima prefecture. Horie and Managi (2017) found that residents in disaster cities can tolerate higher risks of radiation when they feel attached to the original residence. Because the objective risk of radiation is low, these results suggest the importance of psychological factors when analyzing the impact of nuclear disaster. In the context of our study, the accident may have reduced the probability of accepting waste by municipalities in which residents are more anxious about health consequences. For example, municipalities with a younger population or those more dependent on agriculture might be considered to be more risk averse than other municipalities. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background on the wide-area treatment of disaster waste and how waste is disposed. Section 3 introduces the data, empirical strategy, and model specification. Section 4 provides the estimation results for the determinants of accepting waste. Section 5 concludes and discusses policy implications.",5

As from a current perspective, despite all efforts, the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) under the Paris Agreement are not sufficient to achieve the ambitious target of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels, the agreement aims at stipulating the collective progress in the future through a dynamic review mechanism.Footnote 1 Based on an aggregate assessment, the so-called “global stocktake” will assess the achievement of the purpose of the agreement and its long-term goals every five years “in the light of equity and the best available science” (UNFCCC 2015, Article 14). While the current formulation of the stocktake principally does not preclude an assessment on an individual country level, the discussions during the Paris Agreement clearly stressed that, collectively, parties at that time were not willing to agree upon a process that explicitly targets the role of individual assessments in this process but postponed the debate (e.g., Holz and Ngwadla 2016). As one of the key elements of the recently adopted Katowice climate package the agreed guidance describes how mitigation goals and activities are to be presented to make them comparable (UNFCCC 2018). Following the concept of the global stocktake as the central review mechanism to access collective progress over time towards the globally agreed target, there remains skepticism whether countries will deviate from their sovereign commitments (e.g., Barrett and Dannenberg 2016). One potential reason for deviations from previous commitments could emerge from differences in the perception on how to share the burden of global mitigation efforts among the negotiation countries, as having been assessed empirically in previous rounds of climate negotiations (e.g., Lange et al. 2007, 2010). Given the vital and controversial debates on how to compromise between the globally-aggregated review (which leaves behind the rather vague formulation “in the light of equity”) and the individual assessment of countries’ ambitions (where agreement still lacks upon) an assessment of group aggregates might help to foster the multilateral process (e.g., Holz and Ngwadla 2016). By reflecting a certain degree of relevant homogeneity within its members, these groups could both allow for comparisons within groups (i.e. group level-benchmarking) and for differentiation across groups. One of the key challenges in this framework is to identify a set of plausible and acceptable cost-sharing rules being capable to reach consensus and to guide the pathway between two baseline positions: An overarching view on justice as fairness behind the veil of ignorance on the one hand and the purely self-interested use of equity rules on the other hand. Winkler et al. (2018) analyze 163 INDC submissions and conclude that the level of substantiation and accompanying detail, provided to support that an INDC is a “fair” contribution, varies widely across submissions. Even a limited set of indicators including, for example, emissions per capita or emissions per unit of GDP are reported in a widely diverse manner. Winkler et al. (2018), therefore, suggest to agree upon a menu of indicators where countries could choose from. In this regard, our analysis can be considered as a first attempt to assess preferences for weighted or “staged approaches” (e.g., Höhne et al. 2014), where countries take differentiated commitments in various dimensions. To address this challenge, in this paper we empirically investigate preferences for certain burden sharing rules among key groups in a setting that particularly addresses the need for relative assessments of certain rules and reflects on a possibility of observing concessions from negotiating partners. The previous empirical literature focused on preferences towards single principles that have been stated most frequently (e.g., Lange et al. 2007) or those inducing simultaneously the highest support and the lowest opposition rates (e.g., Hjerpe et al. 2011).Footnote 2 Bretschger (2017) investigates theoretically the mechanics of the convergence process of nationally determined climate policies and the role of equity-based signals. Anderson et al. (2017) explore the effects of different fairness principles on the willingness to pay of citizens for climate change mitigation in an online experiment. Our analyses empirically assess the role of burden sharing rules in the strengthening of national ambition levels by means of data from a world-wide survey. We apply a percentage-weighted scheme of different burden sharing rules to examine whether such a mechanism helps to overcome the currently strictly (self-interested) strategic claims on equity in the negotiation process. In our survey, participants had the opportunity to select and combine up to eight different burden sharing rules (including seven pre-defined rules and one open-space category) and to assign relative weights to the selected rules of their preferred bundle. Our analysis is twofold: First, as a necessary condition for concessions, we investigate whether delegates are principally willing to assign a positive weight to more than one (i.e. their preferred) burden sharing rule. Second, if so, we focus on the distribution of these weights to identify potential burden sharing rules that are more likely to provide room for consensus. Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset from a world-wide survey among individuals involved in negotiations of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (i.e. COP-16 in Cancún, COP-17 in Durban). In addition to former studies (e.g., Lange et al 2007, 2010), we consider a larger number of different burden sharing rules including both a discussion of the role of historical emissions and consumption-based approaches. Our analysis shows how preferences differ among groups of key regions that may play an important role in international climate negotiations. Our analysis moreover adds to the debate to eventually focus on few key principles to reduce the complexity of ongoing negotiations in order to lower negotiation costs and to enhance the political process (e.g., Bretschger 2013). Our empirical results provide both insights for potential conflicts and pathways for stipulating (collective) progress through the global stocktake in the Paris Agreement. We observe that delegates from different groups of countries show a general willingness for concessions. However, the degree to which different burden sharing rules are taken into consideration partly differs between countries. As a key insight we report that, in line with previous studies, the individual assessment of the polluter-pays rule based on current emissions does not only stress the persistence of the traditional Annex-B/Non-Annex-B division but in addition suggests tendencies for a more fragmented grouping with different positions between, for example, delegates from developing countries (i.e. G77 members) and emerging countries (i.e. BASIC). At the same time, we observe tendencies for a more harmonized view among key groups towards the ability-to-pay rule.",3

In modern economic and political theory, three root causes or “environmental” factors stand out: Institutions, geography, and culture. Fundamental or environmental factors would not be fundamental if easily changeable and subject to day-to-day political decision making. However, some are changeable none-the-less and subject to deliberate policies. Two of them have been on the political agendas for some time, one institutional and one geographical. The first is the question of economic institutions. On a global scale, institutional change has been substantial in many cases in the post-war era, ranging from regime changes in some countries to piecemeal economic reforms in most. Substantial institutional international variation subsists, however. The other is the question of climate change. Although no country can change its climate on its own several international attempts have been made to accomplish a concerted action against global climate change. Most countries are committed to undertake policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions widely believed to be an important driver of climate change. Climate change has been dubbed “the greatest market failure the world has seen” (Stern 2007). Similarly, poor institutional quality might be the major government failure, underlying other government failures. Although several studies investigate the economic and social impact of both climate change and institutional factors in isolation, there has been little overlap, even if both are potentially important “environmental factors”. Indeed, each strand have found little relevance of the other. The present study contributes in the following way. First, we bridge the gap in the previous econometric literature by examining the combined effect on growth of institutional quality and climate change, identifying the relative importance and robustness of both. We show that it is inappropriate to exclude either factor, as has been the case in previous studies. Second, we devise a method to estimate long-term effects of climate change, using GDP per capita levels rather than growth rates as the dependent variable. Previous “top down” studies have in effect only been able to derive short-term effects, which are less relevant to climate policy issues. Furthermore, they raise concerns about lack of robustness as well as omitted variable bias. Third, we contribute to the growing body of estimates of the impact of climate change. Such estimates, used e.g. by the IPCC, are paramount to advice on climate change policies. Fourth, we introduce an instrument variable to infer causality leading from institutions to growth, which is otherwise difficult to establish in panel regressions. Finally, we point to important policy implications. Increased focus on climate change should not be at the expense of economic institutions and institutional reform, since in most countries deteriorating institutional quality could have at least as negative economic impact as global warming. E.g. an increased emphasis on climate change in development aid at the expense of institutional improvement (such as imbodied in the Washington Consensus) could have adverse net effects. Institutional change and climate policy could be tied to avoid net negative growth effects and could provide basis for economic policy coalitions. We organize the paper as follows: We begin by introducing the previous literature. Next, we introduce our approach and main findings. We then provide an extended presentation of the theoretical motivation for our estimation equations and motivate the choice of data. In the following sections, we conduct estimations. First, we show that temperature changes do not drive recent changes in institutions, and the latter should not be excluded from models explaining growth by temperature changes. Second, we estimate and discuss a number of models, preferring a model with heterogenous effect of temperature and constant semi-elasticity of institutions. Third, we deal with important robustness and causality issues. Finally, we conclude and point to policy conclusions.",1

Al-Rawi,Mohammed Harith Imlus,Sofri Bin Yahya,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Generally, the scientific community has reached a consensus on the environmental damages of human-caused pollution, while the economic community has not reached a consensus on the monetary costs (Fullerton and Karney 2010). Even so, economists have long seen corrective taxes in theory as desirable remedies for the problem of harmful externalities (Shavell 2011; Fleischer 2015). Corrective environmental taxes should be adjusted over time in line with the growth in marginal environmental damages (Heine et al. 2012). According to Keyvanfar et al. (2018), tax and charge regimes have not received more attention due to their high acquisition costs and the natural human resistance to change. Therefore, this study aimed to address this gap by examining the effect of taxes on driver motivations to reduce exhaust emissions. The literature shows that drivers may not consider the full social cost of their actions (Gregory 1979; Foster 2002; Bin and Martins-Filho 2008; Fullerton and Karney 2010). Therefore, any tax rate increases will potentially have effects on motivation, whereby the tax rates should be high enough to motivate drivers to reduce vehicle emissions (Wang et al. 2005; Talbott 2010; Jiang 2012). Accordingly, this study aimed to design a combination of different progressive taxes (PEET, PVAT, PVKTT, and PEST) that would motivate drivers to reduce emissions and correspond to the full social cost of their actions. Taxes are an important economic instrument that can effectively deal with pollution and protect the environment (Mirrlees and Adam 2011). The objective of a vehicle emissions tax is to alter consumer purchasing decisions by discouraging the purchase of vehicles emitting more pollutants (Nel and Nienaber 2012a; Nel and Du Plooy 2013). This green tax has a static cost minimisation, dynamic efficiency, lower compliance and administrative costs, and some positive behavioural effects of encouraging people to alter their consumption. A vehicle emissions tax also can replace current vehicle taxes, and the increased emission tax cost will discourage people from driving polluting cars (Walls and Hanson 1999). Environmental taxation is a powerful instrument for pollution control (Ciaschini et al. 2011). It can incentivise polluters to reduce their emissions (Ashiabor et al. 2011). A price per unit of emissions helps decrease emissions economically, like encouraging people to switch to clean fuels, employing abatement technology, reducing the use of the pollutant, and motivating drivers to drive less or scrap old vehicles. Motor vehicle emissions regulations are generally based on the traditional “command and control” approach of enactments that state what is allowed and what is illegal (Alemanno and Gabbi 2016). The policy measures usually determine benchmarks for emissions or endorse innovations that polluters should use to keep emissions beneath a specific level (Nel and Du Plooy 2013). However, many scholars criticise this approach as being inflexible, poorly targeted, incompatible with the motorist’s incentives, and too expensive to be effective. Therefore, several alternative economic incentives have been proposed. A particularly promising approach is a system in which drivers pay fees based on their annual emissions (Fullerton 2017), where a consumer who drives a gas guzzler and emits more pollutants will have to pay higher taxes than the drivers of environmentally friendly vehicles. In other words, the greater the emissions, the higher the tax. The road transport sector is the most difficult and expensive sector for environmental intervention. Reducing vehicle emissions will require significant behavioural and lifestyle changes. Drivers may oppose policy instruments that restrict their freedom of choice, which makes political and public acceptance challenging. Consequently, introducing economic instruments typically requires a Pigouvian tax, charge, or fee to correct distortions and change behaviours (Mortimore 2015). Pigou introduced the idea of taxing polluting activities in 1920, and his idea is prominent in current political discussion. Environmental taxes are now widely accepted as more efficient instruments to protect the environment than the classical ones of command and control (Schöb 2005; Folmer and Tietenberg 2005). The Pigouvian tax assumes that the damages from an externality such as pollution can best be mitigated by imposing a tax per unit of emissions from any source (Fullerton and Karney 2010). Human motivations for activities leading to vehicle emissions can be a source of environmental problems. Therefore, economists have stressed the relevance of tax rates on personal motivation. Decision-makers can improve tax policies if they have a comprehensive understanding of the costs and impacts associated with emissions. This knowledge would help them establish policies that allow individuals to make decisions consistent with government and society interests in maximizing benefits and reducing externalities resulting from vehicle use. Therefore, a good tax system design can be considered the most important policy to control vehicle emissions. This study was conducted in Malaysia, which is one of the most urbanized developing countries in the world. It has a relatively well-developed economy within the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. Malaysia’s rapid urbanization rate surpasses China’s. The annual rate of urbanization from 2010 to 2015 was estimated at 2.4%, and if this trend continues, over 70% of the Malaysian population will be urban by 2020 (Duflot 2012; Kurabayashi et al. 2013). As a result, Malaysia’s vast population activities in urban areas exert an unprecedented impact on the environment. Such an impact will result in higher demands for transport, increased consumption patterns, greater energy source demand, and an increased number of vehicles on the cities’ roads by 2050 (Okunola et al. 2012; Cassiani et al. 2013; Mathew 2014). Kurabayashi et al. (2013), report that among Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia, the percentage of households owning an “automobile” is highest in Malaysia, at 93.4%. Private vehicles in Malaysia are more reliable and affordable than other ways of transport and, therefore, they have become a dominant mode of personal transport (Mohammed and Shakir 2013; Borhan et al. 2014). Shabadin et al. (2017) stated that the number of registered vehicles in Malaysia has increased by 100% in 2014. The increased number of vehicles has led to an increase in the vehicle-kilometres traveled (VKT), where the average annual vehicle kilometres traveled in 2013 had risen by 4994 km from 2007. Furthermore, the states of Penang, Selangor, Wilayah Persekutuan, and Johor have the highest percentages of VKT in comparison with other states in Malaysia. The Malaysian Department of Environment (MDOE), in its special report on air pollution, listed the industries, including power stations, motor vehicles, and open burning, that are the main contributors to the country’s emissions. Emissions from mobile sources constituted a major source of air pollution (Innes 1996; Mukhopadhyay and Thomassin 2009; Salahudin et al. 2013; Mustafa and Rusli 2016). This study proposes various progressive taxes as an optimal method to obtain maximum reduction in vehicle emissions (Hayashi et al. 2001; Mirrlees 1971; Klein 2014). The proposed progressive taxes are expected to motivate drivers to reduce vehicles emissions (Fullerton and West 2003; Fullerton et al. 2004; West 2004; Christiansen and Smith 2012; Fullerton et al. 2015), because these researchers have confirmed that emission taxes can motivate drivers to mitigate vehicle exhaust emissions.",4

Then, in the longer term, there will be a high chance of 5 °C increase in the average temperature. It will have dangerous effects on both the environment and human societies. This unavoidable global issue needs serious attention. A significant reduction of emissions of GHGs can be achieved only through international cooperation and participation of all countries. The historic Paris climate agreement is a serious step in international cooperation to reduce global emissions and restores hope for a global low-carbon economy. The idea of designing an international environmental agreement and using environmental policies such as pollution permits for solving global warming is not new in the economics literature; however, the role of multilateral relationships between politicians and international lobby groups which are trying to take part in policy and decision-making process through communicating informally has not been seriously described in this context. In general, achieving a sustainable international cooperation is extremely difficult for the following reasons; first, most of the sovereign countries act according to their self-interest since there is no supranational institution or third party at the global level to induce the countries to cooperate. Second, in the case of public goods (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) each country’s benefits are shared by all countries, while each one carries the costs individually. Therefore, free-riding seems to be more attractive than cooperation. Furthermore, sometimes property rights (i.e., emission rights for transboundary pollutants and resources) are not well defined in the detail which is usually referred to as ‘environmental anarchy’. Hence, the international environmental agreements (IEAs) should clarify the property rights and establish institutions that have the authority to overcome environmental anarchy. Accordingly, IEAs to tackle climate change must consider the benefits of all parties to increase the motivation of the countries in such a way as to promote cooperation. When we began to look more carefully at an IEA, the position of governments at the international negotiations tables became the central focus of the analysis. Since governments are mostly influenced by national and international political actors such as ministries, political pressure groups (lobbies) and the general electorate, the study of these relationships plays an important role in the success of a global warming treaty (i.e. the level of reduction of GHG emissions). The most noteworthy study of the impact of national lobbies on IEAs is the paper by Habla and Winkler (2013). They introduce a model of the political economy of permit markets and present a three-stage game including the government and national lobbies. In the first stage, the governments decide on the formation of the international market. In the second stage, each country chooses the number of permits and in the third stage, the permits are traded. They demonstrate that governments’ decisions about participation in the IEA and the number of emission permits depend on economic and political parameters related to national lobby groups. Moreover, they show that lobbying may backfire. A political change by a lobby group in a given country has a direct effect on that country and an indirect effect on both countries. This indirect effect may contradict the direct effect and be strong enough to change the regime towards the lobby group’s less preferred one. This paper extends the work of Habla and Winkler (2013) and focuses on the role of an international lobby group in the determination of environmental policy and participation in IEA to form an international market for emission permits. Indeed, by introducing international lobbying in a multi-agency setting, we not only provide new and richer answers to previous issues, but also aim to address new questions, such as what the implications of lobbying at the international level for rent-seeking incentives of governments are and how governments' perception of the environmental damages changes in the presence of international lobbying. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the role of international lobbies on the formation of international emission permit markets. We try to illustrate how international lobbies can help to solve the aforementioned international environmental agreement problems. To address this issue, we assume that both national and international lobby groups try to sway the government in their favor. Here, an international lobby group is an alliance of several national lobbies in different countries. National lobby groups only care about domestic objectives; however, each nation is affected by the emissions of other countries, hence, impacted by the collective decisions of foreign governments. As a result, they have the incentive to form an international lobby group to join forces and convince other governments to take the desired action. The international lobby group may offer contributions to a government by means of national groups affiliated to it. Media and social networks are other tools available for international lobbies to affect political actors. An example of such international lobbies is the World Coal Association that organizes both companies and not-for-profit associations across the globe to shape the coal industry and influence the policy environment at the international level. In a study, Sapinski (2019) uncovers the presence of a network of policy groups working together to promote the climate capitalism agenda across the globe. The events organized by activists such as Greta Thunberg that influence policymakers in different countries can also be considered an act of international lobbying. Considering the results of Habla and Winkler (2013) as a benchmark, we show that the issuance of emission permits is a function not only of the aggregate levels of organized stakes in both countries but is also determined by the composition of the international lobby group. We also find that under the absence of the international market for emission permits, the presence of an international lobby group with a positive stake in environmental damages can decrease both domestic and global emission levels. However, under an international market for emission permits, the formation of an international lobby group can reduce emissions only under a certain condition. This study also finds that the formation of international lobby group which opposes IEA increases the costs of national lobbies that support the international market in the country that it contributes. Hence, these national lobbies should contribute more to influence the government’s decision and this, in turn, increases the government’s revenue. This work belongs to three main strands of literature. The first one is related to the game-theoretic literature on IEA which examines the motivational structure of countries signing an agreement. These studies are dedicated to the analysis of the conditions under which an international agreement is reached (Barrett 1994, 1999, 2002; Carraro and Siniscalco 1992, 1993; Tulkens 2006) or abatement targets on which countries would agree (Hoel 1992; Endres 1997; Eyckmans 1999). They also examine the number and types of countries needed for achieving an IEA (Carraro and Siniscalco 1993; Barrett 2002; Endres and Finus 2002; Finus and Rundshagen 1998; McGinty 2007; Hannesson 2010). The second strand of literature relies on the political economy of environmental policy. Many studies of the political economy are dedicated to environmental policies and the formation of IEAs. They concentrate on political processes within a country (Congleton 2001; Böhringer and Vogt 2004) and investigate political economy approaches for IEA design and stability (see Haffoudhi 2005; Altamirano-Cabrera et al. 2007; Roelfsema 2007). Marchiori et al (2017) and Habla and Winkler (2013) pursued the common agency framework instituted by Bernheim and Whinston (1986) to build a model in which the process of policy formation is viewed as a game between a government and national lobby groups. Aidt and Hwang (2008) and Cole and Fredriksson (2009) used a multi-principal multi-agent lobby group model (developed by Prat and Rustichini 2003) to analyze foreign effects on environmental policies. Most of these studies suggest the strong influence lobbying activities have on different subjects such as the determination of environmental tax policies. The third strand includes studies of international emission trading which is considered as a pivotal instrument to tackle environmental problems. Helm (2003) expands a consecutive game of international trading of emission permits and finds that international emission trading does not necessarily decrease the total emissions. Carbone et al. (2009), by applying Helm’s (2003) framework, show that under certain conditions international permit markets can reduce emissions. Gersbach and Winkler (2011) suggest an emissions-trading scheme to increase the incentives for the reduction target in which a part of the permits are auctioned and the revenues are distributed to all participants. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model environment and describes its key aspects. Section 3 examines firms’ decisions in the third stage. Section 4 characterizes political equilibrium in the second stage and then derives governments’ policy choices in domestic and international permit markets, respectively. Section 5 analyses conditions under which an international permit market is formed. Finally, concluding remarks are offered in Sect. 6.",

The two pillars of climate change policy are mitigation and adaptation. The former acts directly on the cause of the problem, reducing emissions and lowering future climate change. The latter acts on its consequences tackling directly climate impacts. Recognizing the global public bad nature of climate change, the international community started since the beginning of the 90 s a complex negotiation process under the umbrella of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change to set and coordinate an equitable, effective and efficient climate action. These negotiations rounds offered a natural and extremely fertile ground to apply game and coalition theory models. These have been amply used to predict the potential outcomes of international negotiations on climate change and, in particular, to explain the very reason behind the unsatisfactory achievement of “large” cooperation or of “substantive” environmental effectiveness. The first stream of literature on International Environmental Agreements (IEAs), however, has largely focused on mitigation, while adaptation has been somewhat overlooked. The general result of this literature is that a large (with many countries) and stable (without internal defeaters or external entrants) coalition is not possible to obtain (Hoel 1992; Carraro and Siniscalco 1993).Footnote 1 The driver of the outcome is the incentive to free ride. Intuitively: when, or exactly because, the agreement produces large environmental benefits (it is stringent), then the incentive to free ride by single players is too strong to be possibly offset by the remaining members of the coalition. Thus, the coalition shrinks until the incentive to free ride becomes sufficiently small. This typically occurs when few members (two or three) are left. There is a “dual” interpretation of this exit: when large coalitions do form, it is because the underlying agreements entail a low incentive to free ride, i.e., they are close to a “do nothing” business as usual. In the last decade, a more recent stream of literature emerged studying the interplay between mitigation and adaptation in IEAs. This crop of papers is mostly based on empirical Integrated Assessment Models with only few proposing theoretical framework (Zehaie 2009; Ebert and Welsch 2011 and 2012; Ingham et al. 2013; Eisenack and Kahler 2016). Even fewer have analyzed how the presence of adaptation could affect the size and stability of an IEA (Benchekroun et al. 2011; Buob and Siegenthaler 2011; Marrouch and Chaudhuri 2011; Auerswald et al. 2018; Bayramoglu et al. 2018; Breton and Sbragia 2019). The presence of adaptation might indeed change the nature of the emissions reduction game, acting on the incentive to free ride. The intuition is that, if adaptation is possible, the optimal reply to a potential free rider to a climate agreement could be more adaptation and not more mitigation. This could reduce the free riding benefit and, thus, foster the stability of a climate coalition. Ebert and Welsch (2011 and 2012), analytically show in a 2-player context the possibility for upward-sloping emissions reaction functions, i.e., complementarity between emissions strategies, when adaptation is included as a strategy to fight climate change. Upward-sloping reaction functions would transform a “leakage game” into an emissions (mitigation) “matching game” and could favor the stability of climate coalitions. This issue has been extensively examined by Bayramoglu et al. (2018). The paper examines the effect of adaptation on the strategic interaction among players’ mitigation decisions and on stable coalition size. Both substitutability (standard case) and complementarity (special case) across strategies are assumed. One of the interesting points of the paper is that upward-sloping mitigation reaction functions occur when the adaptation–mitigation interaction is “sufficiently large”, regardless of whether the two strategies are complements or substitutes. When mitigation reaction functions are upward sloping, participation to a climate agreement increases. The authors find that in a game where only mitigation is an option, and hence with downward-sloping reaction functions, the stable coalition size will be at most 2. Instead, when adaptation is an option and it leads to upward-sloping mitigation reaction functions, the stable coalition size will be larger or equal to 3. The strategic relation between mitigation and adaptation has been examined by a parallel stream of literature, concluding that whether the two are complements or substitutes is mostly an empirical matter. Adaptation and mitigation are commonly seen and modeled as economic substitutes: if the cost of mitigation falls (rises), then the optimal response is to increase (decrease) the level of mitigation and decrease (increase) the level adaptation. However, for instance, Ingham et al. (2013) show that, when adaptation costs depend on the amount of mitigation, the two strategies can be complements. This can occur if adaptation were harder to implement under faster rates of climate change. By reducing emissions, countries not only reduce the rate of climate change, but also facilitate (buy time for) adaptation. As assumed by Ingham et al. (2013), adaptation and mitigation may be linked by more than one relationship and as a result, the standard assumption of strategic substitutability may be reversed. Building on this idea, the purpose of this paper is to further investigate the interconnections between mitigation and adaptation and the effects that they could have on climate negotiation outcomes. Our starting point is Bayramoglu et al. (2018), whose analysis we enrich inserting a double connection between adaptation and mitigation.Footnote 2 The first is the standard one: higher levels of adaptation, reducing the marginal damage from climate change, weaken the benefits from mitigation. Conversely, higher levels of mitigation, by generating less damages to be attenuated, reduce the incentive for protection. The second is similar in spirit to Ingham et al. (2013). Specifically, we include an adaptation effectiveness parameter that depends on total mitigation level so that higher mitigation determines higher productivity of adaptation, an issue not yet considered in the analysis of climate coalition formation. This assumption finds support in the scientific literature. The IPCC AR4 (IPCC 2007) states that as climate change increases, not only do the costs increase but also the options for successful (we read effective) adaptation diminish. Adaptation effectiveness appears closely linked to the rate and magnitude of climate change according to Adger et al. (2007) while Romero-Lankao et al. (2014) state that “several lines of evidence indicate that effective adaptation requires changes in approach and becomes much more difficult if warming exceeds 2 °C above preindustrial levels”. Some practical, although speculative, examples can be provided. The first can be related to “catastrophic damages” and the concept of “adaptation tipping points”, i.e., situations in which policies are no longer able to achieve their objectives (Van Ginkel et al. 2020). A typical case is when coastal (or river flood) protection fails due to “too high” and/or “too rapid”, “too frequent” flood events. In this specific case, the presence of hard adaptation measures may even worsen the damage, as water would be more difficult to be removed from the flooded areas. In our context: if “more mitigation” were able to keep the damage below the adaptation tipping point, then adaptation effectiveness would be greatly improved. The reasoning can be extended also to “continuous” or “slow on set” climate damages if we agree upon the idea that adaptation is eventually a “technology” that operates with “standard” diminishing marginal and scale returns. Examples here could be more easily found in the case of “reactive” adaptation. For instance, even though within the range of coping capacity, health care systems can work better at low rather than high levels of congestion. Similarly, interventions against forest fires can be more effective if fire episodes are few rather than many. In both situations, more resources could be concentrated on specific emergencies to pursue the desired outcome.Footnote 3 We claim that this situation—productivity of adaptation related to mitigation level—is in fact the usual one and, as such, should be taken into account to increase the realism of the analysis of the two strategies. With this enriched modelling, we show that the possibility emerges for adaptation and mitigation to be complements and not, as commonly believed, substitutes. Our new assumption also alters the effect that adaptation has on mitigation strategies. In our setting the possibility for upward-sloping mitigation reaction functions, is in fact less likely than in Bayramoglu et al. (2018). This happens because, in our case, mitigation entails a double positive externality (it reduces climate damages and it increases adaptation effectiveness), making the incentives to free ride stronger. Finally, we introduce explicit payoff functions to analyze stable coalition size and their welfare performances. Differently from Bayramoglu et al. (2018) (stable coalition size larger or equal to 3 with upward-sloping reaction function), we find that stable coalition size will be either 3 or the grand coalition (full cooperation). This result is in line with Rubio (2019). Regarding welfare: when stable coalitions are small, welfare improvements compared to non-cooperation are also small. When the grand coalition forms, welfare gains compared to non-cooperation are small if the two strategies are substitutes. This confirms a consolidated finding from the ‘90 s literature on the topic. However, if the two strategies are complements, the grand coalition will bring large welfare improvements compared to non-cooperation. In what follows: Sect. 2 introduces the game theoretical model and its general assumptions, Sect. 3 describes the climate negotiation process as a multi-stage game, Sect. 4 solves the game presenting major results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",2

Arimura,Tatsuya Abe,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Carbon pricing has become a popular economic instrument used to help mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs), which cause climate change. Among carbon pricing techniques, emissions trading schemes (ETSs) have gained attention. Notably, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) was the first comprehensive ETS to control carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In the US, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) started in 2009, followed by the California system. Among Asian countries, Korea was the first country to introduce a cap-and-trade scheme at the national level. Finally, China, the largest emitter of GHG, implemented seven regional ETSs in a pilot scheme and announced that it would introduce a national level ETS starting with the power sector (Duan 2019). The Japanese government has not yet adopted an ETS at the national level. The Tokyo metropolitan government, however, successfully introduced an ETS, the Tokyo Emissions Trading Scheme (Tokyo ETS), in 2010 (Arimura 2015). This ETS is not only the first cap-and-trade scheme for CO2 emissions in Japan but also the first in Asia. Furthermore, Tokyo ETS is unique among ETSs because the main target of this scheme is office buildings. Indeed, it is the first ETS to regulate GHG emissions from office buildings. Tokyo ETS consists of several phases. Phase I started in 2010 and ended in 2014. Phase II started in 2015 and implemented a more stringent emission target. At the start of Phase II of Tokyo ETS, the Tokyo metropolitan government reviewed the level of emissions from the regulated buildings and confirmed an emission reduction of 25%.Footnote 1 It is not clear, however, if the ETS is actually the driver of the emission reduction during this period. One should note that Japan experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, which was followed by the nuclear accident in Fukushima. This nuclear accident affected electricity supply in Japan, but the shortage of electricity capacity was particularly severe in Tokyo because the nuclear power plants in Fukushima belong to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which is almost a monopoly in supplying electricity to the Tokyo area. Due to the accident, TEPCO had to rely on expensive natural gas to generate electricity, and moreover, it had to compensate for the damages caused by the nuclear accident. This cost was passed to the TEPCO’s consumers, and so electricity prices in the Tokyo area increased sharply after the earthquake. Some people, therefore, hypothesized that the reduction in GHG emissions in the Tokyo area was caused by the electricity price increase and not by the ETS. This hypothesis is supported by those who viewed EU ETS with skepticism and thus a doubt whether an ETS could work in the real world is prevalent, especially after seeing the low permit prices in EU ETS. In addition to the price increase in the electricity, other factors may have contributed to the emission reduction in Tokyo. For example, the Japanese government adopted a rolling blackout immediately after the accident. In this scheme, the power companies intentionally stop power supply to one area for a certain period and then shift to stop the power supply to another area while the supply for the first area returns. In this way, the power companies were able to balance the total amount of electricity supply and demand. It could be argued that the experience of the rolling blackout could have incentivized consumers to save energy to avoid future blackouts. This paper empirically investigates the effects of the Tokyo ETS to clarify the cause of emission reduction in Tokyo using facility-level panel data. By conducting a facility-level survey, we collected data on office buildings in Japan. Our study is not the first to examine Tokyo ETS ex-post. Roppongi et al. (2017) qualitatively reviewed the Tokyo ETS. Wakabayashi and Kimura (2018) conducted a quantitative ex-post analysis of Tokyo ETS with a combination of interviews and facility-level data analysis. However, this latter study suffers from omitted variable bias. Notably, they ignored the influence of the electricity price increase on the GHG emissions from office buildings. This is the first study to examine the impact of Tokyo ETS on emissions by incorporating the impact of the electricity price increase. This paper contributes to the empirical literature of ETSs. Until recently, researchers have focused on ex-ante analysis using a theoretical analysis or a computable general equilibrium analysis (e.g., Böhringer and Lange 2005). Recently, however, researchers started to conduct ex-post analyses of ETS. For example, Martin et al. (2016) and Ellerman et al. (2016) reviewed the experience of EU ETS. Others initiated ex-post econometric analyses as the ex-post data have become available. For example, Ellerman and Buchner (2008) and Anderson and Di Maria (2011) confirmed the effect of EU ETS on emission reductions in European countries under EU ETS in the first phase. Petrick and Wagner (2014) and Colmer et al. (2018) estimated not only the abatement effect of EU ETS but also its impact on some economic activities using a German and a French facility-level data set. Calel and Dechezlepretre (2016) examined the impact of EU ETS on innovation in European firms, measured with patents. RGGI is also reviewed. Murray and Maniloff (2015) investigated why GHG emissions in RGGI states were reduced and examined the factors contributing to emission reduction in the region. Our study is in line with this stream of literature, but it is unique because we have examined the impact of ETS on office buildings. EU ETS was designed for manufacturing facilities and power plants, and RGGI was designed for power plants, but Tokyo ETS was one of the first ETS focusing on office buildings. One unique aspect of Tokyo ETS is that the financial sector plays a limited role. The Japanese industry association was against the introduction of ETSs, claiming that ETSs would invite speculation by financial companies. To deal with the criticism, Tokyo government has not established any auction or exchange on the market. Thus, the price of permits in Tokyo ETS is somewhat mysterious. The second contribution of this paper is to reveal the implicit price of the permit through the estimated models. This paper is constructed as follows. The next section reviews the basic design of Tokyo ETS. Section 3 explains the data, and the estimation results and the discussion are shown in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",27

The FIT purchase of renewable energy has increased by approximately 10 times, from 5.6 TWh in FY 2012 to 57 TWh in FY 2016. However, as Japan's total power generation in FY 2016 was 907.6 TWh, 57 TWh is only 6.3% of the total. Approximately 60.6% of the 57 TWh of FIT-purchased electricity in 2016 was generated by commercial solar power, 12.5% by residential solar power, and 10.3% by wind power.Footnote 1 In Japan, the proportion of solar power generation among renewable energy is high. The increase in variable power sources, such as solar power generation, influences the stability of the Japanese electric power system. The power demand density per area is higher in Japan than in other countries. In 2015, the power demand density per area was 0.75 Gwh/km2 in the US and 1.79 Gwh/km2 in Germany, while it was 2.74 Gwh/km2 in Japan.Footnote 2 When the power supply is concentrated in a small area, it is not easy to alleviate fluctuations in the electricity demand and solar power generation, and maintaining system stability becomes difficult. Wide-area operation of electric power systems is one method to solve such problems. In Japan, however, the ten largest power companies supply most of the electricity in their respective jurisdictions, but the power transmission facilities between the grids of each company are not very large. Also, East and West Japan use different AC frequencies (50 Hz and 60 Hz), rendering wide-area grid operation difficult (Ohashi 2015). While FIT has had certain effects on the introduction of renewable energy in Japan, the technical constraints of power engineering appear to weaken its effects. In July 2018, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) of Japan established the ""Subcommittee on Utilization of Carbon Pricing"". The carbon pricing mechanism is indispensable for promoting the general mitigation of greenhouse gases. Under the above technical constraints, the carbon pricing mechanism should be employed to effectively introduce renewable energy. The purpose of this research is to examine the socioeconomic impacts of carbon pricing mechanism-related energy policies under the technical constraints of introducing renewable energy. For this, we use input–output analysis, which is an effective method of analyzing socio-economic interdependence based on technology (Leontief 1986). In Japan, the regional division of the electric power system is a technical constraint on the introduction of renewable energy. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze policies, such as the carbon pricing mechanism, from an inter-regional point of view.",1

The total annual allowance sums up to 550 million tCO2e in 2019, the value of which is estimated as approximately 12.8 billion US dollars. Despite many positive signs, K-ETS is facing several severe policy challenges due to the complicated design features, including perverse incentives lineated by the grandfathering allocation with rolling base periods, lack of long-term policy commitments, double regulation of power sector GHG emissions, and exemption of carbon pricing in the power dispatch process. This study investigates the role of the power sector in K-ETS, particularly in treating the indirect emissions and lay-out of the climate-friendly and economically efficient power dispatch system.",10

A large strand of literature modelling such consumer preferences has analyzed choice of environmental quality in a vertically differentiated product framework, and examined how regulation affects these qualities (Bansal and Gangopadhyay 2003; Amacher et al. 2004; Brecard 2013). Consumers not only choose among the products which vary in quality but also decide on the usage of the product. Moreover, the above literature assumes intrinsic quality to be homogeneous across firms and the product differentiation takes place only in terms of environmental attribute. Often products compete in more than one quality dimension, and the environment-friendly products face competition from the existing standard products. A few papers in the literature have taken cognizance that the intrinsic quality and the environmental quality may be interrelated. While Birg and Voßwinkel (2018) consider these quality dimensions to be substitutes, Mantovani et al. (2016) model them as conflicting. ln this paper, we incorporate both choice and usage of the product, and assume intrinsic quality to be in conflict with the environmental quality. While purchasing cars consumers not only consider characteristics of the car they are purchasing but also how much fuel they are going to use. They also face trade-offs in terms of different dimensions of quality. For example, electric cars are more environment friendly but may not be as convenient as gasoline cars due to the limited storage capacity of batteries of electric cars. Similarly, luxury cars, SUVs, etc. have high intrinsic quality in terms of size, engine, comfort, safety features, etc., but usage of these cars requires much more fuel as compared to standard small cars. Solar thermal panels are considered environment friendly but may not ensure uninterrupted supply of energy and their installation requires space in the house. Eco-friendly cleaning products are mostly natural in origin and chemical free, therefore, less harmful to the eco-system but their performance may not match that of chemical based cleaning products. We use a discrete continuous framework similar to Matsukawa (2012) to model choice and usage of the product. The discrete choice faced by the consumers is a decision on the choice of the product, for example, which brand of a car to buy, whether to buy an electric or a gasoline car. The continuous choice faced by the consumers is how much fuel or electricity should be consumed while using the product. The literature on discrete continuous models includes (Burtless and Hausman 1978; Dubin and McFadden 1984; Hanemann 1984; De Jong 1990; Matsukawa 2012) etc. Hanemann (1984) developed econometric model of discrete choice for different brands of a commodity and continuous choice of the quantity of a commodity to be purchased. De Jong (1990) and Matsukawa (2012) analyze vehicle ownership choices based on the hypothesis that a household maximizes utility from discrete choice of vehicle ownership and a continuous choice of vehicle usage. Using data from Netherlands, De Jong (1990) shows that the cost of the car and the fuel price are effective in reducing car ownership levels and also have an effect on car usage. Matsukawa (2012) examine welfare impact of emission taxes and subsidies, and show that as compared to a subsidy, an emission tax results in greater reduction in environmental pollution and higher welfare. Glerum et al. (2014) extends the literature by analyzing dynamic discrete continuous model of car ownership, usage and fuel type. The paper models forward looking behaviour of the households for acquisition of the car. The literature has also recognized that consumption decisions are made in a social context and consumers are concerned about the choices made by other consumers. Leibenstein (1950) attributes this to a bandwagon or snob effect. Various motivations for these effects include desire to confirm to social norms, status concerns, possible benefits that may accrue as more consumers consume the product (Farrell and Klemperer 2007). Social norms arise from the networks formed by the individuals in a society and may give rise to network effects. The network effects have particularly been analyzed in the context of eco-friendly products -called “green network effect”. Conrad (2006) analyzes network effects that are strengthened by the market share of a firm in a horizontal product differentiation model. The paper shows that the higher the network effect the lower will be equilibrium prices and profits. Griva and Vettas (2011) introduce network effect in a standard Hotelling model and show that high quality firm captures a larger market share when network effects are relatively weak. For stronger network effects, however, either high quality or low quality firm captures the entire market. The network effects may have a dynamic role and continue to exert in future consumption decisions as well. This may warrant a brown good tax to be in excess of Pigovian tax (Greaker and Midttomme 2014). Lambertini and Orsini (2005), Brecard (2013) and Hauck et al. (2014) model green network effect under vertical product differentiation. Lambertini and Orsini (2005) find that when network externalities are large, there is a possibility of Bertrand equilibrium. Brecard (2013) shows that when green network effect is stronger than brown network effect, there is a reduction in environmental quality of both firms and an increase in the market share of the green firm. However, when brown firm network effect is stronger, there is an increase in environmental quality of both firms and an increase in the market share of brown firm. In the former case, a combination of an ad-valorem tax, a pollution tax and a subsidy on green products can achieve optimum. However, in the latter case, the subsidy on green products is replaced with tax on green products. Hauck et al. (2014) has a similar result in terms of the effect of a green network on environmental quality and argues total welfare may decrease with an increase in the network effect. The regulator, thus, would choose a stricter environmental standard. The empirical studies have indicated that network effects increase willingness to pay for environmental friendly products (Rasouli and Timmermans 2016; Grover et al. 2019). Using a discrete choice experiment, Carlsson et al. (2010) find that women’s willingness to pay for ecological friendly coffee is driven by conformity to the social norm and increases when large number of consumers purchase ecological friendly coffee. Network effects have also been found to affect firm behaviour. Bansal et al. (2021) find evidence of peer effects influencing the corporate social responsibility expenditure of firms in India. Network effects may be modelled in different ways. Often it is modelled as a function of the size of the market (Conrad 2006; Brecard 2013; Hauck et al. 2014). They could influence present consumption decision or also future consumption decisions (Greaker and Midttomme 2014). The network effect could also depend on environmental quality directly, for instance, in Carlsson et al. (2010) average level of environmental quality in the society serves as a social norm. While Lambertini and Orsini (2005) and Brecard (2013) associate network effects with the consumption of both green and brown goods, Hauck et al. (2014) and Falcone (2014) associate network effects with the consumption of green goods. The objective of our study is to examine the impact of green network effect and government policies such as emission taxes in a discrete-continuous framework where the intrinsic quality and the environmental quality are in conflict. Specifying a fuel demand function we derive a conditional indirect utility function that satisfies all the properties of an indirect utility function. We use this utility function to analyze a two-stage game in a vertically differentiated duopoly framework, where firms choose intrinsic quality in the first stage, and compete in prices in the second stage. Our theoretical model adds value on several counts. Most papers in the previous literature consider one dimension of quality, the environmental quality (Marette et al. 1999; Zago and Pick 2004; Matsukawa 2012). In contrast, we consider products that have two dimensions of quality (intrinsic quality and environmental quality) that are in conflict with each other (Mantovani et al. 2016). Our paper contributes to the theoretical literature analyzing green network effect by introducing green network effect in a discrete-continuous framework, and analyzing environmental regulation in the presence of green network effect in the above framework. We show that an increase in green network effect reduces environmental quality and increases prices of both firms, decreases the market share and profits of the firm that has high intrinsic quality and low environmental quality, and has an opposite effect on the firm that has low intrinsic quality and high environmental quality. The effects continue to remain the same even when an emission tax is imposed. Our results are different from Lambertini and Orsini (2005) which show that while qualities are independent of the network effect, prices and profits of both firms decreases due to network effect. The results are in line with Brecard (2013) in terms of environmental quality but differ in terms of prices. An emission tax in the absence of network effect leads to an increase in the environmental quality of high intrinsic quality firm and no change in the environmental quality of low intrinsic quality firm. This result is different from Matsukawa (2012), which shows that an increase in emission tax rate in discrete-continuous framework increases environmental quality of both firms. Matsukawa (2012) considers a single quality dimension and does not incorporate green network effects. When we introduce green network effect in our model, the result in terms of increasing environmental quality is similar to Matsukawa (2012). In the presence of green network effect, an emission tax reduces prices of both firms; and does not change market share and profits of both firms. In a standard vertically differentiated product model, Bansal (2008) shows that the effect of an emission tax depends on cost parameter. However, in our study the effect of an emission tax depends on cost as well as usage parameters. We also show that an emission tax reduces total emissions and the reduction in emissions is much higher in the presence of green network effect. For sufficiently small values of the emission tax, welfare is higher under green network with environmental regulation than green network without environmental regulation. The optimal tax rate increases with an increase in green network effect and decreases with the weight assigned to relative environmental quality. Policy implications of our results is that the effect of an emission tax is enhanced if it is complemented by information disclosure or labelling policies for the green network effect to manifest itself. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops duopoly model under discrete continuous framework and analyses equilibrium. The section also analyses various possible regulatory scenarios: (i) Benchmark case where green network effect is absent and there is no environmental regulation (ii) Environmental regulation in the absence of green network effect (iii) Green network effect without environmental regulation (iv) Green network effect with environmental regulation. Sections 3 and 4 analyses the impact of green network and policy instrument of emission tax on equilibrium. Section 5 brings together all the scenarios, compares overall environmental quality under different policy instruments, and discuss impact of green network on optimal tax. Finally Sect.n 6 contains the concluding remarks.",

However, in economics, the concept of sustainable development implies that the environment and economic development are not necessarily trade-offs but may rather coexist. More precisely, in the field of environmental economics, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is used to represent the relationship between economic activity and environmental destruction. Before the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, it was widely accepted that wealthy countries were destroying the environment at a faster rate than poor ones. However, with the EKC, the relationship between environment degradation and income has been reexamined. The EKC hypothesis, which was first indicated in a study by Grossman and Krueger (1991) and popularized by the World Development Report (1992) of the World Bank, suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between different pollutants and per capita income.Footnote 1 Indeed, the EKC hypothesis claims that environmental quality will worsen first as income increases until a certain point where the economy reaches a particular level of average income, and then improve as income increases over the long run (Grossman and Krueger 1995). The economic determinants of environmental quality can be decomposed into (i) scale, (ii) composition and (iii) technique (Grossman and Krueger 1995; Tsurumi and Managi 2010): (i) A larger-scale economic activity leads to increased environmental degradation; (ii) As the overall level of income increases, the economic structure initially shifts from an agrarian structure to an energy intensive industrial structure, increasing the share of polluting activities in the GDP, and then evolves towards a services-based and technologically-driven industries structure, increasing gradually and succinctly the share of cleaner activities in the GDP; (iii) The technique effect occurs when the society substitute non-polluting technologies for polluting ones, leading to the improvement in environmental quality.Footnote 2 Is there some tendency for pollution to decrease after the economy reaches a specific threshold of income, as claimed by theEKC? The environmental effects of economic growth have been receiving increasing attention of economists and politiciansFootnote 3 in recent years. Even though a wide strand of the literature has examined the existence of the EKC, the link between pollution and economic growth remains ambiguous at the empirical level.Footnote 4 For instance, Van Den Bergh and Van Veen-Groot (2001) construct aggregate indicators of the environment (actual environmental pressure, environmental quality and environmental policy) and economic activity for 12 OECD countries and find significant correlation between indicators of economic activities and both actual environmental pressure and environmental quality. Using annual data spanning from 1857 to 2007, Sephton and Mann (2013) record a non-linear cointegration relationship between income and CO2 levels in Spain. Using data on GDP per capita and sulfur emissions, Markandya et al. (2006) report evidences of a U-shaped EKC for 12 European countries. Similarly, Fosten et al. (2012) and Sephton and Mann (2016) investigate United Kingdom data on both carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Their empirical results provide support for the Environmental Kuznets Curve.Footnote 5 Moreover, following the Climate Change Act of 2008, the per capita CO2 emissions in the UK have fallen dramatically in 2017 to levels below those of the 1860s (Hendry 2020).Footnote 6 In a similar vein, Ahmad et al. (2017) focus on the existence of the EKC in Croatia using quarterly dataset spanning 1992Q1 to 2011Q1. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Vector Error Correction (VECM) models, they show the existence of an inverted U-shape relation between economic activity and carbon dioxide emissions in the long run. Their results also reveal a bidirectional Granger causality between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the short run, and unidirectional Granger causality from growth to CO2 emissions in the long run. Anastacio (2017) examine the validity of the EKC hypothesis for North America countries. Using a yearly dataset covering 1980 to 2008, the authors find a unidirectional Granger causality from energy consumption, electricity consumption and economic growth to carbon dioxide emissions in the long run. Apergis and Ozturk (2015) use a yearly dataset covering 1990 to 2011 to test the EKC hypothesis in 14 Asian countries. The authors empirical findings support the presence of the EKC hypothesis. Apergis (2016) uses data for 15 OECD countries for the period 1960 to 2013 and concludes that there is strong evidence in favor of an EKC for 12 countries out of 15. Using a sample of 120 economies over the period 2000–2009, Barra and Zotti (2018) demonstrate the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between income and CO2 emissions. Their results also suggest that as population and industrial production grow, pressure on the environment will grow, calling for stricter environmental protection policies. Using a time-varying coefficient cointegration method, Mikayilov et al. (2018) investigate the EKC hypothesis on 12 Western European countries for the period 1861 to 2015. Their results reveal evidence in favor of relative decoupling in 8 out of the 12 countries. Using data on Gross State Product and CO2 emissions, Churchill et al. (2019) examine the EKC hypothesis for a panel of 8 Australian states over the period 1990 to 2016. Their results provide support for the classic inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis, with a peak reached in 2010. Bulut (2019) uses a cointegration test with a regime shift method on monthly data spanning the period 2000M1–2018M7 to study the impact of income on CO2 emissions in the United States and concludes that there is strong evidence in favor of an inverted-U EKC pattern. However, the EKC hypothesis has been subject to several criticisms, both theoretical and empirical. From a theoretical point of view, the main criticism of Arrow et al. (1995) is that the EKC hypothesis ignores the feedback from environmental damage to economic activities. But, if this damage is severe enough, ignoring this feedback may provide a biased and irrelevant picture as it is likely that the economic activity will be affected. Moreover, based on the Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory, Stern et al. (1996) argue that the EKC hypothesis, if it holds, may be a result of the effects of trade on the geographical distribution of polluting industries. In other words, part of the decline in environmental degradation levels in developed countries may reflect, on the one hand, their specialization in human capital and manufactured capital-intensive activities and, on the other hand, their increasingly strict environmental regulations. Thus, any apparent decrease in per capita pollution associated with an increase in per capita income along the Environmental Kuznets Curve would be exaggerated because the environmental regulation in developed countries might lead polluting industries to shift towards low and middle-income countries that are specialized in labor and natural resources (Lucas et al. 1992; Stern 2003). This reasoning implies that there is no standard and universal relationship between growth and pollution that is valid for all countries. Some empirical studies validate this theoretical hypothesis and conclude that there is a little evidence that countries follow a common inverted U-shaped pathway for environmental destruction as their income rises.Footnote 7 For instance, Managi et al. (2009) use the instrumental variables technique and annual data for OECD and non-OECD countries covering the period 1973–2000 to assess the global impact of trade openness on the environment. Their results suggest that while trade is beneficial for the environment in OECD countries, it has adverse effects in non-OECD countries. In the same way, Tsurumi and Managi (2012) examine the effect of trade intensity on deforestation for a panel of 142 countries over the period 1990–2003. Their results show that higher trade openness reduces deforestation for OECD countries but not for non-OECD countries, and suggest that both environmental-regulation and capital-labor effects have a positive impact on deforestation in OECD countries but a negative impact in non-OECD countries. Stern and Common (2001) use a yearly dataset covering 1960 to 1990 to examine the validity of the EKC hypothesis for 74 countries. Their results suggest that the EKC hypothesis is an incomplete model. Coondoo and Dinda (2002) examine the validity of the EKC hypothesis by testing for Granger causality between income and carbon dioxide emissions in various countries and regions. Their results suggest that there is no strong evidence of an EKC type effect. Wang et al. (2011) focus on China over the period 1995–2007 and find an increasing relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions and that reducing CO2 emissions may hamper China’s economic growth. Kaika and Zervas (2013) argue that developed and developing countries are on different sides of the EKC, and that there is no reason to assume that developing countries will follow the path of the developed countries. Narayan and Narayan (2010) examine the EKC hypothesis for 43 developing countries based on the short and long run income elasticities. Their results show that CO2 emissions have fallen over the long run in only 35 per cent of the sample. Moreover, the authors also examined the EKC hypothesis at regional level and found an income elasticity in the long run smaller than the short run (which implies that carbon dioxide emission has fallen with a rise in income) only for the Middle Eastern and South Asian panels. Similarly, Al-Mulali et al. (2016) use non-stationary panel data techniques to investigate the existence of the EKC hypothesis in seven selected regions. Their result does not provide support for the EKC hypothesis in all regions under study: the EKC hypothesis was only found in the regions where renewable energy has a significant correlation with pollution in both the short and the long runs. Using data from 73 countries over the period 1980–2014, Halkos and Bampatsou (2019) find that the most environmentally efficient countries are those that have signed the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, their findings suggest that the environmental effect of economic growth is determined by economies’ level of development and their geographical region. Other empirical studies find particular pollution-economic relationship and some of which support the EKC theory only partially. Friedl and Getzner (2003) investigate the existence of the EKC in Austria over the period 1960–1999. Their results reveal an N-shaped EKC, which suggest that environmental deterioration will resume beyond a certain income level. Likewise, Webber and Allen (2010) find that there is no single universal relationship between pollution and income. Similarly, Baek (2015) focus on the Arctic countries and reports an inverted U-shaped relationship between income and CO2 emissions in Norway, an N-shape pattern in Sweden, and a linear relationship in Finland and Denmark. More recently, Allard et al. (2018) evaluate the N-shaped EKC using data for 74 countries categorized into three income groups over the period 1994–2012. They find evidence supporting the N-shaped EKC for all low/middle-income and high-income countries, but heterogenous and inconclusive results for the upper/middle-income countries. Zanin and Marra (2012) use a yearly dataset covering 1960 to 2008 to examine the validity of the EKC for 9 countries. Their results suggest an inverted U-shaped EKC for France and Switzerland, N-shaped relationship for Austria, M-shaped relationship for Denmark, Γ-shaped curve for Finland and Canada, and an increasing relationship for Australia, Italy and Spain. Given the ambiguity of the income-pollution relationship from the empirical EKC literature, the challenge for research now is to re-examine some of the issues discussed earlier in the EKC literature using new and rigorous econometric methods. This paper aims to examine the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the United Kingdom using a long span of data (from 1751 to 2016). To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to use the bivariate dynamic correlation (Croux et al. 2001) and the squared cross-wavelet coherency (Torrence and Webster 1999), to assess the strength of links between a measure of environmental degradation (CO2 emissions) and a possible source of this degradation (economic growth) in the UK over a period of 265 years. The remainder of this paper is as follows: Sect. 2 presents the empirical strategy and the data. Section 3 documents our results. Section 4 conclude.",12

Recent reports by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) point out that the transportation sector accounts for the emissions of about 47% nitrogen oxides and 13% particulate matter across 33 EEA countries (EEA 2015, 2016). Besides, road transport constitutes over 20% of the carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and is the only source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission that steadily trended up since 1990 (EEA 2016). Similarly, transportation end-use sector in the US, including cars, trucks, and other sources, accounts for the largest portion of GHG emissions since 2016, surpassing the electricity generation (EPA 2020). High levels of air pollution have been documented to impose significant social costs, causing increased school absence rates (Currie et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2018), lower academic performance (Ebenstein et al. 2016), reduced labor productivity (Zivin and Neidell 2012; Hanna and Oliva 2015; Chang et al. 2016; Archsmith, Heyes, & Saberian 2018; He et al. 2019; Chang et al. 2019), increased infant mortality rates (Chay and Greenstone 2003; Cesur et al. 2017; Anderson 2020), and shortened life expectancy (Chen et al. 2013; Heutel and Ruhm 2016). The issue of transport-related pollution emissions is more notable in urban areas. In Europe, about one-fifth to one-third of the urban population were exposed to PM10 concentrations above the EU and WHO reference levels (EEA 2013) by the year of 2011. Outdoor exposures to air pollution cause nearly 600,000 premature deaths in EU nations annually (WHO 2015). The reduced life expectancy and lost human capital resulting from air pollution can be associated with about 1.575 trillion pounds annually (equivalent to 1.37 trillion US dollars). Over recent decades, policymakers in European countries have increased the scale of actions to attenuate air pollution coming from road transportation.Footnote 1 The Low-Emission Zone (LEZ) is one of the most widely adopted traffic policies in urban areas in Europe (see Wolff and Perry 2010 for a review). It is an incentive-based regulation targeting reducing emissions from specific categories of diesel-engine vehicles. The first generation of LEZs was launched in Stockholm, Göteborg, and Malmo in Sweden under the name of environmental zones (Miljözon) in the late 1990s (Holman et al. 2015). Under the policies, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) (i.e., goods vehicles over 12 tons gross vehicle weight) were required to equip with certified emission control devices or a replaced engine before entering an LEZ city. Following the earliest practice, Germany, France, and Italy also established LEZs to regulate entrance from heavily polluting vehicles into specified areas. Despite the widespread adoption of LEZs, only a small number of papers have examined the effectiveness of LEZs in shifting the traffic patterns and improving the air quality in the designated areas. In addition, a few studies have explored the underlying mechanism that motivates a transition in traffic flow triggered by LEZ policy. This paper provides empirical evidence on the environmental and behavioral effects of the largest LEZ in the world—the LEZ in Greater London (hereafter “London” for simplicity). Launched on Feb 4, 2008, London’s LEZ leveraged on a strictly enforced pricing scheme to discourage the emissions of PM10 from heavily polluting diesel-engine vehicles within the zone. The policy runs 24 h a day, 365 days a year, including national and public holidays. The implementation of the policy progresses through multiple phases, with each phase being a more advanced stage with a broader scope of vehicles under regulation or more restrictive emission standards for the already covered vehicles. The LEZ comes with rigorous enforcement techniques with the installation of over 300 cameras on major and minor roads accompanied by an automatic plate recognition system that monitored compliance behaviors inside London. London’s LEZ covers an area of about 1,600 square kilometers, where over 8 million population resides. Existing empirical analysis on the environmental impact of London’s LEZ largely relies on limited-scale air quality data. Ellison et al. (2013) compare the changes of particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) measured by three stations inside London and one station outside London after the LEZ implementation. Results show that the LEZ generates unmeasurable impact on the PM10 emissions. Jones et al. (2012) analyze air quality changes in late 2007, during which the LEZ policy was publicly announced but not yet implemented. The authors uncover a significant improvement in air quality inside the zone, but found that most of it is attributed to the nation’s gradual replacement of ultra-low sulfur fuels to “sulfur-free” fuels, instead of the pre-compliance adjustments to London’s LEZ.Footnote 2 Researchers have mixed findings for the effect of LEZs operated in other European cities. Boogaard et al. (2012) analyze the changes of traffic-related air pollutants in urban roadside areas versus suburban locations in five Dutch cities following the introduction of LEZs. The study finds no effect of the LEZ policy on street-level air quality and no significant decline in traffic intensity at all but one urban location. Wolff (2014) examine multiple different sized LEZs in Germany and shows that, on average, the LEZs have reduced the PM10 by 9%, but with significant heterogeneity; larger LEZs are estimated to generate more pronounced effects than smaller zones. Gehrsitz (2017) extends this analysis exploring a large health dataset that contains information on the universe German birth statistics. He finds that LEZs had no substantial improvements in infant health in general, although he finds a very small reduction in the incidence of stillbirths. In this paper, we make three contributions to the existing literature. First, we combine the most comprehensive data from a network of air monitoring systems in England to assess the environmental effect of London’s LEZ. The spatially distributed sample consists of 56 roadside and urban background stations, allowing us to create a rich panel of daily air quality observations. The diverse locations of our sample stations enable us to investigate the geographical heterogeneity in the policy treatment effect. Second, we quantify the spillover effect of London’s LEZ on areas adjacent to the LEZ border. The assessment of externality is an important middle ground that helps evaluate the overall benefit of direct traffic regulations like the LEZ. Third, we use traffic flow and compliance data on the subject vehicles—heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and light goods vehicles (LGVs)—to examine the underlying factors accounting for our estimation results. We find evidence of both desired and undesired behavioral adjustments, which led to distinctive policy effects across phases. In the primary regression, we apply a stepwise difference-in-difference (DID) model using 35 air quality monitoring stations located along major representative roads within London and other cities at least 180 miles (equivalent to 3 h drive) away. The DID identifies the changes in PM10 experienced exclusively by stations inside the LEZ during the policy announcement period and its first two phases. We control for station, region-year, and season fixed effects as well as a rich set of weather and non-workday covariates to eliminate the impact of confounding factors. We find that the least stringent phase in the initial period of London’s LEZ has created an upward trend of PM10 inside London. Conversely, the second and more stringent phase has generated a significant reduction of PM10 inside London. Nevertheless, these impacts were salient only along major roads where vehicular emissions constitute the largest source of airborne particulate pollution. No measurable change of air quality was seen in the urban background (e.g., residential) areas during any phase of the LEZ. Using stations located within 1 h of driving distance (approx. 60 miles) to the LEZ border, we also find that the policy created a negative spillover effect by driving up the PM10 along major roads toward London. There is no measurable spillover in residential areas nearby. Overall, we find the air quality improvement caused by London’s LEZ is limited in scale and specific to traffic-intensive areas. We explore the underlying channels leading to the divergent treatment effects in the first two phases of London’s LEZ. Using the policy compliance data from transport for London and employing a two-stage model where the policy implementation serves as an instrument for traffic flow and vehicle composition (i.e., compliant versus non-compliant), we document a close linkage between the number of subject vehicles, policy compliance rate, and air quality in London. We find that the contrasting policy effects can largely be explained by an increased traffic volume of both HGVs and LGVs in London during phase I, despite the continuously rising compliance rate. This indicates potential temporary adjustments in the allocation of these commercial vehicles under the LEZ regulation. When the policy proceeded to phase II, the traffic volume gradually declined with a further improving compliance rate. The two trends worked together in reducing the airborne PM10 in London. The present paper is remotely linked with other studies exploring the side effects of direct traffic regulation. For instance, Davis (2008) analyzes the environmental effect of a license plate program Hoy No Circula (HNC) launched in Mexico City in 1989. The HNC policy banned a specific group of drivers from driving on roads each day of the week based on the last digit of the license plate number. The author finds ineffectiveness of the HNC on reducing major air pollutants during its operation and an adverse effect of the policy on air quality during non-operating hours. Undesired behavioral adjustments in the form of acquiring a second, heavily polluting vehicle and substituting toward highly emitting taxis are shown to have contributed to the adverse effect of the HNC. The paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides background information on London’s LEZ, including an outline of subject vehicles and the charging schemes. Section III summarizes the air quality and weather data in our sample. Section IV specifies the econometric model and discusses the identification strategies in the estimation of the treatment and spillover effects of the LEZ. Section V provides estimation results and performs various robustness checks for the model. Section VI discusses potential underlying mechanisms of our results using compliance and traffic flow data. Section VII concludes.",9
23.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,23 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-021-00309-7,The dual nature of money: why monetary systems matter for equitable bioeconomy,October 2021,Ansel Renner,Herman Daly,Kozo Mayumi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Severe government debt has been a reality for most economically advanced nations since the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008. Indeed, the ratio of gross government debt to gross domestic product for the Group of Seven currently stands at 141% (IMF 2020a). In global terms, the most recent driver of increasing government indebtedness is the substantial monetary actions taken to combat the COVID-19 Pandemic and Recession, roughly $7.5 trillion in 2020 alone (IMF 2020b). Such actions include a massive injection of new money into the global economy through the issuance of, for example, government bonds. Both the general public and economists normally regard the creation of securities such as government bonds as the creation of debt. However, it should be noted in contrast that individual economic agents with outstanding government bonds in their personal portfolios typically regard those bonds as wealth, not debt. Consider the case of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment management company with nearly $8 trillion in assets as of 2020. It is standard for BlackRock clients with government bonds among their managed “financial assets” to regard such things as a genuine form of personal monetary wealth.
 We face here a curious dual nature of money, one that generalizes for all forms of money and money substitute (“general liquidity”). Proper attention is due to that duality in discussions of sustainability. To shed light on it, this contribution revisits the widely unappreciated biophysical foundation of general liquidity. One of the present authors previously investigated F. Soddy’s important contributions to the theory of money, contributions which had been paid little attention in the decades preceding (Daly 1980). This contribution offers a fresh revisiting of Soddy through its discussion of the dual nature of money. It offers a new perspective on money theory, relevant for discussions of sustainable and responsible development paradigm within communities concerned with the nature of finance in an equitable bioeconomy. It must be emphasized that for Soddy, wealth is a physical flow of goods and services contributing to a decent life, following the idea of J. Ruskin. Soddy (1933a) described the part of money aggregate that is to be exchanged for goods and services as “virtual wealth” and asserted that other forms of money should be minimized. He stressed that a subtle balance between physical wealth and virtual wealth should be maintained (Soddy 1934). Those ideas, ultimately prompting his proposal to prevent demand deposits from becoming a source of bank loans, deeply influenced the Chicago Plan and Fisher’s (1936) 100% Money. The manuscript is organized as follows. The section “The dual nature of money and its implications for sustainability” introduces the core rationale. Namely, it presents the dual nature of money. Though money is regarded as a form of wealth for individuals, money is a source of biophysical debt for the community to which those individuals belong. The section “Money creation and the origin of money interest: two potential causes of rapidly increasing biophysical debt” discusses two potential causes of increasing biophysical debt: (1) the desire of all economic entities with the right to issue money to take advantage of said right, and (2) the privilege, given to money owners, to be able to expect positive interest on their money stock. If we properly recognize the dangers of a disequilibrating increase in money stock insofar as such a thing threatens to disrupt the biophysical base of economic activities, two crucial decisions must then be made: (1) the decision over who should be entitled to issue legal tender and thereby receive the benefit of seigniorage, and (2) the decision over how to mitigate distributional inequalities, if and when money issuers create them. The section “Who should be responsible for the issuance of money” addresses those two points, which are closely related to the discussion of who owns newly created money as an asset and who owns it as a debt as well as the discussion of how and when debt is to be repaid at what rate of interest. Finally, the conclusion section comments on the dual nature of money’s characteristic to inform the contemporary discourse on processes of rapid financial globalization.",3
23.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,06 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-020-00298-z,Adoption and diffusion of conservation agriculture technology in Zambia: the role of social and institutional networks,October 2021,Abdul Nafeo Abdulai,Awal Abdul-Rahaman,Gazali Issahaku,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the last few decades, there have been growing concerns in many parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on soil productivity and environmental implications of the typical conventional farming (CF) systems.Footnote 1 These systems continually destroy the natural soil structure, soil organic matter and soil ecosystem (Montgomery 2007; Komarek et al. 2019). Pampel and van Es (1977) indicate that Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a better environmentally profitable alternative to CF since it is good for the environment and at the same time economically viable. The Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] (2010) identified Zambia and eleven other countriesFootnote 2 as CA technology focal countries in Africa, with Zambia considered as the success story for CA uptake in SSA. The FAO (2014) defined CA as practices that involve minimal soil disturbance, use of crop rotations and retention of plant residues such as mulch on the surface of the soil. There was a policy pronouncement in Zambia in 1999 that, CA had become part of the Zambian National Agricultural Policy, intending to increase the number of smallholder farmers practicing CA to 600,000 by the year 2015. However, the adoption of CA technology has been much slower than expected. A considerable body of studies on CA exists in the empirical literature (e.g., Abdulai and Abdul-Rahaman 2020; Michler et al. 2019; Ameila 2014). The study by Abdulai and Abdul-Rahaman (2020) found a significant reduction in household poverty associated with Conservation Agriculture technology adoption in Zambia. In their research on Conservation Agriculture and climate resilience, Michler et al. (2019) found that CA adoption in years of average rainfall does not result in yield gains, but was effective in mitigating the adverse effects of rainfall deviations. Using system dynamics approach to analyze the CA adoption and diffusion process, Amelia (2014) found that both long-term and single-moment economic and social factors significantly influence household CA adoption and diffusion. However, these studies have not incorporated the role of social and institutional networks in CA adoption and diffusion. Meanwhile, understanding the patterns and drivers of adoption and diffusion of agricultural technologies is fundamental to formulating development policies and programs for increasing productivity and ensuring food and nutrition security in SSA (Brown et al. 2017; Darkwah et al. 2019). Therefore, empirical analysis on the adoption and diffusion of CA technology, and in particular, on how farmers' social and institutional networks play out in these processes will shed some light on the factors driving the uptake of the technology. In particular, adopting improved technology, including CA, may not be spontaneous, random or complete in a given population, but depends on understanding the dynamics and cross-sectional patterns of the technology. This study examines the role of peer effects through farmers’ social networks, as well as institutional networks such as extension service in the adoption and diffusion of conservation agriculture technology. By social network, we mean individual members and the links associated with their relationship through which goods or services, as well as information flow among them. On the other hand, institutional network here refers to how connected farmers are to agricultural extension agents who disseminate agricultural technologies for improved productivity and livelihoods. The flow of information may occur in one way only, may be bidirectional or a mixture of links. In particular, disseminating information on new technology to a large heterogeneous population of farmers may be expensive. Hence, implementers of the technology, including extension agents usually target farmer groups who are identified as peers. Moreover, many technology adoption studies normally employ static limited dependent variable models to compare the characteristics of adopters and non-adopters and determine which variables statistically correlate with adoption (e.g. Fuglie 1999; Issahaku and Abdul-Rahaman 2019; Noltze et al. 2012; Mariano et al. 2012). These approaches are restrictive in cases where the effect of regressors on the time-path to adoption and the effect of time-varying covariates on adoption are relevant (Burton et al. 2003; Dadi et al. 2004; Abdulai and Huffman 2005). Specifically, the adoption process of CA may be gradual, as farmers learn by doing, or learn from others. This study contributes to the growing literature on conservation agriculture technology adoption and diffusion by using a discrete-time hazard model to analyze the pattern of adoption and diffusion, as well as the factors that drive the diffusion of CA technology in Zambia. Specifically, we utilize recall data from a recent survey of 408 maize farmers in Zambia to examine the role of social and institutional networks in the adoption and diffusion of conservation agriculture technology. This study relates to the recent literature on the impact of social learning and institutional networks on technology adoption (Maertens and Barrett 2013; Krishnan and Patnam 2014; Genius et al. 2014). As noted by Krishnan and Patnam (2014), capturing the degree of information transmission through social interaction and extension services and their roles in the diffusion of new technology is an arduous task. In particular, Manski (1993) pointed out that an individual exerts influence on the group just as the group influences the individual making it difficult to disentangle the appropriate reference peer effects. Moreover, the fact that a farmer is more likely to adopt a new technology soon after his neighbors have done so might be due to some unobserved variable that is spatially and serially correlated, rather than learning. Hence, a correlation between group adoption and individual adoption may have little to do with social learning. In their study, Krishnan and Patnam (2014) employ instrumental variables approach to address the potential endogeneity problem. In this study,Footnote 3 we use the information on the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers’ peers and farmers’ access to information in a principal component analysis to compute factors that capture the unobserved variables that are important in analyzing the impact of information transmission through social networks and extension agents on technology adoption. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we describe conservation agriculture in Zambia, and in Sect. 3, we outline the conceptual framework used in this study. Sections 4 and 5 present the empirical strategy and data used for the analysis, respectively. The empirical results are presented in Sect. 6, while the final section highlights the conclusions and policy implications.",5

Such increase is largely taking place due to marked changes of economic integration and globalization that developed countries of the Global North have been demonstrating the past few decades (Mendel 2001). Since its introduction in 1996, and as the process of globalization was consolidating, ISO 14001 has become the de facto environmental management system standard (EMSS) at a supranational level, aiming at reducing the environmental footprint of organisational activities. It does not prescribe specific requirements for products, production technologies, or environmental performance outcomes, but mandates a set of overarching environmental management principles, assuming that if sound processes, training, and targets are applied, the desired outcomes will be achieved (Prakash and Potoski 2006a, b). Over the years, it has been characterized a ‘meta-standard’, reaching certification growth levels beyond expectations and becoming a necessary feature for business entities operating in the global marketplace. It this respect, it has provided fertile ground for accessing deregulated markets and to penetrate in large-scale production networks (Larsen and Häversjö 2001; King et al. 2005; Vandergeest 2007; Freitas and Iizuka 2012). Such a meta-standard allows a level of homogeneity of respective management systems and indicates suppliers who endorse environmental responsibility as well as operational efficiencies while pursuing entry points into greener markets (Heras-Saizarbitoria and Boiral 2013; Testa et al. 2014; Di Noia and Nicoletti 2016). In 2018, the number of ISO 14001 certificates were 307,059 covering 447,547 sites, spread across all regions of the world. In Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Central and South Asia, as well as the Middle East,, an annual growth equal to or above 20% has been identified (ISO 2017), indicating the critical importance the standard encapsulates for transnational corporations and a wide array of industries. Franceschini et al. (2004) assert that the diffusion of certification processes such as the ISO 14001 resembles a behaviour similar to that of a bio-population growth in a limited resource habitat, being highly complex and influenced by a wide range of (and internal) external parameters. Being one of the primary soft-voluntary environmental policy instruments, ISO 14001 has been studied from a number of diverse perspectives and disciplines (e.g., see To and Lee 2014, and for a meta-analysis of such studies see Heras-Saizarbitoria and Boiral 2013). In this respect, environmentally proactive specifications and requirements organized under the scope of ISO 14001 have been found to yield cost savings from self-regulation and legal compliance, increased productivity, and efficiency (in terms of resource consumption and waste management) but also to contribute towards administrative simplifications, organizational image and brand equity, social legitimacy, and improved stakeholder relationships (De Oliveira et al. 2010; Heras and Arana 2010; Zhang et al. 2014; Delmas and Montes-Sancho 2011; Delmas and Pekovic 2013; Daddi et al. 2011, 2014; Testa et al. 2014; Iatridis and Kesidou 2016). Certification standards (such as the ISO 14001) can bring inequality among businesses (in terms of their ability to comply with its requirements) driving some out of certain market segments (Reardon et al. 2001; Ponte 2008; Campbell 2005), but also allow for an integration smaller firms to international value chains with significant spillover effects in terms of income growth and employment opportunities (Maertens and Swinnen 2009; Minten et al. 2009; Henson and Humphrey 2010). Several empirical studies have investigated factors explaining ISO 14001 adoption, indicating that stakeholder pressures and expectations as well as organizational characteristics tend to motivate firms to obtain certification (e.g., Nakamura et al. 2001; Welch et al. 2002; Bansal and Hunter 2003; Wu et al. 2007; Arimura et al. 2008; Nishitani 2009). Nevertheless, it is only few assessments that have attempted to shed light on variations in the diffusion ISO 14001 certification among countries in terms of national factors and macroeconomic conditions that may stimulate relevant implementation patterns. In this respect, a relatively recent wave of studies investigating ISO 14001 diffusion in numerous countries and different regions (He et al. 2015; Heras-Saizarbitoria et al. 2015; Fura and Wang 2017; Ozusaglam et al. 2017; Hikichi et al. 2017). Assessing the diffusion of ISO 14001 in Europe through a relative growth rate and density analysis approach, Lira et al. (2019) point out that the region has reached a maturity state with non-uniform patterns, however, among countries. Such uneven acceptance has also been pinpointed at a worldwide scale, undermining the standard’s potential contribution to provide enabling conditions for sustainable development. Heras-Saizarbitoria et al. (2018) confirm major worldwide growth of the ISO 14001 certification and report that European countries with a disparate market structure and institutional environment (e.g., Spain and Italy) lead the way in adoption rates of ISO 14001. Using a panel of 142 countries, Neumayer and Perkins (2004) observe that per capita ISO14001 certifications are positively correlated with income per capita, foreign direct investment, and exports, while a negative correlation with productivity (value-added) levels and state intervention is suggested. These authors argue that the diffusion of ISO 14001 in Europe has been shaped by the long-standing high GDP growth, a favourable institutional environment for business development, stakeholder, and supply chain pressures, as well as investment opportunities and export performance. Moon and DeLeon (2005) focus on how institutional mechanisms affect ISO14001 adoption among 34 countries, and observe that the fruitful and efficient government-business cooperative interactions have led to a higher ISO 14001 adoption rates. Market-supporting institutions reflect coordination mechanisms among key actors of the national business system that ensure capital mobility (flows), reduced information asymmetry, and business creation-opportunities (Miller and Kim, 2012) towards an efficient operation of the market-based economy (Fuentelsaz et al. 2015). Orcos et al. (2018) indicate that market-supporting institutions “have a direct impact on the extent to which stakeholders can monitor firms’ polluting activities and determine the obstacles and benefits that managers perceive from implementing ISO 14001” (p.851). Countries with relatively weak market-supporting institutions tend to have less-dense networks of market-specific intermediaries, i.e., auditors, investment bankers, trade associations, and consultants (Fuentelsaz et al. 2015). Business entities in these countries may face strong information asymmetries, financial constraints, technological capability gaps, and/or ineffective third-party guidance on ISO 14001 implementation from governmental (or non-governmental) bodies (Bansal and Bogner 2002; Delmas 2001; UNIDO 2012). Miller and Kim (2012) also indicate that companies in national settings with strong market-supporting institutions tend to operate under stiff competition. This gives room to introducing ISO 14001 certification as a building block of environmental responsibility allowing to secure market share, differentiate, and, ultimately, increase competitiveness and competitive advantage over peers (Danis et al. 2010; Haunschild and Miner 1997; Iatridis and Kesidou 2016). Similarly, Potoski and Prakash (2013) examine the underlying link between ISO 14001 and pollution in 138 countries, and report a statistically significant relationship in the numbers of ISO 14001 adoption and SO2 reduction, while no similar association is observed considering changes in water pollution (COD emissions). Indeed, environmental pressures, such as GHG emissions and energy intensity, have been stressed as drivers of policy-making towards regulatory mechanisms facilitating benign environmental management practices (Wiedmann et al. 2015; Schandl et al. 2016). Potoski and Prakash (2004) also indicate that ISO 14001 adoption rates are likely to be influenced by trading relationships between countries, national regulations that promote stringent environmental regulations with a less litigious approach towards business conduct, and consumer demand for mechanisms allowing to identify environmentally benign firms. The same authors employ a panel of 106 countries to investigate how trade linkages and export performance may encourage ISO 14001 adoption and conclude that countries whose export destinations demonstrate higher levels of ISO 14001 certifications tend to exhibit higher certification rates themselves (Prakash and Potoski 2006a, b) used. In a similar vein, they also highlight the critical role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the ISO 14001 adoption rates of host countries when FDIs originate from corporations originating from countries with high levels of ISO 14001 adoption (Prakash and Potoski 2007). Indeed, multinational enterprises are in the unique position to act as agent of change in foreign settings and influence the dissemination of standardized management system standards through their bargaining power in supply chains of goods and services (Neumayer and Perkins 2005). In this respect, international trade has been pinpointed as a critical factor for ISO 14001 diffusion among national terrains. Albuquerque et al. (2007) assert that trade can affect the standard’s diffusion and relevant certification rates are found to be associated with export volumes (Boys and Grant 2010). Supporting evidence for this claim is also provided in Delmas and Montes-Sancho (2011) who focus on factors describing trade orientations vis-a-vis ISO 14001 in EU countries. Marimon et al. (2006) assert that the increasing number of ISO 14001 certificates follows a pattern of geographical distribution similar to that of the ISO 9001. Recent studies also suggest that ISO 9001 certification can encourage ISO 14001 adoption (Llach et al. 2011, 2015; Sampaio et al. 2011; To and Lee 2014) as both standards share the same core principles and implementation similarities and the existing experience with quality management system standardization may act as a ‘stepping stone’ in acquiring new, environmental, certification (Vastag 2004). In view of the above, studies assessing diffusion patterns of standards, principles, and/or international guidelines encapsulate valuable insights under the scope of a descriptive and predictive capacity regarding dissemination patterns and cross-country trajectories (Marimon et al. 2006). It is, therefore, critical to gain a more comprehensive understanding of whether diffusion of standards, such as the ISO 14001, is merely random or driven by certain macro-level determinants contributing to this (beyond business-level characteristics). An analysis of ISO 14001 diffusion patterns should account for national characteristics and capacities which may shape the standard’s level of ‘diffusability’ (Tews et al. 2003; Tews 2005). While international dynamics are filtered by national (i.e., endogenous) variables, a thorough examination of country-specific properties as well as (political and socio-economic) capacities may provide fruitful evidence and actionable insights as to why certain countries adopt such policy instruments to a greater extent over others and, thus, demonstrate increased responsiveness to such supranational norms of environmental management. Nevertheless, a comprehensive characterization study for the OECD and the major emerging economies of BRIICS is still lacking. By addressing this gap in the literature, this study seeks to shed light on drivers of ISO 14001 certifications in these country groups. Our assessment considers that the willingness of managers to pursue ISO 14001 certification will depend on macro-level conditions beyond micro-level considerations. The contribution of the paper complements previous work on external drivers of environmental responsibility and management planning. By looking at such parameters that influence the implementation of this environmental standard, an increased apprehension of factors that drive environmental responsibility of organizational entities can be achieved. Studies such as ours may assist international business managers and EMSS consultants-experts in gaining a better understanding of ISO 14001 determinants and in planning the development of environmental management practices. Likewise, such panel data findings also provide actionable insights to technical committees as well as certification bodies with respect to future dissemination or promotional strategies. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the data and the econometric models employed for the estimation. In Sect. 3, the estimation results are outlined. Finally, Sect. 4 summarizes general concluding remarks and a way forward.",1

Moffatt,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There have been substantial improvements in global initiatives to resolve drinking water protection issues over the past few decades. One prominent example is the halving of the proportion of the global population without access to sustainable clean drinking water and basic sanitation between 2000 and 2015.Footnote 1 For another example, between 1990 and 2010, more than 2 billion people received improved sources of drinking water, meeting the 7th millennium development goal target (88%) 5 years before the expected deadline of 2015. However, unfortunately, many countries are still lagging, with an estimated 780 million people lacking access to safe drinking water, mostly from developing countries (Salaam-Blyther 2012). Paradoxically, some of these countries are naturally endowed with abundant water resources. In 2012, UNICEF/WHO reported that while 91% of the urban population have access to improved water supply, only 33% of households have piped water systems in their homes. Moreover, piped water tends to be intermittent and unreliable for non-public sector households and middle/lower income users. This is evidenced by Owusu and Lundehn (2006), who noted that, of Ghanaian households with a secure piped water supply, 87% are officials of the public service or within higher income brackets. It is, therefore, evident that a significant proportion of the urban population remains without access to a reliable supply of piped water. This draws our attention to Sustainable Development Goal 6: “Ensure water and sanitation availability and sustainability management for everyone by 2030”. Evidence from the literature reveals that key factors impeding access to piped water supply are high operational costs and low revenue returns (Water Aid 2005), unrealistic pricing (MWRWH 2007), and private sector exclusion. To address the situation, studies by the World Bank (1991), and Brookshire and Whittington (1993), have sought to propose a full-cost recovery model to bridge the cost–revenue gap, and in turn the supply-deficit gap. However, due to information asymmetry among market agents and perhaps lack of political will, these suggestions have largely been overlooked. The main uncertainty relates to how much consumers are willing to pay for the quality and quantity (piped water) of water supply. Two key research questions we seek to investigate are therefore as follows. First, even if consumers are interested in this full-cost recovery proposal, how much are they actually willing to pay for reliable water services? Second, is the incentive—in terms of a cost–benefit analysis—sufficient to attract private sector suppliers? We seek to fill these informational gaps for the benefit of actors in the water sector. To answer the first question, we provide estimates of households’ average willingness to pay (WTP) for reliable piped water, obtained using a variety of methods. We then deduce the associated cost–benefit estimates to provide an answer to the second question. We consider it important to apply several different valuation methods for two reasons. First, the choice between methods tends to be subjective, the application of several valuation methods to the same choice set provides some degree of neutrality (see Carson et al. 1996). Second, a comparison of estimates obtained using different methods amounts to a useful validation exercise. The concept of validity and its relevance in economics research has been highlighted by Roe and Just (2009). They argue that validity ensures that a finding or conclusion reflects a good approximation of the reality or truth. That is, validity authenticates an empirical finding. They further distinguish between internal and external validity: internal validity is “the ability of a researcher to argue that observed correlations are causal” (Roe and Just 2009, p. 1266); external validity is “the ability to generalize the relationships found in a study to other persons, times, and settings” (p. 1267). For these reasons, the present study employs three different economic valuation methods to estimate the WTP for a reliable piped water supply. These methods are: the travel cost method (TCM); the hedonic pricing method (HPM); and the contingent valuation method (CVM). One of the study’s contributions is the comparison of the three sets of results being used to establish their external validity. We provide evidence that households are willing to pay 3–8% of income for reliable piped water supply, and these robust estimates are consistent with previous literature (Van Den Berg and Nauges 2012; Choumert et al. 2014b). The usefulness of our estimates is mainly in providing a key input to the cost–benefit analysis required to establish the net benefit from investing in reliable piped water supply in Ghana. The cost–benefit analysis reveals that consumers’ WTP is easily sufficient to generate positive net benefits from investing in reliable piped water supply in Ghana. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the empirical literature. Section 3 describes the data collection procedure and econometric methodology. Section 4 presents and interprets the results. Section 5 concludes.",4

An analysis of the Peruvian case,October 2021,Julio Aguirre,Elmer Guerrero,Yohnny Campana,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of forests and the benefits they bring to human well-being is well known due to the critical and diverse ecosystem services (ES) they provide (Brockerhoff et al. 2017; Lakerveld et al. 2015; TEEB 2010; MA 2003).Footnote 1 However, human-caused disturbances can disrupt forest conditions: structure, function, and composition (Soares-Filho et al. 2006; Werth 2002; Holdsworth 1997). The Peruvian Amazon region is internationally recognized for its uniqueness and importance. This rainforest ecosystem, in addition to being a primary rainforest, also has a major conservation value and it is considered to be a priority in nearly all global biodiversity inventories (Brooks et al. 2006). Peru has approximately 73.3 million hectares of forestland (57% of the country’s surface), making it the second-most forested country in Latin America and the ninth in the world. However, between 2001 and 2018 the sharp reduction in forest cover in Peru is a matter of considerable public concern: a total of 2.28 million hectares (ha) with an average rate of 126,938 ha/year, according to the Ministry of the Environment, MINAM). Establishing protected natural areas (PNA) has been one of the main policy mechanisms used for protecting and maintaining natural and biological diversity as well as for preventing the extinction of flora and fauna (FAO 2018; UNEP et al. 2018). By 2018, the terrestrial and marine coverage of protected areas were around 14.9% and 16.8%, respectively (UNEP et al. 2018).Footnote 2 In Peru, by 2018, there were a total of 225 protected areas, comprising approximately 22.93 million hectares (17.84% of the national territory) (INEI 2019). However, natural areas having a protective effect in Peru is debatable (Díaz and Miranda 2012). It turns out that, when looking at the evolution of deforestation in districts with and without PNA (based on the district’s area in 2000), while the percentage of the total deforested area is greater among the latter, the lost hectares in the former are no smaller, which in absolute terms kept the same pattern (Fig. 1). Source: National Environmental Information System (SINIA), Ministry of Environment Deforested area in districts with and without PNA. The information of the total area of each district belongs to the year 2000. From this information, it is considered to every year the changes of the deforested area in each district. . This may have been exacerbated by the development of road infrastructure over the last 16 years. Besides small-scale agriculture, commercial mining and illegal logging, road construction is another determinant of deforestation (Asher et al. 2020; Oliveira et al. 2007). Between 2001 and 2006, the road infrastructure did not change much, but since 2007 it has almost doubled, also of note is that in the 20 years prior to that, the road network had only increased by 34%, from 60,000 to 80,000 km (Webb 2013).Footnote 3 Nevertheless, this growth has been chaotic and blind to the natural environment, and in some cases, it has collided with the government’s efforts to preserve natural spaces.Footnote 4 Figure 2 shows that PNA have been dissected at various points by national and departmental roads. Certainly, despite the accepted fact that road establishment can bring economic and social benefits, especially in rural areas in developing countries, it can also have negative environmental effects, such as deforestation, landscape fragmentation, increased landslides, etc. (Amadi 1988; Warr 2010). Source: SERNANP, MTC, and INEI Protected Natural Areas and the road network in Peru. Protected areas are shown in green, and buffer zones in blue. The red lines denote national roads, while the blue lines represent departmental roads. In the background, the district limits are shown in gray.  Thus, trade-offs may therefore exist between conservation and development objectives in relation to road development, and assessment of the impact of roads on forest product extraction and stocks is needed to facilitate informed decisions in the design of conservation strategies (Charlery et al. 2016). Considering that the aim of creating PNA was to strike a balance between social welfare and environmental and natural-resource conservation (Díaz and Miranda 2012), the literature finds that public policies seeking to promote economic development (such as agricultural and livestock extension programs) clash with the intended objectives of protected areas, in that the divergence between private actors’ incentives and forest conservation is not considered. In other words, the private value that citizens attribute to a forest that they wish to protect, for instance, does not generally reflect its social value (Pfaff and Robalino 2012). Many authors have examined the impact that protected areas have on local communities in terms of deforestation and poverty (Burgess et al. 2012; Olivera et al. 2007), or the effects of road construction on deforestation (Pfaff et al. 2007) but up to our knowledge few works have analyzed the role played by road construction viz-a-viz the policy objective of PNA to mitigate the problem of deforestation. In this paper, firstly, we contribute to the literature by studying this relation, quantifying the effectiveness of PNA on deforestation together with the expansion of road infrastructure using a difference in difference model with two treatments over a panel database, as it exploits the variability of an intervention implemented differently over time. Secondly, this research can be useful for challenge people who plan, build, and maintain roads to reconcile the improvement of transportation infrastructure with the need to avoid serious damage to natural habitats and biodiversity. And, thirdly, since the mitigation of natural habitat loss risks due to impacts of road projects on biodiversity requires effective inter-agency collaboration between the entities responsible for roads and protected areas, this study provides some magnitudes of interests for making decisions (Ledec and Posas 2003). Our findings suggest that the expansion of the road network over the last decade has had an impact, increasing the rate of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon. However, the increase in protected areas has partially neutralized this effect. On average, the approach of roads to within 10 km of the forests has been associated with reductions in forest coverage of around 7.1 km per 400 km2. Despite this, the simultaneous creation of protected areas has led to a reduction in the deforestation rate by 6.5 km2 per 400 km2. It seems that even when the “deforesting” effect of the roads, the protected areas fulfill their protective role. The rest of the paper continues as follows. Section 2 reviews some of the empirical literature. Section 3 provides an overview of the PNA creation and the road expansion processes in Peru; and Sect. 4, their transmission effects. Section 5 describes the data and develops the empirical model. Section 5 contains our estimation results. Section 6 concludes the paper.",3
23.0,4.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,15 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-021-00305-x,"Interactions among macroeconomic policies, the energy market and environmental quality",October 2021,Ivan Hajdukovic,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economic activities affect the environment in several ways. Common effects like increased pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, depletion of natural resources and contribution to global climate change have been recognized as the greatest negative externalities of today's global economy. Many scientific studies have been argued that climate change may in turn negatively affect economic growth and output levels (e.g., Dell et al. 2009, 2012). Renewable and non-renewable energy resources are major inputs for agricultural and industrial production, meaning that their availability will directly affect future production capabilities and economic activities. The energy sector is a particularly interesting case study since it represents by far the largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (International Energy Agency 2009). Despite improvements in some countries, the level of global emissions emanating from the energy sector has little changed over the past decades (International Energy Agency 2017). The potential very serious detrimental effects of climate change have involved a large part of the literature to study not only the effects of climate change, but also the ways in which to mitigate these effects. Macroeconomic policies are usually used for the purpose of stabilizing economic activity and maintain price stability. In response to the global financial crisis, many governments have employed relieving fiscal and monetary policies to support the recovery of their economy, subsequently affecting economic aggregates and global welfare. Nevertheless, the impact of such policies on the energy market and environmental quality is still relatively uncertain. In this context, this paper analyses the interactions among macroeconomic policies, the energy market and environmental quality. Theoretical modelling of the relationships between macroeconomic policies, economic growth and environmental quality is still underdeveloped. However, empirical analysis can help achieve a better understanding of the complex links between them and provide a solid basis for theoretical and empirical approaches. The vector autoregressive (VAR) methodology has become the main econometric tool used to analyse the influence of macroeconomic policies on the environment. This methodology has the advantage of being suitable when the variables of interest are endogenous, which is typically the case with environmental variables. Research on the influence of fiscal and monetary policies on the energy market and environmental quality has been mainly conducted for the United States (e.g., Halkos and Paizanos 2016; Ziaei 2018). Nevertheless, very few studies have investigated the effects of macroeconomic policies in Europe. Lopez and Palacios (2014) contribute to this literature by evaluating the impact of fiscal policy on environmental quality in European countries. On the other hand, Matikainen et al. (2017) analyse the impact of the Bank of England’s and European Central Bank’s monetary policy on the environment. The link between economic growth and environmental quality is one of the most controversial in the environmental economics literature. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis predicts that economic growth initially leads to a deterioration of environmental quality, followed by an improvement of environmental quality once the economy has reached a certain level. Depending on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth and according to the shape of the environmental Kuznets curve, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies may lead to greater use of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions in some levels of the gross domestic product. Moreover, the potential impact of macroeconomic policies on the quality of the environment can generate interactions between macroeconomic and environmental policies. As a result, this implies the need to explore how fiscal and monetary policies can affect the quality of the environment along the business cycle and the specific role of energy markets as transmission channels. A body of literature has examined the link between macroeconomic policies and the energy market (e.g., Anzuini et al. 2012; Hammoudeh et al. 2015; Ziaei 2018). Monetary policy can affect the demand for energy through different channels including supply, demand, exchange rate, portfolio balance and signaling (Ziaei 2018). For instance, an expansionary policy can lead to economic growth, which would increase the demand for goods and services in different markets, including the energy market (Ziaei 2018). A question that arises when evaluating the effects of monetary policy in the energy market is the reaction of prices, which directly affects the demand for energy. There have been some studies dealing with the effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on energy prices, especially oil prices (e.g., Anzuini et al. 2012; Rosa 2014) and other commodity prices (e.g., Anzuini et al. 2012; Hammoudeh et al. 2015). Turning on the role of fiscal policy, government incentives can help generate revenue for environmental purpose, promote low-carbon activities and encourage green investment by pricing environmental externalities (Kosonen and Nicodème 2009). However, to the best of our knowledge, the links between the energy market and government spending components, including government consumption and public investment, have not been explored yet. Economic theory predicts that if an expansionary fiscal policy is associated with an increase in output, the demand for energy and the price would increase. Nevertheless, we believe that the interactions between government spending components and the energy market need an empirical assessment. Several studies have suggested that fiscal policy may be a determinant of environmental quality (e.g., Lopez et al. 2011; Halkos and Paizanos 2013, 2016; Lopez and Palacios 2014). Environmental quality is usually proxied by greenhouse gas or carbon dioxide emissions. The relationship between fiscal policy and environmental quality depends critically on the type of government spending. For instance, if spending is largely used for improvements in renewable energy, then increases in government consumption and public investment could be associated with lower emissions. In contrast, we would expect the opposite relationship if spending is targeted towards non-renewable energy. Fiscal policy measures have been predominantly implemented to moderate climate change issues (e.g., Kosonen and Nicodème 2009). However, Matikainen et al. (2017) and Economides and Xepapadeas (2018) recently showed that monetary policy and central banks may also have to play an important role in the fight against climate change. Therefore, although environmental considerations are not the main concerns of macroeconomic policies, it is essential to consider their potential effect on environmental quality.   Fiscal instruments like spending and taxes have usually been considered sufficient to counteract the negative externalities generated by economic activity (Kosonen and Nicodème 2009). It has been commonly admitted that since the central banks’ main objectives of inflation and output stabilization are primarily short term, their influence on a long-term process such as climate change is relatively weak (Economides and Xepapadeas 2018). However, the very probable impact of climate change on the financial market, economic growth and future output levels might require more involvement of monetary policy (Matikainen et al. 2017; Dafermos et al. 2018; Economides and Xepapadeas 2018). Therefore, central banks may also be required to support climate change policies, which would imply the need to address long-term and short-term issues. Moreover, the potential impact of climate change related fiscal policy measures on prices can generate interactions between fiscal and monetary policies (Economides and Xepapadeas 2018). This implies the necessity of considering them together for the analysis of their influence on environmental quality. From a different perspective, Matikainen et al. (2017) suggest that the environmental impact of the central bank's unconventional monetary policy depends on government commitment to support low-carbon activities through direct spending. For instance, purchasing sovereign green bonds or corporate bonds from renewable energy issuers could support environmental sustainability. In contrast, if central bank's reserve asset purchases are skewed towards high-carbon sectors, then environmental quality could deteriorate. As a result, monetary policy may not be energy-neutral.  This paper provides an empirical examination on the interactions among macroeconomic policies, the energy market and environmental quality. These interactions and channels among them are studied through structural VAR models.Footnote 1 Due to the lack of data availability, we consider aggregate levels of government spending components and central bank’s reserve asset purchases, being this a clear limitation of our analysis that, however, in our view does not invalidate the interest of this approach. The motivation to focus on the energy market is based on the importance of energy use for economic activities and its substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. We use quarterly and monthly data from two non-EMU countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, over the period 1990–2016. This study sheds light on the implications of fiscal and monetary policies on the environmental sustainability for European countries that have adopted a flexible exchange rate regime. The analysis of these specific countries is relevant in the context of environmental issues. Switzerland, as an Alpine country, is particularly affected by global warming (Beniston 2012). On the other hand, the United Kingdom is a coastal country and is seriously threatened by rising sea levels due to the global climate change (de la Vega-Leinert and Nicholls 2008). Switzerland relies heavily on imports to cover its energy needs (Admin 2019), while the United Kingdom was a large producer of oil and natural gas before becoming a net importer of energy in 2004 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2011). Moreover, these two countries represent unique case studies on the effects of unconventional monetary policy on the environment, as they were the only non-EMU countries to implement quantitative easing in response to the global financial crisis. The study of Switzerland and the United Kingdom is particularly interesting given their pursuing important efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These two countries embarked on an energy transition to lower their reliance on fossil fuels and stimulate the use of clean energy. Public sector support and specific incentives such as feed-in tariffs and a variety of subsidies have contributed to the development of their renewable energy markets (Admin 2019; International Energy Agency 2019). From 2005 to 2015, the share of renewable energy consumption over total final consumption has increased from 19.3 to 25.3 percent in Switzerland and from 1.4 to 8.71 percent in the United Kingdom (The World Bank 2019). Energy efficiency improvements and the spread of renewable energies reduced demand for oil and natural gas, which has contributed to the decline in their emissions (International Energy Agency 2007; 2019). The main factor explaining their good environmental performance compared to other European countries is access to a wide range of environmental technologies. They are among the most innovative countries with high spending on research and development (R&D) (Admin 2019; Office for National Statistics 2020). Switzerland was one of the first countries to adopt strong environmental laws, which in turn contributed to the development of environmental technologies much earlier than in other countries (International Energy Agency 2007). The United Kingdom puts energy innovation at the center of its decarbonization policy (International Energy Agency 2019). This paper examines for the first time how the implementation of macroeconomic policies, that aim to stimulate the economy, may also affect the quality of the environment along the business cycle and the specific role of energy markets as transmission channels. Our structural VAR models capture the supply and demand factors of energy markets, which enables us to examine the impact of fiscal and monetary policies on environmental quality that occurs through these two channels. We believe that future research should differentiate between the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on renewable and non-renewable energy since each of them has different economic and environmental implications. On the one hand, the paper evaluates the implications of macroeconomic policies on the price of non-renewable energy and the use of both renewable and non-renewable energy. On the other hand, the study assesses the influence of fiscal policy components, conventional and unconventional monetary policies on greenhouse gas emissions generated by the energy sector. We aim to provide some policy recommendations that can help support the achievement of environmental sustainability.  To the best of our knowledge, there is no theoretical model analysing the underpinnings of the relationship between macroeconomic policies, economic growth and environmental quality. This makes empirical modelling particularly challenging and interesting from the perspective of setting the ground for theoretical and empirical approaches to this issue. We propose two distinct VAR models based on a macroeconomic framework including the energy market. Using the recursive approach,Footnote 2 we identify four policy shocks (i) government consumption (ii) public investment (iii) the official bank policy rate (iv) the central bank’s reserve assets. The baseline model for the cases of fiscal and conventional monetary policy is estimated using quarterly data on the government spending component, the output, the consumer price index, the non-renewable energy price index, the official bank policy rate, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. For the case of conventional monetary policy, the empirical analysis is carried-out for the pre-2009 period. The baseline model for the case of unconventional monetary policy covers the post-2009 period and is estimated using monthly data on the industrial production index, the consumer price index, the non-renewable energy price index, the central bank’s reserve assets, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The government spending component rotates between government consumption and public investment. Energy consumption is decomposed into its renewable and non-renewable forms. The effects of policy shocks are assessed by the impulse response functions and the variance decomposition. The analysis reveals that fiscal and monetary policies have a significant influence on the energy market and environmental quality. Fiscal policy can contribute to achieving non-renewable energy conservation and enhancing environmental quality. Besides, the examination of monetary policy reveals that central banks should investigate the impact of their interventions on environmental quality through the renewable and non-renewable energy markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the interactions and channels among macroeconomic policies, economic growth, the energy market and environmental quality. Section 3 presents the econometric methodology. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 provides the results. Finally, Sect. 6 contains concluding remarks and policy implications.",3

24.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,19 December 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-020-00296-1,"Household electricity demand, the intrinsic flexibility index and UK wholesale electricity market prices",January 2022,Jacopo Torriti,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Peaks in electricity demand bring about significantly negative environmental and economic impacts. This is because if a vast number of users is consuming electricity at the same time, suppliers have to activate power plants with higher greenhouse gas emissions and higher system costs. In Europe, the residential sector is responsible for about one third of overall electricity demand and up to 60% of peak demand (Barton et al. 2013). During peak demand, electricity prices in wholesale markets can experience fluctuations with peak prices up to nine times higher than off-peak prices (Torriti 2015). In a decarbonised future, peaks are likely to remain an issue, where capacity margins are slim particularly in seasons with issues, where the problem is exacerbated by weather (e.g., winter in the UK and summer in parts of the USA). However, even more frequent issues of demand and supply balancing are likely to occur on a daily basis due to the high penetration of intermittent renewable sources, on the one hand, and increasing implementation of electric heating and transport, on the other hand. The need to change demand on a relatively short notice is becoming known in the energy demand literature as the ‘flexibility problem’, which reflects the fact that flexibility of demand can be defined in different ways (Grunewald and Diakonova 2018). To understand, where flexibility may originate from, a fundamental step consists of examining the timing of energy demand and whether there is intrinsic flexibility in what people do. A subsequent step is to understand if time when consumers may offer flexibility overlap with system needs, i.e., times of the day when electricity spot prices are higher due to higher costs of generation and high demand. The ambition of this paper is to provide an innovative approach to measuring flexibility which combines system needs—signalled through wholesale pricing—and intrinsic flexibility in the rhythms of everyday life. Showing at high time granularity how the intrinsic flexibility index correlates with electricity prices is critical, because the time slots when electricity prices are high correspond to time slots when the electricity demand is high. When the intrinsic flexibility index correlates with the price of electricity, demand-side interventions are more likely to flex demand. Conversely, at times when there is no correlation and, for instance, the wholesale price is high, whereas the intrinsic flexibility index is low, the system’s need to flex is high (to reduce prices), but interventions are less likely to be successful at flexing demand. This paper presents an analysis of the 2014–2015 Office for National Statistics National Time Use Survey with a view to derive an intrinsic flexibility index (i.e., the ability to modify routines and practices associated with household energy demand) based on: how synchronised activities are within the family and with the rest of the country; how many activities requiring electricity we share with others; and how fragmented days are in terms of number and duration of electricity-related activities. The dual aim of this paper is to apply the intrinsic flexibility index and to analyse the extent to which the intrinsic flexibility index is correlated with spot prices in the UK wholesale electricity market. The first aim addresses an important gap in research on flexibility of electricity demand. The literature points to the importance of flexibility on the one hand (Carbon Trust and Imperial College 2016) and the central role of people’s practices in providing flexibility on the other hand (Blue et al. 2020). Introducing and implementing an intrinsic flexibility index is an attempt to quantitatively synthesise what we know about practice ordering for the purposes of demand flexibility. The second aim is more operational and can be framed as an exemplification of the flexibility index to understand how its implementation relates to electricity price variations. This is with a view to explore the potential synchronous and a-synchronous characteristics of available flexibility combined with price fluctuations in the spot market. The results of this paper are likely to contribute to work on demand-side flexibility. After this introduction, the paper briefly reviews key concepts around price elasticity and flexibility (Sect. 2); describes the methodology and data (Sect. 3); presents findings on the intrinsic flexibility index estimates and on the analysis of settlement prices and intrinsic flexibility index discusses the potential applications of the intrinsic flexibility index (Sect. 4); and concludes (Sect. 5).",1

Particularly, households can lower their energy consumption by replacing old appliances with new energy-efficient models. In line with this, governments have been promoting appliance replacement for many years to reduce residential energy consumption. For example, they have introduced labeling programs that enable households to make product choices more easily based on the energy-efficiency information of appliances. For instance, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first introduced the Energy Star program in 1992 to help households easily recognize energy-efficient products through Energy Star labels (USEPA 2020). Following the implementation of Energy Star labels in the US, the Japanese government introduced the Energy Saving Labeling program in 1995, which enables consumers to examine the energy efficiency of products through green/orange marks. To further enhance the program’s function, the Japanese government introduced the Unified Energy Saving Labeling Program in 2006. Under this new labeling program, retailers need to indicate products’ energy efficiency by the number of stars and report the estimated annual electricity bill. Therefore, consumers require less cognitive skills to identify the energy efficiency of products than before (Wang and Matsumoto 2020). In recent years, some governments provided households with subsidies and a stronger appliance replacement incentive. However, the effects of such subsidy policies raised concerns. For example, the US Department of Energy developed the State Energy-Efficient Appliance Rebate Program to support residential consumers in purchasing energy-efficient appliances (Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 2015). Although this program spent approximately $300 million between 2009 and 2015, Houde and Aldy (2017) found that consumers upgraded their old appliances with higher quality but less energy-efficient models. Similarly, the Japanese government implemented a rebate program, the so-called eco-point program (EPP), between 2009 and 2011. The EPP provided subsidies to households who purchased refrigerators (REFs), air conditioners (ACs), and digital televisions (TVs) that are labeled with more than four stars under the Unified Energy Saving Labeling Program (Ministry of the Environment 2009). As the cessation of analog broadcasting was scheduled in 2011, the government promoted the replacement of old analog TVs with new digital TVs through the EPP. However, Yamaguchi et al. (2016) reported that the EPP expanded the market share of energy-efficient TV models but incentivized consumers to purchase TVs with large screen size. Their finding suggests that households will not replace an old appliance with a new model only for energy-efficiency purpose. In addition, previous studies about eco-subsidy programs reported that the effect of such programs is limited, that is, only certain types of households replaced old appliances with new energy-efficient models (Wang and Matsumoto 2019; Nakano and Washizu 2017). Wang and Matsumoto (2019) examined the impact of subsidy programs on the selection of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). They applied the multinomial model to identify the types of households that switched from conventional gasoline vehicles to HEVs. The estimated results demonstrate that certain types of households, for example, high-income households, small-sized households, switched to HEVs during the subsidy programs. In other words, their findings imply that other households continue to use their old appliances, regardless of the substantial amount of subsidy available. One of the reasons why households continue to use old appliances can be considered as the existence of status quo bias (Blasch and Daminato 2018; Schleich et al 2016). Blasch and Daminato (2018) examined how status quo bias affects the replacement of old appliances; they found that the degree of status quo bias is intimately associated with household socioeconomic characteristics, such as age, income, and household type. If the pattern of appliance use varies between households, then we expect that the appliance replacement cycle also varies between households. Large-sized households replace washing machines more rapidly because they frequently wash large bulk of clothes at once. In contrast, young people replace their smartphones more frequently as they intend to do more tasks with it. Although certain households may replace appliances for energy conservation, other households may pay less attention to appliances’ energy efficiency and continue to use their old appliances until totally depreciated. Many studies identified early adopters of new energy-efficient products (Campbell et al. 2012; van Rijnsoever et al. 2009), as well as the role of psychological biases on replacement of appliances (Schleich et al. 2019). However, to the best of our knowledge, only Fernandez (2000, 2001) has identified the relationship between households’ socioeconomic characteristics and product replacement from the aspect of appliance’s survival probabilities. Given that certain households do not replace appliances despite the evident benefits, the relationship between households’ socioeconomic characteristics and appliance replacement cycle needs to be determined for residential energy conservation. In this study, we first develop an economic model to describe the survival probabilities of appliance and evaluate the impact of households’ socioeconomic characteristics on home appliance replacement. Fernandez (2000, 2001) studied Americans’ replacement habits of electric space heaters and central air conditioners for the empirical analyses. In contrast, we targeted REFs in this study. We believe REFs are much more suitable for the study of appliance replacement than heaters and ACs. Although the usage of heaters and ACs vary considerably between households, it is often difficult to know it.Footnote 1 In the empirical section, we use microlevel data from the 2016 Survey on Carbon Dioxide Emission from Households (Ministry of the Environment 2016). Survey respondents in SCDEH 2016 were asked about the age of their REFs and their socioeconomic characteristics. Based on the information about the age distribution of REFs, we examine how family size, age of household’s head, and household income affect the replacement cycle of REFs. Our empirical results reveal that (1) large-sized, (2) high-income, and (3) young households replace REFs more rapidly. The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we propose an economic model of home appliance replacement. We assume a maximum product useful life and derive the age distribution of appliance in the steady state. We show how households’ socioeconomic characteristics are associated with appliances’ survival probability and age distribution. Then we apply the model to microlevel data analysis based on SCDEH 2016. In Sects. 3 and 4, we summarize the data and specify the empirical model, respectively. In Sect. 5, we report the empirical findings. Lastly, in Sect. 6, we provide policy recommendations and the conclusion.",5

In particular, feed-in tariffs (FITs) are a major policy instrument used to diffuse renewable energy sources in developed countries such as Japan, European countries and Australia (for example, see Hortay and Rozner 2019). The application of FITs for the diffusion of renewable energy is particularly relevant to solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. A FIT scheme can decrease the share of fossil fuel in electricity generation, thereby lowering CO2 emissions. Therefore, FITs are one of the important policy instruments available to tackle climate change. The use of FIT schemes is not confined only to developed countries. For example, China has employed a FIT scheme since 2013. In the future, the governments of developing countries will also be likely to increase the installation rate of renewable energy. In short, the potential for the use of FITs in a number of developing countries is high. Indeed, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has a published report on how to apply FITs in developing countries (UNEP 2012). Therefore, it is necessary to examine how consumer behavior changes after the rapid diffusion of FITs. To date, there have been many studies evaluating the effect of FITs (for example, see Hitaj and Löschel 2019; Ritzenhofen and Spinler 2016; Hortay and Rozner 2019). However, consumer behavior regarding electricity consumption after the installation of solar PV systems is largely unknown. Almost all studies focus on the spillover effect of FITS on renewable energy sources. A few studies have attempted to understand consumer behavior after the installation of solar PV systems. For example, Sekitou et al. (2018) found that consumers do not tend to conserve electricity after the installation of solar PV systems, although the study does not show the extent to which rebound effects on electricity consumption occur. A recent study (Qiu et al. 2019) reveals in some detail the rebound effect following installation of solar PV systems. In general, economic theory asserts that consumers’ consumption of a good is based on the changes in the marginal price of the good. However, the recent studies show that consumers respond to changes in the average price of electricity instead of the changes in the marginal price (Ito 2014). Qiu et al. (2019) construct a theoretical model based on Ito’s (2014) hypothesis to understand the rebound effect from the installation of solar PV systems. They also analyze hourly based data on electricity consumption in US households. Their study concludes that the installation of solar PV systems causes a rebound effect on electricity consumption. However, this study does not consider the FIT effect. Previous studies have not designed models that include the FIT effect even though almost all developed countries have introduced FITs. In this study, our model is based on the Qiu et al. (2019), but now incorporates the effect of FITs. In addition, we conduct empirical analysis using survey data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to confirm whether our theoretical perspective can describe actual consumer behavior. Finally, we reveal the effect of FITs on the electricity consumption of consumers. However, this study needs to consider exogenous and unobservable factors that relate to the decision making involved in the installation of solar PV systems given that such factors cause bias when we estimate the FIT effect on consumers’ electricity consumption. To overcome this problem, we apply the matching method between the samples constituting the control group (households without solar PV systems) and those constituting the treatment group (households with solar PV systems). After sample matching, we perform a robustness regression analysis to control for biases caused by exogenous and unobservable factors. Our estimation results reveal some important findings. First, the results demonstrate the FIT effect on electricity consumption. As described below, FIT schemes increase the consumption of electricity purchased from electricity companies. Therefore, our results are in line with the theoretical perspective. In addition, our results show that the effect of FIT schemes on electricity consumption is different between each state. One of the reasons we observe such results is the difference in the object of each scheme: solar PV capacity. These results can contribute to better clarifying the cost-effectiveness of FIT schemes and to gaining a better understanding of consumers’ electricity use behavior.",7
24.0,1.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,19 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-021-00311-z,Modelling household behavioural changes as an opportunity for sustainable home energy,January 2022,Norzalina Zainudin,Jasmine Leby Lau,Chandramalar Munusami,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Currently, Malaysia’s energy consumption is about 40% in buildings as compared to 32% and 28% in the industry and transport sectors, respectively. Malaysia Energy Commission (EC) claimed that Malaysia has switched to the energy efficiency lane through the introduction of its 2030 sustainable goals. It is to reduce 25% of gross electricity consumption from the building sector while pledging to reduce up to 40% of CO2 emission per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2020 (EC 2017). The increasing trend of electricity used in the household sector is due to the booming population as reported by the Malaysia Department of Statistics (DOS). Besides, the growth in the number of housing units completed in the country also showed an increase for each year (DOS 2020). Statistics also supported the recent environmental impact assessments which stated that the number of households has increased by 32% with the total residential square footage increasing by 41% from 2011 to 2015. Besides, the rising development of the residential area has also significantly contributed to the increase in the energy demand, and most consumers are not aware of how much energy is being wasted on their daily activities at home. Without energy conservation improvement, the demand for energy uses such as lighting, cooling and heating would increase at similar rates. Moreover, Malaysia Energy Information Hub (MEIH) reported that the electricity consumption in Malaysia increases year by year (EC 2019), and this increment in electricity usage is attributed mainly from the increased use of electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, washing machines, televisions and other common electrical appliances (EC 2017). Hence, household energy demand has become one of the most crucial factors in shaping the management of development towards sustainability and energy security (Camara et al. 2018). Energy efficiency improvement at the demand-side is a crucial part of the energy sector development as the demand dictates the energy supply and fuel consumption. Thus, improving energy efficiency does not only result in the reduction of CO2 emission but also gives consumers more values on cost saving in the long run (Pelenur 2018). Realising the benefits and cost above, the government of Malaysia has put enormous efforts into promoting energy efficiency in the country. The government has enacted a number of legal instruments to promote the efficient use of electricity in Malaysia. The latest regulatory instrument in promoting energy efficiency is the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) in 2013. This regulation has been amended to allow the implementation of Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) on selected electrical appliances and lighting in which electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions, fans, and lamps that enter the Malaysian market must meet the minimum energy performance standards as prescribed under the new regulation. Information related to MEPS of those products must be made available to consumers using energy rating labelling (EC 2017) except for lamps as it is mandatory for all MEPS equipment to be affixed with an energy rating label that indicates the energy efficiency as tested (Salleh et al. 2019). Malaysia has also introduced the National Energy Efficiency Policy and Action Plan (NEEAP) in January 2016 which is a 10-year action plan that aims to achieve overall electricity savings of 52,233 GWh by 2025 (KeTTHA 2015). Additionally, NEEAP has introduced three programmes designed to further support MEPS, namely the 5-star refrigerator campaign, EE lighting campaign and 5-star air-conditioner campaign. Incentive programme such as Sustainability Achieved via Energy Efficiency Program (SAVE) has also helped to create market penetration for energy-efficient products in 2011. Currently, the government of Malaysia has made an announcement about SAVE 2.0 in its 2021 budget that provides an online rebate (e-rebate) of MYR200 for the purchase of energy-efficient air-conditioners or refrigerators, which is expected to benefit 140,000 households. However, lessons from past experiences have given an understanding of the main challenges that impeded the success of previous energy efficiency improvement efforts in Malaysia. From a macro perspective, it can be categorised as low energy prices, lack of finance and an overall national plan for energy efficiency, lack of champion to drive energy efficiency and lack of consistency in embarking on energy efficiency (Abd Rahman et al. 2019; KeTTHA 2015). At the micro level, the effectiveness of the energy saving and efficiency programmes launched by the government in the short term presents challenges without any individuals’ behavioural changes. This is because households are run by individuals, thus, they are not obligated to take particular actions through regulatory such as industrial and commercial sectors (EC 2017). Therefore, it is difficult to control the usage of household energy without raising the awareness and positive behavioural changes on the significance of energy use in the residential sector without having the household sector playing a key role in these attempts. Studies show that significant energy saving has been less than successful in the household sector because of the challenges to change consumers’ behaviour or lifestyle (Pelenur 2018). Many studies have examined effective interventions to encourage household energy-saving behaviour such as information provision, public campaigns, goal setting, feedback and reward (Mizobuchi and Takeuchi 2013; Simanaviciene et al. 2015) as well as households’ energy efficiency that has become a major focus to the government, marketers and academicians. To date, a number of studies have been conducted to provide further insights into energy efficiency efforts (Abd Rahman et al. 2019; Vasseur and Marique 2019) which focus on the adoption of energy-efficient (EE) products (Pelenur 2018; Pelenur and Cruickshank 2014) and MEPS programme (Salleh et al. 2019), and calls for further research in the same area are common. Hence, this paper responds to such calls and contributes to existing literature using evidence from Malaysian households as there is still a long journey ahead for Malaysia to become an energy-efficient nation. As claimed by NST (2020), Malaysia needs an overarching green policy framework that cuts across ministries, sectors and industries to address the existing unsustainable practices that are threatening the planet and human health on an unprecedented scale. Understanding the factors and the mechanisms responsible for consumers’ purchase intention allows providers to tailor targeted interventions (Pelenur and Cruickshank 2012) and help energy providers and practitioners to improve their approach (Bornemann et al. 2018). An example of a prevalence research area is assessing consumers’ purchase intention focusing on specific EE products (Salleh et al. 2019) as well as a few other factors such as awareness and knowledge (Rahman et al. 2016) and perceived benefits (Akroush et al. 2019). In this paper, we aim to explore and closely examine household behaviour in the adoption of EE appliances at home. To learn about policies that can effectively and efficiently reduce household energy consumption, various factors and insights need to be integrated. Hence, a careful analysis is required for the various factors that influence household behaviour. Excluding crucial factors will only lead to biases in the assessment of a particular factor that may contribute towards household behaviour. Thus, this paper is designed to have a better understanding of what motivates consumers’ intention to buy EE products. Our contribution to the existing literature is multi-fold. First, we empirically explore factors that significantly contribute towards consumers’ purchase intention by focusing on five EE products with MEPS in Malaysia. The novelty of the present study is to introduce an attitude toward EE products as a mediator. Previous studies have analyzed the direct relationship between individual product evaluations (independent variables) and adaptation (dependent variable). In this study, we assume an attitude toward a product (mediator) is characterized by individual product evaluation (independent variables) and the product adaptation (dependent variable) is determined by the attitude (mediator). Therefore, we propose a new structure model for the analysis of EE product adaptation. This is because the intention to buy EE products is often identified by studying the mechanism by which intervention achieves its effect. In other words, investigating mediation processes clarify how the intervention achieves the outcome of the study. Besides that, it further develops our understanding of the consumers’ behaviours, mechanisms of marketing as well as the programmes needed. Furthermore, we may also be able to identify more efficient alternatives and intervention strategies through mediation analysis and gain insight into the mechanism or action of behavioural intention. Such information will provide an added dimension to understand consumers’ intention and behaviour which can stimulate the identification of more efficacious and cost-efficient alternative approach. With the energy-efficient products and programme improvement, this study will be relevant to policymakers and industry players to focus on improving the products and consumers’ attitudes to increase market penetration for EE products. This paper is organised into six sections. The next section provides a brief discussion on the theoretical background and discussion of the methodology. The results of the empirical analysis are presented and discussed in the fourth and fifth section while the conclusion and implications are discussed in the final section.",4

While many global leaders dither, global warming continues with predicted increases between 3 and 5 °C unless significant measures are taken (IPCC 2018). Without meaningful policy action, the long run effects of climate may be catastrophic for many regions. Since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, regularly held meetings have provided a venue to assess progress toward climate change mitigation. In 1997, 192 countries agreed to gradually combat climate change by signing the Kyoto Protocol. More recently, in 2015, 196 countries signed the Paris Agreement to address global warming with respect to the mitigation, adaption and financing required to limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5 °C by the end of this century (Sutter and Berlinger 2015). From the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 to the Paris Agreement in 2015, policy initiatives have neither been sufficiently comprehensive nor prevalent enough to slow climate change at a global level. This research examines the effect of environmental policy on short run and long run economic growth of OECD countries. Although numerous studies have investigated the impact of individual environmental policies on economic growth within countries, the number of studies examining the effect of environmental policies on economic indicators across countries is more limited (Bhattacharya et al. 2016; Halkos and Psarianos 2016; Rubashkina et al. 2015; Albrizio et al. 2014). Several studies estimate economic growth models with mixed findings about the impact of policies to limit CO2 emissions on economic growth (Soytas and Sari 2009; Ricci 2007), thus fueling a general perception among cautious policymakers that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be detrimental to economic growth. Such findings have led most countries on a recent trajectory toward minimal or no efforts to reduce their emissions (Nordhaus 2018). There exists evidence to suggest that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be detrimental to GDP growth and employment in the short run (Liu et al. 2018; Maji 2015; Weyant 1993), given such reductions often involve capital costs. However, it may be the case that environmental policy pays dividends in the long run, in the form of economic growth. Sweden, for instance, the first country to implement a carbon tax system in 1991, and now with the world’s highest carbon tax has seen their GDP growth outpace the European average (Frank 2018; World Bank 2016). In line with the Porter hypothesis (Porter 1991; Porter and van der Linde 1995), these results and others (Lu et al. 2010) suggest that firms tend to find alternative production methods by changing or substituting technology thereby reducing CO2 emissions without sacrificing GDP and employment in the long run. This research estimates the short and long run effects of environment control policy on the economic growth of OECD nations. The analysis in this study is grounded in the augmented Solow Model (Solow 1956) with the inclusion of a measurement for policy stringency. Panel data variables include the environmental policy stringency index (OECD 2018) and other non-stationary macroeconomic control variables which are analysed with cointegration and error-correction models using the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) and Dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimators for OECD countries from 1990 to 2014. Pooled OLS, Dynamic OLS and fixed effects estimators are applied to check the robustness of the short run and long run results derived from the PMG. The results suggest that although pro-environmental policy adversely affects economic growth in the short run, it pays dividends in the long run. Overall, the countries with more stringent environmental policies benefit from higher economic growth in the long run. A threshold analysis reveals that countries implementing environmental policy above an empirically determined threshold level tend to benefit from positive economic growth in the long run while the others suffer from both short and long run negative growth. Additional analysis reveals that stakeholders in the countries with more stringent environmental policies tend to change their behavior as evidenced by lower energy–GDP, CO2–energy and CO2–GDP ratios compared to the countries with less stringent environmental policies. The main contributions of this research include support for the Porter hypothesis and a strong argument for more stringent environmental policy to incentivize economic agents to use energy more efficiently and to increase renewable energy use, thereby contributing to GDP growth in the long run. Conversely, the results imply that relatively weak environmental policy fails to sufficiently incentivize stakeholders and only leads to costs in both the short and long run. Another significant contribution of this paper is consideration of the impact of policy in the short and long run, undertaken in few other papers. The findings will be of interest to policy makers who strive to pursue green initiatives without sacrificing economic growth. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the relevant literature, followed by Sect. 3, which explains the theoretical background of the empirical model. In Sect. 4, the data, variables and methods of analysis are described, followed by the results and discussion of the findings in Sect. 5, and concluding remarks in Sect. 6.",5

A case in point is Volkswagen’s emissions scandal. Elson et al. (2015) show how Volkswagen’s corporate governance and organizational structure led to management practices which were non-compliant with environmental regulation, despite the corporation stating well-defined and transparent environmental targets. This case illustrates that the “compliance function” (Miller 2018) within Volkswagen did not operate effectively within the firm as an internal control mechanism. With the potential for conflicting organizational objectives around profitability and environmental performance, there is renewed interest in corporate behaviour towards regulatory compliance and the legal implications for managers and the corporation of environmental non-compliance (Langevoort 2018). The Volkswagen scandal demonstrates that production and environmental decisions are not necessarily aligned to one another. Empirical studies analysing the relationship between corporate governance structures and environmental performance have, however, revealed a more positive relationship. For instance, Berrone and Gomez-Mejia (2009) find that financial rewards to senior managers are positively related to corporate environmental performance. The authors contend that effective environmental governance structures support and reinforce this linkage. Martin et al. (2012) report a case study showing that climate-oriented management practices are more likely to be adopted by corporations where decisions are taken by a designated environmental (or energy) manager. Pro-environmental management practices, in turn, tend to positively affect energy efficiency and productivity, which is conducive to meeting environmental objectives and to (potentially) avoiding regulatory non-compliance. Walls et al. (2012) show that the interdependency between environmental performance and a corporation’s organizational structure is multi-dimensional, and identify the need for additional theoretical work to analyse some of the core dependencies. This is what our paper intends to do. In particular, we contribute to the literature by taking an economic-organizational design perspective. The focus of our paper is on how to govern and organise production and environment-related decisions at the corporate level in a context of environmental liability. Through such a lens, the specific question that arises is how to allocate environmental liability within the boundaries of a corporation to maximize expected profit. We address this question by examining the interlinkage between environmental liability and a corporation’s organizational structure. To investigate this interdependency, we employ a multi-task principal-agent (MTPA) framework, which serves as a natural way to study the interaction between incentives and behaviour at the corporate and managerial levels. We adopt and modify the model developed by Besanko et al. (2005), which distinguishes between a product-based organization (PBO) and a functional-based organization (FBO). A FBO consists of functional divisions, such as production, research and development, marketing, finance, human resources, and environmental protection, each division covering all products. A PBO is organized into product lines, where each product manager is in charge of all functional areas for the product under her control. In what follows, we assume that a FBO has a two-divisional structure: one division responsible for the productionFootnote 1 of all final goods produced by the firm and another division responsible for environmental protection of all products. Both divisions, however, affect the level of gross profits and the level of environmental damage. We show that the choice of organizational structure has implications for the allocation of liability between individual managers and the corporation. For risk-averse managers, our first result shows that the allocation of liability between the firm and manager does not matter for efficiency in a PBO. This neutrality result for the allocation of liability in a PBO is an extension of the neutrality propositions by Kornhauser (1982) and Sykes (1984). This result is also in line with Coase’s (1960) theorem, in the sense that in a world without transaction costs the initial allocation of property rights does not affect efficiency. Arlen and MacLeod (2005) have confirmed this in an applied analysis of care organizations. Our second result indicates that the neutrality proposition does not necessarily hold in a FBO, implying that the allocation of liability does matter for a FBO. More specifically, in case of a FBO it is optimal either to hold the firm liable for environmental damages or to make the environmental function manager entirely liable. The relevant literature in the environmental domain using a MTPA framework goes back to Gabel and Sinclair-Desgagné (1993), who analyze the effect of monetary incentives on environmental risk-reducing activities within corporations. The emphasis of their analysis is twofold. First, they explicitly take into account that there are objective upper bounds to the amount of effort that can be undertaken by an individual agent. Second, they analyze how the accuracy of technology, used to measure effort, affects the optimal incentive schemes. We extend Gabel and Sinclair-Desgagné (1993) in two ways. First, we analyze the effects of environmental penalties on the organizational structure. Second, instead of incorporating the incentives exogenously into the model, we endogenously determine the incentives for environmental protection from the corporation’s profit-maximizing behaviour and assess how these incentives affect its functioning through the organizational structure. Sinclair-Desgagné and Gabel (1997) employ a principal-agent model to analyse the use of internal audits as a way to incentivize the management of environmental resources within the corporate hierarchy. A related strand of literature that use MTPA models assesses the relative efficiency of different penalty schemes, including whether corporations or individual managers should be held liable to civil or criminal charges. Seminal contributions in this tradition (see Kraakman 2000) are Kornhauser (1982) and Sykes (1984, 1988), whereas Segerson and Tietenberg (1992) offer a first application to the specific problem of environmental enforcement. MTPA has also been applied to job design issues (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991) and to the study of incentives and allocation for teaching and research in universities (Gautier and Wauthy 2007). Corts (2006) offers a more fundamental study examining the interplay between tasks and asset ownership. Further, the literature on vicarious liability (Kornhauser 1982) traditionally compares the efficiency of imposing civil liability on the principal (here the firm) rather than on the agent (here the manager). Segerson and Tietenberg (1992) also consider the possibility of criminal sanctions imposed on managers, but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper. To foster transparency and clarity throughout the analysis, we concentrate here solely on the incentive structure and exclude the option of criminal sanctions.",1
24.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,19 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-021-00319-5,Decomposition of air pollution emissions from Swedish manufacturing,April 2022,Polina Ustyuzhanina,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Emissions of air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (\(\hbox {SO}_2\)), nitrogen oxides (\(\hbox {NO}_\text {x}\)), non-methane volatile compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (\(\hbox {PM}_{{10}}\)) from manufacturing have fallen steeply in North America and Western and Northern Europe over recent decades (Levinson 2009; Brunel 2017; Shapiro and Walker 2018; Najjar and Cherniwchan 2020). As our lives are directly affected by the air we breathe—pollution has serious negative effects on both human health and productivity and labour supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2013; WHO 2018)—understanding the sources of the abatement is crucial to ensure that a pollution decline would continue in a sustainable way. While the sources of the abatement might be due to trade liberalization or increasing demand for cleaner goods, there is a wealth of evidence that the primary driver of these emission reductions in industrialised economies has been technique effects, i.e. production processes have become cleaner, which overwhelms the positive scale effect of increasing overall economic activity. However, there is much less clarity about the role of the composition effect, i.e. the effect of changes in the range of goods produced. Hitherto, evidence on composition effects has been mixed and inconclusive. For environmental policy targeting such ambitious goals as 50% share of renewable energy sources in inland energy consumption by 2020, 50% decrease in energy intensity by 2030 compared to the year 2005, or zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045Footnote 1, it is important to be aware of the strengths of both composition and technique effects and the underlying mechanisms. For instance, research subsidies leading to energy-efficiency improvements and lower emissions may lower prices of energy-intensive goods, which risks leading to a countervailing composition effect. The goal of this study is to examine the main drivers of a decline in air pollution emissions from Swedish manufacturing between the years 2007 and 2017. For this, I use detailed data on manufacturing emissions to air and decompose them into three mechanisms: scale, composition, and technique effects. Taking Grossman and Krueger (1993) and Copeland and Taylor (1994) as the starting point and following the decomposition approach as in Levinson (2009, 2015), I create an index of emissions intensities for \(\hbox {SO}_2\), \(\hbox {NO}_\text {x}\), VOCs and \(\hbox {PM}_{{10}}\)—analogous to a Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes—to explore the contribution of these three effects to the emission reductions in Swedish manufacturing during the period 2007–2017. The focus on manufacturing is due to several reasons. Historically, the sector has been an important driver of the Swedish economy. In the recent decade, almost one-third of total sales and one-fourth of gross value-added came solely from manufacturing production. At the same time, many manufacturing activities are energy- and pollution-intensive. Between 2007 and 2017, the sector alone accounted for almost 40% of total \(\hbox {SO}_2\) emissions in Sweden on average. Although the contribution of \(\hbox {NO}_\text {x}\), VOCs and \(\hbox {PM}_{{10}}\) from manufacturing to the aggregate emissions is modest (14% on average during the studied period), the reductions in emissions were remarkably high—30% on average, larger than for agriculture or other industrial sectors. Being pollution-intensive, the manufacturing sector is directly targeted by environmental policies that aim at improving energy efficiency, increasing the share of renewables in energy consumption and reducing industrial emissions, where among the most important are the EU legislation on industrial emissionsFootnote 2 and the Swedish Environmental code. In a small open economy as Sweden, manufacturers, which are often exporters of both final and intermediate goods and owned by multinational corporations, are largely exposed to competition in the world market and sensitive to unexpected price changes (Tillväxtverket 2018). Manufacturing producers should both comply with stringent environmental regulations and be competitive. By quantifying the scale, composition and technique effects, one can better understand how the manufacturing sector as a whole responded to these different forces. The study relates to two strands of literature. First, the paper contributes to a growing empirical literature examining the sources of the emission reductions, mainly in the manufacturing sector, with the method of statistical decomposition (Grether et al. 2009; Levinson 2009, 2015; Brunel 2017; Shapiro and Walker 2018; Cole and Zhang 2019; Najjar and Cherniwchan 2020). I contribute to the literature by applying and adapting the state-of-the-art methodology and very recent data disaggregated at the four-digit level to a small open economy, Sweden. Regarding the methodology, for my measure of manufacturing output, I use data on the value of manufacturing production, which excludes costs for goods that were bought and re-sold without being adjusted. A more common approach in this literature—to use sales as a measure of output (Levinson 2009, 2015; Cole and Zhang 2019; Najjar and Cherniwchan 2020)—would leave out the importance of trade for a small open economy such as Sweden. Regarding data, I study actual annual emissions for Swedish manufacturing during a very recent period, 2007–2017. It allows me to estimate the technique effect directly, as opposed to early studies (Levinson 2009; Brunel 2017) where it is calculated as a residual. Finally, I complement the literature with additional evidence on the presence of a brown shift—a persistent shift towards more dirty production, which offsets a clean-up of manufacturing. Second, the paper relates to a large empirical literature examining the relationship between environmental policies of different character and industry- or firm-level environmental outcomes (e.g., Greenstone 2003; Millock and Nauges 2006; Gamper-Rabindran 2009; Gibson 2019; Najjar and Cherniwchan 2020), and to few papers examining some particular policy instruments in Sweden (Sterner and Turnheim 2009; Åström et al. 2017). While these papers focus on evaluating specific policies, often establishing a causal link between a change in regulation and environmental performance, the goal of my paper is to examine how the manufacturing sector in Sweden evolved—in terms of production and air pollution emissions—during the very recent period, 2007–2017, when various regulations were in place.Footnote 3 The main finding of the paper is that the composition of the Swedish manufacturing sector switched towards pollution-intensive goods between the years 2007 and 2017. I show that holding both scale and technique effect constant, emissions of \(\hbox {SO}_2\) and VOCs would increase by 7 and 20%, respectively. At the same time, the results indicate that, as expected, the clean-up of Swedish manufacturing appears to be primarily driven as elsewhere by the technique effect. For example, a fall in \(\hbox {SO}_2\) and \(\hbox {PM}_{{10}}\) emissions by 34 and 48 per cent corresponds to a decrease in the emissions intensity by 39 and 25%, respectively. Also, the findings suggest that the role of the composition and technique effects might differ in terms of sign and magnitude both across the most pollution-intensive manufacturing industries and pollutants. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant literature and discusses the possible sources of the brown shift. In Sect. 3, I describe the data sources and the decomposition method. The results of the decomposition analysis are in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the robustness of the findings, and Sect. 6 concludes.",1

The accumulated loss exceeds $535 billion at an average of $107.1 billion/year. The trend of disaster frequency is expected to escalate over the years due to changes in climate which will result in catastrophic losses (Lyubchich and Gel 2017). These volatile weather patterns will result in an inevitable challenge to the U.S.’s ability to sustain human and economic development (Tabuchi 2018). As a result, weather risk markets need to be capable of offsetting the financial impacts of natural disasters (Varangis et al. 2003; Dilley et al. 2005). Unequivocally, the catastrophe losses and related risks inherent create uncertainty over the type of disaster event (Lewis and Murdock 1996; NCEI 2020a). For example, due to less coverage of insured assets and data latency in drought and flooding events, they tend to provide uncertain loss estimates compared to the losses of severe storm events in the United States (NCEI 2020a; Smith and Matthews 2015). In consequence, prioritization for mitigating the risks can be diverse and complex. The financial losses due to natural disasters exacerbate due to changes in population and national wealth density (Van der Vink et al. 1998; Bell et al. 2018). If insurers are to retain profitability and solvency in the event of a major catastrophe that insurers must increase their prices for catastrophe insurance and reduce their exposure to risk (Roth Sr and and Kunreuther 1998). Also, reinsurers undergo severe financial stress in facilitating catastrophe insurance by offering tenable reduction for risk in large catastrophic losses (Lewis and Murdock 1996; Liang et al. 2010; Zangue and Poppo 2016). However, the substantial losses can be alleviated using protective measures such as preparedness, mitigation, and insurance (Kunreuther 1996; Ganderton et al. 2000). To better protect the clients, catastrophe insurance policies should ramp-up investments in cost-effective loss reduction mechanisms by better managing the risk. The weather index insurance can effectively transfer spatially covariate weather risks as it pays indemnities based on realizations of a weather index that is highly correlated with actual losses (Barnett and Mahul 2007). The securitization of losses from natural disasters provides a valuable novel source of diversification for investors. Catastrophe risk bonds are a promising type of insurance-linked securities introduced to smooth transferring of catastrophic insurance risk from insurers and corporations to capital market investors by offering an alternative or complement of capital to the traditional reinsurance (Zangue and Poppo 2016). The three types of variables that pay off in insurance-linked securities (Cummins et al. 2004) are insurer-specific catastrophe losses, insurance-industry catastrophe loss indices, and parametric indices based on the physical characteristics of catastrophic events. The first index-based catastrophe derivatives, CAT-futures, introduced by the Chicago Board of Trade using the ISO-Index was ineffective due to a lack of realistic models in the market (Christensen and Schmidli 2000). Secondly, the Property Claim Services (PCS) proposed the PCS-options based on the PCS-index and they slowed down due to market illiquidity (Biagini et al. 2008). Then, the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) designed catastrophe futures and options to enhance the transparency and liquidity of the capital markets to the insurance sector (Biagini et al. 2008). Kielholz and Durrer (1997) further explains alternative risk transfer mechanisms within the context of natural catastrophe problems in the United States. We propose Natural Disasters Index (NDI) to address these shortcomings by creating a financial instrument for hedging the intrinsic risk induced by the property losses caused by natural disasters in the United States. The vital objective of the NDI is to forecast the severity of future systemic risk attributed to natural disasters. This provides advance warnings to the insurers and corporations allowing them to transfer insurance risk to capital market investors. Therefore, the proposed NDI is intended to make up the shortfall between the capital and insurance markets. Furthermore, the NDI could be modified to calculate the risk in other regions or countries using a data set comparable to NOAA Storm Data NCEI (2018). We follow the methods applied in Trindade et al. (2020) on an ad hoc basis as a benchmark for NDI evaluation: (1) option pricing, (2) risk budgeting, and (3) stress testing. We provide an evaluation framework for the NDI using a discrete-time generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to calculate the fair values of the NDI options. Then, we simulate call and put option prices using the Monte Carlo method. We distribute the cumulative risk attributed to our equally weighted portfolio into the risk contributions of each type of natural disaster. Flood and flash flood are the main risk contributors in our portfolio according to our assessments using standard deviation and expected tail loss risk budgets. Furthermore, we evaluate the portfolio risk of the NDI to mitigate risks using monthly maximum temperature, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and the Global Warming Index (GWI) as stressors. We found the stress on maximum temperature significantly impacts the NDI compared to that of the PDSI at the highest stress level (1%). The contents of the rest of this paper are as follows. We provide an exploratory data analysis in Sect. 2  and econometric analysis for NDI in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the steps in option pricing and approximate call and put option prices for the NDI. In Sect. 5, we provide standard deviation and expected tail loss risk budgets for natural disasters in the United States. We assess the performance of the NDI via a stress testing analysis in Sect. 6. Finally, we make concluding remarks in Sect. 7.",3

Even though the government is supposed to encourage polluters to abate their emissions of pollutants, the cost structure of abatement activity is usually private information of polluters. In such a case the government can calculate neither the optimal emission tax rate nor the optimal emission allowances to be issued. Since Weitzman (1974), many authors have been considering what an optimal environmental policy under asymmetry of information is. Recently, a variety of discussions originated from Weitzman (1974) include the effects of the policy choice under asymmetric information on the incentives of a firm to invest in a cleaner technology (D’Amato and Dijkstra (2018)) and the interaction of different policies used to control two types of agricultural pollution (Yeo and Coleman (2019)). Our idea to find out private information is quite simple. Suppose that a firm has only one type of private information. The government will set tax at an arbitrary level. Then the firm will response to the tax rate by emitting a certain amount of pollutants. The response of the firm will provide the government with a hint for private information of the firm. One-time trial and error might be sufficient to find out the information. If the firm has two kinds of private information, the government needs trial and error twice. Trial runs prior to full implementation of environmental tax can be used to know private information of polluters. However, firms may behave strategically in the trial periods taking into account the effects of their abatement on the tax rate applied in the third period and after that. To eliminate an incentive to behave strategically, additional policy devices are needed, i.e., the standard for abatement in the third period and after that, and the penalty on the deviation from the standard. As a consequence, the government can attain the first best in the third period. Our model suggests that the government can find out private information to calculate the efficient tax rate during the trial periods. Trial runs prior to full implementation of the tax will also have another advantage. In general, it is difficult to implement environmental tax for political reasons. Elected policymakers are likely to hesitate to enact unpopular environmental taxes. For example, a Btu (British thermal unit) tax was rejected in the United States (Erlandson (1994)) as a consequence of public opposition to the policy and three proposals to tax fossil energy were also rejected in Switzerland in 2000 (Thalmann (2004)). Cherry et.al. (2014) shows that trial runs with an environmental tax can increase acceptability and public support for implementing the tax. Trial runs can lessen opposition to introducing an environmental tax, because it enables the people to experience the workings and impacts of the policy. The successful implementation of a congestion charge in Stockholm was a good example (Schuitema et.al. (2010)). A two-year pilot was also placed prior to permanent implementation of an electronic load pricing in Hong Kong (Hau (1990)). Weitzman (1974) was the first to compare two types of environmental policies each other under asymmetric information, i.e., price versus quantity. He showed that tax is superior to emission trading scheme if and only if the slope of marginal abatement benefit (MAB) is smaller than that of marginal abatement cost (MAC) in the absolute values. Many authors have tried to fix the deficits of the two policies and propose alternatives. Existing studies can be classified into two approaches. The first group assumes that the government can make each polluter report the cost structure for the abatement activity including the functional form. They show that there is an incentive compatible direct mechanism such that each polluter is willing to tell the truth and as a result the first best can be obtained (Kwerel (1977), Dasgupta et al. (1980), Collinge and Bailey (1983), Spulber (1988), Montero (2008)). In reality however, it is difficult for the government to ask each polluter directly about the exact shape of the abatement cost function even though it is only represented by a couple of parameters. For some reasons, polluters cannot reply about what their specific parameter values are. Therefore, many authors adopting the second approach are supposed to implement more indirect mechanisms rather than making each polluter report the cost structure directly to the government. Some studies considered mixed policies. A mixed policy advocated by Roberts and Spence (1976) includes tax, subsidy, and emission allowance. The policy can be simply expressed as an emission trading system with the lower and upper bound of prices known as a ‘safety valve’. In other words, tax and subsidy give the upper bound and the lower bound of allowance price, respectively. The idea is to approximate the marginal damage function by a step function in which the first and the second steps are given by the lower and the upper bound of prices, respectively. Similar gains can be realized either by renting allowances at prices that increase with the total number of allowances (Collinge and Oates (1982)) or by issuing options for buying additional allowances (Unold and Requate (2001)). Weitzman (1978) showed that a mixed price-quota system is superior to both pure tax and standard. If emissions of a firm exceed the standard, the firm faces a penalty dependent on the deviation from the standard. Yohe (1981) proposed a scheme in which the emission tax varies with the polluters’ emissions level. Kaplow and Shavell (2002) also proposed a non-linear tax scheme. Recently, another type of combination of the two policies are examined by Mandell (2008) and Krysiak and Oberauner (2010). They proposed a mixture of tax and emission trading scheme in which some firms are under the control of tax and the other are regulated by emission trading scheme. Mandell (2008) directly extended the original model of Weitzman (1974) to the N-firms model and showed that the mixture of the two policies is superior to each of them. Extending Mandell’s model, Krysiak and Oberauner (2010) proposed making firms choose the policy that controls themselves and it was shown that the joint use of or the mixture of the two policy devices can still improve the social welfare compared with a single use of them. Although this second approach has an advantage of being designed easily compared with the first approach, it has been difficult to attain the first best under asymmetry of information. In the literature, mechanisms to attain the first best are proposed by only a few studies. Kaplow and Shavell (2002) suggested that the first best can be attained if all the externality costs are imposed on each firm. However, it is demanding too much for each firm to accept the payment of all the externality costs. Kim and Chang (1993) propose a tax/subsidy scheme in an oligopoly market with pollution. Duggan and Roberts (2002) propose a quantity-based scheme where each firm chooses a quantity for itself and for its “neighbor” firm. Although both of the two schemes can attain the first best, they are not implemented in dominant strategies; they require each firm to correctly anticipate the Nash equilibrium strategy of the remaining firms. Several authors propose the mechanism based on emission permit market. Montero (2000) studies an emission trading scheme where a fraction of firms are obliged to participate in allowance trading while other firms can voluntarily opt-in. He derives the optimal allowances allocations to obliged and voluntary firms that can attain the first best when the government has incomplete information on individual emissions and abatement costs. In his model, although emissions and constant marginal abatement costs are firm’s private information, it is assumed that the government knows their cumulative distributions. More recently, Berglann (2012) also proposes an efficient scheme mixing a tax policy with an emission permit market. Each firm trades emission permits in the first stage and chooses the levels of emission in the second stage. However, the mechanism can attain the first best, only if the emission permit market is competitive so that no firms will have market power. The policy with trial runs analyzed in this paper belongs to the second approach and an indirect mechanism is adopted. The first best can also be attained by the mechanism based on trial and error. However, the policy has several advantages over other efficient mechanisms detailed above. First of all, the government does not need any information such as expected value or variance of private information. We assume that each firm has two parameters involved in the abatement cost function and all of them cannot be observed by the government. Instead we assume that the government can observe the abatement or emission of each firm. Under this assumption, the government can extract private information by observing the actual abatement of each firm through trial and error. Second, the mechanism is implemented in dominant strategy (see Kim and Chang (1993) and Duggan and Roberts (2002)). In other words, the mechanism is robust in a sense that each firm will stay at the Nash equilibrium even if other firms deviate from it. Third, the policy does not depend on the market structure because the policy is based on a tax scheme rather than an emission permit market (see Berglann (2012)). The policy proposed in this paper is comprised of two steps. The first step is first two trial periods when the government needs to change the tax rate by each period arbitrarily to obtain private information of all firms. The second step is to calculate the optimal tax which will be applied in the third period and after that. However, firms may behave strategically in the trial periods taking into account the effects of their abatement on the tax rate applied in the third period and after that. To eliminate an incentive to behave strategically, additional policy devices are needed, i.e., the standard for abatement in the third period and after that, and the penalty on the deviation from the standard. As a consequence, the government can attain the first best in the third period. Our idea is similar to that of Moledina et al. (2003). They examine the effect of trial and error by the government in a dynamic setting. They compare emission tax and emission trading scheme in the presence of strategic behavior by firms rather than designing a mechanism necessary to attain the first best. In their model the government fails to utilize fully the information collected in the trail periods, because the government is assumed to think that firms are not strategic even though they are. They show that tax is superior to emission trading scheme when the low-cost firm sets the allowance price but emission trading scheme is superior to tax when the high-cost firm sets the allowance price. In our model, the government is assumed to design the policy taking strategic behaviors of each firm into consideration. The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. In the next section, we derive the first best and then we characterize the optimal tax rate and the optimal number of allowances to be issued. In Sect. 3, we propose the policy based on trial and error in a general setting. In Sect. 4, we try to tune the policy based on emission trading scheme. Section 5 is our conclusion.",

Given the scale of the problem, especially in developing countries that are least equipped to deal with its consequences (World Bank 2010), it is imperative to identify possible policy measures that may be relevant in ensuring environmental protection in these contexts, and to understand how to enhance their effectiveness. Poor environmental quality is considered to be a hallmark of many areas in developing countries, especially as the process of development and urbanization gets underway (Greenstone and Jack 2015). Pollution due to industrial activities, exploitation of natural resources, biodiversity destruction, deforestation, as well as the unsustainable development of agriculture and aquaculture systems are some of the typical problems encountered in these settings, often exacerbated by rapid population growth (Greenstone and Jack 2015). The industrial sector is a significant contributor to environmental degradation in developing countries; for instance, it is one of the leading causes of water, solid waste and air pollution in Vietnam (International Trade Administration 2019). Thus, it is critical to ensure that firms in developing countries find means to reduce their negative environmental impact, and thereby advance the cause of sustainable development. The set of available policy instruments that may be utilized to mitigate the environmental impact of firms can be categorized as those primarily employed by the state, and others which require initiative to be taken by the firms themselves (Gupta et al. 2007). The state must often intervene in the design and implementation of environmental policy instruments; these can broadly be classified as ‘market-based instruments’ that encourage changes in behavior through market signals (such as pollution charges, tradable permits, or subsidies) and ‘non-market-based instruments’ (including command-and-control regulations, such as technology or performance standards, as well as information disclosure programs) (Stavins 2001). Examples of environmental policy initiatives that can be taken by firms include corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, as well as the adoption of voluntary certification (such as ‘ecolabels’) and environmental standards. Voluntary certification and standards have been found to have the potential to achieve environmental targets in developing countries, at least under some conditions (Blackman 2010; Blackman and Guerrero 2012) in contexts, where traditional command-and-control policies have not always been very effective (Eskeland and Jimenez 1992), often because of poor enforcement, lack of funding or trained personnel, lack of political will and a lack of awareness. Weak institutions, and the associated shortcomings in regulatory capacity and implementation, have meant that policy instruments such as voluntary standards and certifications may be an effective means to ensure ‘self-regulation’ by firms (Khanna and Liao (2014) provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on voluntary standards in developing countries). The current literature on environmental voluntary standards for firms in developing countries has evaluated the motivation for firms to obtain these certifications, and found that firms often undertake these in response to pressure from regulators, consumers, investors, or environmental interest groups (Khanna and Liao 2014). Examples of some firm-level characteristics that determine voluntary certification have been found to be foreign direct investment, firm size, whether the firm exports, and production of intermediate products (Tambunlertchai et al. 2013). However, some of these studies also find significant heterogeneity in adoption of these standards, and that not all firms that may benefit from their adoption actually do so (Khanna and Liao 2014). While this literature has evaluated the socio-economic determinants of voluntary certification, to the best of our knowledge, it has not considered behavioral traits of either owners or managers that may determine voluntary certification outcomes. For instance, a lack of awareness or a lack of interest on the presence or availability of these standards could explain why some firms do not adopt them. The idea of a lack of awareness can be linked to the broader concept of limited attention, which has been extensively studied within the realm of behavioral economics. Some studies have found that limited attention could be an important determinant of firms not undertaking actions that may be in their best interest in developing countries (Beaman et al. 2014). This relatively nascent literature suggests that firm owners may have trouble in attending to all aspects of their business, or have limited capacity to process all available information (Dellavigna 2009; Gabaix and Laibson 2006; Koszegi and Szeidl 2013; Hirshleifer and Teoh 2003). This may explain why in some contexts, firm owners may not adopt these standards, even if it may be beneficial to do so. In this paper, our objective is to evaluate the role of a lack of awareness in explaining the voluntary adoption of environmental certification by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the food and beverage industry in Vietnam. Vietnam has grown rapidly in recent decades, and small and medium enterprises have been the dynamic force behind this growth, comprising almost 98% of all enterprises, and employing more than 60% of the workforce (and contributing to about 45% of the country’s GDP) (General Statistics Office 2015). However, this industrialization has resulted in significant environmental deterioration: Vietnam ranks 132 out of 180 countries in the Environmental Protection Index (Wendling et al. 2018), and it ranks among the most affected countries in terms of air pollution (IQAir 2019). The food industry accounts for about 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Poore and Nemecek 2018), with about 18% of these emissions accounted for by the supply chain (including food processing) (Ritchie 2020). While the food and beverage industry is notable for its scale of its environmental impact worldwide, these effects are particularly salient in developing countries. For instance, it contributes about 55% to industrial wastewater pollution in sub-Saharan Africa, and it’s ranked second for its impact on air, water and soil pollution (along with rubber, plastics and leather) in South Asia (Stockholm Environmental Institute and University of York 2020). The food and beverage industry is also one of the most pollution-intensive industries in Vietnam, and it is significant for both its scale of productionFootnote 1, and its pollution load (Dore et al. 2008)Footnote 2. Dore et al. (2008) identify this sector, along with textiles, and chemicals and chemical products, as the biggest contributors to industrial pollution in Vietnam.Footnote 3 At the same time, Vietnam’s growing middle class is demanding products certified as being environmentally friendly: according to a recent survey, Vietnamese consumers are among the most socially conscious in Asia-Pacific. Up to 86% of consumers in Vietnam are willing to pay more for products and services from firms that are committed to having a positive social and environmental impact (Nielsen 2015). Thus, in this context, not only can policy instruments such as voluntary environmental certificates contribute towards achieving environmental goals in Vietnam, but they are also likely to bring benefits to firms that obtain them (such as the potential for increased demand for their products, as well the possibility of exporting). In this study, we analyze the voluntary adoption of an environmental standards certificate (ESC), also known as the ‘certification for environmental protection works’, using data on a sample of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Our main explanatory variable captures whether owners or managers of the firm are unaware of (or lack interest in learning about) the Law on Environmental Protection (LEP), which contains detailed and extensive information on how firms can obtain this certification, and is thus an important source of information on how firms can get certified. The key regulatory instrument at the disposal of policy-makers in Vietnam is the LEP.Footnote 4 This law serves as the basis for industrial pollution management policies in Vietnam, as well as for the framing and implementation of environmental standards. The LEP requires that firms that can produce at a certain minimum scale in specific industries conduct an environmental impact assessment (EIA) before starting operations, with the right to start or continue their business only when their EIA reports have been reviewed, and approved by the State Management Agency for Environmental Protection (The Government of Vietnam 2015; Vietnam Law and Legal Forum 2008).Footnote 5 The EIA is expected to provide a detailed description of the project, as well as important information on its environmental impact on the site, and potential risks due to environmental incidents. Moreover, it requires owners to state measures that they plan to take to address any possible environmental concerns, and with these any other environmental commitments as well (Vietnam Law and Legal Forum 2008). On being granted the approval for the EIA, they then must submit documents to get an inspection done for pollution control. Firms are granted an environmental standards certificate (ESC), or “certificate for completion of environmental protection works” (as it is now called after the amendment of the LEP in 2015) if they comply with the requirements set forth in the EIA, as well as successfully pass the inspection requirements (Vietnam Law and Legal Forum 2008). Firms that have been granted the ESC receive a signed certificate from the competent authority, normally the same one that conducts the appraisal of the EIA, stating that they have met the requirements for the certification. The criteria for obtaining the ESC are more stringent (especially in terms of treatment as well as monitoring requirements) than those for other forms of environmental certification such as the those for the environmental protection plans. Applications can be rejected if they do not provide sufficient evidence that the firm has taken steps to treat different forms of pollutants, or been monitoring its waste, and firms must continue monitoring environmental performance even after having received certification. Firms found lacking in providing sufficient means of treating environmental factors may receive an extension of the deadline, as well as recommendations from the competent authorities on measures to implement (Vietnam Law and Legal Forum 2008; The Government of Vietnam 2015). Of course, it is possible for owners or managers of firms to obtain the ESC, irrespective of whether they have knowledge on the LEP. For instance, customers (both other firms as well as individuals) may choose to purchase products only from firms that have been certified, which could incentivize firms to obtain certification. Moreover, firms may learn about certification (and its possible benefits) from other firms. At the same time, being knowledgeable of the LEP and the ESC doesn’t imply that owners or managers will obtain certification (it may be too costly, for instance, especially for smaller firms). Thus, while deeper knowledge on the legal framework can be expected to augment the likelihood of voluntary adoption of standards, it is unlikely to result in all firms getting certified. In our paper, we are interested in understanding the contribution (if any) of legal awareness or knowledge in improving voluntary certification outcomes, given that the law is an important source of information on the certificates. While obtaining this certification is mandatoryFootnote 6 for large firms belonging to specific sectors in Vietnam, in this paper, we focus on the voluntary adoption of these standards in a sample of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the food and beverage industry of Vietnam. We use unbalanced panel data from the UNU–WIDER Vietnam SME firm-level database (United Nations University UNU-WIDER 2011) that collects information on about 2500 firms, mostly SMEs, across industries from 2011 to 2015 biennially. Our paper presents evidence spanning various estimation methodologies on the effect of a lack of awareness on certification. We employ a probit estimator, a recursive bivariate estimator that is equipped to correct for possible endogeneity, and combine the recursive bivariate methodology with the Mundlak/Chamberlain adjustment (Mundlak 1978; Chamberlain 1982) to address possible unobserved heterogeneity. While the use of the recursive bivariate framework enables identification through assumptions on functional form, we choose to employ an excluded instrument in our first-stage estimation. We find that firms that lacked awareness of the LEP were 38 percentage points less likely to be certified than firms, where respondents had some knowledge of the law; thus, owners and managers being at least somewhat knowledgeable of the LEP has a noteworthy impact on the likelihood of the firm receiving certification for meeting environmental standards. We control for several other factors that have been found to be important determinants of voluntary certification in the literature. Moreover, we find heterogeneity in the size of this effect across different dimensions. For example, we find that firms whose owners or managers are college-educated, those that export their goods, or those that have internet access were more likely to have obtained the voluntary certification if they were aware of the LEP. We find the reverse for household enterprises, i.e., they are less likely to be certified, even when they are aware of the LEP. Our contribution to the literature is that our study provides evidence on the role that psychological or behavioral traits of owners and managers (such as a lack of awareness or interest) can play in hindering the effectiveness of environmental policy instruments (such as the adoption of voluntary environmental certification) for firms in a developing country. We use self-reported information on awareness about the LEP to establish that firms, where owners or managers are more attentive to availability of instruments such as environmental certificates are more likely to make conscious efforts to treat environmental factors (and thus satisfy environmental standards). Moreover, we also add to the literature on the determinants of a lack of awareness on part of owners and managers, and identify both firm-level and respondent-level factors that may lead to individuals being more aware/knowledgeable of environmental laws. Of course, these factors are likely to be context-specific; however, they still provide interesting insights into how policy-makers can target information and education campaigns. We believe that it is interesting to find that owners/managers of firms lacking awareness of the law are less likely to adopt environmental standards, given that knowledge of the law increases the probability of learning about the standards themselves, which is likely to augment their adoption on a voluntary basis. The policy implications of this study relate to the importance of informing and educating firm owners and managers about the availability of voluntary environmental instruments, as well as enabling them to understand the legal framework better, given that legal awareness is likely to weaken at least some information constraints for small and medium enterprises. This is of pivotal interest in developing countries, where weak institutions and a lack of information may hamper the uptake of environmental policy initiatives by firms. The structure of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 provides a brief review of the literature, Sect. 3 provides details on the data and methodology used for the analysis, Sect. 4 includes the main results of the paper as well as additional results, while Sect. 5 concludes and includes policy implications.",3

On productivity and environmental regulation,July 2022,Philipp R. Steinbrunner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The choice of environmental policy instruments has been extensively debated since the seminal contribution of Pigou (1920) on using taxes and subsidies to internalize welfare losses caused by externalities. The environmental economics literature distinguishes between ’command and control’ (CAC) approaches (e.g. environmental protection amendments) and ’market based incentives’ (MBI) (e.g. environmental taxes, tradable permits). Although economic theory preferred MBIs because of their cost effectiveness, CAC has been the major instrument for a long time. During the 1990s, MBIs became more popular, i.e. environmental taxes in the beginning of the 1990s and tradable permits in the late 1990s (e.g. the Kyoto protocol in 1997) (Norregaard and Reppelin-Hill 2000). Currently, environmental taxes are enjoying a renaissance (Krukowska 2020). While almost every microeconomic textbook covers the basic models of environmental policy’s welfare implications in first-best and second-best worlds, economic theory and empirical evidence on its effects on firm behaviour and performance are sparse and provide conflicting guidance, though being fundamental for designing green tax reforms. First, the ’pollution haven hypothesis’ claims that firms relocate to countries with weak environmental standards when environmental taxes rise, reducing profits, productivity and inputs by limiting production possibilities (Commins et al. 2011). Conversely, the ’factor endowment hypothesis’ suggests that employing available clean natural resources improves production possibilities and productivity (Copeland and Taylor 2004). Similarly, the ’Porter hypothesis’ asserts that environmental regulation spurs firms to innovate, increasing productivity and investment (Porter 1991; Porter and Van der Linde 1995). To provide empirical evidence on these conflicting hypothesis, I examine the impacts of environmental taxes on company performance and behaviour employing micro-data on Central European manufacturing firms from 2009 to 2017. Many empirical studies examine the environmental benefits of climate policies, while only few studies, primarily undertaken at country- or industry-level, analyse impacts of environmental policy on firm behaviour. Leiter et al. (2011) investigate effects of industry expenditure on environmental protection and country-level environmental tax revenue on firm investment, and find positive, but diminishing effects. Enevoldsen et al. (2007) estimate responses of competitiveness and output to energy taxes and find significantly negative impacts, whereas Henderson and Millimet (2005) observe insignificant impacts of environmental stringency on state-level output. Next, Aziz et al. (2021) conclude that environmental policy stringency negatively affects economic growth in the short-run, but positively in the long run. Besides, Franco and Marin (2017) investigate how environmental tax rates and their spillovers affect innovation and efficiency. Conversely, only few studies employ firm-level data. Fujii et al. (2016) identify technical innovators in the area of CO2 emissions using Chinese firm-level data. Martin et al. (2014) observe insignificant effects of carbon taxation on British manufacturing firms’ employment, gross output and productivity, and observe significantly negative impacts on energy intensity and electricity use. Similarly, Yang et al. (2021) find significantly negative effects of tightening SO2 removal rates on Chinese firm- and industry-level productivity. In contrast, Commins et al. (2011) find positive effects of energy taxes on productivity and returns on capital, negative impacts on employment, and mixed effects on investment of European firms. Broberg et al. (2013) regress Swedish manufacturing firms’ productivity on distributed lags of investment in pollution control and prevention, rejecting the Porter hypothesis. Supporting the Porter hypothesis, Lanoie et al. (2008) find negative short-run and positive long-run impacts of environmental policy stringency on technical efficiency of Quebec’s manufacturing firms. Managi et al. (2005) investigate the impact of environmental policy on technical efficiency of the offshore oil and gas industry and confirm the Porter hypothesis. Last, Lundgren et al. (2015) estimate the efficiency impacts of CO2 taxes on Swedish pulp and paper manufacturers, partially observing significantly positive effects. This work contributes to the available literature in several aspects. First, my dataset also covers smaller firms next to large or listed firms enabling a more comprehensive analysis. Second, I allow heterogeneous effects of environmental tax rates across industries. Third, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first study examining downstream and upstream environmental tax spillovers using firm-level data. Fourth, I consider endogeneity of environmental tax rates by employing lags instead of contemporaneous values. Generally, energy and pollution tax rates significantly impact productivity in many industries. Positive impacts of taxes on productivity are observed in energy-intensive sectors, industries producing energy-consuming goods and polluting sectors, whereas negative impacts are estimated in industries declining in Europe. Conversely, input amounts significantly respond in fewer industries. Downstream energy tax rates do not affect productivity, while upstream ones decrease technical efficiency. Downstream pollution taxation decreases productivity, whereas upstream taxation spurs technical efficiency. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the empirical framework and data, used to examine the impacts of environmental regulation on firm behaviour, while Sect. 3 provides the results of the production function estimations and the regressions of firm behaviour. Last, Sect. 4 sums up and draws conclusions.",2

While current climate policies focus on national contributions (NDCs), a number of recent studies (e.g. Kriegler et al. 2018; Robiou du Pont et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2017) show that greenhouse gas emission reductions in line with NDCs will not be sufficient to achieve a long-term climate stabilization below 2 \(^{\circ }\)C. International co-operation and multilateral actions are needed to intensify national mitigation efforts. The transfer of financial means and physical capital can be considered as part of the portfolio of international climate change mitigation measures. The purposeful allocation of capital can help to increase the effictiveness and fairness of mitigation efforts. However, capital flows may generate or intensify current account imbalances and are subject of capital market imperfections. Capital market constraints can be expected to increase the costs of transformation towards carbon-free economies, because renewable energy technologies are more capital-intensive than fossil-based technologies. This may increase mitigation costs and reduce the incentive of capital-constrained countries to join international efforts of fighting climate change. This all is not yet discussed in the climate economics literature. This paper fills this gap and in particular asks to which extent the representation of capital markets and capital market imperfections changes the global and regional costs of climate change mitigation. To answer this question, the present study makes use of the Integrated Assessment (IA) model REMIND. We improve the methodology of this model by explicitly representing capital market imperfections and make the model’s macro-economic dynamics consistent with empirical current account imbalances. By embedding an economic growth model that requests for long-term compensation of short-term current account deficits, REMIND derives patterns of long-term international trade and current accounts. The simulation of the current account structure and net foreign assets in this model is related to intertemporal trade and capital trade, respectively. Intertemporal trade helps to balance needs of financing consumption and investments in countries with different demographic dynamics or at different stages of development, hence contributes to economic growth. The issue of capital trade is weakly represented in applied economic modelling studies. With respect to IA models, it has hardly been addressed since (Manne and Rutherford 1994) and Nordhaus and Yang (1996)—on the one hand, because of the numerical demands on solving large-scale models with capital trade, on the other hand, because of the peculiarity of resulting trade flow patterns. In a model with perfect competition and free trade, simulated trade flows may deviate by an order of magnitude from empirical data. The standard theory predicts capital flows from rich to poor countries which is in contrast to observed patterns of international current accounts and which is known as the Lucas paradox (Lucas 1990). In this paper, we discuss how this problem manifests in an IA model. We demonstrate how the model can be improved by applying a wedge analysis and integrating capital market imperfections that redirect trade flows to be consistent with observed data. With the specified capital market representation, the model is able to deal with the Lucas paradox and prepared for improved projections of energy sector transformations and mitigation cost estimates. By similar intent as the present study, Iyer et al. (2015) apply an IA model to assess mitigation cost changes due to the representation of instititutional differences between countries. Unlike the present study, Iyer et al. (2015) do not model the capital market directly, but implemented region-specific risk mark-ups for investments into different electricity generation technologies. They find that this change yield increasing mitigation costs. When running experiments with the REMIND model, we start by analyzing the impacts of representing imperfect capital markets on the baseline dynamics. Changes in the baseline have a direct impact on the costs of climate policies because the reference case is shifted against which policy scenarios are compared. The second part of the numerical analysis starts with the hypothesis that simulated climate policy costs depend on the representation of the capital market. We quantify this effect and demonstrate mitigation cost changes of opposite signs across regions. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we highlight the role of capital trade in shaping long-term growth dynamics. Challenges of modelling capital trade are linked to the Lucas paradox for which we provide alternative explanations. A method to represent capital market imperfections and to solve the Lucas paradox is presented. In Sect. 3, we introduce the trade module of the REMIND model and its integration in an intertemporal welfare-maximizing model framework. Disclosing the nature of trade as control variable and the meaning of the intertemporal budget constraint is crucial. This also applies to the representation of the time preference structure and imperfect capital market features. We discuss the major differences in consumption and current account patterns between baseline scenarios with and without capital market imperfections in Sect. 6. The impact of climate policies is analyzed in Sect. 7 where we answer the question to which extent the estimation of mitigation costs is distorted by the assumption of perfect and uniform capital markets. We summarize in Sect. 8 and identify future research demand.",6

Shevchenko,Daisuke Murakami,Tor A. Myrvoll,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy is more severe than the impact from the 2008 global financial crisis (see, e.g., International Monetary Fund (2020)), and the projection of the COVID-19 impact on the economy and climate is a major concern. In this paper, we study the impact of COVID-19 type events on the economy and climate using the dynamic integrated climate-economy (DICE) model, extended to include stochastic shocks to the economy. The DICE model introduced by NordhausFootnote 1 is an extremely popular integrated assessment model (IAM) for the joint modeling of economic and climate systems. It has been regularly revised over the last three decades with the first version dating back to Nordhaus et al. (1992), and the most recent revision being DICE-2016 Nordhaus (2017)Footnote 2. The DICE model is one of the three main IAMs (the other two are FUND and PAGE) used by the United States government to determine the social cost of carbon; see Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (2016). It balances parsimony with realism and is well documented with all published model equations; in addition, its code is publicly available, which is an exception rather than the rule for IAMs. At the same time, it is important to note that IAMs and the DICE model in particular have significant limitations (in the model structure and model parameters), which have been criticized and debated in the literature (see the discussions in Ackerman et al. (2009); Pindyck (2017); Grubb et al. (2021); Weitzman (2011)). Despite the criticism, the DICE model has become the iconic typical reference point for climate-economy modeling, and is, therefore, used in our study. The DICE model is a deterministic approach that combines a Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans neoclassical model of economic growth (also known as the Ramsey growth model) with a simple climate model. It involves six state variables (atmospheric and upper and lower ocean carbon concentrations; atmospheric and lower ocean temperatures; and economic capital) evolving in time deterministically, two control variables (savings and carbon emission reduction rates) to be determined for each time period of the model, and several exogenous processes (e.g., population size and technology level). Uncertainty about the future of the climate and economy is then typically assessed by treating some model parameters as random variables (because we do not know the exact true value of the key parameters) using a Monte Carlo analysis (see Nordhaus (2018); Ackerman et al. (2010)). Modeling uncertainty owing to the stochastic nature of the state variables (i.e., owing to the process uncertainty that is present even if we know the model parameters exactly) requires the development and solution of the DICE model as a dynamic model of decision-making under uncertainty, where we calculate the optimal policy response, under the assumption of continuing uncertainty throughout the time frame of the model. This is a much more difficult problem that requires more computational and mathematical sophistication, whereas the deterministic DICE model can be solved using an Excel spreadsheet or GAMS (a high-level programming language for mathematical modeling https://www.gams.com/). Few attempts have been made to extend the DICE model to incorporate stochasticity in the underlying state variables and solve it as a recursive dynamic programming problem. For example, Kelly and Kolstad (1999) and Leach (2007) formulated the DICE model with stochasticity in the temperature–time evolution and solved this as a recursive dynamic programming problem. These studies are seminal contributions to the incorporation of uncertainty in the DICE model (although their numerical solution approach is difficult to extend to higher dimensional space and time-frequency). Cai et al. (2012) formulates DICE as a dynamic programming problem with a stochastic shock on the economy and climate. In addition, Traeger (2014) developed a reduced DICE model with a smaller number of state variables, whereas Lontzek et al. (2015) studied the impact of climate tipping points. There are other studies that approached optimal strategies addressing climate change through a simple minimization of the damage function to find the optimal timing for an investment, such as in Conrad (1997); Luo and Shevchenko (2013), which is extremely different from the DICE modeling approach and is not pursued in our paper. In our study, we extend the DICE model by adding a discrete stochastic shock variable, shifting the economy into a stressed regime owing to events, such as COVID-19. This is similar to the model formulation in Cai et al. (2012) but with different types of jump processes for the shocks. The economy after our shocks is allowed to recover, whereas the jump shock considered in Lontzek et al. (2015); Cai et al. (2012) is an irreversible climate tipping point event. One of the scenarios we consider allows for stochastic shocks affecting productivity, which leads to a persistent impact on the economy. This is somewhat similar to the tipping point modeling in Lontzek et al. (2015); Cai et al. (2012). However, it is important to note that shocks considered in our paper reduce both the world net output and emission through the shock reduction of the gross output, while tipping point models assume shock on the net output and no shock on the emission. Thus our shocks lead to a reduction in a policy stringency, while tipping point shocks lead to the opposite effect. In addition, our base model is the more recent version of DICE-2016, whereas Lontzek et al. (2015); Cai et al. (2012) use older DICE versions. COVID-19 has spread across the globe, with over 75 million confirmed cases and 1.6 million deaths from December 30, 2019, to December 20, 2020, according to the Weekly Epidemiological Update from the World Health Organization on December 22, 2020Footnote 3 (with over 4.6 million new cases and 79,000 deaths since the previous weekly updates). Large amounts of emergency loans are needed around the world to develop therapeutic agents and vaccines, as well as to implement various interventions to prevent the spread of infections, such as “stay-at-home” policies, and provide financial support for them. However, in recent years, the effects of climate change on global warming have become more serious on a global scale and the “Paris Agreement” to limit the global temperature increaseFootnote 4 was adopted in 2015. This has resulted in more public and private funds being provided for green projects involving renewable energy and energy conservation, as the world works to prevent the effects of global climate change. In a pandemic of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, it is important to consider the economic impacts of both such pandemics and global warming at the same time. One of the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic is extreme and widespread disruption to the global economy when compared to other global pandemics, such as the 1918 Influenza Pandemic (“Spanish Flu”) or the Hong Kong Flu of 1968Footnote 5. On the official government website of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States (see BEA (2020)), it was reported on September 30, 2020 that the real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 31.4% in the second quarter of 2020. According to a news report on September 2, 2020 in The Japan Times (2020), Japan’s April–June GDP is expected to be revised after making an annualized 27.8% drop on a preliminary basis, which is the largest contraction in the post-World War II period. Though, at the time of revision of this paper, the reported drop of the real GDP in the United States in 2020 (compared to 2019) is only 3.4% (https://www.measuringworth.com accessed on 9 October 2021). The amounts of the stimulus packages released by governments in many countries to limit the human and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been unprecedented. The International Monetary Fund policy trackerFootnote 6 presented a summary of the key economic responses around the world (e.g., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security Act introduced in United States in March 2020 has been estimated at 2.3 trillion USD (around 11% of the nation’s GDP)). Although the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, human capital, and well-being in the long run is unknown, the historical experience of global pandemics and global recessions can provide valuable insight. Arthi and Parman (2021) provides an excellent review of the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital from both historical pandemics and historical recessions. It has been argued that, from a historical perspective, the impact of COVID-19 has been similar to that of the “Spanish Flu” (1918) in terms of direct effects on the health and well-being of individuals, and similar to the Great Depression (1929–1939) in terms of economic disruption. In this study, we consider the impact of COVID-19 type events on the DICE model outputs. We reformulate the DICE model as an optimal control problem and solve it using dynamic programming involving six state variables evolving over time deterministically and affected by two controls (emission control and savings rates). We then extend the model by adding a discrete stochastic shock variable to the gross world output to shift the economy into a stressed regime owing to events, such as COVID-19, assuming that the economy recovers in full after the stressed period. The extended model is solved as an optimal stochastic control problem under different scenarios for the world gross output drop owing to these shock events. With the reference to the Great Depression (1929–1939) and “Spanish Flu” (1918), for our scenarios, we assume that shocks occur on average once during a 100-year period and last for 5 years. In addition, the world economic output during a stressed regime decreases by 5–10%. We note that during the Great Depression, the real GDP in the United States dropped for 6 years (1930–1935) comparing to the pre-depression level in 1929 (averaging to 17% drop per annum over that period)Footnote 7, thus our assumption for the shock magnitude is a bit less conservative. Under all considered conservative scenarios, the impact of COVID-19 type events on the long-term temperature and carbon concentration appear to be quite small. The results show that if the world’s gross output recovers in full after each event, the impact of COVID-19 on the temperature and carbon concentration will be immaterial even in the case of a conservative 10% drop in the annual gross output over a 5-year period. The impact becomes noticeable, although remaining extremely small (i.e., a long-term temperature drop by \(0.1^\circ \mathrm {C}\)), if the shocks are persistent 5% drops in productivity, leading to a 5% drop in output propagating to the subsequent time periods. If the deterministic DICE model policy is applied to the stochastic model (i.e., a suboptimal policy is applied in the case of stochastic shocks), then the drop in temperature will be larger (approximately \(0.25^\circ \mathrm {C}\)), that is, the lower economic activities owing to the occurrence of a shock imply that more ambitious mitigation targets are now feasible at lower costs, which is qualitatively consistent with the results presented in Meles et al. (2020). The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The model is defined in Section 2. Section 3 describes the numerical method used to solve the model. The results are presented in Section 4, and some concluding remarks are given in Section 5.",1

Climate change is thought to threaten agriculture, water supplies, tourism, and icons like the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu wetlands (Hughes et al. 2018). Internationally, UNFCCC (1997, 2015) were important landmarks addressing climate change and emissions reduction. Over time, the Australian Government has shown various levels of commitment to reducing emissions (such as ratification of the Kyoto protocol, introduction of renewable energy target, solar credits scheme, emissions reduction target, net zero emissions target by 2100) (Talberg et al. 2016). Estimates of public support of emissions reduction schemes can assist in developing more efficient policies. Discrete choice experiments (DCE) can be used to elicit preferences for non-market goods and services including willingness to pay (WTP) for emissions reduction options. In DCE respondents are presented with several hypothetical scenarios and are asked to choose among two or more alternatives with different levels of attributes (Hensher et al. 2005a, b). While WTP estimates can be used to compare support of citizens for different emissions reduction options, the temporal stability of WTP over time is unclear (Brouwer and Bateman 2005; Brouwer et al. 2017; Czajkowski et al. 2016; Lew and Wallmo 2017). Some studies looking at the changes in WTP over a short time frame (up to 2 years) found that mean WTP was stable (Lew and Wallmo 2017), while other studies found significant differences in WTP over time (Matthews et al. 2017). Studies that examined differences in WTP over the long-time frame, reported mixed results. Few studies found that values were stable (Price et al. 2017), while many other studies found the opposite (Boman and Mattsson 2012; Zandersen et al. 2007). The temporal stability of WTP coefficients is an important issue for validity and reliability reasons, particularly in benefits transfer which relies on past estimates (Rolfe and Dyack 2019). Given the strong attention of Australian Government to the issues of climate change, the focus of this paper is to investigate whether WTP has changed over time using two surveys 10 years apart (2009 and 2018). The 2009 DCE survey reflected the Australian Government’s commitment to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. The follow-up 2018 survey reflected the Paris agreement to reduce emissions. DCEs can be presented in a labeled or unlabeled form. The labeled form uses labels for each alternative such as brand name or type of the product in the choice set. Unlabeled form uses unlabeled alternatives such as “Alternative A” in the choice set. An advantage of labeled alternatives is to make the choices more realistic, while unlabeled alternatives might be seen as too generic. The disadvantage of labeled alternatives is that respondents might ignore the levels of attributes by choosing the more appealing label that considers individual knowledge of specific options, adding to the validity of the results (de Bekker-Grob et al. 2013). The effect of labels on temporal stability of WTP has not been fully examined in the literature. This study follows Williams and Rolfe (2017) investigation of the effect of labels on consumers’ support for emissions reduction policies. Very similar surveys were administered to different samples in Queensland, Australia in 2009 and 2018. The study adopts the same labels and attributes as in 2009 survey by Williams and Rolfe (2017). The labeled version of DCE is using the following options for emissions reduction: Green Power (i.e., increase of use of renewable energy from wind or solar), Efficient Technology (i.e., reduce consumption of energy through use of efficient appliances) and Carbon Capture (e.g., storing carbon in forests and underground, use of clean coal technologies) options. The attributes are emissions reduction and certainty of achieving the emissions reductions target. This study compares the estimates of WTP from 2018 to 2009 survey (Williams and Rolfe 2017). An adjustment for inflation was applied to WTP estimates from 2009 survey using the consumer price index (CPI) (Hensher et al. 2011). This paper adds to the literature on stability of WTP estimates on two fronts. First, the temporal stability of WTP using surveys administered 10 years apart is evaluated. Literature on evaluation of WTP over long time frame is scarce (Neher et al. 2017; Price et al. 2017). Second, the effect of labels on temporal stability of WTP values using labeled and unlabeled alternatives is investigated. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 describes the case study. Section 4 discusses the results and Sect. 5 provides summary and discussion.",1

For example, electricity is currently growing as a popular alternative to gasoline for automobiles. Future residential demand for renewable energy can make a significant difference in the reduction of greenhouse gases and related health hazards. The combustion of fossil fuels, a major source of growing energy demand in the United States, causes the serious emission of greenhouse gases (EIA 2015). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 87% of the energy produced in the United States in 2019 was generated from non-renewable sources.Footnote 1 Non-renewable energy sources cause severe damage to the environment, which translates into significant health risks (Ohdoko et al. 2013). For example, the particle pollution from coal-fired power plants in the United States caused 13,200 premature deaths, 9,700 additional hospitalizations and 20,000 heart attacks in 2010 alone (Schneider and Banks 2010). The health-related costs associated with air pollution from coal-fired power plants are estimated to be more than $102 billion per year. Therefore, a major area of research need is how to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from energy production (Haines et al. 2009). Considering the total energy demand in the United States and the cost associated with setting up renewable energy plants, it would be impossible to shut down all non-renewable power plants immediately. A significant decrease in energy demand achieved via energy-saving residential and commercial installations combined with the adoption of renewable sources of energy can substantially reduce emissions and potentially make a viable transition to clean energy. This paper examines the effectiveness of punishing and rewarding incentives on ad valorem emission tax based on energy consumption in a laboratory experimental setting. To bring a more realistic context to the experimental design, the key parameters (e.g., income, major expenditures, and energy consumption) are calibrated to match with local census data as much as possible. The study also analyzes how subjects change their behavior as they receive information on energy-saving efforts made by their peers. In this experiment, subjects are presented with a context-rich incentivized game that captures elements of public good characteristics, risk, and intertemporal discounting. Subjects as households’ heads decide how much to spend on energy-saving technology that will reduce future energy costs for themselves and will also decrease the health risks and associated medical expenses for everyone in the group. Discounting is induced by subjects’ ability to save with interests across years (rounds). Each subject plays three sections (baseline, treatment, and repeated baseline) and each section is comprised of 30 rounds with a threshold public good where the emission tax level depends on overall energy-saving choices made by the group. In a companion paper, Chatterjee et al. (2021) examine the role of health insurance in reducing energy consumption and emission risk. This study addresses some existing challenges in the adoption of sustainable energy conservation practices. First, the environmental benefit of reduced emission from energy conservation is presented in terms of reduction in health risk directly proportional to total energy consumption. Second, to incorporate the non-monetary benefit of adoption, the energy-saving choices are described as not cost-effective if they do not result in health risk reduction (and associated medical expenses). The energy-saving choices are cost-effective when an expected decrease in group medical expenditure is accounted for. Third, monthly energy expenses are set to a realistic portion of total expenditure and income. The default energy bill is set at 0.67% of the consumption expenditure and 4% of annual income. Subjects appear to have a significant learning curve leading to incremental adoption over time. They also tend to adopt more if the change in the level of emission tax is framed as a reward rather than a punishment. No significant change in behavior was found when subjects can observe the decision made by their peers and the aggregate energy-saving choices made by the group.",3

Although municipal waste represents a small fraction of the total waste generated in the EU (approximately 7–10%), the EU legislator (EU 2018) has focused on municipal waste management as a key factor in waste prevention.Footnote 1 Municipal solid waste is among the most complex kinds to manage, because it raises challenges entangled, with a variety of administrative, economic, and social problems. The efficient and effective management of this waste stream is, therefore, commonly accompanied by better performance in overall waste management (Malinauskaite et al. 2017). The European Waste Framework Directive established that by 2020 the recycled fraction of municipal waste should be increased to a minimum of overall 50% by weight. The Circular Economy Package, among other ambitious objectives, set new municipal-waste-recycling targets for the subsequent years. By 2025, at least 55% of municipal waste by weight will have to be recycled, 60% by 2030, and 65% by 2035 [EU 2018, Art. 1(12)]. To cope with the direction and targets set by the EU and the implied modifications to national laws, municipal waste management, often organized at regional or local level, has adopted different strategies. However, some converging trends are clearly identifiable, such as the introduction of curbside (door-to-door, DtD) collection programs which require users to separate their waste at home.Footnote 2 Curbside collection is financed by either the flat-fees system or the pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) pricing system. The latter makes the user’s cost an increasing function of the unsorted waste produced, generating an incentive to reduce the unsorted waste and increase the fraction recycled. A number of studies estimated the impact of PAYT pricing systems on household recycling behavior. Empirical findings generally point to a significant positive effect on recyclable waste and a negative impact on the amount of unsorted waste (Allers and Hoeben 2010; Bucciol et al. 2015; Bueno and Valente 2019; Carattini et al. 2018; Dijkgraaf and Gradus 2004, 2009; Ferrara and Missios 2005; Gellynck and Verhelst 2007; Kinnaman and Fullerton 2000; Usui 2008; Yang and Innes 2007).Footnote 3 Apart from the costs of being technological equipped to adopt a unit pricing system, the PAYT pricing system could be affected by a further limit: it might generate the incentive to waste tourism or illicit waste dumping or burning (Fullerton and Kinnaman 1995; Kinnaman and Fullerton 2000; Kinnaman 2006). Bucciol et al. (2015) found that in the province of Treviso (Veneto, Italy) PAYT induced illegal dumping, although only limited to those municipalities in which the PAYT system was introduced when the fraction recycled was already high. The assessment of the effectiveness of the PAYT system is further complicated by its frequent coexistence with DtD collection programs. It is, therefore, not easy to distinguish the effect of the former from the latter. Bucciol et al. (2015) disentangled the effect of the PAYT system from the one of DtD collection. They found that, while the impact of the DtD collection is rather flat but increasing with respect to the initial level of fraction recycled, the effect of the PAYT system negatively depends on it. If a municipality starts from a fraction recycled of 60%, the DtD program is able to increase it further, while the introduction of the PAYT does not modify it. This paper is inspired by the latter result reported in Bucciol et al. (2015). Given that PAYT is ineffective when the fraction of waste recycled is already high, are there other systems with which to increase the fraction recycled when it is already satisfactory? We answer this question by assessing the effectiveness of a program started in 2013 in the province of Macerata (Marche, Italy). The program has been aimed at improving the fraction recycled and reducing the unsorted waste in a province where the fraction recycled was already substantial. The program consists in the embedding of microchips in the bags for DtD collection. Users are obliged to use the microchipped bags and to leave them on the curb on designated days. When users collect their microchipped bags from the waste collection company’s distribution point, each bag in the roll is coupled with the user’s information (name and address) through the microchip. Hence, the microchip enables the local police to identify the users that have left the bags on the curb, check whether they have sorted the waste properly, and fine the users not complying with the mandatory rules for recycling. The program started in municipalities with DtD collection, a flat-fee pricing system, and an already high amount of waste recycled, on average above 70%. Differently from the province of Treviso where the PAYT pricing system was introduced in some municipalities (Bucciol et al. 2015), in the province of Macerata the waste management company opted for fines (or the threat of punishment) for those users not complying with the mandatory recycling rules. This choice was in line with the advice stemming from the results in Bucciol et al. (2015) for municipalities already with a large fraction of recycled waste: given the already large commitment to recycling in the province of Macerata and the risk of encouraging illicit waste dumping and burning, the switch to a PAYT system could have been unfruitful or detrimental. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we show that also where the fraction of recycled waste is already high, there is still room for improvement using the ‘stick’, i.e., a simple system to identify users not complying with the recycling rules and fine them. This was implemented without a major change in the organization of waste management and without a significant risk of illicit dumping or burning, which could instead characterize the shift to a unit-based pricing system. We, therefore, complement the analysis in Bucciol et al. (2015), because they showed that the DtD coupled with a PAYT system is not effective when the fraction recycled is already high, while we prove that DtD coupled with a system based on the threat of sanctions for non-compliers has the potential to improve waste sorting behavior, even if the fraction recycled is already large. Second, our empirical analysis is based on an administrative and detailed dataset on waste collection at municipality level and robust natural experiment econometric methods allowing for time-constant and time-varying effects of unobservables. The estimated results are, therefore, interpretable as the causal effects of the microchipped bag program under weak assumptions. Our identifying assumptions are in fact weaker than those of other studies investigating similar issues, e.g., Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2009), Allers and Hoeben (2010) and Bucciol et al. (2015). The first of these studies controlled for neither time-constant nor time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. The latter two got rid of spurious effects induced by municipality fixed-effects. However, the difference-in differences approach in Bucciol et al. (2015) was not made robust to time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. Allers and Hoeben (2010) took into account biases due to possible time-varying unobserved heterogeneity, but they resorted to the exogeneity of excluded instruments and to parametric assumptions on the first stage equation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes waste management in the area under analysis and the main features of the microchipped bag program. Section 3 presents the dataset and the sample used for the empirical analysis. Section 4 explains the econometric models and the strategies used to identify of the causal effect of the program. Section 5 reports and comments on the main findings. Section 6 concludes.",

It partially replaced traditional tax and administrative forms of regulation (including grandfathering, i.e. giving polluters permits in proportion to past pollution), with a cap-and-trade mechanism in which the right to emit a certain amount of CO2 is a tradable and bankable commodity.Footnote 1 The system permits buying emissions allowances, namely permissions to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent in a specified period. Allowances are assigned to participating installations and aircraft operators in the EU who bid for their acquisition. The auction cap, i.e. the maximum amount of GHG emissions allowed for allocation, operates in combination with a trading system. The latter allows participants that reduce their GHG emissions further than required, and consequently bank their unused permissions, to trade their excess allowances with other participants who have a shortage of allowances or to use them to cover their own future emissions. As borrowing is not allowed, permission to sell unused allowances is a means to increase the liquidity of the market. The EU–ETS cap-and-trade auction system is designed as a competitive (i.e. single price) multiunit auction aiming at pursuing cost effective and economically efficient reductions of GHG emissions by producing price signals that should reflect the abatement costs as well as the scarcity of the allowances. Auction efficiency requires that allowances should go to bidders who value them most, i.e. those who have the highest marginal cost of reducing emissions. Participants with lower marginal cost and higher elasticity of substitution between polluting and non-polluting means of production would rather choose other ways to abate their emissions and comply with environmental regulation, e.g. by production optimization and investment in low carbon technology. On the contrary, buying allowances at the auction is supposed to ensure a quick, simple, and least bureaucratic way to permit those who face dissimilar technological and economic constraints to carry on profitably with polluting production and continue business as usual. Auctioning has progressively become the default method for allocating allowances, not only in Europe.Footnote 2 Yet, according to the official EU website, EU-ETS has become the world's first major carbon market and observers estimate that it has contributed to the decrease of the overall trend in carbon emissions within the EU-ETS sectorsFootnote 3—mainly in the electricity sectorFootnote 4—although it is yet unclear to what extent. EU-ETS operates in all EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and the UK. It limits emissions from more than 11,000 heavy energy-using installations (power stations and industrial plants) and airlines operating between these countries and covers around 45% of the EU's GHG emissions. Many sectors and gases are includedFootnote 5 and 300 million allowances are set aside in the New Entrants Reserve (NER) to fund the deployment of innovative, renewable energy technologies and carbon capture and storage through the NER 300 program.Footnote 6 Since 2005, the implementation of the EU-ETS system has gone through different trading periods (officially called Phases) and auction rules have been somehow modified from one phase to the next. In the first and second phases (2005–2007 and 2008–2012, respectively), the average ratio between allowances demanded and the total available allowances (called Cover Ratio and measured as the ratio between the bid volume and the available volume in the auction) was about 1 and 4% respectively. It indicated the realization of serious imbalances of allowances. Indeed, during the period 2009–2013, an enormous oversupply occurred, and the allowance market built up a huge “bank” of allowances having since 2008 an infinite lifetime. Note that in 2013–2014 the bank was even larger than a whole year of allowance supply (Vollebergh and Brink 2020, p. 3). The reforms of the EU-ETS rules and the launch of the third phase (2013–2020) lead to some important changes. The number of bidders increased with respect to previous periods and the Cover Ratio reduced from 4 times to just twice. This might indicate that the new rules permitted a reduction of the imbalances and generated a tendency towards long run equilibrium, a result not achieved in previous phases. With the linear reduction factor adopted in the revised EU-ETS Directive of 2018, the supply of allowances is expected to be zero in 2057. Since the decreasing cap implies that the cap will become more and more restrictive, banking helps to smooth the impact of the restrictions as it provides for intertemporal flexibility in the trade of allowances. Towards the end of phase III (January 2019), a Market Stabilizing Reserve (MSR) system was introduced to further reduce excess supply phenomena.Footnote 7 The current system is regulated by Emissions Trading System (phase IV: 2021–2030).Footnote 8 The purpose of this paper is to analyze the equilibrium price behavior of Phase III of EU-ETS auctions. It focuses first on the properties of the underlying stochastic price process generated by bidding behavior and then evaluates the effects on this dynamic of the above-mentioned measures introduced at the beginning and towards the end of Phase III to reduce excess supply and make the market more efficient. More specifically, after describing the main characteristics of the EU-ETS auction mechanism, the paper analyses in Sect. 2 the properties of the equilibrium prices realized at each auction round as they are generated by optimal bid strategies. In doing so, the paper analyses the link between equilibrium prices and bidders’ valuation of both winning and non-winning bidders. Then, in Sect. 3, the paper analyzes the stationarity property of the de-trended prices series and evaluates if their mean, variance, and covariance follow some discernible trend or if they meander without constant long-run mean or variance. Considerations derived from the properties of optimal bid functions (Sect. 2) and the results of empirical analysis of Sect. 3 suggest that the variance of the auction equilibrium price is not constant and to capture series’ characteristics like skewness, excess kurtosis and the volatility behavior the modeling of the returns of emission allowances should depart from the random walk hypothesis. Section 4 contains and comments all these estimation results. In Sect. 5, different versions of a multivariate GARCH model are tested and different variance equations are estimated to analyze what factors affect price volatility and how the estimated volatility (the estimated conditional variance) has evolved over time. It is found that the number of successful bidders as well as the total monetary amount bid affect negatively, as expected on the basis of results obtained in Sect. 2, the equilibrium price whereas the total number of bidders (winners and non-winners) and the cover ratio (interpretable as a measure of the inefficiency of the trading mechanism) reduce volatility. Results show that Phase III reforms are factors explaining the estimated conditional variance and that adjustment schemes and unlimited banking might have contributed to increase the liquidity of the market but have also increased its volatility. On the contrary, the bid spread (the difference between maximum and minimum bid in each auction round) increases equilibrium prices. Finally, predicted prices and availability of bid data permit the estimation of bidders’ surplus (difference between estimated willingness to pay and actual payment) realized during the entire Phase III (and the end of Phase II). The time path of the surplus (generated by the informational rent given by bidders’ private information on pollution technology) is shown in Sect. 6, where one can appreciate its sharp increase realized during the last part of Phase III. Conclusions are presented in Sect. 7 where I emphasize the link constructed in this paper between the results of a theoretical bidding model and the statistical properties of the time series of equilibrium prices as a key element for the interpretation of the GARCH outcomes. Interpretations of the empirical results is also offered in terms of policy issues.",

The policy is also desirable for generating tax revenue as a “second dividend” (idem). However, in practice, over the previous few decades, the instrument has faced great opposition. Kallbekken and Saelen (2011) list many examples of unsuccessful attempts to introduce the tax, including the carbon taxation in France in 2010, which was revisited in the “gilets jaune” demonstrations of 2018 (Dounne 2018; Carattini et al. 2019), with another recent case being the carbon tax repeal in Australia in 2014 (Australian government 2014). It is also remarkable the rejection, by 92% of Swiss voters, of an energy tax that would replace the value-added tax (Baranzini and Carattini 2017). Acceptance may be increased by recycling tax revenue in a way that taxpayers are pre-informed about. What could be done with earmarking to specific expenditures recognized as beneficial (Baranzini and Carattini 2017; Carattini et al. 2019; Gevrek and Uyduranoglu 2015; Kallbekken et al. 2011, Saelen and Kallbekken, 2011) or with the more direct and uncertainty-free approach of returning part of the own tax paid. The latter was shown in experimental studies to increase tax compliance further than the negative incentive of ex-post payment of taxes due (Robben et al. 1990; Fochmann and Wolf 2019), thus one is left to wonder whether similar pro-tax attitudes, such as acceptance before the tax is introduced, would be as well stimulated. What is coherent with the quasi-experimental results of Engström et al. (2015) and Rees-Jones (2018) evidencing that tax returns are perceived as income gains under loss-aversion and tax liability uncertainty, in line with prospect theory. Tax return, in the deterministic context in which Pigouvian taxation is generally framed, is rigorously not a gain, but since it nevertheless reduces the tax due, it may increase acceptance. This of course depends on public’s perception of tax effectiveness to correct the externality level (Baranzini and Carattini, 2017), after return is discounted, and on how strong is “tax aversion”, i.e., the propensity to attach a higher value to each dollar owed as taxes (Cherry et al. 2012; Kallbekken et al. 2011). Additionally, from a potentially positive “acceptance-effect” of tax return, one should not conclude on its efficiency. The incentive to reduce the externality is diminished as the effective tax rate is discounted in the exact magnitude of the return. There is, then, an “efficiency-effect”, so that a Pigouvian tax return is intrinsically prone to a trade-off between public acceptance and implementation of the efficient externality level (Cherry et al. 2012, 2017). To reveal how severe such trade-off is, the objective of this paper is to estimate the acceptance and efficiency effects of tax return. By relying on a laboratory experiment, three contributions are made for the ongoing debate on the feasibility of Pigouvian taxation. First, the scantly studied trade-off between acceptance and efficiency is addressed by estimating tax return’s effect on each dimension and by deriving a decomposition formula measuring the extent in which efficiency is determined by acceptance. Second, going beyond the dichotomy between absence and presence of revenue recycling that dominates the literature, the effects of different degrees of tax return are assessed. Third, without parallel in previous studies, a theoretical model is developed both as a source of refutable hypotheses and as basis for assessing the plausibility of standard rationality assumptions, thus enhancing the knowledge on behavioural patterns behind acceptance and efficiency. The contributions are important due to two main facts. The first is that tax return is not the only form of revenue recycling that diminishes the tax rate. This “side-effect”, which may be also caused by earmarking,Footnote 1 has efficiency implications that remain ignored. In Kallbekken et al. (2011), the transfer of revenue to a specific social group proved to be effective in increasing acceptance. The authors, however, did not investigate how efficiency was affected by the fact that, for the beneficiary group, the transfer was a tax return, even if a function of all taxpayers’ contributions (as detailed in Sect. 2 below). The same applies to Heres et al. (2017), in which a fixed percent of aggregate tax revenue was returned seeking to balance fiscal budget within each group of experiment’s participants. What could be anticipated as a tax discount, especially in the treatment with full information about the balancing procedure. The need to balance fiscal budget within small groups of subjects, which is imposed by the experimental design adopted in the two mentioned papers, is not without implications for treatment identification (see Sect. 2). The implicit tax rate reduction confounder was here avoided by having tax return itself as the treatment, which was presented in a fully transparent way to participants as resulting into tax rate reduction, similarly as in Cherry et al (2012 and 2017). Our contributions are also important because the potential of a reduced tax rate to increase public support is suggested by real externality taxes having rates smaller than marginal external cost. For instance, Shmelev and Speck (2018), argued that the Swedish carbon tax rate is not Pigouvian and a lower-than-optimal rate is applied in USA's and China’s gasoline tax (Parry and Small 2005; Lin and Zeng 2014). In addition, the tax returns directly granted to households and companies as means for revenue-neutrality may have contributed for majority acceptance of carbon tax in the Canadian province of British Columbia (Murray and Rivers 2015; Carattini et al. 2019) and 36% of global carbon pricing revenue is returned to the public (Carl and Fedor 2016). Additionally, it should be emphasized that tax return is equivalent, from a social accounting perspective, to the recycling of tax revenue as reduction of tax rates on consumption and income, which were assessed by Lee et al. (2018), as in both cases, purchasing power loss is mitigated. Authors demonstrate the macroeconomic rationale for such recycling by showing that it does not only avoids GDP to fall with introduction of carbon taxation but may also increase it, as informed by simulations of a post-Keynesian computational model for the Japanese economy. Despite its concrete relevance, the implications of a suboptimal tax rate were not discussed by other studies exploring the acceptance effect of pre-informed revenue recycling (Kalbekken and Aasen, 2016; Sec 3.3., Saelen and Kalbekken, 2011, and Gevrek and Uyduranoglu 2015), the two exceptions, although not focussing on recycling, being Cherry et al. (2012 and 2017). In the laboratory experiment of this paper, participants, by buying and reselling, created external damage to each other. They also voted to introduce or not a tax on purchases. The treatments applied corresponded to the degree of return measured as the fraction of tax recycled directly to the taxpayer. As this increased profits and implied a reduced tax rate, the acceptance-efficiency trade-off was introduced by design. A theoretical model informed the selection of the treatment levels and hypotheses tested. Results revealed that foregoing 50% of efficiency is justifiable as means for greater acceptance but a larger sacrifice, of 80%, is unjustified, what makes tax return a limited effectiveness device. Acceptance also proved to be a pivotal component of efficiency. Regarding participants’ behaviour, four deviations from the “rational voting assumption” basing the theoretical model were observed. First, mild suboptimization of own quantity and second, not expecting others to choose quantity optimally. Third, voting was not fully based on profit. Fourth, quantity and vote were strategically chosen, a sharp departure from a standard assessment of the decision problems that was missed by previous experimental studies. The remainder of the paper begins by presenting the theoretical model grounding experiment’s design and tested hypotheses. The experimental procedure is described in section three. The data is analysed with unconditional and conditional statistical approaches in section four and a coupled discussion and conclusion closes the paper.",

During the last five decades, several climate agreements and United Nations climate talks (i.e., the Kyoto protocol, Copenhagen and Cancun, the Paris agreement etc.) have been implemented, and concluded with the resolution of achieving climate change mitigation goals. These consist of actions to limit the rate and magnitude of global warming and its related impacts on human life, especially those on agriculture. The United Nations’ efforts are to target and strategically limit and reduce CO2 emissions. The greatest industrialized countries are primarily committed to reducing gas emissions, and to switch their economic activity toward friendly environmental tools. They are clearly committed to participating in the implementation of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) before 2030, where climate action is the thirteenth goal. Unfortunately, agriculture is the sector most affected by climate change. According to previous empirical studies on the economic impact of climate change (IPCC,Footnote 1 2007; (Müller et al. 2011; Zaied and Cheikh 2015; Waldman and Richardson 2018), 20% of losses resulting from climate change will occur within agriculture, especially in relation to small and medium-size farmers’ profits. Consequently, any adaptation measure within the climate action’s SDG should seriously and fundamentally consider the preservation of the agriculture sector. Since a long time, the role played by climate and weather conditions is crucial in determining the types of crops grown by farmers and the yield at harvest time. However, in recent decades, the variability of weather caused by climate change has destabilized agricultural productivity and consequently had a negative impact on farmers’ profits. Indeed, several research papers have argued and confirmed that climate change leads to an acute loss in agricultural productivity (Chen et al. 2016); (Maia et al. 2018); (Amadu et al. 2020); (Veljanoska 2018)). North and sub-Saharan African countries will lose more than 35 million tonsFootnote 2 of their cereal production as a result of anticipated climate changes before 2030. The productivity of agricultural crops might be affected by climate change through multiple channels. For instance, the increase in average temperature and evapotranspiration will increase the need for water resources for crop production. However, if there is no corresponding increase in precipitation, these countries are likely to experience serious crop failure, and annual productivity will go down. Furthermore, the increases in average temperatures have, in most cases, been associated with increased incidence of disease and forest fire. Temperature is a key factor that affects the development and yields of crops. In critical phenophasesFootnote 3 of crops, high temperature may damage crop yields. However, temperature is a key factor in the development of crops, and low temperature may also damage crop yields. Therefore, weather variabilities and climate change are crucial and need to be understood to limit their future impacts on agricultural crops. The notion of threshold in temperature and rainfall can be determined by the threshold value being empirically estimated by the appropriate econometric model. Consequently, several studies have been developed investigating the climate–agriculture nexus, and predicting the impact of climate change on agricultural crops. The threshold concept has been used to identify the level of response in crops to climate change. Utilizing US data on temperature distribution on each day and across all days in the growing season, (Schlenker and Roberts 2009) showed that daily temperature is harmful for crops, only when it surpasses the threshold of 30 °C for soybeans, 29 °C for corn, and 32 °C for cotton. Conversely, they showed that the yields increase under these thresholds. Additionally, in the case of Africa, (Hulme et al. 2001) have argued that an increase by 2 °C in the minimum temperature would reduce rice yield at the rate of 0.71 ton/ha, while a 1 °C rise in the mean temperature would have no significant impact on wheat yields. According to the uncertainty in predicting climate change impacts on agriculture is basically due to temperature, rather than rainfall. They conclude that crops’ yield sensitivity to temperature was a critical source of uncertainty. In addition, they argued that rainfall plays a critical role in the year-to-year variability of production. One standard deviation change in precipitation is associated with a 10% change in production. Temperature also plays an important role, but it is slightly less important than rainfall. They argued that rainfall is very important for agriculture compared to temperature. The present paper proposes a novel approach that allows for a possible presence of a threshold effect in the climate change mechanism. Climate factors, such as temperature and rainfall, might have a varied impact on crops with respect to a turning point. For this purpose, we implement recent nonlinear panel data techniques, namely panel smooth transition (PSTR) models, where climate variables are allowed to influence agriculture yield in a nonlinear way. The main advantage of the PSTR framework is that the possible presence of a threshold effect is not given a priori, but instead is captured endogenously and correctly for the data. More interestingly, this approach allows for the interaction between climate factors in their impact on crop yields: on the one hand, we can measure the impact of temperature with respect to the level (or change) of rainfall; on the other hand, we are able to gauge the effect of rainfall on agriculture depending on the level (or change) of temperature. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has considered such interactions using nonlinear panel data econometric techniques.Footnote 4 Thus, we have originated new insights using PSTR modelling. Our study is conducted using disaggregated data collected from 24 Tunisian regions over a period of 37 years, from 1980 to 2016. The main results from our modeling of the link between climate and agriculture reveal that the impact of temperature on crops increases when rainfall (in terms of level and change) surpasses a given threshold (see Tables 3 and 4). This outcome is in line with expectations as cereals need temperature to grow during their life cycle. In addition, our empirical estimates indicate that the positive impact of rainfall on crops is declining for higher levels and changes in the temperature (See Tables 5 and 6). This outcome would point out the negative impact of global warming on agriculture, especially in the Mediterranean region (see IPPC special report “Global Warming of 1.5 °C”). Indeed, even if rainfall might increase agricultural productivity, higher saved temperature, especially during the last decade in north Africa, is likely to absorb the benefit of dry seasons and promote severe drought. This paper calls for the implementation of a public policy privileging and subsidizing the threatened areas. Adaptation measures should include the implementation of a water demand management system that promotes using scarce water resources more efficiently. Moreover, policymakers should seriously consider encouraging the development of drought-tolerant crops, especially in the south of Tunisia where global warming has caused a severe drought. In the north of Tunisia, adaptation measures may include choosing tree species and forestry practices that are less vulnerable to storms and fires, especially in Jendouba, the highly forested region of Tunisia. However, to promote the implementation of SDGs, and specifically the thirteenth that is related to climate action, Tunisia, as well as neighboring countries in the Middle East and North Africa, is committed to reducing emissions of climate pollutant, and to making an effort to switch to clean energy and industry. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the data and their properties. Section 3 explains the empirical methodology. Finally, Sect. 4 discusses the empirical results, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",
25.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,16 November 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-022-00354-w,Regulation of aquaculture production,April 2023,Frank Jensen,Rasmus Nielsen,Henrik Meilby,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Seafood production from aquaculture has increased rapidly, and in 2017, the global output was 112 million tons, including 53.4 million tons of various fish species [see, e.g., FAO (2018)]. Nevertheless, FAO (2017) estimates that an additional 23 million tons of seafood is needed to fulfil global nutritional requirements. Growing populations, increasing income and shifts in preferences toward healthier foods may increase the demand for seafood even more. At a global level, the production from aquaculture and capture fisheries are approximately equal due to the stagnation of capture fisheries and the tremendous growth in aquaculture production. Specifically, since 1990, production from capture fisheries for human consumption has been almost constant, at a level of 70 million tons annually, whereas aquaculture production has experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately 6% [see FAO (2018)]. Thus, economic analyses of aquaculture production have become increasingly important [see Anderson et al. (2019)]. A major problem is that aquaculture production generates a number of negative externalities, including the spread of diseases, chemicals and antibiotics (see Anderson et al. 2019), but nutrient discharges have probably received the most attention (see Tveterås 2002; Asche et al. 2009 and Nielsen 2012 Lack). However, to keep the following analysis as general as possible, we use the term ‘discharges of pollutants’ to cover all negative externalities generated by aquaculture production. Given the discharges of pollutants, regulation of aquaculture production may become necessary. Note that land-based freshwater-fish farming is the dominant production method, contributing with 87% of the volume and 74% of the value of production [see FAO (2017)]. With land-based farming, it is possible to control pollutant discharges; therefore, regulation of at least a part of aquaculture producers is technologically feasible [see Nielsen (2011, 2012) and Nielsen et al. (2014)]. However, the existing regulation of aquaculture production is largely undertaken by using command and control instruments, such as feed quotas, limits to freshwater use and maximum fish density [see, e.g., OECD (2011)]. Furthermore, the recommendations of regulatory measures proposed by FAO (2013) are also dominated by command and control rules, which are economically inefficient [see, e.g., Cole and Grossman (1999)]. Thus, it appears useful to discuss economically optimal ways to regulate aquaculture production.Footnote 1 Decision and regulatory variables are important issues for an economic analysis of the regulation of aquaculture production. As Guttormsen (2008) indicated, one possibility is to describe aquaculture production as a process where a producer releases a certain amount of recruits into ponds, feeds these for some time and then harvests them when an appropriate weight has been reached. Thus, an aquaculture producer decides whether small or large fish are harvested, and this partly depends on the amount of time that the fish spend in the pond. Following the same line of reasoning, Bjørndal (1988) characterized fish in a pond as a growing capital, and the objective is, therefore, to identify the optimal point in time for harvesting fish that maximizes the present value of the profit from aquaculture production. The arguments by Guttormsen (2008) and Bjørndal (1988) indicate that the rotation timeFootnote 2 may be an important decision variable, albeit not the only one, for an aquaculture producer. Aquaculture production may, therefore, have much in common with optimal rotation problems investigated in the classical forest economics literature [see, e.g., Karp et al. (1986)]. Since the amount of pollutants discharged from aquaculture varies over time, it may also be useful to clarify how externalities (and regulation of externalities) can be related to rotation time. A number of scientific papers have studied the optimal rotation time for aquaculture production. Hean (1994) and Bjørndal (1988) developed single rotation models, but as Guttormsen (2008) pointed out, a problem with these models is that it is unclear what happens after the rotation ends. Therefore, it seems more reasonable to take infinite rotations into account, which is in line with the classical Faustmann model for forestry.Footnote 3 Papers adopting this approach include Arnason (1992), Heaps (1993, 1995) and Guttormsen (2008). Common to the literature studying the optimal rotation time for aquaculture production is that disaggregated models are used in the sense that the number, mortality and weight of fish are explicitly included. Furthermore, to our knowledge, rotation time models have not previously been used to discuss the optimal regulation of aquaculture production. The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap. Inspired by the classical forest economics literature, we use rotation time as both a control and regulatory variable and take an infinite sequence of identical rotations into account. With the purpose of identifying optimal regulation, we depart from a general model that can be used to express the Faustmann and Hartman model as special cases. The Faustmann case represents our private optimum, while the Hartman case represents our social optimum. Because we focus on the optimal regulation of an aquaculture producer, we operate with general profit and environmental damage cost functions, contrary to the literature on aquaculture production that uses the rotation time as a decision variable (see above). Furthermore, we take the quality of fish explicitly into account in the profit function by including a variable that depends on the rotation time and assume that the quality of fish is reflected in the prices for different sizes of fish. In our analysis of the social optimum, a damage cost function is considered, which is defined as the damage cost in each time period during a rotation. The damage cost is assumed to depend on the rotation time, and including it in the model causes a difference between the private and social optimum. As a regulation instrument, we suggest a total tax scheme, collected at the end of each rotation, related to the rotation time based on the total discounted damage costs. We also investigate the implications for our regulatory recommendations of relaxing several assumptions in the basic model, but for the sake of consistency, we only present modeling extensions that can be expressed as special cases of our general model. Examples of these extensions include differences between social and private revenue functions and discount rates. Since our paper is inspired by the forest economics literature, it is useful to briefly summarize its relation to this literature. At least three strands of the forest economics literature are relevant for this paper. First, our work is related to the literature on optimal rotation time when a standing forest has benefits or costs [see, e.g., Hartman (1976)]. The total benefits or costs of a standing forest are defined as the sum of the discounted value during an entire rotation. Examples of benefits and costs discussed in the literature are biodiversity [see, e.g., Juutinen (2008) and Caparros and Jacquemont (2003)], carbon sequestration [see, e.g., van Kooten et al. (1995) and Price and Willis (2011)], forage and water production [see, e.g., Strange et al. (1999) and Calish et al. (1978)], backcountry biking [see, e.g., Englin (1990)], recreational fishing and hunting [see, e.g., Calish et al. (1978)] and resin tapping [see, e.g., Wang (2006)]. However, in the forest economics literature, it is often unclear whether the benefits or costs of a standing forest are collected by a forest owner or society [see, e.g., Boman et al. (2010) for a discussion]. It is clear that our study is related to this literature since the total damage is defined in the same way as the benefits and costs of a standing forest, but we explicitly argue that the damage cost of pollutants is taken into account by a social planner but not by an aquaculture producer. Second, our paper is related to a small strand of literature on the optimal regulation of forests due to the impacts of climate change. Tahvonen (1995) used a general equilibrium model and showed that a subsidy to increase the stock size of trees should be provided because of the carbon storage capacity. At the same time, a tax on the flow of CO2 emissions should be imposed on all sectors in the economy to reduce pollution. Gong and Kristrom (1999) and West et al. (2019) used partial equilibrium models and considered a subsidy to increase the optimal rotation time in forests. In both papers, the subsidy was provided to increase carbon sequestration in trees. Our paper is inspired by this literature in the sense that we discuss the optimal regulation of an aquaculture producer based on rotation time. However, in the papers by Tahvonen (1995), Gong and Kristrom (1999) and West et al. (2019), the regulation of CO2 emissions was discussed specifically, while we discuss the regulation of pollutant discharges in a more general way. Finally, our paper is related to the forest economics literature on the optimal rotation time when the quality of timber matters. Here, it is useful to distinguish between: a. models with an exogenous quality; and b. models with an endogenous quality. Concerning a., it is common to assume that quality aspects are reflected in the price of timber, and MacDonald and Hubert (2002) provided an overview of parts of this literature.Footnote 4 Regarding b., one approach is to set up large numerical simulation models with additional control variables apart from the rotation time, which implies that quality may become endogenous. Examples of papers adopting this approach include Tahvonen et al. (2013) and Hyytiainen and Tahvonen (2002). Our paper is related to both a. and b. in the sense that we include the quality of fish in the models, but to maintain generality, we express quality in a very simple way in our models by using a variable that depends on the rotation time.Footnote 5 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present our basic model for a private and social optimum, which is used to discuss optimal regulation, while the implications of relaxing several assumptions behind the basic model for the regulatory recommendations are discussed in Sect. 3. The paper is concluded, and several limitations are discussed in Sect. 4.",
25.0,2.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,06 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-022-00357-7,The future of transport-related emissions in dense urban areas: an analysis of various policy scenarios with MOLES,April 2023,Ioannis Tikoudis,Walid Oueslati,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Reducing air pollution and curbing CO2 emissions from urban transport constitute two timely challenges. The latter is an urgent policy priority due to the impact climate change may have on natural systems (IPCC 2019) and the global economy (OECD 2015a, 2016). The former is a key public health priority, as poor air quality is responsible for one in every nine deaths (WHO 2016). Air pollution imposes a significant social cost, since exposure to it results in higher rates of morbidity, absenteeism, partial disability and productivity losses (OECD 2016). Cities are key in the effort to reduce both types of emissions. Urban areas are major energy consumers, generating the largest part of global CO2. They are also the loci where the issue of air pollution is mostly pronounced, as large concentrations of air pollutants are typically observed in densely populated areas (Lanzi and Dellink 2019). Coming up with a socially desirable remedy can be complicated, as the ideal policy mix has to face these interrelated issues simultaneously, while ensuring economic efficiency and satisfying fiscal constraints. Moreover, it should not interfere with economic growth or exacerbate existing inequalities. This study examines the impact of various policies in both types of emissions in densely populated cities, using Santiago (Chile) as a reference. The role of transport in curbing emissions is crucial. In Latin America, the transport sector contributes to 55% of NOX, over 30% of CO and roughly 20% of emitted PM2.5 (IEA 2016). Moreover, it generates a substantial part of SO2 and VOC, pollutants that are associated with a range of negative health impacts,Footnote 1 and is a major source of CO2 emissions. In Chile, transport-related CO2 emissions rose by 44% in 2000–2013, and currently account for 25% of the country’s total CO2e emissions (Gallardo et al. 2018). The goal of decarbonizing transport is highly related to that of reducing air pollution, as the two types of emissions largely originate from the combustion of motor fuels. To examine how relevant policies may affect these emissions, the present study uses multiple data inputs, projection techniques, and a new version of MOLES (Tikoudis and Oueslati 2017, 2021).Footnote 2 MOLES is an environmental economic model developed by the OECD to assess the environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency of urban policies. The model belongs to the family of urban Computable General Equilibrium models (u-CGE).Footnote 3 The version presented here focuses on some environmental by-products of economic activity in cities, in particular CO2 emissions and air pollution. To measure these by-products, MOLES accounts for different vehicle technologies, from pre-Euro to EURO 6. These technologies also coexist with electric vehicles and public transport. All technologies evolve with time. The forward simulations we present introduce new generations of vehicles, which possess improved fuel economy and embody better filters. In the same simulations, the carbon intensity of electricity, which powers EVs, declines with time, and public transport characteristics evolve as well. The paper offers a comparative analysis of a series of policy-relevant scenarios. It presents a reference scenario for the evolution of transport-related emissions of CO2, CO, NOX, VOC, PM2.5, SO2, N2O, and NH3 in the period 2020–2050. During this time, the current policy framework that applies to the transport sector in Santiago is kept constant. The study juxtaposes that scenario against a series of counterfactuals constructed out of three core policies. These include: (i) the rapid electrification of public bus fleets, (ii) a stringent carbon pricing scheme, and (iii) a vehicle vintage-differentiated kilometer charge. The policy analysis investigates the effectiveness of the various policy combinations in reducing emissions. Simultaneously, it takes into consideration the potential impact they may have on the balance of public budgets and on household welfare. The analysis of the reference scenario uncovers a striking difference between the trajectories of CO2 emissions and the various air pollutants. On the one hand, aggregate CO2 emissions from urban transport can be remarkably rigid to technological progress. The carbon footprint of Santiago’s transport system in 2050 is projected to be just 6% lower than its current level. In contrast, the corresponding reference emissions of CO, VOC, NOX and PM2.5 are projected to fall by 55–80% in the same period. This striking difference is due to the asymmetric evolution of capture technologies. Tailpipe filters continuously advance during the last 40 years, and are expected to continue improving throughout the time window 2020–2050. In contrast, carbon capture technologies in transport are in their infancy and any assumption about their long-run evolution is purely speculative. The analyses of counterfactual scenarios yield a set of key policy recommendations. First, the paper highlights the importance of ramping up the electrification of public bus fleets. That will decrease the current emissions from buses and fortify the green impact of tax-based policies increasing the pecuniary cost of car use. While such policies may promote the use of public transport, their environmental benefits are maximized only when buses operate with the greenest technology available. Second, we find that a carbon tax and a vehicle-differentiated kilometer charge are effective in inducing similar decreases in both the emissions of CO2 and the various air pollutants. That is, each policy can contribute to pursuing both environmental goals, as their tax bases greatly overlap. In turn, the finding suggests that any local or national authority in charge of these instruments could mitigate both environmental issues. Finally, we find that none of the two tax schemes will be welfare improving as a stand-alone policy. In contrast, combining them with a distinct revenue-recycling mechanism could secure that the immediate benefits exceed the imposed tax burdens. Our analysis shows that recycling the tax revenues with a horizontal lump-sum transfer can secure that the reform is welfare improving, even before we factor in the social benefits from carbon savings and air pollution reduction. Importantly, the inclusion of this revenue-recycling mechanism secures that the reform is welfare improving for all income segments. Therefore, the political acceptability of any such scheme will be largely determined by the presence of a dedicated mechanism to recycle the revenue from these tax instruments. The paper contributes to the literature in various ways. First, it expands the existing set of contributions on CO2 emissions and the role of urban transport policies in curbing it, by examining this role in a new setting (Santiago, Chile). Examples of earlier contributions include: Tscharaktschiew and Hirte (2010), who predict that Pigouvian tax on transport will reduce CO2 by 1–11%, depending on the social damage of CO2 in German cities; Anas et al. (2009), who predict that a 10% increase in the cost of a car trip in Beijing will reduce CO2 by 1%; Tikoudis and Oueslati (2021), who suggest reducing CO2 from Auckland’s (New Zealand) transport system by 45% requires a drastic combination of a kilometric charge (0.40 NZD/km) and a fuel tax (0.60 NZD/km); Domon et al. (2022), who predict that a congestion toll and a carbon tax have the potential to reduce direct CO2 by 2.9% in Sendai, Japan. In line with these contributions, the present paper also pays specific attention to the role of the carbon tax, as that could be crystallized into the functions of the urban transport system. However, our work expands the scope of the aforementioned research to various air pollutant emissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to perform an analysis focusing on key air pollutants, like CO, SO2, VOC, NOX and PM2.5, in an applied urban equilibrium context.Footnote 4 By including these pollutants, the paper also expands the rapidly growing literature on the cross-effects of CO2 mitigation policies and pollution abatement policies by focusing on the synergies these policies may have in the transport sector.Footnote 5 We examine the co-benefits from addressing the two types of externalities (the local air pollutants and the global CO2) in an urban context and in a non-static manner, i.e., within the critical time window 2021–2050. The study provides an evaluation of policies accelerating the electrification of public bus fleets. From a technological viewpoint, previous contributions highlighted the overall importance of proliferating battery electric buses (BEBs). For instance, Holland et al. (2021) report that an old diesel bus produces 1.2 times the CO2 of a new diesel bus and 2.2 times the (well-to-wheel) CO2 of a BEB. In contrast, the marginal external cost from the air pollutants emitted by an old diesel bus kilometer is 19 times higher than the corresponding cost from a modern diesel bus kilometer.Footnote 6 Comparable figures are provided by Hensher et al. (2022) for Australia and by Mao et al. (2020) for China. Overall, the numbers from these technology-oriented contributions imply that: (i) the modernization of the public bus fleets (i.e., the replacement of old diesel buses by new ones) will not drastically reduce CO2 emissions, even if public transport is dominant; (ii) the same modernization will have a much more profound impact in the reduction of air pollution; and (iii) the electrification of public bus fleets (i.e., the replacement of diesel buses by electric ones) may have a considerable mitigation effect on CO2, especially if public transport possesses a substantial share of the modal split and the carbon intensity of electricity (CO2/kWh) production is low. The findings of our study are well in line with these hypotheses. Third, the study underlines that the environmental performance of externality taxes heavily depends on the presence of greener substitutes. The study makes also several methodological contributions, which we discuss along the way and in the Technical Appendix. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the methodological details of the study. That includes the reference scenario, the three core policy interventions examined in the simulations, as well as the way they are combined to form counterfactual policy scenarios. Section 3 discusses the findings from the various simulations. Section 4 discusses the policy implications of our findings and Sect. 5 concludes.",

In achieving this, the EU Commission has initiated the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to support transition to stop free allowances and in long term to reduce the risk of carbon leakage and ensure competitive price (European Commission 2019). CBAM can be imposed either as import tariffs for certain goods that imported to the EU or export rebates for the EU export. In early 2021, the EU Parliament expressed its support, and the first legislative proposal was released on July 14, 2021, as part of the Fit for 55 legislative packages (European Commission 2021b, c). On the other hand, the EU’s strong commitment and its unilateral move are still subject to caveats. EU contributions as an economic union are still limited to making meaningful differences in global emissions targets without equal effort from the major emitters such as China and the US. A coordinated multilateral action shall be considered since domestic reductions in emissions are likely counter-balance by emissions outside the EU (Condon and Ignaciuk 2013; Clora and Yu 2022). In addition to this, the carbon cost discrepancy has been expanding dramatically in the EU ETS sectors, indicating a higher growing burden on the European industries compared to other regions (Mathieu 2021). A climate alliance or club has been a long-discussed approach to global warming, as a study proposed by Nordhaus (2015). Aligning acclimate club with CBAM is feasible as participating countries could manage emissions at a stringent level and coordinate tariffs on imports to solve the leakage and burden sharing issue (Branger and Quirion 2014; Böhringer et al. 2021). The EU legislative proposal opens this opportunity to coordinate with the affected regions that motivates to form a climate club, which includes the opportunity for agreements with China and the USFootnote 1 since both have also committed to a more stringent climate approach to reach climate neutrality. With the US, the EU, and China accounting for 61% of the global gross domestic product and 43% of goods imports, forming a climate club has geopolitical advantages. A tripartite deal also supports China’s green revolution with no extra cost on the export (Li and Zhang 2012) and fits with the US’s strategy on China’s technology and intellectual property (Tagliapietra and Wolff 2021). A collective CBAM implementation involving the EU, China, and the US is critical to achieve universal abatement commitments from others. China and the US are net gainers from unilateral mitigations, but these net gains are bolstered by universal climate abatement (Perdana and Tyers 2020). An import tariff in CBAM increases production costs and acts as a punitive instrument that alter countries’ decisions to join and change other countries’ dominant strategy from free riding. As the cost of reducing emissions falls, the cost of joining the club will decline, so China and the US’ decisions to form a coalition and implement CBAM alongside the EU is a decisive factor for others countries to follow (Helm et al. 2012; Böhringer et al. 2016). This paper aims to assess the distributional impacts of the climate club of the EU, China, and the US imposing the CBAM. Despite studies measuring the implication of CBAM, none specifically focused on analyzing the impacts when a border tariff protection is implemented amongst a climate club consisting the EU, the US, and China.Footnote 2 Though the impacts of unilateral policy are measurable, the magnitude of the resulting leakage will depend on the current climate policies, implementing countries, and sectoral coverage. Unlike previous studies, we start the analysis from the current policy and climate targets for these regions, then move to their latest climate neutrality targets. CBAM is then introduced under this neutrality framework and being assessed for its potentials of CBAM to reduce emissions leakage, sectoral competitiveness, and their distributional allocations in each region or as a club. Scenario development also involves sectoral analysis, the basis and the adjustment tariff target in order to improve the global-cost effectiveness. Our analysis confirms that collective implementation reduces leakage and improves productivity especially in energy-intensive industries (EII). The collective implementation also improves welfare relative to a non-CBAM and or unilateral implementation, where welfare contribution from trade is stronger for the US than for the EU or China. The following section discusses the current literature of CBAM, the critical aspect and the implications. A modelling approach is addressed in Sect. 3, and Sect. 4 elaborates the scenario development, numerical results and analysis. Results are concluded in Sect. 5.",

Since Orr (1976) pointed out the importance of considering the impact of environmental policy instruments on innovation and the adoption of new technologies, many researchers have conducted theoretical studies to evaluate the incentives of policy instruments to innovate and adopt new technologies (e.g., Milliman and Prince 1989; Requate and Unold 2003). In addition, there are numerous other studies on the relationship between environmental regulation and innovation, including, for example, the theoretical and empirical studies on the Porter hypothesis proposed by Porter and Linde (1995) (e.g., Qiu et al. 2018 for theory and Cohen and Tubb 2018 for empirics, to name a few new ones). Most studies in the above literature have focused on green technology diffusion and innovation in the manufacturing process. This is likely because the manufacturing process is a major source of emissions. For example, according to Ge and Friedrich (2020), approximately 30% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2016 came from the manufacturing sector. However, durable goods such as automobiles, heaters, air conditioners and electrical appliances are also considered to be a major source of GHG emissions, as GHG emissions from road transportation and the use of electricity and energy for residential and commercial buildings also account for approximately 30%. Thus, green product innovation and diffusion are also important for sustainable growth. In addition to contributing to sustainable growth, green products with attributes such as energy efficiency and home chemical safety may attract more consumers. This is because there are green consumers, as Zhang et al. (2015) show by referring to Bemporad and Baranowski (2007), OECD (2002) and European Commission (2007). Because many companies in various industries as well as retailers outsource the manufacturing of their products and key components, the cooperation and coordination with their suppliers is also necessary to make their products green to attract more consumers. Therefore, to achieve green products, many retailers and downstream manufacturers have been engaged in green supply chain management (GSCM). The effects of greening their products or GSCM will be considerably influenced by their relationship with suppliers, and the relationship will be affected by the downstream market (retail market) and upstream market (supplier) competition. In particular, what are the effects from the perspective of social welfare? Depending on the situation and the structure of the supply chain, it may not be a good idea to blindly allow only very green products to be produced. This paper theoretically investigates the relationship between green product diffusion, the competitive structure of the supply chain and social surplus. Concretely, we first examine whether a green product is more likely to be diffused when downstream markets and/or upstream markets are more competitive. We also examine under what conditions it is socially efficient to set environmental standards to diffuse greener products and the relationship between the condition and competitive structure of the supply chain. As described above, we mainly focus on green product innovation and diffusion and theoretically examine the greed product relationship with supply chains and social surplus. Of course, this is not the first study in economics to focus its theoretical analysis on green product innovation and diffusion. In addition to papers on the Porter hypothesis mentioned above, many studies have analyzed the impact of policy interventions on products, such as environmental standards, on green product innovation and/or diffusion and social welfare (e.g., Arora and Gangopadhyay 1995; Cremer and Thisse 1999; Motta and Thisse 1999; Moraga-Gonzalez and Padron-Fumero 2002; Bansal and Gangopadhyay 2003; Conrad 2005). One of the most popular topics has been eco-labeling, which can mitigate the problems arising from information asymmetry and contributes to green product diffusionFootnote 1. Although these previous studies deal with important issues that this paper does not address, there are no theoretical studies in economics on green product innovation and diffusion that take into account the competitive structure of the supply chain. Given that most products are developed and sold through the supply chain, this could be a new contribution to the economic literature on green product innovation and diffusion. Many studies in logistics theoretically analyze green product innovation and diffusion in models that incorporate the supply chain. This is because green product innovation and diffusion are closely related to green supply chain management. Many researchers have investigated green product innovation from different settings and focuses: comparison of different supply chain network structures (Liu et al. 2012), cooperative and non-cooperative behavior between retailers and suppliers (Ghosh and Shah 2012), chain-to-chain competition (Li and Li 2016), the nature of green products (Zhu and He 2017), competition between green and nongreen manufacturers (Ma et al. 2018), retailers’ investment in clean technology for manufacturers (Shi et al. 2019), with and without competition in product greenness (Du et al. 2020), a retailer with fairness concerns (Li et al. 2020). However, in the logistics literature on green product innovation and diffusion, the focus is only on the players that form the supply chain and their actions and strategies, not on how reducing the environmental impact of products affects social surplus, as in this paper or in economics. Thus, this paper has a different focus than previous studies. Our results can be divided into two categories: the impact of supply chain structure on the diffusion (and innovation) and social surplus of green products and the impact of environmental standards. Regarding the former, green products are more diffused and the social surplus is greater when both wholesale and retail markets are competitive. To put it in finer detail, if only one of the markets becomes competitive, the effect on product diffusion and social surplus is the same whether the competitive market is retail or wholesale. In addition, green products are more prevalent and social surplus greater if both markets are competitive rather than if competition is fierce in only one of them. Regarding the impact of environmental standards, it is more likely that setting environmental standards will result in a greater social surplus if the market is more competitive. However, if the greenness of a product does not attract consumers but its social benefit is relatively high, it may be better not to include environmental standards. This paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we present the models for the three supply chain network structures; in Sect. 3, the main results obtained from the model are presented, and their implications are discussed; and we conclude in Sect. 4.",
25.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,03 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-023-00360-6,The recycled content of plastic products: estimating the impact of a recycling law on the input mix,July 2023,Hirotaka Kumamaru,Kenji Takeuchi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The global production of plastics increased from 2 million tons in 1950 to 380 million tons in 2015, and the cumulative generation of plastic waste amounted to 6.3 billion tons during this period (Geyer et al. 2017). The vast amount of plastic waste poses a serious threat to the environment, including marine litter and pollution (Carney Almroth and Eggert 2019; Navarre et al. 2022). In particular, plastic leakage from developed countries is contributing to these issues through global supply chains (Navarre et al. 2022). While the governments of many countries have implemented various policies to reduce plastic waste and promote recycling, the extent to which these policies have impacted the production process is not yet clear. This study examines the impact of a recycling law in Japan on the use of recycled/virgin materials in the production process of intermediate plastics.Footnote 1 Recycling is beneficial in that it reduces disposal costs as well as the use of virgin material. Although the collection of recyclables temporarily avoids disposal, the latter benefit will not be realized unless the recycled material is used for production and substitutes for virgin material. To explore how the input share of recycled and virgin material has changed after the implementation of the recycling policy, we focus on the production of intermediate plastic products, such as film, sheets, plates, and containers. The Japanese recycling law for containers and packaging does not directly require producers to use recycled plastics, but the law may indirectly affect producer behavior by increasing the supply of recyclable materials. As the law increases the collection of used plastics, we expect the producers of intermediate products to find more opportunities to shift their input mix toward used plastics and increase the recycled content of products. For example, Hosoda (2004) documented that manufacturers began to increase the use of recycled plastics as inputs for various products after the law’s implementation. In this study, we capture the change in the input mix by utilizing data from the Monthly Report of Current Production Statistics Survey published by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. The report provides data on the monthly production of various categories of intermediate plastic products and the amounts of inputs used for their production. This allows us to investigate the changes in the input share of recycled plastics in each product category. Building on the assumption that the recycling law impacted only specific product categories, we examine the law’s impact by the difference-in-differences (DID) method. To confirm the validity of the method, we run the estimation with a different definition of the treatment and the control group, as well as the test for parallel trend by event studies. We further discuss the effect of the export of plastic waste to describe the whole picture of the law’s impact. Results of this study indicate that the use of recycled plastics per product increased by 1 percentage point after the recycling law’s implementation. Meanwhile, the use of virgin plastic materials, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and vinyl chloride, per plastic product decreased by 3 percentage points on average. These results suggest that the law helped shift inputs from virgin plastics to recycled plastic materials even though the impact size has been small. This study is related to several strands of literature on waste management and recycling. First, there are numerous empirical studies on the economics of recycling. Specifically, scholars have investigated the impact of recycling programs on households (Ek and Miliute-Plepiene 2018; Ishimura 2022), professional recyclers (Ashenmiller 2009), municipalities (Dijkgraaf and Gradus 2017, 2020; Ferreira et al. 2017), and technological innovation (Nicolli et al. 2012). These studies tend to focus on how much waste is collected and pay less attention to how much-collected waste is actually used. This study fills the research gap by focusing on the producer’s role in the recycling system and examines how the collected waste affects demand for recycled/virgin materials by producers. As producers play a critical role in determining the total amount of material used in an economy, our study has significant implications for policies to establish a sustainable production process with lower environmental impacts. Second, while several studies have theoretically investigated the impact of various policies on extended producer responsibility (Calcott and Walls 2000; Ino 2011; Matsueda and Nagase 2012), empirical investigation of existing recycling programs remains scant. This study contributes to the literature by quantitatively examining the impact of recycling law on the change in inputs in the production process. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background. Section 3 describes the data and our empirical model. Section 4 explains the main results. Section 5 discusses extensions of the analysis. Section 6 concludes. Supplemental figures are included in the Appendix.",
25.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,15 May 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-023-00368-y,Estimating the long-term impact of market power on the welfare gains from groundwater markets,July 2023,Athanasios Tsiarapas,Zisis Mallios,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Water markets have been proposed as an effective instrument for water management, particularly groundwater, since it is believed that through them the efficient allocation of water resources can be achieved by balancing the forces of supply and demand (Hearne and Easter 1997; Mattheiß et al. 2009; Walter et al. 2010; Mattheiß et al. 2009; Marston and Cai 2016; Rey et al. 2019; de Bonviller et al. 2020; Campanhao et al. 2021). However, one of the main drawbacks of water markets is that the emergence of market power in the market, i.e., monopolistic or monopsonistic power, can in no case be excluded (Grafton et al 2011; Tsiarapas and Mallios 2022). According to OECD (1993) and White (2013), in a market, monopoly (one seller) or oligopoly power occurs when there are a limited number of sellers who have the ability to set the price of the product they offer. In this case, therefore, the sellers are not price takers, as is the case in full competition, but it is the sellers themselves who set the price, apparently at a level above that of full competition. Conversely, in a market, monopsonistic or oligopsonistic power effects occur when there is one buyer or a limited number of buyers respectively, who are able to influence the price setting. In any case, the occurrence of market power in a market of any product leads to a loss of surplus and a reduction in the quantity produced, i.e., it leads the market to failure (OECD 1993; Grafton et al. 2011). Since much of the expertise on water markets comes from emission markets, a first approach to estimating market power can be considered that of Hahn (1984), who was the first to study market power in emission markets (see Montero 2009 and Wang et al. 2021 for a more detailed review of studies on market power in emission markets). Two papers whose contribution to the estimation of market power in product markets is considered extremely important are those of Hyde and Perloff (1995) and Boyer (1996), who, although presenting a 'structural model' for estimating market power, nevertheless maintain reservations as to whether market power can actually be estimated. According to Boyer (1996), a 'structural model' uses simple economic theory to estimate market power by exploiting the hypothetically known curves for the total revenues of an industry and the total production costs of a firm in the industry and leads to relevant conclusions by comparing the slopes of the tangents to these curves. This basic but unrealistic assumption of the ""structural models"" about known curves for the total industry revenues and total production costs of an industry firm makes researchers such as Hyde and Perloff (1995) and Boyer (1996) cautious about the reliability of the final results. Returning to water markets, however, in recent years there seems to be a growing interest in assessing the effect of market power on the benefits that can be derived from their implementation. Ansink and Houba (2012) examine market power in the case of a water market that develops along a river, in which Cournot competition prevails by formulating a Lerner index for sellers. Bruno and Sexton (2020) develop a time-static model to quantify, based on a ""structural model"", the loss of social welfare when market power occurs in a water market involving two groups of farmers, focusing on both the case of monopoly (or oligopoly) and monopsony (or oligopoly). Tomori et al. (2021) based on the model of Anskik and Hoba (2012) develop a Nash-Cournot model to estimate market power in the California water market of the United States of America utilizing the concepts of Willingness To Pay (WTP) and Willingness To Accept (WTA). At the same time, of course, with all of the above, research interest in groundwater management continues to exist with the key features of the approaches being the formulation of optimization problems and time-dependent dynamics. A widespread technique for solving such problems, i.e., time-dynamic optimization problems, is the optimal control theory, which utilizes Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (Hellegers 2001)). The first relevant approaches are those of Burt (1964, 1966, 1975) as well as those of Gisser and Mercado (1973) and Gisser and Sanchez (1980), which focus on estimating the benefits over time of public intervention for optimal groundwater management. As the papers of Gisser and Mercado (1973) and Gisser and Sanchez (1980) included several simplifying assumptions, which led to an underestimation of the benefits resulting from public intervention (Edwards and Guilfoos 2021), several related approaches followed over the following decades, which belong to the family of hydro-economic models and which modified key assumptions of the original models (see for example Esteban and Albiac 2011; Guilfoos et al 2013; Latinopoulos and Sartzetakis 2015; Merrill and Guilfoos 2017). The modification of these basic assumptions led to the conclusion that ultimately public intervention can lead to increased social welfare, which is significantly increased through the implementation of economic instruments such as water markets for optimal water management. Of the previously mentioned papers on groundwater management, the one by Latinopoulos and Sartzetakis (2015) is of particular interest, because it is related, indirectly of course, to what was mentioned about market power. Latinopoulos and Sartzetakis (2015) formulate a time-dynamic optimization model to estimate the benefit for two groups of farmers pumping water from an aquifer by implementing economic water management instruments such as a non-tradable water quotas system and a tradable water rights system, i.e., a water market. In the case of the water market, they consider perfect competition conditions without considering the case where market power occurs in the market. In this paper, a theoretical dynamic optimization model is proposed to estimate the long-term benefits of a water market in which two groups of farmers participate and pump water from a single-cell, unconfined aquifer managed by a water agency. This model is formulated broadly along the lines of Latinopoulos and Sartzetakis (2015) but modifying their basic assumption of perfect competition conditions in the water market. Therefore, it is made an attempt to quantify the loss of aggregate total benefits over a given planning period from the occurrence of market power in a simple water market using a ""structural model"", such as that of Bruno and Sexton (2020), who do not extend to the long-term impact of such market conditions. By adding dynamics to the static model of Bruno and Sexton (2020) through a bathtub model what it is actually done is to allow to the groundwater pumping cost at a specific year to be a function of the previous year’ s pumping rate. Hence, based on the above, the contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, this paper attempts to quantify the long-term impact of market power in water markets and at the same time to prove that the welfare loss duo to market power in a time dynamic setting depends not only on the market power level as Bruno and Sexton (2020) show but also on the initial allocation. Secondly, given that the only way for the water agency to intervene in the water market to correct market distortions is the initial allocation of water rights, i.e., the maximum amounts of water that each user is allowed to consume before having to resort to the water market, this paper attempts to determine the initial allocation that leads to the minimization of the loss in aggregate total benefit due to market power, since as it is stated by Hahn (1984) through initial allocation of rights the impact of market power on social welfare can be mitigated. Hahn (1984) finds evidence for his claims in emission markets and what he actually states is that the impact of market power depends on the excess demand for emission permits which is highly dependent on the initial allocation of permits. Because of the fact that no evidence of Hahn’ statement was found concerning groundwater markets it was decided to discuss it in the time-dynamic model developed in this paper.",
25.0,3.0,Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,29 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-023-00367-z,“No fences make bad neighbors” but markets make better ones: cap-and-trade reduces cross-border SO2 in a natural experiment,July 2023,Daniel Leppert,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A key consideration in any attempt at regulating air pollution is its ability to effortlessly cross administrative and legal boundaries. A comprehensive theory of cross-border externalities was proposed as early as Montgomery (1972), who showed that the abatement effort mandated by the regulator ought to be higher for upwind sources that contribute to ambient pollution in downwind receptor regions. Indeed, in maintaining air quality or other environmental standards across regions with cross-border pollution, the optimal regional tax rate is a function of the downwind externality (Xepapadeas 1992a). The logical question that follows is how does the regulator identify pollution sources that contribute to degrading the environment also in other regions? The United States’ Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, maintains close monitoring of ambient air quality using a network of monitors, as do environmental agencies in many industrialized countries. However, even when the government has broad authority of monitoring, it is not always trivial to determine how much pollution from which source ends up where (Wei et al. 2018). It is rarely simply a matter of distance between source and receptor point, but as shown by e.g. Zheng et al. (2014), geography and meteorology also play important parts. While a large literature has studied the externalities firms impose on society, such as public health (Chay and Greenstone 2003; Fowlie et al. 2012; Schlenker and Walker 2016) and urban amenity values (Zheng et al. 2014), comparatively less attention has been devoted to how firms that face different geographic conditions respond to regulation (Kampas et al. 2013) and to geography as an influencer of efficient policy. Despite an established theoretical literature (Fowlie and Muller 2019; Montgomery 1972; Xepapadeas 1992b) raising the issue, cross-border pollution remains salient in practice and recent work by e.g. Heo et al. (2023) emphasize the problem. Between 2016 and 2018, the US states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and New York each petitioned EPA to regulate pollution sources in upwind states that allegedly interfered with the petitioners’ air quality standards (Gerrish 2020). The efficient policy response depends on the primary driver of cross-border pollution. While spatially non-targeted instruments can be effective in cases where cross-border pollution depends primarily on the emission rate, spatially targeted policies are preferrable when geography is a significant driver (Holland and Yates 2015; Xepapadeas 1992b). This paper clarifies this uncertainty in the context of US state-level standards for ambient air pollution determined by the EPA and regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. EPA established the Acid Rain Program (ARP) under Title IV of the 1990 CAA amendments to reduce power sector emissions that cause acid rain (Stavins 2003). Specifically, the ARP targets SO2 emissions through cap-and-trade. The cap-and-trade system, currently covering over 2000 electricity generating units across the United States, is widely regarded a success story in US environmental regulation, having contributed an estimated 10.8 million tonne reduction in SO2 between 1990 and 2010, or 67% (Schmalensee and Stavins 2013). In 2005, the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was promulgated under the federal law to limit the interstate transport of SO2, an air pollutant contributing to acid rain primarily from burning fossil fuels, across 27 eastern states. However, CAIR was short-lived. In 2014 it was vacated following a 2008 ruling by the D.C. Court of Appeals in favor of North Carolina, which argued that the cap-and-trade system made downwind states powerless to combat emissions from upwind sources outside their jurisdiction (Kruse 2009). Because upwind plants were able to purchase permits to cover their emissions, they could keep contributing to ambient pollution in a downwind state. The 2011 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) which succeeded CAIR following the legal challenges and remains in effect, attempts to target sources in upwind states by restricting the market for permits to within-state trading (Shouse 2018). Recognizing that cross-border pollution can produce spillover harms (Heo et al. 2023), it is motivated to examine CAIR’s impact in this respect. Using an atmospheric air pollution dispersion model suggested by Mendelsohn (1980), but rarely used to evaluate the need for spatially targeted regulation of air pollution (Jaramillo and Muller 2016), I identify individual electric utilities that contribute to ambient SO2 in downwind states. Using a canonical difference-in-differences experimental design with utilities to be covered by CAIR SO2 caps in the treatment group and remaining ARP regulated utilities as controls, I estimate the effect on interstate SO2 pollution from tightening of emission caps. Because geography does not change over time, treatment timing captures the effect of emission reductions on downwind pollution. The rest of the article is structured as follows: I first provide the policy background for CAIR and CSAPR, as well as the legal arguments that led the D.C. Court of Appeals in 2008 to rule that CAIR was ineffective at protecting downwind states. Secondly, I present the economics behind environmental externalities and the difference between spatially targeted and nontargeted permit allocation. I go on to describe the theory behind the Gaussian air pollution dispersion model (Zannetti 2013), which I develop and apply for the first time in combination with a natural experiment. The model, referenced going forward as GAUSSMOD, is developed and optimized for replicability, and presented for an interdisciplinary and policy-oriented audience. These sections arrive at the conclusion that the cross-border externality is a function of two variables: The rate of emissions at the source, and the geographic conditions. My identifying assumption is that while source emission rates change over time, geography does not (Fowlie et al. 2012). This allows me to more convincingly isolate any treatment effect caused by a reduction in emissions because of CAIR. To rule out unobserved abatement heterogeneity between groups I also estimate CO2 emissions, which are not differentially regulated. Then, I present the data and dispersion model output. Finally, I present and discuss the results.",

Under the EU ETS, producers must buy or be allocated emissions allowances, which they can then trade with other participants. At the end of each year, they must turn in enough allowances to cover the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their annual production. This system acts as a price on carbon, which increases participants’ production costs. If the additional cost is high enough to put them at a competitive disadvantage compared to foreign producers, EU producers could lose parts of their market shares. They might also choose to relocate their activity outside the EU to avoid paying this additional cost. Both of these effects would decrease production within the EU, and increase production outside the EU. Not only would this undermine the EU’s emission reduction efforts—since any internal reduction in emissions would be compensated by an external increase in emissions—it would also harm the bloc's economy and labor market. This problem is known as carbon leakage, defined in the economic literature as a displacement of carbon emissions from a region with stringent climate policies toward a region with less stringent climate policies (Naegele and Zaklan 2019). Carbon leakage is most commonly understood as we have described it above—a mechanism through which regulated domestic firms lose their competitive edge to unregulated foreign firms. However, this is only one of three channels through which carbon leakage can occur, known as the competition channel. The second channel is the energy channel. It is an indirect leakage channel working through global energy markets. As a regulated region reduces its demand for fossil fuels, the price of these goods will drop on international markets. This price drop can create an incentive for firms in the unregulated region to increase their fossil fuel consumption, and consequently their GHG emissions too. Finally, the third channel is the innovation channel, which has an opposite effect to the other two channels. More stringent environmental regulation encourages firms in the regulated region to invest in R&D, innovate, and adopt carbon-abating technologies and processes. Innovations resulting from this may then be diffused to other regions, including those without any environmental regulation. This channel is not discussed much in policy circles, despite its potential for generating negative carbon leakage, i.e., to reduce carbon emissions both in the regulated and the unregulated region. A fourth channel known as the income channel is sometimes mentioned in the literature. This channel could work through a change in the terms-of-trade between countries as a result of carbon pricing, which could indirectly modify global consumption patterns. However, this channel is very uncertain and likely only has a negligible impact compared to the other channels if it does exist (Cosbey et al. 2019). We therefore do not discuss it further in this paper. Up until now, the EU has dealt with the threat of leakage by lowering the stringency of its ETS. This was accomplished by freely allocating emissions allowances to firms covered by the ETS and by allowing the use of international carbon offsets to comply with regulation requirements. However, a new policy option is now being considered to replace free allocations: on 14 July 2021, the European Commission (EC) formally adopted a proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), as part of its Fit for 55 program (European Commission 2021b). The CBAM imposes a carbon price on foreign goods imported to the EU which should level the playing field between foreign and domestic producers and reduce the risk of leakage. The current proposal foresees a gradual implementation of the CBAM starting in 2023. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we present the context and policy debate surrounding carbon leakage and Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) in the EU. Second, we discuss the state of the economic literature on carbon leakage and CBAs. Finally, we include discussions on further research that is necessary in this field to answer policy concerns and unresolved research questions. Several other literature reviews on carbon leakage and/or border adjustments exist, focusing on specific aspects or methods in the literature. Cosbey et al. (2019) briefly review the economic and legal literature on these topics, before giving an in-depth discussion on policy recommendations for a CBA—although these are not EU-specific. Dechezleprêtre and Sato (2017) review the empirical evidence on the effects of asymmetrical environmental regulation on key aspects of firms’ competitiveness, but do not directly discuss leakage effects. Verde (2020) looks into the empirical evidence on competitiveness and leakage effects caused by the EU ETS. For reviews of the literature using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, Carbone and Rivers (2017) and Branger and Quirion (2014) are key references. Finally, Popp (2019) looks at recent empirical research delving into the link between environmental policies and green innovation. The aim of the present literature review is to be broader than the ones cited above, and to provide readers with a global understanding of issues related to the different channels of carbon leakage and to carbon border adjustments. To achieve this, we describe the mechanisms underpinning each of the three channels of carbon leakage, and give a full review of existing evidence from empirical, theoretical, and structural strands of the literature. This allows for a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of these different approaches, and gives some context to the discussions and literature on CBAs which are also presented. Additionally, our description of the EU’s policy context and history dealing with carbon leakage is an addition to existing literature and puts the findings from economic research into perspective. In this paper, we highlight the discrepancy between the economic literature and policy debates about CBAs. Policymakers tend to focus on the competition channel when designing leakage-prevention measures, without taking into account the potential impacts of the energy and innovation channels. To address this discrepancy, we recommend that policymakers also aim to minimize the impact of the energy channel by developing cooperation with unregulated countries and taking foreign carbon pricing and regulation initiatives into account in the CBA. Additionally, they should work to maximize the impact of the innovation channel by promoting green technology diffusion to unregulated countries and reinvesting CBA funds into an international technology fund. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 anchors the problem of carbon leakage in the EU’s political and institutional context, discussing the bloc’s history of carbon leakage mitigation measures, as well as the debate surrounding the proposal for a CBA. Sections 3, 4 and 5 review the literature on the competition, energy, and innovation channels of carbon leakage, respectively. This review includes discussions on further research that may be needed for each channel. Finally, Sect. 6 presents existing literature on CBAs, and looks at the impact of such a policy on each of the three leakage channels. Section 7 concludes.",
