17.0,2.0,Journal of Bioeconomics,29 May 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10818-014-9183-y,Regulating invasive species with different life history,July 2015,Katarina Elofsson,Ing-Marie Gren,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Invasive species, i.e. species that are introduced into a natural environment where they are not normally found, can give rise to large economic damage due to their impact on native species, wildlife habitats, forest and agriculture productivity, and recreation (Pimentel et al. 2005; Colautti et al. 2006; Gren et al. 2009). Estimates of damage costs indicate that they can correspond to 5-10% of GDP (Gren et al. 2009). In principle, there are three ways to reduce the damage of invasive species; prevention, control and adaptation. Prevention efforts inhibit the entrance of species into new regions, control measures directly regulate the size and dispersal of the invader population, and adaptation measures reduce the damage caused by the invader through adjustments of ongoing economic activities at the site such as, e.g., changes in the management of wild native species, and in agricultural and forestry production which reduce the risk of damages from an invasion.Footnote 1
 Existing international agreements of relevance for the management of invasive species concentrate on policies for prevention of unwanted introductions, whereas little guidance is provided regarding the policies for control or adaptation (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2001). However, prevention measures sometimes fail to stop the introduction of an invader. The subsequent establishment and growth, and the associated economic consequences, is then determined by the interaction with resident species already present in the habitat. One example is the introduction of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the Baltic Sea in the late 1980s. The round goby has become the dominant demersal fish species in shallow water and competes for food with the commercially valuable native flounder (Platichthys flesus) (Karlson et al. 2007). Another example is ringed (Phoca hispida) and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), where populations in the Baltic Sea have recently recovered from very low levels caused by, first, extensive hunting in the last century and, later, toxic pollutants (Österblom et al. 2007). Seals are highly piscivorous and therefore compete for food with the commercially valuable cod (Harvey et al. 2003). Even though the seals’ fish consumption is negligible in relation to commercial cod catches on the larger Baltic-wide scale, the consumed fish biomass can be of the same magnitude as fishery catches, or even larger, at the regional scale (Lundström et al. 2012). The interaction between a resident and invasive species suggests that the optimal choice of policy instruments should be considered in a multispecies framework (Fleming and Alexander 2003). This can be of particular interest for efficient management of invasive species. When the resident and invasive species compete the invader can be limited, not only by direct control of that species, but also by reducing harvests of the resident species in order to increase competition for the common food resource and, thereby, crowd out the invader. Such control of and adaptation to biological invasions has, to the best of our knowledge, not been analyzed in the earlier literature, which is further described in Sect. 2. There is an increasing role of anthropogenic introductions of invasive species, implying that the ability of the invasive species to compete with resident species and get established in the new habitat is successively becoming more important compared to the biological dispersal ability of potential invaders (MacArthur and Wilson 1967; Hulme 2009). This strengthens the need to fit policies to the progress stage of the invasion, e.g., by control and adaptation being applied when the effect is particularly high. The effectiveness of control and adaptation at a particular point in time depends on characteristics of invading and resident species, and on the degree of establishment of the invader. The purpose of this study is therefore to analyze the role of life history, i.e. the degree of evolutionary specialization in survival or reproduction, of invasive and commercial resident species for the optimal choice of strategy and the associated economic instruments. We use a numerical two-species, age-structured model to analyze policies for biological invasions. This discrete-time dynamic model allows for analysis of how policies for control and adaptation depend on the species’ life history, i.e. their degree of specialization in reproduction or survival, when the invasive and resident species compete for scarce resources. The model is relevant for iteroparous species, i.e. species which are reproducing repeatedly over their life time, marine or land-living, which demand the same scarce resource, and where the resident species is harvested with a selective or non-selective method. We investigate the economic trade-off between control and adaptation, and the associated control subsidy and adjustment of the optimal harvesting tax. This is done with an aim to examine how these policy instruments depend on species’ life history and on the technology for harvest of the resident species. Multi-species age-structured models are mostly used in analysis of fishery management (Bertignac et al. 2000; Nieminen et al. 2012), where they are motivated by their high biological relevance and the importance of species age for management decisions taken. To the best of our knowledge, this modeling approach has only been applied to invasive species management by Elofsson et al. (2012), who analyze efficiency properties of adaptation measures in a two-population setting, but do not include control measures or analyze policy instruments. In our view, this paper contributes to the literature on policies for control of and adaptation to invasive species by analysis of how the trade-off between control and adaptation is affected by; (i) eco-system interdependences between invading and resident species, (ii) invader age at the time of arrival, and (iii) species’ life history, i.e. survival and reproduction characteristics. It also contributes through the analysis of the role of species’ life history and harvesting technology for the joint choice of harvesting tax and control subsidy in the presence of an invasion. The paper is organized as follows; a brief literature review is provided in Sect. 2, the bio-economic model is presented in Sects. 3 and 4, and data for the empirical model are given in Sect. 5. Next, the results are presented in Sect. 6 and the paper ends with a discussion and conclusions in Sect. 7.",4

Burnham,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cooperation is an important issue for economics, other social sciences, and evolutionary biology. Punishment has been shown to increase cooperation under some conditions (Yamagishi 1986; Fehr and Gachter 2002). There is a considerable literature on the role of punishment in sustaining cooperation (Trivers 1971; Clutton-Brock and Parker 1995; Fehr and Gachter 2000; Fowler 2005; Sigmund 2007). Cooperation, punishment, and reciprocity are important to a wide-range of species including apes (Brosnan et al. 2005; Silk et al. 2005; Jensen et al. 2006, 2007a, b; Vonk et al. 2008; Brosnan et al. 2009; Leeuwen et al. 2011; Riedl et al. 2012; Proctor et al. 2013), monkeys (Brosnan and Waal 2003; Cronin et al. 2010; Talbot et al. 2011), and rodents (Rutte and Taborsky 2007) . The implications of reciprocity include cooperation itself as well as the impact on hierarchy and health (Sapolsky 2005; Yee et al. 2008). Three main findings regarding the role of punishment and cooperation are salient for this study. First, punishment can sustain cooperation at higher levels than observed in the same settings without punishment (Yamagishi 1986; Fehr and Gachter 2002). Second, in some societies, which may be unusual (Henrich et al. 2010), punishment supports cooperation as it is preferentially imposed upon relatively low cooperators. However, in some settings, and with some populations, ‘anti-social’ punishment is directed toward high cooperators (Shinada et al. 2004; Herrmann et al. 2008). Third, punishment can increase efficiency (in situations where the cost of punishment is lower than the benefits created by increased cooperation), although not in all settings (Rand and Nowak 2011). This paper contributes to the literature on punishment and cooperation in two ways. First, it investigates punishment technology that may be more similar to non-laboratory punishment. Second, and relatedly, it contributes to an important debate about the evolutionary origin of cooperation. The first motivation is that non-laboratory punishment is often much more extreme than that used in many experiments. Commonly, the laboratory ratio used is 3 units of money taken from the punished for every 1 unit taken from the punisher (3:1 hereafter). In some studies the punishment technology is as high as 4:1 (Cinyabuguma et al. 2006; Nikiforakis and Normann 2008). Within the range studied, cooperation increases as the punishment power is increased (Nikiforakis and Normann 2008). These experiments may be unrealistic as outside the laboratory punishment technology is often much higher-powered. Sanctions in the criminal justice system impose severe punishments often far in excess of the crime’s impact. For example, “three strikes” laws in states such as California frequently result in life imprisonment for relatively minor crimes. Criminal convictions have long-term impacts on the ability to obtain employment, and as such constitute very costly punishments. In social settings, punishments for norm violations can also be severe. These costs can range from exclusion from networks (including access to jobs) to outright violence. In the US in 2012, for example, 27 % of identified homicides were committed in face-to-face conflict between strangers (FBI 2013). Conflicts between strangers commonly result from extremely minor infractions such as failure to yield in traffic situations, or perceived insults in social settings such as bars. Violence has tremendously high costs to both parties. Furthermore, such high-powered punishment has been a persistent feature of human society that predates industrialization; current rates of violence are argued to be much lower than those for our ancestors (Pinker 2011). There is a line of research that argues that punishment is not part of cooperation (Dreber et al. 2008; Rand et al. 2009). However, among human foragers, there is evidence that punishment is both important and higher-powered than the standard 3:1 in laboratory experiments. One study documents 235 incidents of peer-to-peer punishment linked to norm enforcement among the Ju/’hoansi Bushmen (Wiessner 2005). This paper summarizes its results by saying that costs to the punisher are “relatively low,” p. 135 and impose “very real material consequences on the target” p. 122. The extent of costly punishment among hunter-gatherers is debated. One article looks across several societies and argues that punishment is not costly among hunter-gatherers (Guala 2012). In discussing the Bushmen data in Wiessner (2005), however, this article emphasizes that those who punish do not suffer high costs writing, “material cost for the punishers is close or equal to zero” Guala (2002), p. 10. The low cost to punisher and “material consequences” to punished (noted by Wiessner) is precisely the asymmetry between costs and punishment that a 50:1 technology is designed to investigate. Thus, to understand punishment and cooperation outside the laboratory, it may be useful to look at higher-powered punishment than the typical 3:1 ratio used in economic experiments. The second, and related, motivation for this study is the ongoing debate about the origin of human cooperation. A leading group of scholars sees a particular form of group selection, so-called strong reciprocity, as an important source of cooperation; a view that is sharply contested by others. Beginning in 1964, various types of cooperation that were once considered puzzles have been reconciled with evolutionary theory via kin selection (Hamilton 1964), reciprocal altruism (Trivers 1971), group selection (Wilson 1975), and costly signaling (Zahavi 1975), and indirect reciprocity (Nowak and Sigmund 1998). In all these cases, the apparent puzzle of cooperation is resolved when the costly behavior is revealed to increase the fitness of the genes of the cooperator. In some cases, the individual organism receives future benefits that compensate for the cost of cooperation (reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, costly signaling), and in the other cases, the organism is not repaid, but its genes’ are repaid via impact on other organisms (kin selection, group selection). While there has been significant progress in understanding cooperation, one area remains controversial: Costly cooperation in situations where the behaviors cannot redound to the benefit of the cooperators’ genes. Experimental investigations that produce such behavior are final and anonymous interactions among people who are neither kin nor members of evolutionarily relevant groups. In these anonymous and final interactions, costly cooperation cannot redound to the benefit of the gene via any of the five theories listed above. If the players are not kin, then costly acts cannot redound to the benefit of genes in kin via kin selection. If the players are not part of evolutionarily relevant groups, then costly acts cannot redound to the benefit of genes via group selection. If there are no future interactions, then costly acts cannot be repaid via reciprocal altruism. If no reputation can be formed, then costly acts cannot be repaid via indirect reciprocity. If behavior is anonymous then costly acts cannot be repaid via signaling. The remaining ‘puzzle of cooperation’ is the human propensity to cooperate even in final and anonymous interactions played among people who are neither kin nor members of evolutionarily relevant groups. There are two main explanations for this ‘puzzling’ cooperation. The first is ‘strong reciprocity’, a form of group selection (Gintis 2000; Fehr et al. 2002). Note that strong reciprocity is group selection, but it is not standard group selection as the individuals in laboratory experiments are not part of evolutionarily relevant groups (Burnham and Johnson 2005). Thus, strong reciprocity is a new aspect of human nature where the altruistic behavior is directed toward transient, anonymous strangers in laboratories. The second set of explanations for the puzzling cooperation is diverse, but united in that they do not rely upon group selection (Price et al. 2002; Johnson et al. 2003; Trivers 2004; Burnham and Johnson 2005; Binmore 2006; Dreber et al. 2008; West et al. 2011; Burton-Chellew and West 2013; Kurzban and DeScioli 2013). One common theme in these views is that the cooperation is produced by psychological mechanisms in particular settings. The behavioral outcome may benefit others in the transient, experimental groups, but group selection is not required for the evolutionary origin of the mechanisms that produce cooperation in these settings. The proponents of strong reciprocity focus on the fact that in some settings costly acts increase efficiency. In particular, proponents write, “Everyone in the group will be better off if free riding is deterred”, and “the act of punishment, although costly for the punisher, provides a benefit to other members of the population ... For this reason, the act of punishment is an altruistic act.” (Fehr and Gachter 2002) pp. 137, 139 Table 1 is a representation of the strong reciprocity view that cooperation is fostered by costly acts that cannot be repaid. The proponents of strong reciprocity do not propose any empirical test of the idea that punishment in this setting is grounded in group selection. However, one form of test is to examine the robustness of the “bad for the individual, good for the group” outcome. The robustness of this “bad for the individual, good for the group” outcome with respect to punishment technology has an important history. In 1986, Yamagishi et al. reported that cooperation increases towards 100 % with a punishment technology of 3:1. They also report, however, that with a punishment technology of 1:1 cooperation rates decline. More recent work (Nikiforakis and Normann 2008), examines punishment technology ranging from 1:1 and 4:1. In their introduction, the authors write, “Despite the large number of experiments, little is known about the robustness of the punishment schemes and the requirements on them to lead to higher cooperation and welfare improvement” p. 359. Thus, the goal of this study is to study cooperation with higher-powered punishment technology. To accomplish this goal, a public goods game based on Fehr and Gachter (2002) was played where punishers could pay 1 monetary unit to reduce another player’s payoff by 50 units (50:1 hereafter). Four aspects of behavior are relevant to the motivation for this study. Q1: What is the cooperation level under 50:1? Q2: What is the punishment level under 50:1? Q3: Who gets punished under 50:1—low or high contributors? Q4: Is efficiency increased by 50:1 punishment?",4

Rietveld,Petri Böckerman,Jaakko Pehkonen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Occupational choice theory presumes that people become an entrepreneur if the total expected utility derived from entrepreneurship is higher than the utility they expect to derive from their best alternative employment option (Taylor 1999; Parker 2009). Utility entails more than income—entrepreneurs have, on average, a lower and more volatile income than people in paid employment (Hamilton 2000) – and includes utility derived from non-monetary factors such as independence and initiative (Taylor 1996). Individuals are thought to make an occupational decision in which the fit between an individual’s characteristics and the job requirement is such that it results in the highest expected utility (Kristof-Brown et al. 2005). There is a growing trend within entrepreneurship research to bring biological factors into these models of occupational choice. For example, some studies find that psychological traits such as narcissism (Mathieu and St-Jean 2013), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Verheul et al. 2015), and dyslexia (Hessels et al. 2014) are more prevalent amongst entrepreneurs. Other studies incorporate direct body-markers such as genes (Nicolaou et al. 2008; Van der Loos et al. 2013a, b), hormones (White et al. 2006; Van der Loos et al. 2013a, b; Greene et al. 2014) and height (Rietveld et al. 2015) in models of occupational choice. The current paper contributes to this emerging strand of empirical research by investigating the potential role of creatine in the decision to become an entrepreneur and its influence on being a successful entrepreneur. There are no earlier studies investigating this relationship. Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid which supplies energy to body cells. It enhances physical performance, for example in high-intensity exercise (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk 2000), and improves mental ability and cognition (Rae et al. 2003; Allen 2012). Therefore, greater effort intensity may result in labour market outcomes in which great effort is needed and rewarded as creatine reduces (increases) the costs (returns) to effort. For example, creatine has been linked to total income, earnings and employment years (Böckerman et al. 2014). Entrepreneurship is associated with high social status in many countries (Kelley et al. 2011) and typically requires greater physical effort than working as an employee (Buttner 1992; Stephan and Roesler 2010). Thus, high levels of creatine may be particularly valuable in pursuing an entrepreneurial occupation and also partly explain entrepreneurial success. Creatine has also been linked to the Big Five personality traits (Ryman et al. 2011). The Big Five dimensions associated with increased levels of creatine in certain parts of brain overlap with those associated with entrepreneurship. Creatine is positively associated with Conscientiousness and negatively with Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism. A recent literature review indicated that entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial performance is also positively associated with Conscientiousness and negatively with Neuroticism (Brandstätter 2011). Entrepreneurship is also negatively associated with Agreeableness. However, Extraversion is negatively associated with entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial performance. Other studies have found that higher Conscientiousness, lower Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism are associated with better labour market success in terms of earnings, job performance and employment (Heineck 2010; Almlund et al. 2011; Uysal and Pohlmeier 2011; Nandi and Nicoletti 2014). However, Extraversion seems to be positively associated with better labour market performance (Nandi and Nicoletti 2014).

This was the basis for explaining the reasons of human action and for deriving by implication what a ‘good life’ means. The result was a positive theory and a related normative discourse. Today this is different. Over the two centuries since its existence, the utilitarian approach has undergone a dramatic metamorphosis. If students of economics nowadays are introduced to the concept of ‘utility’, the sensory underpinnings and the connection with moral philosophy are almost entirely missing. Starting point is now an axiomatic theory of preferences from which a purely formal notion of ‘utility’ is logically deduced (see, e.g., Mas-Colell et al. 1995). It is the notion of an abstract magnitude, an index number, of which nobody seems to know what kind of psychic experience it represents. And utilitarian moral philosophy has adjusted to the language of subjective “preference orderings” in place of sensory perceptions and their hedonic quality (see, e.g. Sen 1987). Outside economics, by contrast, a very different development took place. In the behavioral and human sciences, many material hypotheses about human behavior and its underlying motivations have been launched over the last decades—several of them in a remarkably similar spirit as the utilitarian conjectures that have been abandoned in economics. The evolutionary paradigm can be argued to offer an overarching framework able to organize the vast body of knowledge that has been accumulated about the motivations of human behavior (Burnham et al. 2016). In this paper, some of these developments will be reviewed with the intention to show how a behavioral theory of utility can be formulated on this basis, a theory that rehabilitates in part the explanatory and normative impetus of early utilitarianism. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes basic views held in early utilitarianism and outlines the major transformations by which the approach was successively changed in economics into an abstract theory of choice behavior. Section 3 discusses a few attempts in economics that revived some elements of the early utilitarian approach or even its very sensory foundations, albeit with little impact on presently taught utility theory. Section 4 then reviews elements of a theory of action motivation developed in biology, the behavioral science, and psychology. They are relevant for a behavioral re-interpretation of utility theory, a re-interpretation that will turn out to restore the original utilitarian program in important respects. Section 5 addresses the normative question. This question resurfaces since the suggested re-interpretation of utility theory seems to impose limitations on what a ‘good life’ may, or may not, mean. Section 6 offers some tentative conclusions.",

This landmark agreement has given renewed impetus to global efforts to tackle some of the fundamental challenges that inhibit the emission reductions. While much of this effort has thus far focussed on state-centred national adaptation strategies, non-state market adaptation processes are increasingly being recognized as central to both mitigation and adaptation strategies (Kinzig et al. 2013). For example, in some developed economies record levels of financial resources are flowing into clean energy initiatives while a considerable number of energy provider are divesting from coal-fired power plants. It is therefore vital to rethink what kind of strategies can accelerate the pace of climate adaptation among the everyday consumers and producers whose interactions determine the pace and character of the global economy. There is an urgent need to find better ways to promote the voluntary adoption of sustainable practices among both consumers and producers alike. In the case of consumers, for example, the main type of policies being advocated are state-imposed tax and subsidy measures that rely on making ‘green’ consumption alternatives relatively cheap and ‘brown’ consumption activities relatively more expensive (Wagner 2006). These measures are only effective as long as consumers are sensitive to relative price changes and correspondingly alter their behaviour so as to minimize the cost of consumption. Several scholars have noted such measures could lead to the crowding out of the voluntary adoption of sustainable consumption patterns (Frey and Jegen 2001; Claro 2007; Spash 2010). This suggests that solely relying on pecuniary incentives to achieve sustainable consumption patterns could in fact contribute to the lock-in of unsustainable consumption patterns, as consumers feel less intrinsically motivated and morally obliged to voluntary adopt sustainable consumption practices. Beyond tax and subsidy measures, millions of dollars are spent every year by governments on ‘soft’ measures such as public information campaigns to promote the voluntary adoption of sustainable consumption practices among households. However many of these campaigns turn out to be relatively ineffective because of the so called ‘value-action’ gap (Chai et al. 2015). This refers to the great paradox that emerges when one compares public perceptions of climate change and its associated impact on the environment with the literature on consumption sustainability. In the former, survey after survey conducted around the world suggests that most individuals do accept that climate change is real and most express at least some level of concern about it e.g. (Nisbet and Myers 2007). On the other hand, while many do profess to be concerned about climate change and the state of the environment, there appears to be a yawning gap between these concerns and their propensity to act on these concerns by adopting sustainable consumption practices (Gifford et al. 2011). What are the social institutions that foster this gap and what type of new policies could deliver more effective outcome in terms reducing negative abatements and encouraging consumers to act on their environmental concern? To develop effective and evidence-based strategies that help consumers voluntarily act on the deep-seated climate change concerns, more interdisciplinary research is needed to understand the interplay between green public information campaigns, the adherence to social norms and consumer learning processes. In this regard, Evolutionary Economic approaches to studying consumer behaviour can be useful given its focus on the studying various way that consumer’s knowledge and preferences adapt to changing market environments (Buenstorf and Cordes 2008; Woersdorfer and Kaus 2011; Witt 2011; Chai 2016; Baum 2016). On the supply side, many economies continue to be heavily dependent upon fossil fuels. Not only does this provide a major challenge in the context of reducing carbon emissions but it also means that many economies lack the diversity in its power generation necessary to be resilient to unanticipated future developments in global energy markets. Low carbon emission technologies, such as wind and solar power generation, have been falling in cost as their adoption has increased. This has caused problems for coal generators and created a state of uncertainty in which capital investment strategies have been placed on hold (Byrnes et al. 2013). Inevitably, this has generated political pressure against policies designed to reduce carbon emissions which, in turn, has put investment strategies in the renewable sector on hold. Given that it seems inevitable that renewables will become the lowest cost choice in some, but not all scenarios, what we are witnessing is ‘creative destruction’ in action (Molyneaux et al. 2013). So we can expect to see a significant reduction in the share of coal in power generation over the coming decades. How should policymakers manage this transition towards a changing mix of power generation? Globally, there have been many schemes introduced to subsidize investments in renewable energy and these have made sense when scale was low and unit costs high. However, parallel policies to assist with the exit of old and relatively inefficient coal generation plants have been less in evidence, particularly in Australia (see Nelson 2016; Foster and Bell 2017). This imbalance in policy application has tended to occur because of a narrow focus on carbon mitigation, using standard economic analysis, rather than on developing a system-wide strategy to facilitate the transition of the whole, highly-interconnected power system, using some of the analytical approaches developed by evolutionary economics (Foster 2011). This special issue presents a number of papers that discuss the global challenges faced in managing the transition to a sustainable economy from an interdisciplinary perspective. The majority of these papers were presented at a 2015 workshop on “Managing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy: Some Insight from an Evolutionary Perspective” that was held in the run-up to the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) by Griffith University and the Global Change Institute (University of Queensland) in Brisbane, Australia. The aim of the workshop was to create a forum for interdisciplinary dialogue among economists, psychologists, engineers and environmental scientists studying climate change adaptation strategies. The first two papers begin by delivering some empirical assessments of progress being made in the economy and among individuals in terms of adapting to climate change. Stern (2017) reviews the econometric literature studying the relationship between economic growth and emission levels across both developed and developing economies. From a psychological perspective, Bradley and Reser (2016) discuss recent trends in the extent to which individuals are psychologically adapting to climate change and how this process is critically mediated by natural and social environs. The next three papers focus on the demand side and the behavioural barriers consumers face in adapting to climate change. Baum (2016) synthesizes contributions from economics, psychology and sociology to discuss how a richer conception of individual behaviour and its contextual determinants can yield useful insights for policymakers seeking to promote pro-environmental change among consumers. Earl (2016) adopts an evolutionary economic approach to analyse barriers that are rooted in the complex interconnections between choices that consumers must navigate on a daily basis. Finally, Ali (2016) focuses on the gem market and discusses the prospect of consumers viewing synthetically produced gems as environmentally friendly substitutes for rare earth mined gems. The next two contributions discuss the policy challenges faced by in transitioning the Australian energy market towards low carbon forms of energy production. Foster and Bell (2017) discuss the impact on solar photo vatic feed-in tariffs and their impact on economic growth, social equity and the environment. Nelson (2016) outlines the policy principles that help achieve a smoother transition towards a decentralized and consumer-focused energy market. Finally, Potts et al. (2016) concludes this issue special issue by considering the co-evolution of market, state and the environment and how the interaction of these systems may contribute (or inhibit) the transitions towards a sustainable economy. The editors would like to express their thanks to all referees involved in the reviews of these articles. We also extend our thank to sponsors of the 2015 workshop, including The Global Change Institute, The Griffith Asia Institute, The Griffith Centre for Sustainable Enterprise and The Griffith Climate Change Response Program.",2

(1979). More recent contributions include Kasperski (2015) and Wang and Ewald (2010). In these articles, however, the interaction between species has always been biological, ecological and sometimes technical, but rarely in the market. Most articles that take market-interactions into account, are empirical studies, and many, if not most of them, seem to deal with interaction between aquaculture and wild caught fish (Anderson 1985; Ye and Beddington 1996). Analysis of substitutes and complements in demand is fundamental in economics and well known from basic textbooks as well as numerous empirical studies, e.g. Meng (2014) and Garcia and Raya (2011) to mention a couple of recent ones. This phenomenon also applies to natural resources such as fish products (Vignes and Etienne 2011). However, there are only a few studies that systematically investigate implications of cross-price effects on optimal management of renewable resources from a conceptual and theoretical angle, probably because such models have a tendency to become very messy. There are, however, some recent exceptions to this rule, and Quaas et al. (2013) is one such. Their results are based on the assumption that there are two stocks with identical regeneration functions. Using this assumption they investigate the effect on resilience of substitutability and complementarity. Quaas and Requate (2013) study the effects of preferences for diversity in a model with an arbitrary number of fish species. An older example is Ruseski (1999) who uses a two-stage, two-period model to analyze the behavior of two agents, one regulated and one unregulated, who harvest identical products from two separate stocks. He finds that trade in the presence of market power and divergent management regimes may produce unexpected results. Related problems have also been srtudied in the literature on the interplay between international trade and renewable resources like, for example, Chichilnisky (1994), Brander and Taylor (1997) and Bulte and Barbier (2005) None of these, however, deal with the same problem as studied here. In this article a continuous time two-species bioeconomic model is applied to investigate the effects of economic (market) interaction between species on optimal management from a sole-owner perspective. That is, the owner, or manager, of both species is one and the same who maximizes the combined revenue from the two stocks. This may seem far-fetched if the term sole-owner is taken literally. But here the more common interpretation of the term sole-owner is used, namely that it represents the managing authority of a nation who behave as a sole-owner on behalf of its inhabitants in order to maximize the aggregated resource rent. There may, for example, exist two stocks in different parts of the country’s EEZ, but with certain similar characteristics making them substitutes in the market. Such characteristics can be that both species are “white fish” or that they are used for fish-meal or fish-oil production. This sole-owner exploits a certain degree of direct and indirect market power, and the demand functions are assumed to be stationary over time. The biological model is a surplus growth model, but the only interaction between the species is in the market where the quantity of each species may affect the price of the other. The aim of this study is to investigate implications of market interaction upon the optimal steady state and on the paths leading to the steady state. Revenue and costs for each species are separable, but the harvest of one species enters the inverse demand function for the other. There are several possibilities, for example that one species affects the price of the other, but not vice versa. The most realistic assumption is probably that they are true substitutes such that both species affect the other species’ price. Somewhat facetiously, we can say that they predate on each others price. No technical or biological interactions are considered, but the two stocks can have completely different growth functions. No artificial assumptions about symmetry are made. The analysis is divided in two parts, first a steady state analysis and then a dynamic analysis. Each of these parts are again divided in two, based on whether the net revenue function depends on the state variable(s) or not. This is because the state variables turn out to play an important role for the results. In the steady state analysis, the results are derived analytically from the mathematical model. In the dynamic analysis, on the other hand, numerical methods are resorted to as it is beyond realistic expectations to hope for closed-form solutions of a highly non-linear system of four differential equations.",4

Burnham,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economics is a field in quiet crisis. The cause of the crisis lies at the foundation of the field, in a controversial, and empirically-challenged, set of axioms regarding human nature. Economics is a Cartesian field where results are derived from a small set of assumptions. As such, the unresolved issues regarding the axioms are particularly crippling to the field. ‘Preferences’ serve as the foundation of economics. Canonical economics assumes that people have preferences (i.e., tastes) over goods, risk, time, and the happiness of others, and given those preferences, each individual makes the best decisions for herself or himself. Cartesian systems are powerful because they allow strong, unambiguous conclusions (e.g., If two lines intersect, then they intersect in exactly one point). Economics is unique among the social sciences in deriving results from a set of axioms. However, because Cartesian systems draw strong inferences, it is essential that the axioms be incontrovertible. Economics is justified, therefore, in making strong statements only if the axiomatic assumptions regarding human nature are correct. However, there is a substantial behavioral economic literature challenging each and every axiom of economics (see Table 1). In addition to being disputed, the axioms of economics are taken as given from outside the field (‘exogenous’). Therefore, economics faces a serious barrier to progress because preferences, the foundation of the field, are ‘axiomatic, controversial, and exogenous.’ (Burnham et al. 2015) Is free trade good? The conclusions of David Ricardo, and other economists, regarding the consequences of free trade are valid only insofar as the axioms are correct. Every economic theory is similarly speculative, because all economic theorems are derived from axioms that are unproven. The crisis in economics is caused by its foundation in controversial, and unproven, axioms regarding human nature. Experimental evolution allows the empirical study of these core assumptions, and, as such, holds tremendous potential to improve economics.",1

Understanding how a species is adapted to its environment remains a longstanding topic of investigation, because researchers continue to discover new and surprising adaptations (e.g. Tian et al. 2013). Individual adaptations can involve substantial biological complexity and the diversity of adaptations appears nearly inexhaustible. The perception of evolutionary outcomes derived solely from the abundance of extant adaptations might be boundless biological success, that species are likely to adapt successfully to even the most extreme environments. And yet, the vast majority of species over the long history of Earth have gone extinct (Raup 1994). While some of these extinctions involved external extreme perturbations to life (meteor strikes), which are necessarily be difficult to adapt to, such sudden, dramatic and simultaneous extinctions are not the norm (Payne and Finnegan 2007). Extinctions occur to species across of range of biological importance, from those that were ecologically dominant to those that were always numerically rare. But, there has been only modest success in incorporating observations of species loss and extinction into a general understanding of evolutionary processes (Gould 1989; Nixon and Wheeler 1992). Investigations into the causes of extinction are necessarily challenging because the species are typically already absent, or soon will be, and even studies on extinct species often focus on their unique adaptations, rather than the basis for their extinction (Forey and Chatterton 2003). Recently, there is increasing interest in understanding the basis for extinctions, and their role in affecting biological function and diversity (Rankin and Lopez-Sepulcre 2005). Some of this interest involves recognition of an adaptationist bias in evolutionary biology, that has led to changes in null hypotheses and improved understanding of the limits of natural selection (Gould and Lewontin 1979; Pigluicci and Kaplan 2000). Two well known examples of adaptationist bias include misattribution of the basis of altruistic behaviors (Williams 1966) and a general expectation that the microbes in a microbiome are beneficial (Moran and Sloan 2015). A broader motivation for the increased interest is recognition of the dramatic environmental changes caused by human activity, which have persistent, widespread negative effects on available resources and habitats. Such changes disrupt living systems, including human populations. As environments become increasingly affected by human modification, pre-existing adaptations are mismatched to current habitats, so that many species are under threat of imminent extinction (Bellard et al. 2012). Environmental degradation is not unique to humans, as all species change their environment, typically drawing down resources and releasing waste products (Srivastava and Jefferies 1996). There have been numerous studies of adaptation to environmental change, but many of these studies suffer from an adaptationist perspective, so that understanding the limits of adaptation remains surprisingly thin (Bell 2012). Without such understanding, predictions regarding the generality and basis of successful adaptation are likely to be overly optimistic in forecasting the biological consequences of rapid environmental shifts. To address these issues, we investigated the potential for adaptation under severe environmental conditions associated with habitat degradation. We made use of microbial experimental evolution to explore ecological and evolutionary outcomes (Lenski 2017). Bacterial populations provide good model systems for the study of adaptation as they are relatively easy to culture and assay for growth. There is a wealth of information about the genetics, biochemistry and physiology of many bacterial species, and the biochemical pathways of stress responses are probably best known for bacterial species. We characterized the growth dynamics and evolutionary responses of bacteria under serial transfer, a periodically varying environment. In a serial transfer environment, the life history of a bacterial population can be described as four phases (Travisano 1997): (1) lag phase, the period of time required for bacteria to initiate growth after transfer to fresh medium, (2) growth phase, a period of exponential growth during which neither nutrient concentration nor waste products limit growth, (3) stationary phase, a period where reproduction does not occur due to nutrient limitation and/or build up of toxic waste metabolites, and (4) death phase, a period during which the population declines occur. Adaptation to periodic, serial transfer, conditions can involve improvements in one or more phases, such as shorter lag times or faster growth rates. Previous studies often focus primarily on exponential growth under ideal conditions, although there are exceptions (Fiegna and Velicer 2003). The experiments presented in this paper were performed with the soil bacterium Alcaligenes xylosoxydans strain A41 during growth in a stressful environment, culture medium supplemented with biphenyl as the sole carbon and energy source. Biphenyl is a solid aromatic hydrocarbon, consisting of two benzene rings, that is hydrophobic, lipophilic and can readily diffuse into bacterial membranes. Biphenyl can be toxic to bacteria, even to those using it as a resource, due to its ability to disrupt cells and membranes (Sikkema et al. 1995) and the production of toxic metabolites during growth (Pérez-Pantoja et al. 2015). Much research into the ability of bacteria to grow on biphenyl is motivated by attempts to reduce pollution by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated analogues of biphenyl (Bedard et al. 1986). PCBs were previously widely used in electrical components due to their insulating ability and chemical stability, but their current use is greatly restricted because exposure is associated with numerous health issues (Kimbrough 1987). A. xylosoxydans A41 was isolated for its ability to degrade biphenyl (Ohta et al. 1996; Maeda et al. 1998), an ability that is not ubiquitous, but is found in a wide variety of unrelated bacterial species. In this study, the causes and effects of a stressful novel environment are examined. We addressed two related questions: How does the complexity of the seasonal environment affect the short term (ecological) and the longer term (evolutionary) likelihood for extinction? We show that short term ecological dynamics are predictable, that adaptation to the stressful conditions readily proceeds, but that the potential for extinction is enhanced as a consequence of adaptation.",2

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 2008, a US Naval officer somehow lost a bag of tools while distracted with the cleaning of a mess from a grease gun that had leaked. This would not be a noteworthy occurrence except that it was among the most expensive tool bags in the history of humankind, valued at over $100,000. Perhaps more surprising is the fact that this Naval officer holds an advanced degree from MIT, has received numerous military decorations – including several medals for “superior meritorious service” – and had previously performed some of the most technically-challenging mechanical repairs ever completed. How can an experienced, well-trained, certified genius lose a $100,000 tool bag? Mainstream or ‘neoclassical’ economics is built on a model that assumes people behave in an ‘optimal’ manner, unconsciously acting in accordance with the rules of underlying mathematics. An optimizing person would definitely keep track of expensive tools; to not do so would have serious consequences. In sharp contrast to the neoclassical economists, Richard Thaler and other behavioral economists start, not with a model, but rather by simply observing human behavior. And observations reveal that, far from behaving optimally, human beings make mistakes all the time, mistakes that might include losing something worth $100,000. In 1987, Professor Thaler wrote the first of his “anomalies” articles, in which he describes human behaviors that are inconsistent with neoclassical economic theory, writing, “An empirical result is anomalous if it is difficult to ‘rationalize,’ or if implausible assumptions are necessary to explain it within the [neoclassical] paradigm.” (Thaler 1987, p. 198). We entitle this series of articles Ordinaries, because we believe that the anomalies of Professor Thaler are intellectual artifacts, generated by viewing behavior through the distorting lens of current economic theory. Viewed instead with the clearer optics rendered by the natural sciences—recognizing humans as evolved, biological organisms—the anomalies of behavioral economics are expected, predictable, and commonplace behaviors. In time, biology will synthesize neoclassical and behavioral economics into a coherent field. Neoclassical economics is correct to emphasize optimization. Yet behavioral economics is also correct, to identify systematic failures to optimize. A biological perspective reconciles these seemingly inconsistent views of humans as both intelligent optimizers and prone to systematic mistakes (Burnham 1997; Burnham and Phelan 2000). Humans are the product of natural selection, which favors maximization. If selection is so powerful, however, why do humans make so many mistakes? The answer is that natural selection does not produce behaviors. Rather, selection produces behavior-generating physiological mechanisms that are sensitive to environmental cues. The anomalies of behavioral economics are produced when this flexible biological machinery operates in particular settings. The Ordinaries column will interpret economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology. From this view of life, the anomalies of behavioral economics will disappear into a coherent biological framework that incorporates elements of neoclassical maximization.",11

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (Mensah and Brown 2007). In Europe, 45% of all deaths are caused by cardiovascular disease (Townsend et al. 2016). Most of these deaths are avoidable because they are caused by eating too much of the wrong kinds of food and by leading sedentary lives. Numerous personal choices that we make influence our risk of cardiovascular disease. How does economics view these decisions? Recall that economics is a field divided upon itself, with neoclassical and behavioral schools that agree on almost nothing. So we summarize the two main branches of economics separately. Mainstream, neoclassical economics is untroubled by cardiovascular disease. In fact, early and unnecessary death are considered to be optimal. By neoclassical assumption, each individual makes the best of their personal circumstances. Most people would prefer to live long, healthy lives. Many of these people, however, also hate exercise and love the foods that kill us. Thus, viewed under the assumptions of neoclassical economics, a death by heart attack at age 45 is an acceptable outcome and expected for some people. Those who suffer early death from heart disease are assumed to have evaluated and elected to make a trade-off between expected lifespan and their desires for leisure and food. Behavioral economics, in sharp contrast, views such detrimental lifestyle choices as one of many types of mistakes that people commit. The behavioral economic view of human nature is of bumbling buffoons who struggle with math, lose money in financial markets, and make costly, emotional decisions in many areas, with little rhyme or reason to explain them. It may be unfortunate that people make poor decisions about diet and exercise, but to behavioral economists it is not surprising. Table 1 summarizes the current state of economics with regard to cardiovascular disease. The Ordinaries column is dedicated to viewing economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology (Burnham and Phelan 2019). The goal is a better understanding of human behavior, and, consequently, better outcomes for individuals and for groups of people.",10

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Perhaps the most quoted part of Mean Genes is Jay’s solution to airline food. The problem is that airline meals usually include an unhealthful dessert item such as a brownie that many of us would rather not eat. However, because the brownie is likely to sit on our tray table for an hour or more before being swept away by flight attendants, all too often the brownie gets eaten (Burnham and Phelan 2000). Jay’s solution is to use the mayonnaise that comes with the meal and smear it on the brownie as soon as possible. The brownie becomes disgusting to Jay and his will power battle is over. Self-control battles are part of human nature, discussed by Plato as follows, “And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink? Yes, he said, it constantly happens. And in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him?” (Plato 360 BCE, Jowett 1888 translation). The essential aspect of the battle for control is internal mental conflict. Paraphrasing Plato, “something bidding a person to commit an act and something else forbidding.” These conflicts exist in two forms. There are behaviors such as eating the brownie that feel good, but that we want to resist. And there are behaviors such as physical exercise that we feel are valuable, but that we have a hard time completing (see Table 1). There are philosophical issues underlying the notion of self-control. What does it mean to want something and to not want it at the same time? Who is the individual in this situation? Why should we favor the part of us that wants to be nice, physically fit, and polite, over the hedonistic part that wants to binge, consume, and indulge in other pleasures? In this article, we take it as a given that people do face self-control issues and that it would be useful to have a better framework to understand and exert self-control. This article explores self-control within the mission of this series (Burnham and Phelan 2019): The Ordinaries column will interpret economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology. From this view of life, the anomalies of behavioral economics will disappear into a coherent biological framework that incorporates elements of neoclassical maximization.",9

What is MMT? Professor Kelton introduces MMT by writing, “there are no constraints on the federal budget.” (p. 2). The first ‘M’ in MMT is for modern. Before modern theory, economists evaluated government spending using old (incorrect) monetary theory. Consequently, governments have tended to spend too little causing unnecessary, missed opportunities to improve society. In June 2020, for example, the US government spent almost a trillion dollars more than it received. Such statistics are best measured against the size of the economy. By this “percent of GDP” metric, the US Federal deficit in the single month of June 2020, exceeded annual deficits in all but a few years, and even exceeded the deficit in some entire decades. Should we worry about government overspending such as these recent, record deficits? Critics of government deficits say, “we are burdening our children and grandchildren” or “The piper is going to have to be paid.” The logic of these ‘old monetary theory’ fears is that debts need to be repaid. Live like the grasshopper today by overspending, and die like the grasshopper in the future because winter is coming. Stark views about winter coming are wrong, according to MMT, because the US government can print, or electronically create, any amount of money. The essence of MMT is, “The federal government shouldn’t try to manage its budget ‘like a family sitting around the dinner table.’ We don’t need to tighten our belts with shared sacrifice and fiscal restraint … citizens should never be forced to suffer harsh austerity on the grounds that the government lacks the ability to pay for health care or pay benefits to retirees or the disabled.” (p. 180). MMT argues that misguided debt fears produce real economic pain. For example, President Obama suffered from ‘the deficit myth.’ In 2009, President Obama took office in the midst of financial crisis. At the time, the Democrat party had control of both the House and the Senate, so President Obama had wide latitude regarding the size of the increased spending response to the crisis. The Obama administration considered spending between $787 billion to up to $1.8 trillion. What happened? “In the end, Obama lost his nerve.” (p. 6). According to Professor Kelton, President Obama should have spent more. “By not getting the policy response right, we set the stage for a slow and weak recovery that harmed our communities and translated into trillions of dollars in foregone prosperity for our economy.” (p. 7). President Obama hurt the people of the US because he spent too little. Historically, many other politicians have made similar mistakes by spending too little. “The federal government has historically almost always kept its deficit too small.” (p. 43). Professor Kelton argues that President Obama could have spent much more and paid for the expenditures by creating more dollars. “The dollar is no longer tied to gold. The US issues a freely floating fiat currency so it doesn’t need to tax or borrow before it can spend.” (p. 98). MMT states that there is no limit to the ability of the US government to fund expenditures by creating money. “If we wanted to, we could pay off the debt immediately with a simple keystroke.” (pp. 10–11). “The entire national debt could be paid off tomorrow and none of us would have to chip in a dime.” (p. 90). The subtitle of the book includes “the Birth of the People’s Economy”. To achieve the People’s Economy, we do not need hard choices, technological advances, or arms treaties; we just need to print more money. “A just and more prosperous world—one that combines ecological sustainability with full employment, human well-being, a lower degree of inequality, and excellent public services that meet the needs of all—is within reach.” (p. 260). In summary, The Deficit Myth states that the US Government can create unlimited amounts of money, therefore debt and deficits do not matter. MMT is new, and before its creation by Professor Kelton and others, politicians and the public were negatively constrained by the old-fashioned view that government bills need to be repaid. Once Modern Monetary Theory slays The Deficit Myth, the US will print enough money to achieve a better and more just society.",4

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In certain laboratory settings, blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) seem to earn the label of ‘bird brains.’ Researchers in Professor David Stephens’s laboratory at the University of Minnesota presented jays with a choice. The birds could peck a disc and receive a single food pellet, or they could wait a very short time—just a matter of seconds—before pecking and receive two pellets. (This ‘later-larger’ reward varies across experiments and species, but we will use two throughout this article). Only a bird brain would be so impatient as to choose half as much food now, instead of waiting a few moments for the double portion. But many animal species, including pigeons, tamarins, and chimpanzees, make similarly ‘impulsive’ choices in laboratories (Stevens & Stephens, 2010). And even though they can easily understand the cost, in some settings people, too, make choices betraying the same extreme impatience as the laboratory birds (Ainslie, 1975). “Would you prefer $10 today or $11 tomorrow?” is the central question posed in a series of behavioral economic experiments. We once ran this experiment for real cash in an undergraduate class at the University of Michigan. One student, we’ll call him Norm, chose $10 on the day of the experiment. Coming to the front of the large auditorium filled with over 150 students, Norm collected his crisp $10 bill. Before he had returned to his seat, we questioned Norm’s decision. “Norm, why $10 today? Isn’t $11 tomorrow better? Aren’t you being a little impulsive? Perhaps you are being irrational?” Norm responded, “For me, the unit of wealth is ‘the beer’ and it costs $5 at my favorite bar where I will be drinking right after this class. So, $10 is equal to two of ‘the beer,’ and because they don’t sell fractional drinks, $11 is also equal to two of ‘the beer’. As you taught us, two of ‘the beer’ today is better than two of ‘the beer’ tomorrow.” Q.E.D. Norm sat down to thundering applause. We will check in on Norm again later in this article. Let us return to the general topic of choice across time. ‘Discounting’ is the term for decisions that involve payoffs in multiple time periods. Should the world, for example, invest more now in electric vehicles? The consequences of a faster shift to electrification include a smaller economy today and a better world tomorrow. (Some environmentally positive projects make us both richer today and better off tomorrow. These environmental ‘free lunches’ should all be undertaken.) Making the best investment decision in the electric vehicle situation requires a method for comparing payoffs in the different time periods. People face myriad discounting decisions. How much should we save from each paycheck? Over how many years should we spread out mortgage payments? Should we borrow money to attend graduate school? The list goes on. In the Stephens’ lab, the jays always chose one pellet immediately, unless the delay was infinitesimally small. In doing so, the birds missed the possibility of doubling their money (pellets) in a very short period of time. In economics, the currency of decision-making is happiness, typically labeled ‘utility.’ In the currency of utility, almost any single decision—even seemingly disastrous choices—can be viewed as optimal. Suicide increases happiness if it pre-empts a future life filled with negative utility. Drug addiction causing early death is optimal as long as the short-term pleasure outweighs the long-term loss of happiness (Burnham and Phelan, 2019). An economist cannot say definitively that one pellet now is worse than two pellets in a minute. Choosing one pellet now may produce tremendous utility. The driving force shaping bird decision-making, however, is not the maximization of utility. Rather, it is natural selection, a force leading to decision-making processes that maximize reproductive success. The measure of the value of any behavior is its impact on an individual’s reproductive success relative to other individuals. Put another way, the currency of natural selection is “relative reproductive success.” This currency is also called “inclusive fitness,” and it can be quantified. With the unambiguously defined currency of inclusive fitness, we can make absolute statements about behaviors. We can compare alternatives, as well. Suicide does not increase inclusive fitness unless it produces benefits (measured as increased reproductive success) in genetic relatives. Similarly, choosing one bird pellet now instead of two pellets in a minute, is a biological mistake. Why do birds and humans make discounting mistakes? This article explores discounting within the mission of this series (Burnham and Phelan, 2019): The Ordinaries column will interpret economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology. From this view of life, the anomalies of behavioral economics will disappear into a coherent biological framework that incorporates elements of neoclassical maximization.",7

Doti,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A number of academic studies have studied the impact of demographic and socioeconomic forces on the incidence of COVID-19. These studies have focused attention on counties and metropolitan statistical areas (Hamidi et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Wheaton and Thompson 2020). At the state level, the print and electronic media have extensively reported on differences in COVID-19 infection and deaths (Olsen, Washington Post, 2019; Rosenthal, New York Times, 2020; Tavernise and Mervosh, New York Times, 2020), but these reports are largely anecdotal and lacking in academic rigor. The paucity of COVID-19 academic research at the state level is regrettable. State governments have emergency power rules from the Tenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution to respond to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. These rules allow states to enact measures that are not allowed at the local level. As will be presented later in this study, the responsiveness at the state-level in implementing “lockdown style” closure and containment policies will be tested as to their efficacy. These tests are possible because measures of each state’s responsiveness are available at the state level. Such tests are not possible at the city, county, or metropolitan level because uniform measures of local responsiveness are not generally available. Similar data constraints at the local level exist for other socioeconomic variables that might serve in explaining COVID-19 death rates. Yet another compelling reason for more research at the state-level is that states rather than local areas are increasingly being recognized as laboratories for the control of COVID-19. In a recent Wall Street Journal opinion editorial, for example, a resident fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, wrote: Hospitalizations and deaths are rising, including nursing homes and long-term care facilities. But President-elect Joe Biden can look to some states as a model for handling the pandemic. The good news for Mr. Biden is that he can adopt some of the best practices learned in the states. (Wall Street Journal, 2020) State-level COVID-19 death rates vary widely. As shown in the rank ordering of Table 1, cumulative death rates per 100,000 people as of December 1, 2020, range from a low of 10 in Vermont to a high of 191 in New Jersey. The mean cumulative death rate for all 50 states was 73.4, with a standard deviation of 40.5. Figure 1 shows that the mean death rate for all 50 states has increased in a linear-like manner from April 1, 2020, to December 1, 2020. Mean cumulative COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 for all 50 states Although no state-level studies that examine the impact of socioeconomic variables on COVID-19 have been published, a survey of SSRN as of December 1, 2020, showed 6056 articles dealing with the coronavirus. Of those, 3634 relate to public health, legal, economic, societal, and fiscal implications. Several of these studies focus attention on the impact of density on COVID-19 infection and death rates on counties and metropolitan areas. Hamidi et al. (2020), for example, conclude that their most important finding is “that density is unrelated to confirmed virus infection rates and inversely related to confirmed virus death rates” (p. 11). They conclude that “COVID-19 death rates are lower in dense counties and higher in less dense counties” (p. 12). Wheaton and Thompson’s (2020) findings reveal that density and the total number of infections are inversely related, but that density has no significant effect when the infection rate serves as the dependent variable. These findings run counter to the commonly accepted view that greater social interaction leads to higher COVID-19 infections and deaths. As reported in NYC/EDC: In theory, population density increases the contact rate of an individual, thereby increasing the production number (also called R by epidemiologists) of the virus and leading to larger outbreaks. (Zhong and Teirlinck, NYC/EDC, 2020) Determining whether density does or does not play a significant role in explaining the COVID-19 death rate has important implications for socioeconomic planning and policies. As Hamidi et al. (2020) conclude: The fact that density is unrelated to confirmed virus infection rates and inversely related to confirmed death rates is important, unexpected, and profound. It has important implications for community design, … and nearly every other front-burner issue important to planners. (2020, p. 12) In the study to follow, we hope to shed light not only on how density and other factors such as state-level mandates are associated with the COVID-19 death rate but also why our findings differ from the conclusions reached in previous studies. We present an empirical model and the results of regression tests to explain these differences in death rates at the state level during three different time periods. The tests regress state-level COVID-19 death rates against hypothesized demographic and socioeconomic explanatory variables. Those variables found to be significant in this study will also shed light on the role these variables play in explaining COVID-19 deaths.",4

Harris,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this article, we attempt to identify the critical forces driving the massive outbreak of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County, which by January 10, 2021 had registered over 967,000 confirmed cases of the disease (Los Angeles County Department of Public Health 2021). To that end, we bring together four critical strands of the growing research literature on the worldwide COVID-19 epidemic. First, investigators have attempted to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of local outbreaks by applying theoretical models to data on reported cases (Chang et al. 2020; Fang et al. 2020; Hao et al. 2020). Second, numerous studies have used the techniques of geospatial analysis to evaluate the impacts of public health policies (Dickson et al. 2020; Franch-Pardo et al. 2020; Orea and Alvarez 2020; Zheng et al. 2020). Third, cross-sectional studies have related the age structure and household composition of various countries to COVID-19 incidence and mortality (Aparicio Fenoll and Grossbard 2020; Esteve et al. 2020). And fourth, researchers have increasingly relied on data derived from the movements of smartphones with location-tracking software to study patterns of viral propagation (Dave et al. 2020; Harris, 2020a, d). While a number of studies have assessed the effects of state-of-emergency and stay-at-home orders, as well as restrictions on restaurants, bars and large social gatherings, these efforts have largely relied upon large cross-sections of state and county data (Cronin and Evans 2020; Gupta et al. 2020). Here, by contrast, we rely upon detailed data on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among approximately 300 communities within Los Angeles County from February 24, 2020 through January 10, 2021. Focusing sharply on Los Angeles County—far and away the largest by population in the United States—we follow in the line of other recent studies attempting to relate transmission patterns to the fine microdetails of individual communities (Horn et al. 2020; Vijayan et al. 2020). We develop a spatial extension of the conventional SIR epidemic model to study the radial spread of infection among these contiguous communities during the early phases of the epidemic. We merge our geospatial data with census-derived, community-specific data on the characteristics of households, in particular a measure of the prevalence of households at risk for inter-generational transmission. We study how wide local variations in the prevalence of this risk factor result in marked heterogeneity in the reproductive number during the course of the Los Angeles County epidemic. Before delving into the fine details of our data, methods and results, we paint a broad-brush picture of the epidemic under study. Figure 1 plots the weekly incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in Los Angeles County over a 46-week period, from the week starting Monday, February 24, 2020 (which we designate as week 0) to the week starting Monday, January 4, 2021 (designated week 45). The data points for the figure were derived principally from the web-based dashboard of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH), supplemented by the dashboards of the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which are situated within Los Angeles County but run their own health departments (Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services 2021; Los Angeles County Department of Public Health 2021; Pasadena Health Department 2021). We characterize these as confirmed cases, as they reflect only those infected individuals who were tested and reported to the DPH or to the two other municipal health departments. Weekly confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in Los Angeles County We have divided the observation period into four successive phases. Phase I (spanning weeks 0–5) saw an initial rapid increase in confirmed case incidence. By the start of Phase II (spanning weeks 6–20) the epidemic curve was already flattening, as the emergency lockdowns declared in early March by the Los Angeles mayor, the county supervisor and the California governor had begun to bite (Barger 2020; Garcetti 2020a; Newsom 2020). Following the reopening of retail stores, indoor dining, hair salons, gyms and bars in May and June (Money 2020; Parvini 2020; Shalby 2020a), confirmed case incidence rose to a temporary peak of 221 per 100,000 by the week of July 13 (week 20) at the end of Phase II. Reacting to the surge in cases, the state public health officer ordered the reversal of most of the county’s prior reopening orders (Angell 2020; Gutierrez 2020). The resulting decline in confirmed case incidence, seen during the initial part of Phase III (spanning weeks 21–34) was short-lived, as the county reopened hair salons, nail salons, breweries and shopping malls in September and October (Cosgrove 2020; Shalby 2020b; Shalby and Cosgrove 2020). As Phase III came to a close in week 34, the state issued new guidelines permitting gatherings of up to three households (Times Staff 2020). The extraordinary, ten-fold surge in confirmed case incidence that followed during Phase IV (spanning weeks 35–45) elevated Los Angeles County to the title of the new COVID-19 epicenter in the United States. Emergency stay-at-home orders issued by the Los Angeles mayor and the California regional health officer during week 40 (Garcetti 2020b; Pan 2020) had little or no short-term detectable effect on indicators of social mobility (Harris 2020f). Confirmed cases during the eleven weeks of Phase IV accounted for more than two-thirds of all confirmed cases recorded during the entire 46-week interval covered by the figure.",11

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"“Would the Ache enjoy a Big Mac?” The Ache are an indigenous people in South America who have been studied extensively by anthropologists (Hill and Hurtado, 2017). When these anthropological studies commenced, the Ache lived in a manner thought to have some important similarities to the way that all humans lived before the invention of agriculture. Before agriculture, all humans can be characterized as Pleistocene foragers—people who lived by hunting animals and gathering plants. So would the Ache enjoy a Big Mac? We asked this question of one of the anthropologists who lived with, and published extensively, on the Ache. The answer, “Yes, the Ache would love a Big Mac, and they would kill you for one.” A Big Mac contains 8 g of saturated fat. The US government divides dietary fat into four types: monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats are labeled as good for humans, and saturated and trans fats as bad (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). The US government recommends limiting saturated fat intake to no more than 10% of total calories. One Big Mac represents almost half of the daily recommendation for saturated fat intake. While most people believe eating saturated fats is unhealthful, 77% of Americans nonetheless consume more than the recommended amount (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Eating dietary fat, particularly “bad” fats, is an official US government source of death. Furthermore, this behavior is entirely avoidable. At a societal level, we could avoid the production of foods that kill us. At an individual level, we could navigate a world filled with death-causing food and eat only those substances that are good for us. Given that dietary fat reportedly kills, why do we eat so much? At one level, the answer is obvious, Big Macs taste good. At another level, however, there is a deeper puzzle. Violet, a high school student, recently asked, “Why are all (her emphasis) the foods that taste good, bad for us? Shouldn’t evolution have made us enjoy foods that are good for us?” Good question, Violet. In fact, eating foods that taste good is killing people. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world (Mente et al., 2009). The consumption of dietary fat is reported to be one of the most significant contributors to heart disease (Milanlouei et al., 2020). Published research studies attribute 9% of all heart attacks and 16% of heart events to consumption of excessive dietary fat (Hooper et al., 2001). In this article, we examine the consumption of dietary fat, but not with the goal of improving people’s health. Rather, our primary intention is to improve economics. This is because although the facts about food and health are generally so well-known as to be trite to most people—“eat your vegetables”—the topic is important for economics. This article overlaps with and extends our previous article on genetic mismatch (Burnham & Phelan, 2020a). In that article, we argue that the anomalies of behavioral economics, and many modern human problems including heart disease, stem from ancestral genes that are out of sync with industrialized life. This article focuses on the specific aspects of dietary fat, including a more detailed explanation of their chemical structures and the physiology of their breakdown and usage by humans, that are responsible for causing significant health problems. This discussion has broad relevance because it exemplifies one of the two types of behavior that are challenging to economics. First, behaviors that are bad for us, but feel good. Second, behaviors that are good for us, but feel bad (see Table 1). By focusing on dietary fat consumption in some detail, we present here an in-depth examination of a fundamental human behavior that feels good, but has negative effects, within the mission of this series (Burnham & Phelan, 2019): The Ordinaries column will interpret economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology. From this view of life, the anomalies of behavioral economics will disappear into a coherent biological framework that incorporates elements of neoclassical maximization.",7

Widely cited studies published in leading economic journals apply evolutionary arguments and theories to explain and discover features of human psychology and cognition that have a role in economic behavior (for recent reviews, see Collins et al. 2016; Burnham et al. 2016). Many economists hold that the insights of evolutionary theory might be relevant for economics in that they can help improve our understanding of human preferences and behavior. Looking back into the writings of Jack Hirshleifer, a pioneer economist that examined what evolutionary biology can contribute to economics, “[t]he programmatic contention here is that such preference patterns, despite seemingly arbitrary elements, have survived because they mainly are adaptive to environmental conditions” (Hirshleifer 1977, p. 18). In the economic literature human preferences are taken as given. For Jack Hirshleifer, evolutionary theory could help economics with identifying what preferences we have and explaining why they survived selection processes (Hirshleifer 1977, p. 17). It is still unclear, however, what method can facilitate economists in formulating evolutionary hypotheses about human preferences and behavior. Terence Burnham presents a promising evolutionary method that aspires to reconcile different sub-fields within economics (Burnham 2013). In this paper, I set aside prospects for a broad integration within economics or among the social sciences. My relatively modest aim is to clarify and refine Burnham’s proposal. It is also not my intention to present and critically assess alternative methods offered by evolutionary psychologists.Footnote 1 Instead, I examine Burnham’s method on its own terms and consider whether it can be utilized to inspire productive work at the interface between economics and biology. In Burnham’s view, it is possible to formulate novel hypotheses and predictions about human preferences, on the basis of what patterns of behavior would have been adaptive in the Adaptively Relevant Environment (henceforth ARE). After clarifying two crucial theoretical terms that figure in Burnham's method, the ARE and maximizing behavior, I suggest that identifying the ARE requires economists to describe a particular trait and build or pick an evolutionary model that identifies a set of selection pressures against which it would confer an evolutionary advantage. With this in mind, I further argue that evolutionary models of adaptive behavior do not routinely entail particular insights about human psychology. The problem this raises for Burnham’s method is that several scientifically plausible hypotheses about human preferences will be compatible with such evolutionary models. Finally, based on the theoretical resources provided by the indirect evolutionary approach (henceforth IEA), I argue that Burnham’s method can be more reliable if economists apply or build evolutionary models of their own that target particular features of human psychology and cognition. Such models may reduce the number of plausible hypotheses to allow for rigorous scientific testing in laboratory or field experiments. Based on these arguments, the revised method proposed in this paper is the following: Identify preferences and overt behaviors related to them. Apply or build an evolutionary model and use information about our ancestral past to determine the ARE of these traits; Predict the structure of preferences and how they operate in the present environment; Test these predictions in the laboratory and the field. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section I introduce Burnham’s method, focusing on concepts that are more relevant for its application in theoretical and empirical research. Moreover, I set forth what I consider to be the main problems with his proposal. Following this, in Sect. 3, I examine what kind of evolutionary models can be applied to shed light into our psychological traits. Section 4 explores in more depth whether it is reasonable to assume that decisions in the ancestral past were based on utility maximization. Sect. 5concludes.",

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The goal of the Ordinaries column is to use genetic evolutionary theory and related natural science perspectives to improve economics. Currently, there is a schism within economics between neoclassical and behavioral schools. These divergent views fundamentally disagree about each axiom of the field. Neoclassical and behavioral economics do, however, share a common set of social science methodologies that are not connected to the natural sciences. Biology offers a route to a neo-Darwinian synthesis in economics. The natural sciences utilize a variety of methodologies and approaches not found in either neoclassical or behavioral economics. The Ordinaries column is intended to help move economics toward a natural science foundation, with a long-term goal of reuniting and improving economics. To date, we have published six Ordinaries columns (Burnham & Phelan, 2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2021a, 2021b) with the common goal to catalyze the integration of economics and the natural sciences.

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"‘“Newton had his apple,” [Professor Richard] Thaler said in an interview, with the bit of mischief he’s known for in the classroom. “I had my cashews.”’(Chicago Booth Magazine, 2015). In this article, we analyze Richard Thaler’s cashew epiphany, which led to the creation of the field of behavioral economics and Professor Thaler’s Nobel Prize. Behavioral economic scholars focus on situations where human behavior diverges from that predicted by neoclassical economics. Behavioral economics utilizes the framework of Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1970), labeling these divergences as “anomalies.” “An empirical result is anomalous if it is difficult to “rationalize,” or if implausible assumptions are necessary to explain it within the [neoclassical] paradigm.” (Thaler, 1987, p. 198). Behavioral economics is built on a foundation consisting of these anomalies. Here is the seminal anomaly that created behavioral economics: “Some friends come over for dinner. We are having drinks and waiting for something roasting in the oven to be finished so we can sit down to eat. I bring out a large bowl of cashew nuts for us to nibble on. We eat half the bowl in five minutes, and our appetite is in danger. I remove the bowl and hide it in the kitchen. Everyone is happy.” (Thaler, 2016, p. 34). The dinner party anomaly, which we label the “cashew conundrum,” is contained in the last sentence: “Everyone is happy.” Neoclassical economics assumes that more options are always better than fewer. Accordingly, a guest should be unhappy to have the cashews removed. The notion that a person might eat a cashew and be unhappy is antithetical to the concept of “revealed preference,” the bedrock of neoclassical economics (Samuelson, 1938). The cashew conundrum is the parent of all the subsequent behavioral economic anomalies. Thus, we focus our attention on this key event in the history of economics. Why do people sometimes regret eating cashews? This article explores the cashew conundrum within the mission of this series (Burnham & Phelan, 2019): The Ordinaries column will interpret economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology. From this view of life, the anomalies of behavioral economics will disappear into a coherent biological framework that incorporates elements of neoclassical maximization.",4

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How does one write a biological economics article? The goal of biological economics is to synthesize, reconcile, and improve the two main economic schools of thought: neoclassical and behavioral. And while the guidelines for writing a neoclassical or behavioral economics article are clear, there is no similar guide for biological economics. This paper fills that void by creating a template — a “how-to” guide — for writing a biological economics article. The instructions for writing a neoclassical economics article have been described as: “The combined assumptions of maximizing behavior, market equilibrium, and stable preferences, used relentlessly and unflinchingly, form the heart of the economic approach.” (Becker, 1976. p. 5). The guidelines for a behavioral economic article are described (and demonstrated) in the first ‘anomalies’ article, “An empirical result is anomalous if it is difficult to ‘rationalize,’ or if implausible assumptions are necessary to explain it within the paradigm.” (Thaler, 1987, p. 198). In the neoclassical view, all decisions are assumed to be optimal, maximizing some notion of happiness or ‘utility.’ A behavioral economics article documents a divergence between actual human behavior and that predicted by neoclassical economics. This paper lays out a process for writing a biological economics article. A biological economics article integrates insights from biology into economics, reconciling those behaviors misunderstood or poorly understood within economics with the well-established theoretical and empirical natural science foundations that make sense of them. Here are the four steps, summarized from Ordinaries 8, the ‘cashew conundrum’ (Burnham & Phelan, 2022). 
Step 1: 
Identify an important human behavior that is poorly understood.
 The cashew conundrum is the observation that Richard Thaler’s dinner guests were happier when pre-dinner cashews were made less accessible. The cashew conundrum is important because it was the seminal event in creating behavioral economics, and led to Professor Thaler’s Nobel Prize. 
Step 2: 
Summarize the current state of economics with respect to the target behavior.
 Economics is divided and confused about the cashew conundrum. Neoclassical economists assume that eating pre-dinner snacks — even in quantities that “ruin” dinner — is optimal. Behavioral economists observe that people seem unhappy with their own overeating behavior at times, and can be made happier by the removal of options (the cashews in this case). 
Step 3: 
Utilize natural science insights to inform our understanding of the behavior.
 Humans and our pre-human ancestors came to have ravenous appetites as an evolutionary adaptation to chronic, unreliable food availability and recurrent famine. Humans have specific, powerful neural mechanisms that prod us to eat, and, in particular, to seek out high-calorie, low-effort foods, such as roasted, shelled cashews. People with access to food tend to overeat because these biological mechanisms, selected to avoid starvation, are now mismatched with modern settings characterized by plentiful, calorically-dense food. 
Step 4: 
Revisit the economics of the target behavior with insights from biology.
 Neoclassical economics is wrong to assume efficient and non-conscious maximization in an evolutionarily novel world. The genes underlying our behaviors evolved in a world of hunger and starvation. As a result, we tend to overeat in environments with surplus food. Behavioral economics is right to note the pervasive situation that people often overeat, but limited in documenting the conundrum without providing insight to its cause or its solution.",3

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"If you rent a car, let’s say in Las Vegas, the rental agent will try to sell you insurance. This additional insurance augments whatever coverage you have from your existing car insurance. Why does the rental car company offer to sell you insurance? The answer is to make a profit. Their expected cost of the insurance is less than your price. If the insurance seller makes a profit, does this mean that buying insurance is a bad deal for the car renter? Absolutely not. The renter may hate losing big chunks of money so much that even though the expected monetary value of buying insurance is negative, the expected psychological value is positive. Adam Smith would approve of Las Vegas car renters making a mutually advantageous insurance transaction. The trouble for neoclassical economics comes, however, when the implicitly risk-averse car renter then drives to a Las Vegas casino and begins gambling. All wagers offered at casinos are profitable, in expectation, for the house. Folk wisdom captures the house’s advantage: “Are you heading to Vegas?” says a neighbor seeing a friend loading luggage into a car. “Yep, I’m looking to win big.” This elicits the retort, “Say hello to my money. I left it there.” A dollar bet at roulette yields, with common rules, just under 95 cents in expectation. Is it irrational for a person to play roulette at a cost of about one dollar lost for every twenty dollars bet? Not necessarily. Neoclassical economics justifies gambling by inferring that the gambler has “risk-seeking” tastes. The rational gambler gets sufficient joy from considering the possible positive outcomes that the psychological payoff to a money-losing gamble is positive. Voila! A restaurant offers a hamburger for above cost. An insurance company sells a policy for above expected payout. A casino sells a gamble for more than expected winnings. What is the problem? The problem, for neoclassical economics, is that people are assumed to have consistent, stable risk attitudes. A person can either buy insurance or gamble. When the same person, however, buys car insurance at the Vegas airport and then proceeds to play roulette, neoclassical assumptions are violated. People, according to neoclassical economic assumptions, walk through life with their risk-averse or risk-seeking attitudes, making optimal and therefore consistent decisions. Actual human behavior is inconsistent, however, as people are sometimes almost simultaneously risk-seeking and risk-averse. Why do people make inconsistent and, in some cases, apparently poor, risky decisions? This article explores decisions under uncertainty within the mission of this series (Burnham & Phelan, 2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2022a, 2022b): The Ordinaries column will interpret economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology.

Burnham,Jay Phelan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Consider an apparently idyllic society, a society in which no one is worried about being overweight. People seek and easily obtain opiates every day without a single person suffering addiction. Furthermore, there is no property theft, no homelessness, and no children abandoned. The people also love to gamble, yet no one is in financial trouble from their risk-taking. Is such a utopia possible? Yes, in fact, at one point in time, not only was it possible, it was common. During the Pleistocene Epoch, prior to the invention of agriculture, the description above is an accurate description of many—perhaps most—human societies. This is not to say that it was a Xanadu—far from it. Struggles and difficulties have been constant for human populations for as long as our species has existed. People in the Pleistocene struggled against a wide range of external pressures. These included hunger, thirst, weather, violence, disease, and predation. Today, people more commonly fight internal battles. These include struggling to eat less and to not kill ourselves directly or indirectly through bad choices. As we wrote in Mean Genes (Burnham & Phelan, 2000), for people living in industrialized economies, “our toughest battles are with ourselves.” The cause of most self-control problems is, perhaps paradoxically, technological innovation. In the Pleistocene, for example, many people struggled to find enough food to survive. Now, as a consequence of agriculture and other technological creations, many people would live longer if they would eat less. In this article, we discuss the extent to which we can return to the Pleistocene, more specifically how technology can reduce the scope and intensity of the conflict that we have with our own passions. People living in modern industrialized societies suffer myriad maladies; they are maladies that would have been completely unknown to people living in the Pleistocene. Obesity is considered by some an “epidemic” with billions at risk (Templin et al., 2019; Wolfenden et al., 2019). Substance abuse destroys many lives, killing over 100,000 people in 2022 in the US alone (Centers for Disease Control, 2023a), for example. Property theft, homelessness, suicide, and gambling addiction are pervasive (Bainbridge & Carrizales, 2017; Nikkinen, 2022; Speak, 2019; van Dijk et al., 2021). Technology is the primary cause of these woes. Our bodies and brains are now out of sync with our environment; experiencing a phenomenon known as “evolutionary mismatch.” Our Pleistocene taste buds, which are highly responsive to calorically-rich, fat-dense foods, are poorly-suited for a world with cars, restaurant drive-through lanes, and easily obtainable 2,000-calorie bundles of fat, sugar, and salt. Furthermore, mismatch extends far beyond food, with consequences for every aspect of human life, and every area of economics. We explain mismatch, and its relevance to economics, in Mean Genes (Burnham & Phelan, 2000) and throughout the Ordinaries series, particularly in “Ordinaries 2: Strangers in a Strange Land” (Burnham & Phelan, 2020a), “Ordinaries 6: Big Macs & Economics” (Burnham & Phelan, 2021b), and “Ordinaries 8: Thaler, cashews & Tinbergen” (Burnham & Phelan, 2022a). Mismatch is of paramount importance in understanding apparent paradoxes in human behavior, including the so-called anomalies of behavioral economics. However, neither neoclassical nor behavioral economics incorporate the concept. Consider the choice to consume a Big Mac, a product likely to contribute to morbidity and mortality. Neoclassical economics assumes that a person eating a Big Mac has made an optimal choice. According to the neoclassical economist, the consumption of a Big Mac reflects a conscious or unconscious trade-off: “I know that I will die earlier if I eat this Big Mac, but the intense pleasure and satisfaction that it brings me more than compensates me for my sickness and early death.” In contrast, behavioral economics considers the Big Mac as a mistake: “I know I shouldn’t eat this Big Mac. I shouldn’t. I am weak. Oops, I just ate the Big Mac and supersized the fries.” However, both neoclassical and behavioral economics are silent on the fundamental question of why people engage in behaviors that they know they will later regret. While economics fails to provide any explanation, biology fully elucidates our desire to engage in a wide-range of behaviors that appear self-destructive (and often are). For our ancestors, consuming the equivalent of a Big Mac was biologically beneficial. Consuming a large amount of calories, rich in protein, fat, and sodium, helped our ancestors survive and reproduce. Because of this evolutionary benefit, natural selection favored the development of neurological reward circuits that produce pleasure in response to the consumption of fat and salt. Modern humans today possess these same pleasure-producing neural pathways. Although our taste buds and brains still reflect ancestral payoffs, technological advancements have transformed the world in which we live. The biological economist summarizes Big Mac consumption as follows: “Our ancestors won their evolutionary competition by acquiring and consuming the molecules that constitute a Big Mac. Owing to the phenomenon of heredity, we carry the genes that rewarded them for making such choices.” The mission of the Ordinaries articles is described as follows (Burnham & Phelan, 2019, 2020a, b, c, 2021a, b, c, 2022a, b, c, 2023): The Ordinaries column interprets economic behavior from the perspective of evolutionary biology. From this view of life, the anomalies of behavioral economics disappear into a coherent biological framework that incorporates elements of neoclassical maximization. This article is different from most prior Ordinaries articles. Rather than healing a schism between the subfields of neoclassical and behavioral economics, this article fills a void. Going beyond simply describing genetic mismatch, this article delineates different technological strategies to mitigate the negative impact of having left the Pleistocene. In the future, our toughest battles will continue to be with ourselves, but we will have new tools to use in the fight.",

The results of quantum theory have been confirmed in particular in physics, and many scientists agree with the basic findings (see e.g. Herbert, 1985; Feynman, 1994; Weinberg, 1995; Friedman, 1997; Rosenblum/Kuttner, 2006; Greene, 2011; and Susskind, 2014). Whereas in classical physics the properties of real material objects (e.g. a ball) can be precisely measured using mathematics, in quantum physics, there are only probabilities of finding certain properties through measurement. These probabilities take the form of wave functions, which are associated with different simultaneous states (groundbreaking Schrödinger, 1926; Greene, 2011). However, unlike in classical physics, where one can accurately measure an object’s momentum or location, wave functions represent only potential realities, not actual ones (Weinberg, 1995). How can a link to social science be derived now? It is difficult to grasp and one of the most incomprehensible secrets of how the indeterminate quantum world leads to the determinate classical world (including our social life), especially when considering that quantum mechanics subsumes classical physics, whereas its practical applicability is limited to subatomic particles. This process leading from the quantum world to macroscopic reality is called decoherence in physical science (Zeh, 1970). What if social life is not determined by the classical world but instead by quantum in the form of wave functions? This (social life) would also include economics and its research areas, such as decision-making theory. Of particular interest for the paper is the psychological decision theory including cognitive biases, fundamentally shaped by Nobel laureate behavioral economists Kahneman and Tversky (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973, 1974, 1983; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, 1984; Kahneman, 2011). In addition to this special feature of cognitive biases, human decision-making behavior in general should also be viewed from the perspective of a quantum Darwinism with the aim of designing a new quantum model of decision-making behavior. The research questions are therefore as follows: First, how can findings from quantum physics be transferred to social sciences (including economics), and which new perspectives result? Second, how can (behavioral) decision theory be interpreted differently in the light of quantum physics? Third, how can the perspective of a quantum Darwinism complete human decision-making behavior? The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a short overview of quantum physics and its fundamental experiments, followed by a summary of decision-making theory and related cognitive biases as elaborated by Kahneman & Tversky in Sect. 3. Section 4 transfers selected knowledge and interpretations of quantum physics into the social world and takes a critical appraisal of the term “quantum social science”, especially with a focus on cognitive biases and Darwinian selection. Section 5 concludes the paper.",
