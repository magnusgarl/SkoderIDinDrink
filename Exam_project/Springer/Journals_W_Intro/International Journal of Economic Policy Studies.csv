Its main purpose was to organize the provision of electricity and gas more efficiently by introducing competitive forces where possible and by using regulation when and where needed. More competition creates incentives for firms to invest in cost reducing and innovative technologies and thus fosters cost-efficiency. Competition would thus force down prices, which by many politicians was seen as the ultimate goal of the liberalization process. Figure 1 illustrates the liberalization idea for the electricity sector. The left-hand side sketches the structure of the electricity sector as it was before the initiation of the liberalization process. Most Member States had one vertically integrated firm that dominated the sector.Footnote 1 This vertically integrated firm took care of electricity generation, transmission and distribution and consumers had no choice as to where to buy electricity. The goal of liberalization was to move to a market structure as shown at the right-hand side in Fig. 1, which allows for competition in electricity generation and retail, while keeping transmission and distribution activities regulated. Economies of scale are typically quite important in transmission and distribution, which justifies regulation. Liberalising the electricity market Today, most Member States of the European Union (EU) have liberalized their electricity market. The United Kingdom was the first EU Member State to liberalize its electricity market already more than 20 years ago, soon followed by Norway (which is not an EU Member State). Most other Member States initiated the liberalization process shortly after 1996 and ended the process about 10 to 15 years ago. However, although most Member States formally ended the liberalization process, a European internal market for electricity has not been realized yet. To complete the creation of a European internal electricity market—one of the ultimate goals of EU energy policy—a number of obstacles remain and need to be removed. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief overview of the EU electricity market liberalization process and to survey the main remaining issues and challenges. To do this, we will make intensive use of publicly available reports and studies, of which we will synthesize the main messages, findings, conclusions. The structure of the paper is as follows. “The European Union, some facts and figures” briefly surveys and describes the European Union, presents some facts and figures, and puts it into perspective from a more global point of view. This section also surveys the most important legislative initiatives in the context of EU energy policy making. “Experiences from liberalising the electricity market” then surveys some facts and figures on the energy market liberalization. In “Challenges”, we then describe the main challenges faced by EU policy makers, when creating an internal energy market. Finally, “Conclusion” concludes.",32

Japan is no exception, regulation relaxation of the electric power business began in 1995, and since then, entrance regulation and rate regulation have been abolished through several law revisions. In Japan, the monopoly system of 9–10 electric companies that are regional, private, and vertically integrated has been maintained in the post-war period. The market structure has been dramatically changed due to the liberalization of power generation, wholesale and retail markets, and unbundling of power supply functions. Since the UNFCCC came into force in 1994, global warming has become a policy issue to be addressed concretely by all countries in the world. One effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, is to use renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Following European countries, Japan introduced the Feed-in tariff (FIT)Footnote 1 in 2012, which gives incentives to encourage utilizing renewables, and since then it has been growing rapidly. In this paper, we take up the regulatory reforms involved in the above two tasks, analyze the facts and influences, and identify issues that are likely to become manifest as side effects. Then, we examine their impact on economic growth. This paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we outline the circumstances and content of regulatory reforms concerning deregulation and global warming countermeasures. Their outcomes and impact are analyzed in the following section. Then, the impact of these regulatory reforms on economic growth are evaluated, and the concluding section provides a summary and outlines challenges.",1

Higher reimbursement prices contribute to stronger R&D incentives for pharmaceutical firms and medical-device makers, but they also increase the financial burdens on the national health insurance (NHI) system and patients. Lower reimbursement prices reduce the NHI system’s public payers’ and patients cost, but they may hinder patients’ access to innovative drugs and medical devices. Hence, a tradeoff exists between reducing the financial burdens on the NHI system and patients and increasing providers’ R&D incentives. However, if a successful solution to this tradeoff is found, it will not only reduce the cost of the public payers and patients but also reduce any remaining unmet medical needs. Therefore, analyzing a policy that leads to both lower national health expenditures and stronger R&D incentives of pharmaceutical and medical-device firms is very important. In this paper, we examine the pharmaceutical industry and focus on the risk that pharmaceutical firms face regarding the reimbursement price level. Theoretically, an increase in the reimbursement price risk reduces a risk-averse firm’s R&D incentives. In the previous literature, only a few studies examine how (that is, via what policy) to best balance reducing the financial burdens on the NHI system and patients while increasing pharmaceutical firms’ R&D incentives. In a simulation study on the new NHI drug-pricing system in Japan, Wakutsu and Nakamura [22], emphasizing the explicit use of a discount rate in balancing the two opposing tasks, analyze how different price patterns over the product life cycle differently affect a firm’s R&D incentives and the public payers’ financial burden. To the best of our knowledge, no study in the literature focuses on pharmaceutical firms’ reimbursement price risks or analyzes how increased predictability via reduced price risk contributes to lowering the financial burdens on the NHI system and patients and strengthening those firms’ R&D incentives. Specifically, this paper’s objective is twofold. First, in the theoretical discussion, we show that a reduction in the reimbursement price risk that a risk-averse pharmaceutical firm faces increases the firm’s utility level, thereby strengthening the firm’s R&D incentives. In addition, we show that, by increasing the predictability of future reimbursement price levels, a drug price that is lower than the expected price can increase the firm’s utility level and thereby maintain its existing R&D incentives. The second objective is to examine this possibility through numerical simulation. Theoretically, the reimbursement price risk is predicted to reduce a pharmaceutical firm’s R&D incentives, but the extent to which such incentives are reduced is not clearly understood. Hence, we first study how much a given level of reimbursement price risk reduces a firm’s R&D incentives. Second, we examine how much a reimbursement drug price can be reduced while keeping the pharmaceutical firm’s R&D incentives unchanged if the price risk is successfully decreased. Lastly, as sensitivity analyses, we examine how the magnitude of the impact changes with the degree of price risk it faces and the level of its risk aversion. For methodology, in a simulation analysis, a hypothetical new branded drug is constructed from actual data on the Japanese drug market. Assuming that a pharmaceutical firm is an expected-utility maximizer with an instantaneous constant-relative-risk-aversion (CRRA) utility function, and that the R&D incentives are quantified by the standard discounted cash flow valuation, we then conduct numerical simulations and compute the certainty-equivalent drug price and risk premium associated with various degrees of reimbursement price risk. Referring to the empirical literature on firms’ risk preferences, we set the parameter value for the relative risk-aversion (RRA) level of a pharmaceutical firm to 3.0 and the discount rate to 0.08. From the simulation analysis, the following results emerged. In the presence of a 20% price risk regarding a reimbursement price of 100 (i.e., ranging from 80 to 120), a pharmaceutical firm’s certainty equivalent is 96.0. It follows that a reimbursement price of 100 in the presence of a 20% price risk is equivalent to a reimbursement price of 96.0 with certainty. In the presence of a 20% price risk regarding a reimbursement price of 100, the price premium is 4.0. This finding implies that, by increasing the predictability of future prices, the reimbursement price can decrease by 4.0 while maintaining the firm’s existing R&D incentives. The magnitude of the impact increases at an increasing rate with the degree of price risk, and increases at a diminishing rate with the level of risk aversion. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In “Basic idea”, we explain the theory underlying the basic idea of the present study. “Literature on firms’ risk preferences” briefly reviews the empirical literature on firms’ risk preferences. “Methodology” describes the methodology used. “Results” presents the simulation results. Finally, “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",1

The persistence of conscription in the developing countries, even though the developed countries seem to have one-by-one been abandoning it in favor of all-volunteer systems, has been remarked by many but never yet fully explained. (See however: Hall [11], Economist magazine [7], and Tarabar and Hall [25]). We offer an explanation, based on the cross-country differences in cost of a conscription system compared to an all-volunteer recruitment system, as represented in the model of Mulligan and Shleifer [17]. We will argue that within the Mulligan and Shleifer model, the less efficient tax systems of developing countries incline them to favor conscription with longer service obligations. This is a line of argument previously advanced by Ross [21] but not fully confirmed by his statistical estimates. The data related to the tax systems of the different countries now enable a more complete investigation. We estimate a Tobit regression equation with cross-country data that supports the claim that countries whose abilities to collect taxes are constrained by their citizens’ non-use of banks, are more likely to have conscription with longer required lengths of service. Figure 1 shows the inverse relationship between GDP per capita and the length, in months, of conscript service obligation. For many of the countries, the length of obligation is zero; they are not drafting anyone. Countries with higher income are less likely to have military conscription. As shown in Table 1, about one-third of the high-income countries have conscription, but more than half of the low-income and middle-income countries have conscription. Length of conscript service obligation and GDP per capita Conscription is not a strictly dichotomous variable. Shorter length of service obligation in a universal conscription system means less reliance on conscription. It means that the number of conscripts in service at any given time are fewer. Exemptions from conscription, for example student deferments, represent a margin for reducing the reliance on conscription. Unfortunately we do not have adequate information about the deferment and exemption practices of the different countries that use conscription, and so our empirical analysis will focus on length of service obligation. The high-income countries that do have conscription tend to require fewer months of service than do low and middle income countries. This is quite evident in Fig. 1. It is also shown in Table 1. The developing countries are more likely than the high-income countries to use conscription, and to require more months of service by each draftee. The question we aim to answer is, why? The model of Mulligan and Shleifer [17] is simple yet general enough to accommodate key differences between rich countries and poor ones. As will become evident, our argument rests within their model. A conscription system can be costly to set up, and misallocates labor compared to an all-volunteer system, but a voluntary enlistment system entails a higher wage bill. The taxes needed to fund the higher wage bill of a voluntary enlistment system are more burdensome, the less efficient the tax system. For a poor country with an inefficient tax system, the tax burden of a voluntary enlistment system can be greater than the tax burden of a conscription system. That is the crux of our explanation as to why poor countries are more likely to rely on conscription. It is also the case that the particular distortions of military conscription, arising from the misallocation of labor, are likely to be small in a developing country where labor skills are relatively homogeneous compared to most developed countries. But we are unable to confirm this with data. We do find empirical support for the link between the inefficient tax systems of poor countries and their greater reliance on conscription—presumably because it makes the higher wage bill of a voluntarily recruited force more burdensome for them. Poor countries collect taxes where they can, which often means the taxes are highly distorting and have high excess burdens. In the rich countries, taxes are broad-based and so entail smaller excess burdens than in the poor countries. The rich countries have gradually come to rely less on distorting tax sources including customs duties, government monopolies, and inflation of the currency. Military conscription—a tax in-kind on labor—can be added to the list of distorting taxes that persist mostly in the developing countries, a reflection of the constraints facing developing countries. Simply put, in a developing country, where the informal sector of the economy is large, taxes that might be less distorting are easier to evade and harder to collect. A recent paper by Tarabar and Hall [25], which came to our attention only after we completed our own analysis, overlaps a bit with ours, but also differs from ours. They estimate a single equation with panel data at 5-year intervals, 1970–2010, for about 100 countries, an equation that explains length of conscript service obligation. They argue that the long-term decline in conscription over their period of observation is related to the secular increase in primary schooling among young males, and to the changing age profiles of country populations. This is consistent with a view that the misallocation of labor caused by conscription is becoming more costly over time, prompting the high-income countries in particular to shift toward voluntary recruitment. We think this is a correct understanding of the time trend. But, our focus is on the cross-sectional variation in the recent period, and why conscription persists in the developing countries more than in the high-income countries. Our reasoning and our empirical analysis point to the less efficient tax systems of the developing countries as an important underlying factor. In our empirical estimate we find that some of the same control variables also used by Tarabar and Hall are significant. For both their study and ours, countries with British legal origin (common law) rely less on conscription, and countries with Socialist origin rely more on it. Also countries facing hostile neighbors have larger military forces and so rely more on conscription (we model this with structural equations, which Tarabar and Hall do not—they put it all in a single equation). And finally, we show that the governments of countries whose citizens and businesses use banks less—countries with large informal sectors, mostly developing countries—tend to collect less tax revenue, and to just that extent, rely more on conscription. Again, we model this with structural equations. Tarabar and Hall, following the example of Ross [21], include government consumption spending relative to GDP as a variable in their equation, on the premise that the marginal excess burden of taxes rises with size of government, but the variable is generally not significant and has the wrong sign for their interpretation. The efficiency of the tax system, the main focus of our analysis, is absent from their findings. We begin by describing our theoretical framework and how it frames our understanding of the differing relative costs of conscription compared to voluntary enlistment. Then we present empirical estimates showing that patterns actually present in the data support our reasoning. Countries with less efficient tax systems, wishing to recruit larger fractions of their labor forces, are more likely to have conscription with longer service obligations.",

Humans have only limited capacities and thus they concentrate on the challenges they are facing. They do not consume their abilities by worrying about the distant future. Such behavioral tendencies must have worked for their survival in the long run. Both myopia and optimism-bias are thus a part of human nature. However, owing to technological advances, as human activities increase in scale, the need for careful consideration of long-term interests increases. Focusing on fiscal policy, through the development of capital markets such as issuing long-term bonds, which enables inter-temporal resource allocation between generations, we must not leave myopia and optimism-bias intact. Changes of generations due to our limited lifespan make the problems more difficult. Fiscal policies affect future generations as well as present generations, but only present generations are allowed to participate in decisions on policies. The hypothesis of “silver democracy”, based on the rational voter hypothesis [5], argues that elderly voters prevent sustainable policy choices. It is therefore urgent to discuss how to design a policy decision framework which ensures that sustainable policies are socially selected. In a democracy, as well as voting, the role of deliberation is emphasized. A representative democracy provides the opportunity to reach some reasonable judgment, away from the mere accumulation of interests of voters, through deliberation among the representatives. This is called the hypothesis of “deliberative democracy” in this paper. Assessing the effectiveness of deliberation in promoting sustainable policy decisions is necessary. In order to consider the validity of the hypotheses and to obtain keys to designing a decision framework to solve long-term fiscal problems, this paper describes “laboratory research” conducted on decisions about fiscal policy. In the research, participants were asked to choose from options of hypothetical fiscal policies. Among previous experimental work on fiscal policy, Cadsby and Frank [3] were the first to examine Ricardian equivalence. The Ricardian view comes from Barro [2], who argues that shifting the burden of debt from present to future generations will not happen. Knowing that debt will have to be repaid by their children, an altruistic present generation will not regard debt as net wealth, and so will not increase their consumption through the use of debt. Cadsby and Frank [3] introduced the following altruistic utility function of generation 1 (U1) and asked the subjects to act upon the function: \( {\text{C}}_{1}^{\text{A}} \) is the spending on consumption by generation 1 at period A. U2 is the utility function of generation 2. The results of their experiment favor Ricardian equivalence. Following their study, Slate et al. [24] tested the equivalence under uncertainty, Ricciuti and Di Laurea [17] under liquidity constraints, and Adji et al. [1] under distortionary taxes. In these studies, altruistic intergenerational utility functions were assumed, however in the present paper, the specific form of utility function is not given, because the altruism of the participants and the form of their utility functions, is the subject of investigation here. Under the hypothesis of “silver democracy”, the utility function of generation 1 would take U2 away from Eq. (1). Since fees were not paid to the participantsFootnote 1, the research in this paper is not an experiment in the sense of Smith [25]. However the use of questionnaires which ask subjects to formulate responses to hypothetical situations for the studies of fiscal policy is known in Kotlikoff et al. [12]. Like the research in this paper, their study did not give a specific form of utility function in advance and found an undervaluation of future resources relative to current resources, which suggested that Ricardian policies would not be neutral. In a broader context, economic valuation using stated preference information is known as the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)Footnote 2, which contains a scenario of the hypothetical policy the respondent is being asked to evaluate or vote upon. In this paper, judgment based upon altruism is called public judgment. Sen [21], using Edgeworth’s words, pointed out that when we depart from the “unsympathetic isolation which is abstractly assumed in Economics”, we adopt sympathy and commitment. Through sympathy, humans leave their own limited interests and participate in other people’s happiness/unhappiness and joy/sorrow. And commitment means that “if it does not make you feel personally worse off, but you think it is wrong, you are ready to do something to stop it” [21]. In this way humans begin to act based on public judgment, which is clearly distinguished from judgment based upon personal interests. As an empirical analysis of “silver democracy”, Shimasawa et al. [23] found that per capita geriatric welfare expenses in Japan’s 47 prefectures increase along with median age. Different from their study, this paper investigates the issue in controlled laboratory-like conditions, which enables more precise assessment of the hypothesis. In this paper, consideration is not limited to analysis focusing on individuals, but covers the nature of collective decision making: what is discussed among participants, and how valid the hypothesis of deliberative democracy is. Opinions are exchanged among participants on hypothetical fiscal policy options, and in turn they choose one. On some occasions, a mechanism to artificially create “representatives of future generations” among participants is used. The idea of “representative of future generations” is obtained from Saijo [19]. In this paper, following Saijo [19], the “representative of future generations” is called an “imaginary future generation”(IFG). Nakagawa et al. [15] and Kamijo et al. [10] are previous works involving the use of IFG. In these studies, it is reported that when IFG joins discussion in the laboratory, the groups including the IFGs tend to make a choice of higher sustainability. In these experiments, payoffs over multiple generations (i.e. if the present generation chooses high compensation, the next generation’s compensation decreases) are presented, and choices are made through the exchange of opinions among three participants. What were presented in these experiments were simple numerical values. In this paper, to learn about the functions of IFG, and to obtain keys for improving fiscal policy, concrete options of fiscal policy are presented and discussed. Shichijo and Hiromitsu [26] is a preparatory-stage study toward this paper. This paper extends participants of the survey, considers the hypotheses through statistical investigations, and assesses the results in the broader context of previous works.",3

This incident increased distrust of nuclear power generation among the Japanese population, which resulted in policy makers deciding to halt operations at all nuclear power plants in Japan. Figure 1 illustrates the electricity generation of Japanese incumbent electric companies. Note that electricity generated by nuclear power plants decreased to zero in 2014. Source: Agency for Natural Resources and Energy [1] Electricity generation in Japan. Figure 1 also indicates that electric power companies had to use thermal power plants to generate electric power that was previously generated by nuclear power plants. This increased the electricity price because thermal power plants use expensive fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Figure 2 shows that the electricity price was tending downwards until 2010, but began rising thereafter. Source: Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan [10] Electricity price of electric power companies (Yen, Fiscal Year). The increase in electricity price imposed a heavy burden on manufacturing companies that consume a large amount of electricity. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry [23] estimated that the cost of electricity generation would increase by 3 trillion yen if all nuclear power plants ceased operations, and all the substituted electricity was generated by thermal generation power plants. In such a case, the decline in profits was estimated to be over 50% in the plastics industry, and over 30% in the non-ferrous metal, fibers and transport equipment industries. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry [23] also reported the influence of an increase in electricity price using the following examples. An electric furnace company expressed concerns that its competitiveness decreased because of the increase of imported steel from Korea, where the electricity price is lower. A chemical manufacturer reported that their manufacturing cost increased by one billion yen for each yen/kWh increase in electricity price. This manufacturer reported that they had to shift investment to factories abroad. Hosoe [14] showed that some domestic manufacturing companies were facing disadvantages and accelerated off-shoring to avoid the soaring electricity price. The paper simulated the effects of the power crisis on Japanese industrial sectors using a CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model. The simulation indicated that the power crisis would decrease the domestic output of the wood, paper and printing, pottery, steel and nonferrous metal, and food sectors, and would accelerate foreign direct investments in these sectors. A power crisis like the one in 2011 rarely happens. However, electricity prices can rise due to other factors such as an increase in the costs and tariffs of Feed-in-tariffs (FIT: Fig. 3), and fluctuations in fuel prices (Fig. 4). Source: Agency for Natural Resources and Energy [2] Costs and tariffs of FIT. Source: Institute of Energy Economics, Japan [20] Prices of fuels (yen/calorie). We estimate the sectoral elasticities of manufacturing industries. We believe this kind of analysis is essential in discussing the effects of industrial policies because policy makers should understand which sectors are affected the most by an increase in electricity prices when they formulate industrial policies including tariffs, grants, and other industry-specific policies.",2

Jordan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Much of the discussions in the decade following the “Global Financial Crisis” (GFC) of 2008–2009 has been about the causes of the housing and other bubbles and how repeated bubble episodes can be prevented in the future. These are important issues and are in the spirit of Frederick Hayek who taught, “the only time to fight recession is during the prior expansion”. However, in the years immediately following the international ‘economic hangover’, there also were numerous proposals for enhancing the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in dealing with future “crises”. These ‘how to reduce the pain of hangovers’ recipes implicitly reject the Hayek proposition. What they prescribe instead is greater latitude for policy activism—even more discretion left to economic policymakers. The most worrisome suggestion with regard to monetary policies is the idea that central banks should target higher average inflation rates than had become the consensus in the 1990s—which was something under 2% rates of increase of the common price statistics. Sometimes the proponents of targeting higher inflation acknowledge that debasing the currency is a form of taxation, yet defend the proposals for more of it saying that the un-legislated tax of inflation is not worse than other forms of taxation. This is a political argument, not an economic argument. The economists who advocate higher inflation view the effects of monetary policies working solely, or at least primarily, through interest rates and they fret about the “zero boundary problem”. It is a quite simple argument that nominal market interest rates contain an “inflation premium” and if inflation is very low or nonexistent market interest rates will also be low. The advocates of monetary policy activism view this as a problem because in the midst of a crisis the authorities can make only ‘small’ cuts in interest rates—they cannot go below zero. The central idea is that if aggregate nominal demand for output declines for any reason, a judicious reduction of interest rates by monetary authorities will spur consumers and businesses to spend more, thus sowing the seeds of recovery. The claim is that if the crisis is severe it takes larger cuts in interest rates to reverse the contraction, so higher interest rates to begin with—the result of higher inflation—gives the policymakers a bigger weapon.",3

In April 2013, under current Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the BOJ adopted massive and various monetary easing tools to achieve the target—the so-called Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE). This was expanded in October 2014, and supplemented with a negative interest rate in January 2016 and yield curve control in September 2016. The BOJ’s financial assets as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) recorded about 100% currently—much greater than the European Central Bank (about 30%) and the Federal Reserve (about 25% in 2014 when the maximum had been reached). While the BOJ’s asset purchasing program was extended from the Comprehensive Monetary Easing (CME) under the Governor Shirakawa, its scale of monetary accommodation and diversity of monetary easing tools adopted are unprecedented and extraordinary. Moreover, raising inflation to achieve the 2% target in a low inflationary or mild deflationary environment like Japan is a rare experiment in the world. Many central banks have adopted the inflation-targeting framework, but in the context of a high-inflation environment, so containing inflation was their key objective. In April 2013, Governor Kuroda appeared certain that the 2% price stability target would be achieved in around 2 years, since all necessary measures had been taken. More than 5 years have since passed, and the BOJ continues to lag behind other major central banks including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB). While the Fed struggled to achieve the 2% long-run goal, inflation based on personal consumption expenditure (PCE) and core inflation (based on PCE excluding food and energy) have finally been at a level of around 2% since March 2018. In the eurozone, inflation based on the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) has been around 2% since April 2018, but core inflation has remained at around 1%—well below their price stability target of “below, but close to, 2%.” The BOJ is the poorest performer among the three central banks, since both headline and core inflation remained substantially weaker. According to the latest November 2018 data, inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) recorded 0.9% but CPI excluding all food and energy—an indicator that reflect goods and services mostly determined by domestic demand and supply conditions—was a mere 0.1%. In April 2018, the BOJ gave up expressing the expected timing to reach 2% inflation—after having postponed it six times after its initial claim of “around fiscal year 2015.” This is a clear indication that the BOJ has lost confidence in achieving the target in the foreseeable future. This paper takes an overview of the BOJ’s monetary policy since April 2013 when QQE was adopted and examines factors contributing to the failure of achieving the 2% price stability target. The paper is comprised of five sections. “Adoption of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing and its expansion” section briefly focuses on QQE adopted in April 2013 and its expansion in October 2014. “Negative interest rate, yield curve control, and the july 2018 adjustments” section sheds light on the negative interest rate, yield curve control, and the recent monetary policy adjustment announced in July 2018—all of which could be views as “steps towards monetary policy normalization”—not yet as “clear steps of monetary policy normalization” but steps moving closer toward normalization due to the clear deviation from the original QQE framework. These measures have given rise to ambiguity and complexity over the monetary policy framework due to inconsistency with the BOJ’s communication strategies. “Effectiveness of unconventional monetary easing” section reviews inflation performance and factors contributing to the failure of achieving the 2% price stability target. The conclusion is drawn in “Conclusions” section.",4

The Bank of Japan (BOJ) failed to tame the deflation during its early stages. As a consequence of the 46th House of Representative general election in 2012, the Abe Cabinet was formed on December 26, 2012. The government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the BOJ led by Governor Masaaki Shirakawa at that time released a joint statement on January 22, 2013 about how to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. They declared “the Bank [BOJ] sets the price stability target at 2% in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index”, and “the Bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time” [1]. The change of the BOJ was a Copernican revolution for the BOJ because it had refused to adopt an inflation targeting policy for a long time. When Takatoshi Ito and other academics proposed the policy of inflation targeting (1–3%) in October 2001,Footnote 1 the BOJ refused to introduce their proposal. However, the effectiveness of inflation targeting policy has previously been shown by Bernanke et al. ([2], pp. 333–34, p. 347). Haruhiko Kuroda who assumed the role as the new Governor has introduced Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) as a new monetary policy. Shirai examined the QQE policy in detail in her article of an Overview of the Bank of Japan’s Unconventional Monetary Policy During the Period 2013–2018 [3]. I comment Shirai’s paper on QQE, and reconsider essential matters of the QQE policy adopted by the BOJ.",2

After a decade at the yearend of 2018, the US, where super easing monetary policy was initiated, is finally in the process of the exit policy after successful achievement of 2% inflation and 3% growth rate and gradually raising the interest rate. While the EU continues the negative interest rate policy, she has started to search for the exit policy with some ambiguity towards the future. Japan, on the other hand, has succeeded to get out of deflation, but not achieved the 2% inflation target even after repeated extensions of its target date without any prospect of the growth rate recovery. Japan is a unique country in the world whose growth has almost been stopped for more than 30 years and now positions at around 150th in the world growth rate ranking. Why the unconventional super easing monetary policy was not so effective globally as was expected? Why is Japan most lagged in the recovery and achieving the 2% inflation target? What should Japan’s monetary policy and the growth strategy be to recover the growth? In the following, we present our theoretical analysis to answer the above three questions. On these important topics, numerous arguments and controversies are underway on a variety of scenes, including political, journalistic, as well as academic levels [1]. Especially at present, as the world is in the middle of a big change of the fourth industrial revolution under the unconventional monetary policies, the points of argument could tend to become unfocused. Nevertheless, a policy proposal based on a rigorous economic analysis with a clearly defined time horizon is needed, since the essence of economic activity has never been changed. In the following sections, we present the answers to the above-mentioned three questions. First, “What is the problem of unconventional monetary policy commonly adopted in the advanced economies?” Second, “What’s wrong in Japan?” Finally, “What should Japan’s growth strategy be?” Our purpose is to propose the practical policy solutions to the challenges we are confronting now.",2

Comments and views on Shimizu,August 2019,Keiichiro Kobayashi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The analysis and policy proposal by Professor Yoshinori Shimizu (this volume) is reasonable and persuasive. He argues that the decade-long deflation in Japan has been almost over and we need to constitutionalize the long-term inflation target at 2%. I agree to persuade the Japanese people to recognize that the 2-% inflation is the solution to ever-growing sovereign debt problem and that the close cooperation among the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Services Agency, and the Bank of Japan is necessary. I also agree with Professor Shimizu on the proposal that establishing the balanced budget as soon as possible is necessary for the long-term prosperity of Japan. Before achieving the balanced budget, it is necessary to achieve high economic growth, by implementing “growth strategy”, or, in other words, structural reforms that encourage local banks to increase loans to the small- and medium-size enterprises, promote competition and change vested interests, and provide pecuniary reward or incentives to new innovators. I cannot agree more with Professor Shimizu that the growth strategy should be financed by super-long-term government bond, rather than tax increase. These proposals are quite comprehensive and reasonable, given that the changes in the velocity of money, or the inverse of the Marshallian k, are exogenous and stable. Observing the monetary policy in Japan for the last three decades, we have a question whether the velocity may be endogenous and responsive to the policy changes. If the velocity decreases endogenously in response to an additional monetary easing, it may be difficult to escape from deflation, even if the BOJ or the government of Japan firmly commits to the 2-% inflation target by constitutionalize it. In what follows, we propose a theoretical argument of a new rational expectations’ equilibrium hypothesis in the intergenerational economy. The intergenerationaly rational expectations’ equilibrium implies that velocity is endogenous, and deflation can continue under an extreme increase in money supply.",1

On the one hand, it is often associated with recurring phases of expansion and recession in the overall level of economic activity. On the other hand, it also typically connotes fluctuations in economic activity around a trend level, as captured by the concept of the output gap. Although there are multiple definitions of the business cycle, I focus on the concept of deviations from trend. This is a standard definition. Certainly, if one were to search for images of “The Business Cycle”, it would lead to many similar-looking stylized pictures that plot the level of aggregate output over time as behaving much like what I would refer to as a “rollercoaster ride”, repeatedly climbing above trend in expansions only to fall below trend in the subsequent recessions. This pattern is clearly consistent with the business cycle as deviations from trend. It also corresponds to a symmetric output gap in the sense that movements above trend appear essentially as a mirror image to the movements below. One reason that stylized pictures of the business cycle typically portray a symmetric output gap is that most trend-cycle decompositions used in practice to measure the output gap, such as linear detrending, the Hodrick–Prescott [1] filter, and the Beveridge–Nelson [2] decomposition, impose that the cycle is zero on average. This restriction tends to produce a symmetric-looking cycle by construction. However, deviations from trend may not actually be symmetric. Instead of a “rollercoaster ride”, an alternative analogy is that of a “periodic pandemic”, whereby recessions act like recurring negative health shocks that affect the whole economy and bring output below the trend level at which it would have operated under normal health. This alternative notion of the business cycle is long-standing in macroeconomics and is alluded to in the following quotes by Wesley Mitchell and John Maynard Keynes: “…the most violent declines exceed the most considerable advances. The abrupt declines usually occur in crises; the greatest gains occur in periods of revival.”—Wesley Mitchell [3] “…the substitution of a downward for an upward tendency often takes place suddenly and violently, whereas there is, as a rule, no such sharp turning point when an upward is substituted for a downward tendency.”—John Maynard Keynes [4] Building on the idea that capacity constraints limit how far the economy can grow above trend, while there are not the same limits on how far below trend it can go (except the obvious extreme case of outright collapse to zero activity), Friedman [5, 6] formalized an empirical ‘plucking’ model of aggregate output. According to his model, economic activity is typically at its trend level in normal times, but is plucked below trend like a string nailed to the bottom of a board when the economy suffers a recession, with the string returning to the board during a recovery. The resulting pattern is one of an asymmetric output gap that is negative on average. In this short and highly selective survey, I first review possible theoretical reasons for an asymmetric output gap and some policy implications. I then summarize the empirical evidence for such asymmetry in a range of industrialized economies, including Japan, drawing heavily from the results in Morley and Panovska [7]. I also extend the health analogy to consider hysteresis effects of recessions and state-dependent effects of policy. Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research.",7

Perspectives from time series analysis,February 2020,Hisakazu Kato,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the mid-1970s, the total fertility rate (TFR) in Japan has been consistently below 2.0, and the risks and problems of such a low fertility rate have been debated from early 1990s. Low birth rate is not unique to Japan with many developed countries also experiencing low fertility. In addition, some Asian countries such as Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan have also been facing the same problem. Although China abandoned its one child policy, the signs of rising birth rate are yet to be evident. With regard to Japan, in 2005, the TFR recorded its lowest levels since the World War 2, after which it increased slightly to 1.45 in 2015. In 2018, the TFR in Japan was 1.42, much lower than the replacement ratio to maintain the current population. However, it is marginally higher than Korea or Taiwan. Ever since [4] seminal paper, which laid the foundation for population economics as a specialized field, economic analysis has deliberated on the fertility decision-making. Considering children as durable goods, their costs and family income are essential factors that need to be analyzed. In particular, the opportunity cost of a child for a woman, that is, the loss of her life-long income due to renouncing her job to rear her child, is the most essential factor, and this is influenced by her wages. From this perspective, the decision by woman whether to have a child or whether to continue supplying her labor has a close relationship. Although there are innumerable research studies analyzing the relationship between birth rates and women’s labor supply, these were largely micro-econometric studies, with a time series or macro-level analysis being rather limited. Given that the decision by a household of having a child is influenced by many complex factors, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship using a few macro-level variables. Furthermore, from the perspective of the number of samples, it would be difficult to put it on board on time series analysis, because we can obtain only year-based observations. On the other hand, it is beneficial to analyze the TFR by time series data, because it can capture the dynamic relationship among the variables, although the number of variables would be limited. Using this advantage of time series data, we can estimate the effect of government policy, which is difficult to estimate from cross-sectional data or individual-level panel data, both of which have a limitation in the period of time. The purpose of this study is to show the dynamic relationship between the TFR and women’s labor participation, which are broadly discussed—and to see whether there has been a positive relation between them in recent years—using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. In addition, the second purpose of this study is to estimate the effectiveness of government policy on the TFR as an extend analysis through the SVAR model. There are three main findings in this study, based on the above analysis. First, at a country level for OECD members or at the prefecture level in Japan, although there are many reports establishing a positive relation between the TFR and female labor participation rate, that relation seems spurious. Second, female wage plays an important role in this framework of TFR and women’s labor market, and wage is the third variable that influences both the TFR and labor participation rate. Third, according to SVAR analysis, government policy to improve TFR is effective and the policy has positive impact on TFR. This study is organized as follows. The section “Backgrounds and Literatures” provides the background of TFR decline in Japan and the literature review on its determinants. In particular, we focus on the recent studies on the relationship between the TFR and female labor participation. The section “Data” provides time series characteristics of the data and estimation strategy, and summarizes the SVAR model. The section “Estimation results and the implications” shows the estimation results of the model. Calculation of impulse response function and estimation of cointegration play key roles in this empirical analysis. Conclusion is drawn in the section “Concluding remarks”.",4

Paper companies still have excess facilities as domestic demand declines due to the gaining popularity of electronic media. Over the past decade, there has not been any major industry realignment as the six largest companies continue to dominate the scene. While there has always been a momentum for the formation of a new camp among Daio Paper Corporation, Hokuetsu Kishu Paper Co., Ltd, and Mitsubishi Paper Mills, Ltd. to rival Oji Holdings Corporation and Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd. (the largest and the second-largest players, respectively), such a move was hampered as these companies vied for dominance. Against this backdrop, Oji Holdings announced in February 2018 that it will form a capital and operational alliance with Mitsubishi Paper Mills. The alliance is aimed at maintaining the companies’ cost competitiveness by eliminating excess production facilities and jointly operating ships to transport chip materials. Domestic demand for paper is expected to decline for 8 years in a row; hence, the challenge for the entire industry is how each company should expand its earnings. There have been many empirical studies regarding mergers in the paper industry from the standpoint of productivity and cost effectiveness. However, such studies only compared cost effectiveness based on data regarding existing companies. No comparisons have been made between actual and hypothetical mergers. To overcome this, this article creates simulations of data on hypothetical mergers (i.e., whether mergers actually took place or not). A relative comparison will be made between such simulated data and the actual merger data regarding cost effectiveness using a data envelopment analysis (DEA).",1

The analysis builds on a theoretical model that decomposes movements in external and domestic shifts into anticipated and unanticipated components using rational expectations. Anticipated movements are assumed to vary with agents’ observations of macro-economic fundamentals, which determine changes over time. Deviation in domestic and external shifts from the anticipated values captures shocks impinging on the economic system. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of adjustments in monetary growth and government spending to domestic private spending and external fluctuations (exports, imports, the exchange rate and the oil price). The empirical investigation aims to gauge policy adjustments and the implications on trend indicators of real growth and price inflation. Specifically, the model determines the effects of external and domestic shifts on the growth of the money supply and government spending with respect to anticipated and unanticipated shifts. In this context, anticipated movements determine the trends of policy adjustments. In contrast, unanticipated movements with respect to domestic and external shocks determine cyclical fluctuations and trigger stabilization policy adjustments. The data under investigation are for a sample of 18 developing countries and 27 advanced countries. In the first step, the analysis identifies the time-series results of policy adjustments with respect to anticipated and unanticipated domestic and external shifts. In the second step, the analysis considers co-movements in the policy responses to domestic and external shifts impinging on the macro-economy. Subsequently, the analysis considers variation in the trends of real growth and price inflation, with the time-series policy responses to domestic and external shifts employed in the empirical model. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Theoretical background and empirical models” presents the theoretical background and outlines the empirical models. “Empirical results” presents empirical results.

In response, Japan, jointly with the United States and the EU, had filed the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Procedures regarding China’s export restrictions on these raw materials and, in August 2014, the WTO Appellate Body ruled that China’s export regulations were inconsistent with WTO Agreements. In conformity with WTO recommendations, China abolished its export duties in May 2015, in addition to the export quotas in January 2015 [16].Footnote 2 In recent years, there has been an increased trend of “resource nationalism” among material producing countries to take actions to retain their raw materials, causing conflicts of interests between material producing and importing countries.Footnote 3 Export restrictions on raw materials may be implemented to allocate raw materials preferentially for a material producing country’s manufacturing industry and maintain the competitiveness of its domestic industry. Thus, export restrictions on raw materials have become an important global issue.Footnote 4 This study aims to examine the strategic export policy towards raw materials in the context of a model with vertically related markets. In addition, it explores the effects of government interventions of raw material importers on the export policy towards these materials. For this purpose, this study constructs a simple two-country model, where one material exporting country has an upstream monopolist producing raw materials, such as rare earths, whose production generates local pollution, and downstream firms producing a final good from the raw materials, and one material importing country has downstream firms using the raw materials.Footnote 5 In this model, an export tax towards raw materials has the following effects: a positive one of an increase in domestic downstream firms’ profits and a reduction in local environmental damage, and a negative one of reductions in domestic upstream firm’s profit and consumer surplus. Depending on the relative magnitudes of these effects, the optimal export policy is either a tax or a subsidy. With regard to the optimal export policy towards raw materials, the following results are obtained. If the number of downstream firms in the material exporting country is not too small and these firms have the lowest costs, then the optimal export policy on raw materials when there is no intervention by the government of the material importer is a tax. In contrast, if the number of downstream firms in the material importing country is sufficiently large, these firms have the lowest costs, and the material exporting country values pollution damage less, then the optimal export policy is a subsidy. The reason is that, in the former case, the positive effect of the export tax outweighs the negative effect; whereas in the latter, the negative effect is dominant. With regard to the effects of the material importer’s government intervention on the export policy towards raw materials, the following results are obtained: the import tariff on the final good imposed by the importer’s government reduces the incentive to levy an export tax on raw materials, and may determine the exporter’s government to provide an export subsidy. This is because the import tariff on the final good diminishes the positive effect of the export tax towards the raw material and strengthens the negative effect. Furthermore, the interventions by the two governments make the material exporting country worse off, but may make the material importing country better off relative to free trade. This study contributes to the literature on strategic trade policy in vertically related markets. Several existing studies have examined strategic export interventions in downstream industries in the presence of a vertical industry structure (e.g., [1, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12]. In contrast, this study focuses on export policies towards upstream industries.Footnote 6 Using a two-country model of vertically related markets characterized by Cournot competition, Fung and Korinek [8] analyze the economic effects of export taxes applied to industrial raw materials.Footnote 7 However, they do not deal with the issue of an optimal export policy in raw materials sector, and assume that the other trading country is passive. In a model with a vertical market structure and an environmental damage function (local pollution caused by production of dirty intermediate goods and global environmental improvements from clean final goods), Wan and Wen [19] compare the environmental and welfare impacts of three policies: downstream production subsidies, upstream pollution taxes, and upstream export tariffs. Unlike us, they do not consider retaliation and trade war (upstream export tariffs versus downstream import tariffs), and assume symmetric downstream industries.Footnote 8 As shown by our findings, the optimal export policy towards raw materials depends crucially on the difference in material exporter’s and importer’s downstream industries. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and derives the market equilibrium. Section 3 analyzes the strategic export policy towards raw materials. Section 4 considers the interactions between the governments of material exporting and importing countries. Section 5 presents conclusions.",

According to the definition of International Monetary Fund (IMF), workers’ remittances refer to the value of monetary transfers that is sent from the workers residing abroad for more than 1 year to the home country and are recorded in different sections of the balance of payments. Nowadays, remittances become an important and reliable source of external funding and capital accumulation in the developing economy [3]. In developing countries, remittances play an important role as a source of household income and are considered as a stable source [4]. In 2017, India was the largest remittance-receiving country, whereas Bangladesh was the eighth in the world [46,47,48]. Every year, South Asian migrant workers sent a significant amount of remittances which is an important source of economic development. Remittances are used to raise national savings, reduce the constraint associated with foreign exchange and balance of payments, and contribute to development budget. The remittances should be transferred through formal channels such as bank drafts, money transfer companies, and others to maximize the inflow of remittances. Informal channels like traders, friends or relatives without legal status should be avoided [27]. According to the neoclassical theory of migration, labor moves from low-wage countries to relatively high-wage countries because of wage differences among countries [23]. Remittances provide a way of poverty reduction and economic development when immigrants send remittances to the home country [49]. On the other hand, this type of migration to abroad could damage the development process when the home country loses highly educated and skilled workers which is called brain drain [41]. Thus, losses of human capital may affect economic growth negatively as reflected in the neoclassical growth theory. Remittances may have adverse effects in the economic context. It may hamper economic growth through exchange rate appreciation thereby making it less competitive in international trade [35]. It may also inversely affect the labor supply decision of recipient families. Increase in remittances can be considered as an increase in non-labor income. Considering leisure as a normal good, households are expected to demand more leisure after receiving remittances in the form of non-labor income. The research of Rodriguez and Tiongson [36] indicates that remittances reduce the labor supply of receiving households in the Philippines. Thus, remittances have a negative impact on the labor supply decision of receiving family members, particularly female members [42]. It can raise inequality between families those are getting remittances and those are not. This procedure makes recipient families dependent on remittances and takes them away from productive activities. Most of the time, this money is used for consumption rather than productive investment [17]. The negative relationship between remittances and economic growth implies the altruistic motive of remittances while it specifies the productive motive if positively related. Sometimes, people use unofficial channels like Hundi and Hawala to reduce the sending cost of remittances which are called informal remittances. Political stability and better government laws are positively related to remittance inflow [1]. Usually, people use two types of channels to transfer funds: formal and informal. Government supervision and laws are associated with formal channels such as banks, postal services, money transfer operators and other wire transfer services. In most cases, these channels are related to high transaction costs and exchange loss. Hundi is the informal system used to send remittances to Bangladesh. Hundi and Hawala exist in Pakistan, whereas the Hawala system is known to India. Though Hundi is informal, it is organized comprising a network of relationships like friendship, kinship and regional attachment [33]. Favorable cost and speed of the informal channel Hawala lead to the migrants of Sri Lanka finding it more attractive than other formal channels [44]. Figure 1 shows the amount of remittances in 2017 of four countries. India was the top remittance-receiving country all over the world receiving $69.0 billion in 2017.

This paper is concerned with the impact of remittances from four selected countries as these countries are emerging and receive a huge amount of remittances from all over the world whose productive utilization may raise economic growth. The purpose of this research is to examine whether remittances have a significant impact on economic growth in South Asian emerging countries. In this regard, this paper aims to find out the relationship between remittances and economic growth of these countries within the framework of neoclassical growth theory. Besides the joint impact, the individual impact of remittances in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and the comparison among these countries are also provided with the purpose of distinguishing the utilization of remittance inflows. To conduct this analysis, annual data of 40 years over the period 1977–2016 were collected from the World Bank and IMF database. Country-specific analysis of remittances is added along with the overall impact of remittances in four emerging countries which implies the originality of this research, as most of the existing literature only provide the joint impact of remittances for developing or emerging countries. Initially, pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) regressions are run to get the joint impact of remittances on economic growth for four emerging countries. Then, the dummy variable interaction model is used to identify the separate impact of each country. The F-test is also conducted to test the joint significance of interaction terms. Probability value indicates that interaction terms are jointly significant. Regression results show that the joint impact of remittances is negative and significant. The country-specific dummy variable interaction model implies a negative impact of remittances in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and positive impact in India. The paper is structured as follows. “Literature review” briefly discusses the literature on the relationship between remittances and economic growth. It contains the positive, negative, mixed and neutral impact of remittances in different countries. “Methodology” explains the variables, data source, relevant models, methodology and empirical implementation of this study. “Empirical results” represent the results from the relevant estimation. Finally, “Conclusion” delivers the concluding remarks and recommendations.",47

In this speech, president Xi noted that the new normal of China's economy has the following three featuresFootnote 1: First, the economy has shifted gear from the previous high speed to a medium-to-high speed growth. Second, the economic structure is constantly improved and upgraded. The tertiary industry and consumption demand are becoming the main driver. Urban–rural and regional disparities are narrowing. Household income is going up as a percentage of national income. The benefits of development are reaching more people. Third, the economy is increasingly driven by innovation instead of input and investment. The growth pace of the Chinese economy has shifted significantly from high speed to medium-to-high speed. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China’s real GDP growth rate in 2018 was 6.6%, the lowest annual growth rate since 1990. China’s real GDP growth rate was on average more than 10% for the period 1981 through 2010, but it dropped to 7.7% during the period of the 12th 5-year plan (2011–15), showing a gradually declining trend (Fig. 1). It is almost impossible to foresee if China would get back to double-digit economic growth in the future. China’s real GDP growth rate: 1981–2018. Data: National Bureau of Statistics of China In the abovementioned APEC CEO summit speech, president Xi also mentioned that “the intensity of our endeavor to comprehensively deepen reform will determine whether we will successfully adapt ourselves to the new normal” and stressed the importance of innovation:  To comprehensively deepen reform, we need to broaden the path for innovation. If innovation is the new engine for China's development, reform is the indispensable igniter. We need to take more effective measures to enable the engine of innovation to run with full power. In recent years, one of the economic reforms promoted in China was the transformation of the economic growth model on the supply side. Under the new normal conditions, the Chinese government has been accelerating the implementation of an innovation-driven development strategy. What preceded this reform was the structural change contribution to economic growth. It is well known that there are three main factors that contribute to economic growth: labor input, capital stock, and total factor productivity (TFP). Regarding the labor input, China’s labor supply has been profoundly affected by the one-child policy started around 1980. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the working-age population (aged 15–59 years) started to decrease in 2012 and will continue to shrink gradually.Footnote 2 This decline had a negative impact on economic growth in China.Footnote 3 As for capital stock, China’s overall leverage, measured as the debt-to-GDP ratio, is still relatively high, especially in the corporate sector (China’s corporate debt was 129% of GDP in 2018).Footnote 4 Therefore, it is almost difficult to increase capital stock with further investment expansion. In fact, the yearly growth rate of fixed-asset investment has already been declining since several years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the fixed-asset investment rose to 30% in 2009, but shrank to 5.9% in 2018. Consequently, it is highly essential to improve growth through the TFP channel to maintain a medium-to-high speed in a situation in which the labor input and capital stock contribution to economic growth is gradually decreasing.Footnote 5 The Chinese government is strengthening research and development to increase TFP’s contribution to GDP.Footnote 6 This article introduces some policies for stimulating innovation in China and examines the current state of the new economy, which has the most effective policy effects.",11

Since the pattern and speed of demographic transition differ in each country, the effects of demographic transition on the economy also differ in each country. China has experienced rapid demographic transition since the 1970s, as the working-age population has increased, and the dependent population ratio has decreased. Such demographic transition provides favorable conditions for economic growth, thereby producing economic fruits referred to as the ""demographic dividend"". Yuan and Gao [6] argue that China’s rapid demographic transition could provide a demographic dividend and that China has successfully harvested this demographic dividend with the “Reform and Opening-up” policy. They conclude that this demographic dividend has greatly contributed to China’s “miracle” economic development. However, their study does not clearly analyze the economic mechanism through which the demographic dividend has affected China’s economic growth. This paper extends their study and clarifies how and to what extent the demographic dividend has affected China’s economic growth. In the following sections, China’s demographic transition is briefly reviewed, the demographic dividend is economically explained, and its effects on the Chinese economy are empirically discussed, along with the results of some previous studies and a simple analysis of macro data.",3

The rate increased slightly from 48.7% in 2000 to 50.0% in 2015. Though FLP at the national level remained flat, there have been significant regional disparities in FLP of the working-age population (15–64 years). Among 3362 administrative areas in Japan, the lowest and the highest values are 41.8% and 89.1%, respectively in 2015, showing a big difference. Furthermore, there is a remarkable tendency that regions with low FLP are geographically concentrated. It is quite important to investigate spatial distribution patterns of FLP in order to implement regional labor market policies effectively. Therefore, this study aims to examine spatial distribution patterns of FLP. To improve FLP under the rapidly aging of the population, it is crucial to raise participation rates for the working-age population, specifically for the regions with low FLP and consequently reduce regional differences in FLP. Various studies have examined the determinants of female labor force participation rate (FLP). In Japan, the total fertility rate (TFR) and FLP have been positively correlated since the mid-1970s. In a time series analysis, Kato [1] examined whether the observed relationship between TFR and FLP in Japan truly exists. Kato [1] identified a genuine factor that affected both TFR and FLP was female wage; moreover, TFR was strongly positively related to the ratio of the public expenditure for young families to the gross domestic product. Mishra, Nielsen and Smyth [2] examined the relationship between TFR and FLP using the 1960–2006 data of the G7 countries. They found that a 1% increase in TFR induced a 0.4% decline in FLP. Elsby et al. [3] showed that in the US, the FLP rose during the 1990s because of a decrease in exit from the labor force, but after the 2000s, the FLP decreased as entry to the labor market declined. Examining the data of 22 OECD countries in 1990 and 2010, Blau and Kahn [4] argued the effects of policies facilitating labor market participation for women. Kato [1] further concluded that Japan’s TFR improved after the mid-2000s due to the influence of the Government’s family policies. The effects and roles of family-friendly policies have also been considered in previous research [2, 4, 5]. Some previous studies have focused on regional disparities of FLP in a country [6, 8]. Regional level analysis can reveal the differences within a country, informing effective regional policies that can contribute to nationwide rises in FLP. Liu and Noback [6] investigated the factors affecting the regional FLP in the Netherlands. They found that regional FLP is influenced by the demographic conditions, socio-economic status, and female-dominated industrial sectors. Ederveen, Nahuis and Parikh [9] performed a panel data analysis of 83 European regions. They found that FLP relieves the reverse impact of low mobility on the regional disparity adjustment. A variety of approaches has been addressed to analyze the regional differences in FLP. However, regional FLP analysis often fails to grasp the regional distribution patterns of FLP in a geographical space. Can any geographic distribution patterns be explained by spatial interaction effects? This paper examines changes in regional FLP distribution patterns in Japan from 2000 to 2015. The regional data of more than 1800 municipalities are sourced from the 2000 and 2015 Japanese Censuses. This study utilizes geographic information systems (GIS) and an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) suggested by Anselin [10, 11]. The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial dependence of the distribution patterns of FLP and to discern the implications for regional labor market policies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section ""Data and Spatial Distribution of Female Labor Force Participation Rates in Japan"" describes the data and the regional FLP distributions in 2000 and 2015. Section ""Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis of Female Labor Force Participation Rates"" identifies the spatial heterogeneities of the FLP by using spatial data analysis. Section ""Conclusion"" concludes the paper.",1

Ali Akkemik,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The long quest for optimal allocation of power resources has pushed for fundamental reform in the electricity sector in many countries during the past decades. Electricity markets have been subject to significant liberalization starting from the 1980s. However, liberalization in the electricity markets across countries was never an easy process. There still exist challenges in opening up power markets completely due to the sector’s complexity and new challenges arising from various generation sources and environmental concerns. Electricity sectors are regulated to ensure that supply and demand are always balanced, so that the system does not collapse. The sector has traditionally been recognized as strategic and managed through state-run vertically integrated monopolies with prices set lower than marginal costs. However, this has led to high inefficiencies and large burdens on state budgets. Since the 1980s, governments have been trying to open up all or certain segments of the power sector to competition, starting first in Chile, the UK, Argentina, Norway, New Zealand, and Australia. Turkey has also undertaken various reforms to liberalize its electricity market starting from the 1990s.Footnote 1 The Turkish electricity industry has undergone a considerable transformation, since a new electricity market law was approved in 2001. The new law introduced large-scale reform in the sector. Key steps in this reform process were (i) unbundling generation, transmission, distribution, and trading activities, (ii) establishing an independent regulatory body, (iii) launching wholesale power trading through the day-ahead market, and (iv) finalizing the privatization of distribution companies by 2013. A new electricity market law was enacted in 2013. The new law introduced new changes including, (i) separation of market operator from system operator, (ii) establishment of an energy exchange, (iii) establishment of an intra-day power trading platform, (iv) privatization of generation assets, and (v) the removal of autoproducers’ status for private generators. There has been considerable efficiency improvement during the course of reform in the electricity market [1]. Electricity market reform in Turkey has been subject to a number of studies.Footnote 2 While most studies examining the electricity market reforms are descriptive (e.g., [4, 6, 11, 13, 14, 21, 37, 47]), analytical studies examine this issue from different perspectives such as statistical and econometric modeling [22, 38], data envelopment analysis [12], general equilibrium modeling, and simulation models [8]. In this paper, we examine the impact of electricity market reform on the Turkish economy using an applied multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. While using the standard features of the general class of CGE models, our model reflects the institutional structure and the market power in the electricity industry. An important characteristic of our model is the introduction of increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition in the electricity sector.Footnote 3 Various papers in the past have examined the government’s policies in the electricity market in Turkey using CGE models. Madlener et al. [35] were the first CGE model with a focus on Turkish electricity sector, and examined how energy conversion technology adoption under uncertainty has performed from an environmental and an investor’s point of view. They found that while positively contributing to environmental sustainability, gas-fired power generation technologies do not carry clear merits from an investor’s perspective. Aydin [5] examined the impact of the expansion of hydroelectric power’s share in the generation mix using a dynamic CGE model, and found that this change increases real GDP by 0.14% and decreases carbon emissions by 0.012% per annum. In a CGE study examining the impact of reforms in Turkey, Akkemik and Oguz [3] found using counterfactual analysis of full liberalization of the electricity sector that GDP rises by 0.53% and welfare improves by 1.08%. Their findings suggest possible outcomes for further reform in the power sector, in which full retail competition has aspired. PWC [40] analyzed the changes in the Turkish energy sector using the GTAP model, but this study has little focus on electricity sector.Footnote 4 With this background, this paper contributes to the literature on electricity market reforms in two avenues. First, it examines the reforms in the electricity market in Turkey, which is an important emerging market. Second, it builds a general equilibrium model that introduces sophistication with regards to the institutional organization of the electricity sector. This paper builds on the multi-sector CGE model in Akkemik and Oguz [3], but extends it to reflect the institutional structure of the electricity sector. Previous CGE studies treat the electricity sector either as a constant-returns-to-scale sector or treat the electricity sector as a single production entity. However, the supply process in the electricity sector involves different stages starting from generation to transmission and then to distribution and sales. Akkemik and Oguz [3] treat different stages separately in the CGE model, but ignore the institutional structure of the sector. The public and private segments of the electricity sector may be subject to different constraints and this may have important policy implications. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first CGE study that accommodates such institutional features of the market in the modeling exercise. Since the reform process emphasized the unbundling of these stages and increasing the presence of the private sector, we differentiate between the public and private sectors for each stage of electricity supply. This is a major innovative aspect of our model. In addition, to address another aim of the reform process, namely, the establishment of a wholesale power trading through the day-ahead market, we also include this market in the model as a satellite account attached to the electricity sector. Overall, our CGE model is designed to comprehensively examine the electricity market reforms in Turkey by fully reflecting its institutional organization of the market as well as its microeconomic features such as increasing returns to scale. We conduct various policy experiments using the CGE model. Some important simulation results are noteworthy. The simulation findings imply that market liberalization benefits the economy the most if it is undertaken for all state-run power companies simultaneously, and operational inefficiencies of state-run companies are reduced, stronger private-sector participation is realized in the generation segment and establishment of the day-ahead market. Removing the mark-up for state-run power companies, including generation, wholesale trading, and distribution segments, leads to a positive change in GDP by 0.35%. A rise in the private sector’s share in power generation also boosts GDP significantly by 0.18%. More remarkably, the impact of higher participation of state-run companies to the day-ahead market is positive, by 0.25% of GDP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section provides an overview of the electricity sector in Turkey. The third section briefly discusses the electricity sector reform. The fourth explains the methodology and data. The fifth section reports findings from simulations, and finally, the sixth section concludes.",2
14.0,2.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,11 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-020-00042-1,What prolongs the duration of NEET status for youth? Evidence from Japanese panel data,August 2020,Yoshiyuki Tanaka,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Following the “Great Recession,” which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, youth unemployment rates rapidly increased in Western countries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the average unemployment rate for youth aged 15–24 years in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 2.7% higher than the pre-recession level. In this scenario, the rise in the number of young people who are “not in education, employment, or training” (NEET) has emerged as a serious problem worldwide [1]. A NEET is defined as a young person who is not working or learning, and includes job seekers. The OECD [2] reports that the number of NEETs grew substantially from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2011. In the Euro area, particularly in Ireland and Spain, the NEET ratio exceeded 4% during the period. After 2011, the OECD [1] reported that many countries did not recover to pre-recession employment levels. Furthermore, the impact of the recession has been especially severe for youth compared to adults. The OECD [1] similarly shows that more than half of NEET youth are in the non-labor force, and the increase in the number of NEETs aged 20–24 years and 25–29 years has been remarkable. This has resulted in immobilization and discouragement of NEET youth. Despite the problem of youth unemployment, the literature on NEETs remains insufficient. Moreover, the transition from NEET to another status has been debated only marginally. Samoilenko and Carter [3] consider the transition problem for NEETs (aged 15–24 years) in New Zealand using the “Survey of Family, Income and Employment 2002–2010” and link administrative data from the “Integrated Data Infrastructure.” Their sample includes 645 NEETs, divided into three cohorts along with the macroeconomic environment. They use the propensity score matching method to control for the unobserved individual heterogeneity and compare NEET and non-NEET groups within a 2-year and 4-year flow status. The results show that after 2 years, the NEET group is more likely to be jobless and on social security. This result is substantial both for the long-term NEET group and for the older age group (aged 20–24 years). Meanwhile, after 4 years, the likelihood to be on social security remains high, but the employment rate shows no significant difference. Ranzani and Rosati [4] analyze the transition problem for NEETs (aged 15–24 years) in Mexico using the “Mexican Labor Force Survey.” The data consist of quarterly interviews and sample changes every five quarters. The authors review the data and find that about 60% of NEETs retain their status for 1 year, while about 25% find jobs, with males more likely to find jobs. The estimation results of a multinomial logit model with individual random effects show that those with low educational qualification, long-term NEET status, higher age, and who are women tend to retain the NEET status. Broadly, the results of these studies reveal the existence of negative duration dependence of the NEET status, especially for older generations. In Japan, despite the consequences of the Great Recession being less serious compared to other countries, there has been little improvement in youth employment. Furthermore, labor market conditions have significantly worsened over the last 2 decades. After the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990 s, companies reduced the recruitment of new graduates while protecting workers who were already employed. To make matters worse, because of the Japanese system of collective recruitment of new graduates, the young people who were unemployed after graduation encountered difficulties finding jobs, tending to stay in unstable jobs with low wages. This is known as the scarring effect of the cohort and has been discussed extensively in past literature. According to Ohta et al. [5], the labor market during the year of graduation impacts an individual’s performance in the labor market for at least 12 years, especially for an individual with low educational background. The unstable young workers have been widely known as Freeter since the early 90 s. Sakai and Higuchi [6] study the Freeter and the flow of its employment status in Japan. Specifically, they define unstable young workers, that is, non-employed (including NEETs) or non-regular workers within 2 years after graduation. Using the Keio Household Panel Survey, they empirically estimate the duration of the Freeter spell until the individuals eventually transition into regular employment and get married. The results show that in recent years, it has become difficult for people to exit the Freeter status. It is likewise difficult to get married due to low income after experiencing the Freeter status. In the early 2000 s, the unstable young people, particularly those aged 15–34 years in the non-labor force and not in education, employment, or training—defined as the NEETs [7, 8]—became a social problem in Japan. Several policies have since been launched to aid such youth. For example, the Job Cafés, employment placement or vocational ability development service for youth, launched in 2003, and the Local Youth Support Stations, the counseling or consultation services for youth who have difficulties in social participation, launched in 2006. However, few studies have examined the causes of the Japanese NEETs as a non-labor force in Japan. Kosugi [7] discusses the characteristics of NEETs and points out that they tend to have a lower educational background, including junior high school graduates or high school dropouts, and often live with parents or other relatives of an older generation. Ohta [9] finds that economic environment factors, a low rate of job opening ratio, or a high proportion of low-income households, have affected the number of NEETs in 47 prefectures. Genda [10, 11] focuses on the labor supply behavior of individuals and confirms the discouraged worker effect for groups with low expected return on job seeking and the income effect of individuals with high household income. However, the income effect has weakened given the increase in the number of NEETs from low-income households in recent years. Over a decade has passed since the NEET became a social problem in the early 2000 s. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) [12] defines middle-aged non-labor force, as those aged 35–44 years in the non-labor force without education or training, and those aged 15–34 years as the NEETs. The Ministry reports that “after 2002, the NEET rate retains its high level, but the notable point is the gradual growth of non-labor force rate among middle-aged persons. This could be related to the time spent as an out of the labor force because it becomes more difficult to find a job as time passes. Thus, the age group of the non-labor force is growing [12, pp. 160]”. This result implies that the reason for the growth of the non-labor force is the negative duration dependence of joblessness, which makes finding jobs more difficult, thereby prolonging the unemployment spell that was identified by overseas’ literature. However, there are important differences between Japan’s and other countries’ definitions of NEETs. First, the Japanese NEET definition considers a wider range of age categories with a maximum age of 34 or 39 years, while the maximum definition in the overseas’ studies is 24 years—at least 10-year difference. Furthermore, the definition of NEET in Japan is limited to non-labor force for young people, while overseas’ researches include jobseekers [7, 8]. Thus, it is unclear whether the abovementioned results can be applied to Japan. Second, as Flinn and Heckman [13] point out, there is a substantial difference between the hazard rates for transitions into employment from the non-labor force and from unemployment. Thus, the non-labor force and unemployment should be considered separately. There has been much consideration of married women’s labor force status (e.g., Heckman and McCurdy, [14]), while there is only some literature on the transitions in labor-force status among the elderly and the disability welfare policy (e.g., Little, [15]). From this perspective, even less literature regarding the transition from the non-labor force for youth or working-aged individuals is available. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature focusing on the transition from NEET status in Japan. Thus, this is the first study that defines a NEET as a member of the non-labor force, and empirically examines the factors of transition from NEET to another labor force status. Furthermore, this paper examines transition into regular or non-regular employment and the different working attitudes among NEETs as non-labor force youth, which could be unique to Japanese literature. We use panel data from the “Japanese Longitudinal Survey of Adults in the 21st Century” conducted by the MHLW, after which the transition from NEET status was estimated using the competing risk model. The result shows that although many NEETs leave the status within a year, there exists a negative duration dependence of joblessness. We also find that higher educational qualifications and job experience improve the transition from the NEET status; however, there are different outcomes for gender with respect to educational background. For men, graduation from a university or completion of graduate studies promotes the transition from the NEET status; while, for women, graduation from a professional school or junior college also promotes the transition. However, from the estimation with the classification of regular and non-regular employment, gender differences emerge. Women tend to engage in work as non-regular employees, while men do not tend to be willing to work in non-regular employment. Therefore, we conclude that the hurdle for employment is relatively high among men because their reservation values for accepting jobs are higher relative to women. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Theoretical background and estimation model” explains the theoretical background and estimation model. “Data” describes the data, the “Japanese Longitudinal Survey of Adults in the 21st Century,” and the behavior of the data. “Estimation results” reports the empirical results. “Summary and conclusion” concludes the paper.",

For example, consumers can buy books, home appliances, and movies via Amazon, one of the largest online commerce platforms. People communicate via social media platforms such as Facebook, which also mediates users and advertisers. Moreover, crowdsourcing platforms enable people to work as individual contractors with other organizations or individuals. In addition, sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb and Uber enable people to utilize scarce resources of consumers using coordination functions of those platforms. These examples demonstrate that digital platforms exert a deep impact on the fundamental functions of the economy such as how we buy, sell, and work in the society. On the other hand, there is a growing concern among public authorities over the consequences of the rapid diffusion of digital platforms. Given the strong network externality of the digital platforms, many of them are becoming dominant in the market and causing the concern on monopoly. The market domination of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon—all US-based platform companies and Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Jindong, having a similar presence in China symbolize the issues. Galloway [1] points out the risk of giant digital platforms gaining ultimate control over the society. Consequently, excessive dominance and monopoly is becoming one of the major concerns among government authorities. Government authorities are also expressing their concerns on privacy, such as the proper handling of personal data in the digital platforms (MIC [2]). The destruction of traditional industry is also frequently discussed as one of the negative effects of digital platforms. Given the growing negative concerns, government authorities are considering political measures to regulate digital platforms. For example, on April 17, 2019, the European Parliament approved a new regulation on digital platforms aiming at “establishing a fair, trusted and innovation-driven environment for businesses and traders.” The European Commission also established the “Expert group to the EU Observatory on the Online Platform Economy” to monitor the implementation of rules.Footnote 1 From the taxation perspective, OECD [3] issued a proposal on a unified framework for solving base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), aiming at proper taxation and distribution of wealth of multinational digital service companies. In Japan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) established a committee on platform services and showed the future steps for composing the regulatory framework on international providers, personal data handling, and fake news (MIC [2]). The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI [4]) conducted a survey focusing on the issues between retailers and e-commerce platforms. In addition, the Consumer Commission of Japan is studying e-commerce platforms focusing on consumer protection (The Consumer Commission [5]). The concerns on digital platforms are widely spreading as shown above, but it is still not clear how the presence and the diffusion of digital platforms are affecting the society and economy. Digital platforms are already functioning as the fundamental infrastructure of economic systems, and there would be both positive and negative effects on the economy. De Reuver et al. [6] provided a literature review in 2017, which is limited to recommending researchers to address issues on definitions, scope, and methodology for future research, and does not specifically focus on the economic impact. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date survey considering the development in the past few years, with focus on the economic impact. Therefore, the present research conducts a literature review aiming at answering the question, “How much do we know about the economic impact of digital platforms?”. This paper is structured as follows. Section “Definition of a digital platform” explains the method of literature survey and shows an overview of prior studies. Section “Methodology and overview of literature” explains the previous studies on digital platforms in terms of mechanisms and business models which are not the focus of this study; however, the basic characteristics of digital platforms are reviewed for further discussions in the paper. Section “Economic impact of digital platforms” introduces the prior studies on the economic impact of digital platforms. Being the main section, it has the following five subsections: labor, incubation, consumption, destruction, and wealth distribution. Section “Future research opportunity” introduces the future research opportunities, and “Conclusion” provides the conclusion.",2

After the funds rate reached zero, they turned to purchasing housing agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy. The U.S. economy recovered quickly from the GFC. Many expressed concern, however, about the impacts that unconventional monetary policy is having on the banking sector. Banks channel saving to alternative borrowers. If there are complete markets and perfect information, then the financial system is a veil.Footnote 1 Modigliani and Miller [12] showed that, under these assumptions, whether a firm raises funds through debt or equity does not affect the firm’s cash flow and thus its value. Fama [8] extended this result to banks. He showed that whether the public holds bank deposits or common stocks affects only the labeling of ownership claims and not macroeconomic outcomes. These depend on the tastes and endowments of economic agents and on the state of technology. Akerlof [1] demonstrated that asymmetric information could overturn these efficiency results. In his example, a seller lowering the price of a used car can cause buyers to lose interest because of concerns that the car is a “lemon.” Prices may thus be unable to clear markets. Additional factors, such as an independent mechanic, may be needed for the market to function efficiently. Financial markets are plagued by imperfect information. Savers release funds today for the promise of obtaining funds later. Whether they get repaid depends on the character of the borrower, the quality of the investment, the collateral that the borrower can provide, and other factors. The lender needs to consider these items and not just the price (i.e., interest rate). Asymmetric information can hinder the flow of funds from savers to small businesses and other lenders whose creditworthiness is hard to evaluate. Financial institutions can bridge imperfect information problems. As Bernanke [2] noted, banks have a comparative advantage because of the following reasons: (1) economies of specialization, as lending officers gain expertise in a particular industry; (2) economies of scale, as it is cheaper for bank to evaluate a loan than for small savers to; and (3) economies of scope, as it is cheaper to provide lending services together with other services. Banks may play a role in bridging information asymmetries analogous to role of an independent mechanic in the market for used cars. Petralia et al. [13] highlighted why banks may play a unique role in channeling funds from savers to borrowers. Banks accept safe short-term deposits and transform these into risky longer-term loans. They make a profit on the difference between the interest rate they earn on longer-term assets and the rate they pay of short-term deposits (the net interest margin). They screen borrowers and monitor their financial conditions. They also manage their loan portfolio and diversify away idiosyncratic risk. In addition, their ability to pool funds from many depositors allows them to provide liquidity and payments services. If banks are special, then an interruption in their intermediation may disrupt the wider economy. Contractionary monetary policy may hinder the flow of financial intermediation. As Bernanke and Gertler [6] discussed, this can happen if it raises the external finance premium. The external finance premium is the difference between the cost of funds raised externally (e.g., through equity, debt, and bank loans) and the opportunity cost of internal funds. These costs can differ because of informational asymmetries and other imperfections. Bernanke and Gertler [6] noted that the external finance premium should fall as borrowers’ net worth increases. Higher net worth implies that borrowers can post more collateral, provide larger down payments, and take other steps to improve the terms of the loan. If the central bank raises interest rates, then firms face higher interest payments and lower cash flow. This worsens their financial positions and the terms of available loans. As some firms forgo loans, financial intermediation declines. Expansionary monetary policy that pushes short rates low or negative and that reduces the spread between long- and short-term rates may reduce the net interest margin that banks receive. This can reduce their profitability and capital. As Bernanke and Gertler [6] observed, a decline in bank capital can impair the ability of banks to attract funds and thus to make loans. The Fed implemented expansionary policy to fight the GFC. It first lowered the federal funds rate from 5.25% in August 2007 to zero in December 2008. It then turned to quantitative easing (QE), purchasing housing agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy. As Table 1 shows, QE was implemented in three stages: QE1 from November 2008 to November 2009, QE2 from August 2010 to November 2010, and QE3 in 2012. Glick and Leduc [10] investigated how Fed announcements of QE between November 2008 and November 2010 affected asset prices. They included five events from QE1 and five from QE2. They reported that news of looser monetary policy caused the 10-year Treasury rate, the value of the dollar against several currencies, and the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index to fall. Gagnon et al. [9] noted that Fed asset purchases reduce the available supply of long-duration assets and increase the supply of bank reserves with zero duration. Assuming that longer-term assets and bank reserves are not perfect substitutes, these purchases should reduce the risk premiums on longer-term assets and thus reduce longer-term yields. They examined the response of interest rates using one-day windows around eight important announcements during QE1. They found cumulated interest rate drops of 91 basis points for ten-year Treasury yields, 156 basis points for ten-year agency debt yields, and 113 basis points for mortgage-backed security yields. They also reported a 57 basis point drop in the ten-year Treasury yield relative to the two-year Treasury yield. Using Kim and Wright’s [11] estimates of the term premium that investors require to hold longer-term assets, they concluded that the drops in long-term Treasury yields primarily reflected declines in the term premium rather than declines in expected future short-term interest rates. Roache and Rousset [14] employed the events for QE1, QE2, and QE3 that are included in Table 1. They examined how these events affected asset price risk by employing risk-neutral density functions estimated from options prices. They reported that “tail risk” fell after announcements of unconventional monetary easing by the Fed and concluded that large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) increased market confidence during times of uncertainty. When Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced on 22 May 2013 that the Fed may taper its bond purchases as a step toward normalizing monetary policy, the spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury security yields rose 9 basis points. When he repeated the same message on 18 June 2013, the spread rose 13 basis points. Because of the strong market reaction, this episode was dubbed the “Taper Tantrum.” When Bernanke repeated the same message on 18 June 2013, emerging market stocks fell again. He then announced on 18 September 2013 that any tapering of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve would be delayed. The spread then fell 17 basis points. The Fed began tapering its bond purchases in December 2013 and concluded bond purchases in October 2014. Figure 1 shows that, apart from increases during the temper tantrum period and a few other periods, the spread has decreased steadily from 400 basis points at the beginning of 2010 to − 20 basis points at the end of September 2019. Figure 2 shows the three-month Treasury bill rate and the federal funds rate. It shows that the 3-month Treasury rate moves closely with the federal funds rate. For instance, when the Fed raised the funds rate from close to zero in December 2015 to 2.4 percent in January 2019, the 3-month rate increased almost in lockstep. As the Fed subsequently lowered the funds rate to 1.8 percent in September 2019, the three-month rate also moved with it. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database Spread between 10-year and 3-month treasury yields. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database 3-month treasury security rate and the federal funds rate. The spread is closely related to banks’ net interest margins. This paper investigates how changes in the spread, in Fed policy, and in other events have affected U.S. bank profitability after the GFC. To do this, it estimates a multi-factor model to explain the return on bank stocks in the U.S. Stock prices are the expected present value of future cash flows. Thus, investigating how changes in the spread and in other factors affect bank stock returns can shed light on how they influence bank profitability. The results indicate that the spread and the level of the 3-month Treasury interest rate both influence bank stock returns. The changes in the spread and the low three-month interest rates that are clear in Figs. 1 and 2 have thus harmed banks. These changes are partly due to Fed policy. Banks are also facing competitive threats from companies using digital technology and big data and from technology giants. Given the special role that banks play in the economy, the monetary authorities should keep a close eye on the health of the banking system going forward. The next section presents the data and methodology. Section “Results” presents the results. Section “Discussion” considers why interest rates are so low and how banks will weather the challenges from financial technology and Big Tech firms. Section “Conclusion” concludes.",2

Furthermore, local migration depends not only on monetary factors such as income and moving expenses, but also on psychological factors such as comfort and anxiety. People want to be relieved of a burdened city life characterized by overtime, long commutes, and crowded trains. They discover the value of natural environment and a comfortable living space which cannot be obtained in the city, and find jobs unique to the rural region, and somehow maintain a balance between the monetary and psychological factors associated with migration. Thus, a recent movement has emerged, witnessing migration from metropolitan to rural areas [16]. This study therefore focuses on what makes people choose local migration and aims to investigate the possibility of planning migration to rural areas to live a comfortable life. Adding to the conventional push–pull theory, this study quantitatively shows that in modern society, characterized by a matured economy and spread of the Internet, the shift from labor and consumption activities in urban areas to those in rural areas depends on people’s age, productivity, and asset status. Unlike the past, when main reasons behind migration were financial, factors such as a new way of living and working, work–life balance, living environment, relationships with local communities, and education are now affecting migration in Japan. So far, discussions have focused on local immigrants and settlers, with no attention being paid to factors such as age, income level, and diversity of values. Therefore, in this study, we identify the characteristics of the modern immigrantsFootnote 1 by analyzing these factors to elucidate the reasons behind migration plans of the younger generation and middle class. Modern Japan’s economy is believed to be mature, but its urban life is considered to be stressed because of aspects such as unaffordable housing facilities, crowded commutes, extended working hours and overtime, and less personal time. In contemporary society, the widespread use of the Internet has made it easy to shop online if there are no shopping facilities available in the vicinity. Additionally, elderly households can afford to live in modern urban areas by managing expenses and compensating for public pensions with assets built while actively employed in service. However, it is difficult for the current working generation to expect the same in their old age since public pension benefits are expected to reduce in the future, while medical and nursing care expenses are likely to increase. For households that own a high-value home in an urban area and/or rent out their home to earn additional income, relocating to an area with low real estate prices could be a choice to improve their living conditions. Therefore, in planning their future, which includes preparation for retirement and asset formation, the current working generation might consider migration as an attractive option in terms of pursuing a richer, more satisfying life experience. Earlier, a push–pullFootnote 2 phenomenon between work opportunities and income was at play in metropolitan areas, wherein there existed movement from regions with few income opportunities to regions with better economic opportunities. As the economic gap between urban and rural areas reduced, migration from rural to urban areas decreased in the 1970s (Kawakami et al. [11]; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism [15]). Conversely, migration from urban to rural areas is increasing in recent years. Therefore, the push and pull elements of the push–pull phenomenon can be diversified. However, in modern Japanese society, income disparities are bound to exist in both rural and urban areas. For example, rural areas do not merely serve as receivers of the unemployed, but the middle class and wealthy people, living in modern urban areas, are also attracted to them. Rural life is seen as a rather attractive living environment for the above-mentioned reasons. In life economics [8], people are regarded as living persons. They are not only economic entities counted by material gains or losses, but are also leading timely, spatial, and mentally rich lives. According to Baba et al. [1], people would be willing to change their living environment from the external uneconomical working environment in a large metropolitan area with long commutes and regular overtime without pay to a rural area blessed with external economic functions of the forest such as living space conservation and health recreation functions. For young people who are physically able and can drive a car, which is indispensable in rural areas, and possess certain assets, migration is a reasonable choice to maximize one’s economic benefits. Even if there is a slight decrease in income, one could still have some control over one’s working hours, live in a large house close to natural environment, and enjoy leisure time in a comfortable living space. Considering the maturing Japanese economy and the aspects of modern society, such as urban working environment and life potential of people living in three major metropolitan cities of Japan: Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, people seem to be seeking an environment that can relieve stress and improve the quality of life; that is, they choose lifestyle migrationFootnote 3 as a reasonable approach to a more successful future. In this research, encouraged by the social demands of solving the problem of population decline in rural Japan, we estimate and verify the factors determining migration to rural areas in Japan using econometric analysis. To advance our research, we made use of the results of a questionnaire survey by Mitsubishi Research Institute. The survey investigated the type of welfare policies effective for migration. The purpose of our study is to analyze what makes people who are originally interested in local migration to make specific plans for migration, including not only welfare conditions but also employment in local areas, social opportunity to contribute to the rural community, and the overall living environment. Thus, we indirectly make use of data that are considered useful for our purpose. First, a screening survey was conducted with 66,964 residents in metropolitan areas.Footnote 4 Subsequently, the main survey was conducted with 3,567 residents who were either interested in migration or not only interested in but also planning migration. Those who answered that they plan to migrate comprised 5.32% of the population who either answered “I am interested in migrating within 5 years” or “I have a more concrete plan for migration”. Since people who are planning migration are likely to go ahead with it than those who are simply interested in migration, we chose the former group as the subject of our research and excluded all other people from this study sample. Based on the results, we hypothesize the following as important reasons for making a specific plan to migrate: to make a living from a regional industry, such as agriculture, fishery, or forestry; to return to an area where one (or one’s spouse) was born to secure a larger living space; to have closer contact with parents and friends; to carry on the family business; interest in real estate such as land and housing related to the destination of migration; current level of household income; and expected income level of the household after migration. It was also hypothesized that lack of facilities and services necessary for daily life such as shopping centers and aging are important reasons hindering specific plans for migration. However, the change in income before and after migration was not considered as an important reason affecting a specific migration plan. We constructed a probit model to analyze and verify the hypotheses. Increasing local migration has significance in solving a wide range of problems, such as rural depopulation and regional economic sustainability. In Japan, the phenomenon of people migrating from rural to urban areas in search of employment and income opportunities during the high-growth period has been explained by the conventional push–pull theory. However, since there is little empirical research on lifestyle migration from urban to rural areas, the current study will prove useful in this field.",

Whether these liabilities consist of ""promises to pay"" at some future dates (such as debt securities) or irredeemable representations of value used to settle transactions (such as fiat money), they all essentially embody claims on real resources. Therefore, their value reflects the credibility of their issuers, as perceived by the markets where they are traded; that is, their issuers’ (proven or presumed) capacity to preserve their value over time. In today’s globalized economies, not even full monetary sovereignty shields governments from the constraints that the market valuation of their liabilities poses on their monetary and fiscal policies, and no sound macroeconomic theory can ignore the effects of these constraints.Footnote 1 This article is about how far modern money theory (MMT) and its policy prescriptions account for this realization and the implications of neglecting it.Footnote 2",3

The social background and impetus for the conception of this study are as follows. Recent developments in information and communication technology (ICT) have brought significant changes to both large and traditional industries. Three main issues are involved. First, what it means to dominate a market. Second, how market dominance is measured. Third, how should abuse of market dominance and avoidance of competition be dealt with. Market dominance is the ability to set prices above the competitive level. It also refers to the ability to artificially influence the terms of trade. The factors that determine market dominance in data involve the quality and quantity of information. These are the factors that enhance market control, regardless of whether the firm in question has big data [33]. How to measure market dominance, and especially how to capture the market in the context of ICT developments and new market conditions, is a challenge. It is necessary to consider anti-competitiveness separately in the following cases, taking into account the various data-enabled realities of society. First, it is a contract subject to monopoly regulation. Second, it is the issue of how to consider the existence of large firms that makes it difficult for new entrants to obtain data. Finally, there is the issue of two-sided markets. The third issue, abuse of market dominance and avoidance of competition, also poses several challenges to data privacy or infrastructure investment; however, various measures are being considered to counter them, including competition law response. There are various possible responses to these issues of market and economic activity in the context of sophistication of society and advancement of science and technology. The main approach is to analyze markets and economic structures from the demand side. For example, market dominance has been modeled and empirically analyzed based on how firms behave to maximize their profits under the demand curve. In contrast, the analysis of private sector corporate diversification strategies to date has been based on the supply side of the analysis. For example, Song [29] performs a stochastic frontier analysis using financial data to estimate the multi-product distance function and estimate the efficiency index with respect to private railroad firms' diversification strategies. (The results do not show a clear relationship between the degree of diversification and efficiency.) In addition, Song [30] estimates an inefficiency model along with technical efficiency and finds that the degree of diversification has a negative impact on efficiency, while the development of the real estate business and pure holding company system has an effect on efficiency. As a result, diversification through a systematic and manageable corporate system is suggested as a management implication. Furthermore, Song and Shoji [31] find a small but positive relationship of the diversification index (segmental Herfindahl index) with railway investment with respect to the impact of diversification strategies on investment behavior, indicating that such strategies can be linked to revenue streams. For diversification strategies in general, capital markets are also discounted in Japan, as confirmed by Hiramoto [15], Tsuchimura et al. [35], and Hanasaki and Matsushita [14]. Widening the investment opportunity gap has been pointed out to be inefficient and Tsuchimura et al. [35]. However, most of these analyses of business diversification have looked at the linkages and efficiencies between businesses on the supply side, and the implications of diversification from the demand side have not been seen. The principles of the economics of demand seem to suggest that firms achieve a combination of price and quantity in response to the elasticity of demand in each market. For example, using the Internet, “as the number of people who use such services to provide goods, etc. increases, the benefits to those who receive such goods, etc. are significantly increased, and this increases the number of recipients, which in turn significantly increases the benefits to the providers, which in turn further increases the number of providers” (from Article 2(1)(1) of the Law on Enhancing Transparency and Fairness of Certain Digital Platforms). Regulations for the relationships have been introduced May 27, 2020. It targets indirect network effects between multiple markets, which also requires theoretical and empirical analysis of diversification from the demand side. Therefore, this paper examines the effects of the multifaceted market of private railways, which is not a digital platform, but the presence or absence of indirect network effects has not been tested so far. New perspectives have been added to the efforts of these operators. For example, Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a service that improves people’s mobility and the challenges in providing it have been examined by various operators. For example, Sakai [27] describes MaaS initiatives in the EU and points out the importance of compatibility, interoperability, and continuity. In addition, under this MaaS situation, Hörcher and Graham [16] examines whether subscriptions are an efficient pricing tool and points out that differentiated pricing is effective. However, this has also not been examined in terms of demand-side conditions, e.g., what are the indirect network effects with other service offerings. This paper, therefore, attempts to analyze the demand-side conditions in this regard as well. And although the analysis of airports is where we find an analysis of the multifaceted marketability of demand in transport-related demand, although the analysis of airport-related projects can be found [5, 8], and in rail-related projects, we do not find anything other than Johansson et al. [17], who looked at the relationship with employment in general. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study analyzes indirect network effects and multifaceted marketability in demand, with a focus on railroad-related demand. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical examination. In this section, in addition to the precedent analysis from a judicial perspective, an economic theoretical analysis is also carried out. Section 3 provides an empirical analysis. It examines several aspects of the indirect network effect from the demand side using data on Japanese private railways. Section 4 is the conclusion.",1
15.0,2.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,07 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-021-00059-0,Japanese newspapers,September 2021,David Flath,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The rise of the internet is having the same dramatic impact on newspaper publishers in Japan as in the US and many other countries. In 2017, Japanese newspaper advertising revenue, adjusted for inflation, was only half as great as at its 1997 mini-peak. Japanese newspaper circulation also peaked in 1997 and has fallen by about one-fourth in the two decades since then. But Japanese newspaper subscription revenue adjusted for inflation has fallen by only about seven percent over that same interval. These much-remarked facts about the current situation of the Japanese newspaper industry do not tell the whole story. For that, we need an economic model and a little bit of econometrics, which it is the main contribution of this paper to provide. The precipitous drop in Japanese newspaper advertising revenue and circulation presents a natural test of the standard model of newspaper pricing, a model that treats each newspaper as a platform in a two-sided market. One side of the market is the sale of newspaper subscriptions, and the other side is the sale of newspaper advertising. The two are interrelated because wider circulation makes newspaper ads more valuable to advertisers by increasing the reach of each ad. In pricing subscriptions, newspaper publishers must therefore consider how circulation affects their profit from selling ads. Such thinking has been the core idea behind models of newspaper pricing and content ever since it was first articulated by Rosse [17]. The algebraic framework of this model was refined and generalized by Rochet and Tirole [16] and adapted to broadcast media by Anderson and Coate [1]. This two-sided market model has been used to analyze the pricing of individual newspaper publishers in various countries, including Italy [4], Belgium [19], and the United States [11]. The papers just mentioned are part of a broader empirical literature on newspaper economics, usefully surveyed by Chandra and Kaiser [5]. Flath [12, 13] estimates models of the pricing and content choices of individual Japanese newspaper publishers, using data from 2007. Here, I use the empirical findings from those two earlier studies to analyze the industry-wide time-series data on Japanese newspaper pricing, revenue, advertising and circulation, 1997–2017. Based on the inferences in this paper, underlying the recent changes in Japanese newspaper revenue and circulation is an 83% decrease in the demand for newspaper ads from 1997 to 2017, and a 26% decrease in demand for newspaper subscriptions, measured at the 1997 inflation-adjusted prices of ads and subscriptions. Had the newspaper circulation not fallen, and the average ‘reach’ of newspaper ads remained unchanged, the demand for newspaper ads still would have fallen by 71%. To put it another way, the fall in newspaper circulation accounts for only about 1/7th of the decrease in demand for newspaper ads. The elasticity of demand for newspaper ads increased from 1.7 in 1997 to 2.7 in 2017, prompting newspaper publishers to lower their inflation-adjusted prices of ads by 33%. The effect of this price drop on the volume of newspaper ads and on newspaper ad revenue has masked the true fall in demand for newspaper ads, which was massive. Even though the demand for newspaper ads fell by 83% from 1997 to 2017, the volume of newspaper ads fell by a mere 14%, and the revenue from newspaper ads fell by 53%. The loss in ad revenue induced newspaper publishers to raise their inflation-adjusted subscription prices by 19%, with very little effect on the number of subscriptions. The 29% drop in number of subscribers from 1997 to 2017 is about equal to the 26% decline in demand for subscriptions over the same period, measured at the 1997 inflation-adjusted price. The paltry 7% fall in subscription revenue from 1997 to 2017 masks the true decline in demand for subscriptions which was nearly four times greater. A contribution of this paper is to directly link the fall in demand for newspaper print ads in Japan to the rise of internet advertising expenditures, using an autoregressive distributed lag econometric model. This paper also contributes to the recent empirical literature that quantifies the various effects on newspaper pricing, revenue and content, that have resulted from declining demand for newspaper ads. Pattabhiramaiah et al. [14] show that one un-named US newspaper raised its subscription prices in response to an exogenous decline in its revenue from advertising. Angelucci and Cagé [2] show that newspapers in France responded to the emergence of TV advertising from 1964 by lowering their subscription prices while raising their newsstand prices. The Japanese newspapers, that are the focus in this essay, derive little revenue from newsstand sales, and seem to have raised their subscription prices as the demand for newspaper ads has shrunk, as has also occurred in the US. Angelucci et al. [3] estimate the effect of entry by TV broadcasting on local newspapers in each US city, 1944–1964. They find that entry of TV in a city mostly affected evening newspapers, decreasing both subscription price and newspaper circulation averaged across all newspapers by 2–3 percent, and decreasing newspaper advertising rates by 1.6% and national newspaper advertising quantity by 3.1% (with no effect on local advertising quantity). Angelucci and co-authors also find that entry by TV broadcasting induced a small constriction of newspaper content by various measures including number of stories, pages of content, and number of news services. Japanese newspapers in the internet age are facing a greater fall in demand for advertising than for subscriptions, and have responded by lowering their advertising prices while raising subscription prices. Furthermore, Japanese newspapers have, on average, expanded pages of content by 26.7 percent from 1997 to 2017 while maintaining approximately the same number of reporters and editors. This is suggestive of the internet having lowered the costs of producing newspaper content, unlike the advent of broadcast TV that mainly affected the demand for newspaper subscriptions and advertising, without changing the costs of producing newspapers. Inferences here will show that in Japan, average first-copy production cost of news content per page adjusted for inflation fell by 22 percent from 1997 to 2017. Seamans and Zhu [18] analyze the impact of Craigslist—an internet-based classified advertising service—on local newspaper prices and content in the US, from 2000 to 2007. They find that upon Craigslist entry, local newspapers on average raised subscription prices by 3.3 percent and experienced a 4.4 percent drop in circulation, while decreasing their display ad prices by 3.1 percent. This resembles the changes in Japanese newspaper prices over the same period found in this study. Seamans and Zhu also show that local newspapers confronted by Craigslist adopted more differentiated content than before and became less likely to offer digital editions. Most Japanese newspapers now offer digital editions but at subscription prices that are as high as for their print editions, and they have few digital subscribers. Perhaps Seamans and Zhu are correct in suggesting that greater competition from internet advertising reduces the marginal profitability of newspaper digital subscriptions. An industry facing adverse demand shocks experiences a loss in profit that causes some of its firms to shut down, often an economically efficient response. But newspapers are thought by many to have some social benefit beyond the economic profit they might generate. Concerns about the changes confronting daily newspapers in the internet age have latched onto the role they play in informing voters in countries including the US and Japan that aspire to conduct democratic elections. Is government subsidy necessary to the profitability of daily newspapers? Nearly all newspaper publishers in Japan—and most other nations—are not publicly owned with shares listed on the stock exchanges, and so their financial data is closely guarded. In this study, the economic profit accruing to newspaper publishers, 1997 to 2017, is inferred indirectly, from the constructed and imputed estimates of prices, quantities and costs of production and distribution. Japanese newspaper industry annual economic profit has fallen from 4845 100-millions of 2005 yen in 1997 to 1123 100-millions of 2005 yen in 2017. That is a 77 percent decrease but leaves profit still positive. Very few daily newspapers in Japan have shut down in the last twenty years. Japanese newspaper publishers can survive in the digital age, because the replacement of print newspapers with digital ones will significantly economize on the cost of meeting the demand for daily news. These economies on costs will offset the newspaper publishers’ loss of ability to use profit from print ads to cross-subsidize their supply of daily news. Subscribers in Japan have a revealed willingness to pay for daily news. The Japanese newspaper publishers will continue to meet that demand, digitally. In reaching this conclusion, the validity and usefulness of the standard two-sided model of newspaper pricing and content will become evident. The line of argument in this paper is complex enough that a “roadmap” paragraph—usually an unwelcome intrusion in an academic paper—may here be a help. The paper proceeds as follows. It begins with some facts about the Japanese newspaper industry “The Japanese newspaper industry” and the basic framework in which each individual newspaper publisher is presumed to choose its subscription price and advertising price “Basic framework”. This basic framework is used to model and interpret newspaper aggregates—subscription revenue and number of subscribers, and revenue from the sale of ads and average pages of advertising reaching each subscriber—using parameters of individual newspaper publisher cost and demand taken from previous estimates “Industry-level data”. The resulting four-equation structural model of newspaper publishing industry supply and demand for subscriptions and advertising (displayed in “Four equations to describe industry aggregates”) is used to infer the precise numbers of newspaper ad pages that would have been demanded in each year, 1997–2017, at the 1997 inflation-adjusted prices per subscriber of both ads and subscriptions “Separating the effects of exogenous demand shocks from the effects of price changes induced by those shocks”. The data so constructed are then used to estimate an ARDL model that shows the cointegration between demand for newspaper ads and nation-wide expenditures on internet advertising “ARDL model relating the rise of internet advertising expenditures to the decreasing demand for newspaper ads”. After some discussion of the changing content and changing cost of producing newspapers “Analyzing the changing demand for newspaper subscriptions and changing supply of newspaper content”, the empirical representations of the four-equation structural model are also used to infer the effect on newspaper publisher industry profit of falling demand for newspaper advertising, from 1997 to 2017 “The effect of demand shocks on newspaper publisher profit”. The conclusion speculates on what these many inferences imply about the future of Japanese newspapers.",
15.0,2.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,13 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-021-00060-7,"An analysis of export, import and exchange rate oscillation in Ghana",September 2021,Peter Nuhu,Dramani Bukari,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“Growth on average does benefit the poor as much as anyone else in society, and so standard growth-enhancing policy should be at the center of any effective poverty reduction strategy” [1]. With this in mind, sustaining economic growth is paramount to every policy maker. As such, economic policy in nature is designed to do this by ensuring production based primarily on comparative advantage especially in a contemporary world of greater openness, expanded movement of capital, goods and service, and increased integration of both financial and market systems. Trade policy has become an effective balancing tool for policy makers. It prioritises expansion of exports particularly of value-added products and reduction of total imports. This is done while encouraging an increase in the capital and technology component of imports as these are necessary to enhance output of existing manufacturing units, and to exploit untapped resources. Theoretically, exchange rate is an effective tool for trade policy; its ability to influence trade is well established. Conversely, exports and imports are also known to impact exchange rate. This leg of the discussion has become very important for developing economies, including Ghana. Since independence in 1957, Ghana has, in a way, maintained steady economic growth notwithstanding the many coup d’états. Growth since the Economic Recovery Program has been particularly remarkable. Annual growth from 1984–2008 averaged 5% [2]. Even more worthy of note, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth between 2008 and 2013 averaged 11.4%; with a 17.4% peak in 2011 [3]. Growth in industry (42%) in 2011 accounted for a chunk of this growth. This ballooning of industrial contribution is attributable to first-oil production from the Jubilee field and therefore marks a departure from the empirical structure of the Ghanaian economy before and after 2011. While traditional empirical evidence shows that growth in most advanced economies follow a certain trajectory i.e., moving from agriculture through industry to services driven economy [4, 5], Ghana’s growth is somewhat unique in that the fall in agricultural value added is not due to increased contribution from industry but services. Between 1965 and 2018, while agric and services contribution have average 43 and 35% respectively, industry has contributed 22%. It is revealing that agric which contributed 50% in 1965 now contributes just 20%, while services that contributed 29% now contribute 46%. Industry hasn’t deviated much from its average except in 2011 as noted earlier and in 2018 when it contributed 34%. Even more revealing is the contribution of the manufacturing subsector to industry. Starting from 1965 at 52% and growing steadily to 72% in 1978, the subsector’s contribution has been falling ever since; standing at just 41% in 2017. Predictably, net trade in goods and services has been negative since 1980 until 2018. Indeed, Ghana has not seen a trade surplus in goods since 1987 until 2018. The question is, how has this impacted the exchange rate in Ghana? Since deregulation of the currency market in 1986, the Ghanaian economy has been bedevilled with persistent depreciation of the Cedi; forcing a currency redenomination in 2007. In 2007, the Ghana Cedi (GH¢) which traded at GH¢0.94 to the dollar has since lost so much value and currently trades at close to GH¢6 to the dollar. The year-on-year exchange rate that stood at GH¢1.95/US$1 depreciated by 48, 26, 7, 11 and 5% in 2014–2018 respectively. The theoretical position on the relationship between trade and exchange rate is well established. Currency depreciation is traditionally noted to be expansionary even though contractionary effects are established by some contemporary theoretical developments [6]. Both [7] and [8] establish this point; indicating that currency depreciation could potentially decrease national income and cause aggregate demand to fall. What has remained unclear empirically, especially for Ghana, is the impact of trade on the exchange rate. Ref. [9] examined how exchange rate fluctuations impact export growth in Ghana using the ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. The paper concluded that exchange rate does not impact export growth. Similarly, [10] investigated the impact of exchange rate movements on balance of trade in Ghana using data from 1980–2016 and unlike [9] found that exchange rate negatively impacts balance of trade. Indeed, earlier literature such as [11, 12] also assessed the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the economy, trade and more narrowly on imports/exports with varied results. What these authors have not come across is the reverse case of how trade—exports and imports—has impacted exchange rates in Ghana. This is particularly important given the position of policy makers and analysts that restructuring the economy is what is required to reverse or stablise the sustained depreciation of the cedi. Specifically, the arguments have leaned towards promoting an export-led rather than import-dependent economy. Meanwhile, the anticipated effect of this proposition remain empirically untested for the Ghanaian context which creates a knowledge gap that needs to be filled. This paper will therefore contribute to the discussions by establishing the needed empirical evidence to guide future discussions. Monthly time series data spanning over a decade and a half, from 2005–2019, coupled with econometric modelling will be utilised for this purpose. The results may also be useful for other developing countries as our survey of existing literature points to a focus on the impact of exchange rate on trade as oppose to the reverse. The rest of the paper is organised as follows; Sect. ""The relationship between export, import and exchange rate"" discusses the theoretical relationship amongst the variables tested in this study. Sect. ""Methodology"" lays out the models that are adopted for the analysis, whiles Sects. ""Results"" and ""Discussion and Conclusion"" present and discusses the results of the modelling and conclusion, respectively.",2

There is no global definition for urban areas as different countries define it differently [10, 16]. Malaysia defines urbanization as an area that has a minimum ten thousand population, where at least 60% of its population (aged 10 and above) are involved in non-agriculture based activities and at least 30% of its housing units have modern sanitation facilities [12]. The more recent Sustainable Development Goal enlists ending all forms malnutrition by the year 2030. Malnutrition is a crucial health issue among children, mainly because it can impede their overall mental and physical growth and wellbeing. It is indicated by both severe underweight and obesity as classified by the World Health Organization [35] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [6]. Although the average child nutrition is better in urban areas, the intra-urban inequality is higher in terms of accessibility to good affordable food and remains a persistent problem [5, 24]. This growth-centered policy has perhaps contributed to the rising overweight and obesity prevalence in the country [7]. As Malaysia prospered and urbanized, lifestyle changes that followed became more pronounced and food consumption outside homes became increasingly prominent in households food budgets. Conversely, rising living costs caused more urban poverty and inequality. For example, the low skilled jobs and low wages, coupled with inadequate housing facilities and bigger households, have caused pockets of poverty to rise, especially among the vulnerable urban population. Often, living conditions and lifestyle among these vulnerable urban population in Malaysia is ideal for chronic health conditions to thrive, affecting even the health of children [1, 37]. Lower income households often opted for food outside home as it was either cheaper or more convenient, given the often longer commuting hours for work. Often, children from these disadvantaged households have highest prevalence of both under and over nutrition and are infamous for unhealthy eating habits. Consequently, the rapidly expanding waistline of young Malaysians became a cause for grave concern [13]. Obesity impairs health and curtails longevity, leading to severe health risks, namely non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer. If left unchecked, the resultant premature deaths, years of life lost and the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) stemming from such diseases are akin to squandering valuable human capital. Childhood obesity is currently one of the more significant health threat, especially in urban settings and in developing countries like Malaysia. Children in low- and middle-income countries have transitioned from being mostly underweight to being mostly overweight or obese due to increased consumption of calorie-dense highly processed foods which often lead to poor health outcomes [3]. According to the NCD-RisC,Footnote 1 overweight and obesity prevalence in Malaysia increased from 1.9% and 0.3% in 1975 to 27% and 12.9% in 2016. Based on 2008 WHO report (2008) Malaysians stood heaviest among South East Asian nations and the more recent [9] further affirms that overweight is a persistent malnutrition issue among Malaysian children. A 2013 advisory report from the Academy of Sciences, Malaysia stated that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among schoolchildren (aged 6–12 years) between the years 2001 and 2008 increased from 20.7% (1 in 5) to 26.1% (1 in 4). The severity of being obese and overweight among Malaysian school children, particularly, have worsened in the last decade where the prevalence of overweight and obesity surpassed certain thresholds [23]. The WHO’s data repositoryFootnote 2 also echoes the fact that obesity prevalence among Malaysian children between the ages of 5 and 19 is on the rise and is even higher than global prevalence rates. In developed countries, weight decreases with better income and education while in weaker economies, or among poor sub-populations, weight increases alongside income [15]. Past studies in developed countries suggest that an increase in energy intake, reduced physical activities and a sedentary lifestyle were factors related to the occurrence of obesity [19], and U.S. Department of Health And Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, n.d.). Overweight and obese children are likely to grow into obese adults and face a direr range of health risks [34]. These include increased risk of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which was once peculiar to the urban population but now is fast-spreading among rural folks too [14, 25]. Children who are obese, often end up with low self-esteem and low academic attainment and show social anxiety [11, 18]. Physical activity is a critical element in having a healthy childhood. Not only does it reduce the risk of obesity, but regular involvement in sports and physical activities also augurs well for the child’s academic, social and behavioral skills development [29, 31]. A survey among teenagers in Egypt revealed that more than 50% consume one or more sweet carbonated beverages daily while close to 90% did not participate in regular physical exercise [20]. Unsurprisingly, a third of these kids were overweight. Besides physical activity, the environment also has an impact on kids’ health. With rapid urbanization and affluence, the environment in which these kids live in also had changed, causing sedentary lifestyles to thrive. An apt example is the phenomenal growth of 1300% and 250% in the fast-food market and carbonated beverage sales, respectively. Various studies, be it from economics, nutrition, public health or even ecology, have shown that childhood obesity cannot be attributed to a single factor, but involves a multitude of factors. The socioeconomic background of families [26], the environment [8], and [21] and even parent–child feeding practices and parenting beliefs [36] are some examples that present evidence that various factors can contribute to childhood obesity. How parents expose and educate children on food choices, and the availability and frequent inclusion of healthy food will help develop likings towards such foods [4]. Against this backdrop of higher overweight and obesity prevalence, the objective this study to investigate whether the parental socio-demographic factors contribute to children overweight and obesity. Although there are numerous studies in Malaysia reporting increasing childhood obesity, this study attempts to establish if urbanization has exacerbated overweight and obesity prevalence, between 2006 and 2015. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next sections describe the research methodology, results, discussion and finally the conclusion.",

A critical appraisal of EU stabilisation policy,September 2021,Bernd Lucke,Bodo R. Neumann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a major recession for all European economies, often unprecedented in size in postwar or post-communist times. There is wide consensus among economists that debt-financed expansionary fiscal policy is the best policy response to the economic dimension of this crisis. But many European countries – particular countries of the Eurozone – had high levels of debt already prior to Covid-19. Despite historically low interest rates and massive purchases of government bonds through the European Central Bank’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the resurgence of the European sovereign debt crisis is clearly a concern among policy makers and economists. EU leaders have reacted to this challenge by a number of improvised measures, not envisaged prior to the outbreak of the crisis. Among these is a 100 billion € support programme to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE), a 240 billion € credit line for Member States of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), and a 750 billion € recovery instrument “Next Generation EU” intended to supply debt-financed grants and credits to EU Member States via the EU budget. These measures have in common that they make funds available without requiring Member States to increase their issuance of government bonds. Rather, the EU or the ESM will issue sovereign bonds on own account. Since this debt is backed either proportionately or mutually by all Member States, the countries hardest hit by the crisis will–so the thinking goes–have greater access to emergency funds than under a stand-alone scenario. However, the financial instruments have been slow to take effect. At the time of writing (December 2020) no ESM country had applied to use the 240 billion € credit line made available via the ESM. Rumour has it that Member States shy away from a perceived stigma of being the recipient of ESM credits, which, according to Articles 3 and 12 of the ESM Treaty, are granted under “strict conditionality” only. Moreover, while the European Council agreed in May 2020 on the design of the 750 billion € recovery instrument, it took EU leaders until December 2020 to clear political hurdles related to the “rule-of-law” mechanism and “Next Generation EU” is still waiting to see entry into force while the second wave of Covid-19 plagues the Continent. Finally, from the 100 billion € SURE programme, approved in May 2020, no disbursement took place before end-October and the actual instalments paid at the time of writing were only 17 billion €. While there is no doubt that European leaders aimed at making available large European funds almost immediately after the size of the economic crisis became known, not much speedy action in response to Covid-19 can be witnessed. This raises the question if other options to respond to a major crisis are available – and, if they are better suited to serve the Union’s overarching goals of economic growth and cohesion. One option relies on the idea that financial support for countries hit by a major shock may be “automatically set on the basis of a formula” enshrined in European legislation, cf. European Commission (2018, p. 12). This option was brought forward by the Commission as a legislative proposal for the establishment of a “European Investment Stabilisation Function” (EISF).Footnote 1 Such a proposal is – since May 2018—under consideration by the European Parliament and the Council.Footnote 2 It is supposed to ensure funds for macroeconomic stabilisation in case of asymmetric shocks in a “swift and lean decision-making procedure”, cf. European Commission (2018, p. 4), by foreseeing simple mathematical rules to determine eligibility and size of financial aid for Member states. Rules rather than discretion? This is indeed the question, but under a different angle than in Kydland and Prescott’s [13] classical paper: For in terms of crisis response, European policy makers hardly bother about time consistency. Rather, the trade-off is time delays linked to discretionary decision making versus the consistency of rules-based support measures with the general economic policy objectives of the Union. We will, in the sequel, shed some light on the rules-based approach advocated by the Commission in its EISF proposal, and argue that support measures based on pre-agreed formulae may allow at best marginally faster crisis responses, but do so only at considerable costs. We build on and extend results by Lucke and Neumann [14] by showing that the EISF rules would have led to grave misallocations of funds during Covid-19 and previous crises, suboptimal effects in terms of stabilisation policy and would have been distributionally regressive. Even worse, both discretionary support measures and rules-based allocation of emergency funds create disincentives for Member States to counter the crisis swiftly with own resources and may induce strategical delay. Given the serious weaknesses of rules-based and discretionary approaches to crises response at Union level, we argue that it remains indispensable for Member States to preserve (or create) own fiscal space in normal times. Automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimuli at national level are well-tested means of stabilisation policy. Union measures, by contrast, face design and implementation issues which make them unreliable if not undesirable. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. “Macroeconomomic Stabilisation at EU level” reviews the political development towards fiscal capacity of the Union and relates it to the literature. Section “The Legal Framework” discusses the legal constraints of EU stabilisation policy. Sections “The European Investment Stabilisation Function” and “Economic Analysis of the Commission Proposal present and analyse the Commission’s EISF proposal. Section “EISF and Covid-19” studies how the EISF would have worked out during the Covid-19 crisis. In Sect. “Historic Simulation and Disincentive Effects” we present historical simulations for previous economic crises in the EU and discuss disincentive effects. We conclude in Sect. “Conclusions”.",

To address this challenge, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) [1] of the UK government published the Housing White Paper, Fixing our broken housing market, in February of 2017. It aims to guide local planning authorities to make plans that forecast housing need and ensure sufficient housing supply. In the following September of 2017, DCLG [2] published a wide-ranging consultation entitled Planning for the right homes in the right places. As stated in this document, ‘for too long, we have not built enough homes. The damaging financial crisis ten years ago compounded this problem’ (DCLG [2], p. 4). These documents implied the serious challenges of the housing supply and the significance of housing planning in the UK. However, as suggested by ECOTEC [3], local housing planning in the UK was criticized for failing to serve this purpose for a long time. Under such background, Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) was introduced in 2004, aims at providing the main evidence for local housing planning and policy. The main contents of SHMAs are assessments of local housing need, especially affordable housing need. Affordable housing need is defined as housing that is provided to eligible households whose need are not met by the market, such as homeless and low-income households. Local planning authorities are supposed to conduct SHMAs regularly to ensure that housing policy is based on objectively assessed housing need. The first round of SHMAs was published around 2008. To date, most local planning authorities have conducted the second (or the third) round of SHMAs. Although it is widely recognized that SHMAs have enhanced the evidence base for local housing planning, previous studies have shown that key questions remain about their effectiveness. Ferrari et al. [4] reviewed 21 SHMAs comprehensively and pointed out significant weaknesses in them. On the other hand, over the last two decades, Evidence-based Policymaking (EBPM) has been gaining increasing attention. The core idea of EBPM is making policy based on scientific and objective evidence. In the UK, both the government and Knowledge broker organizationsFootnote 1 such as What Works Centers are making great efforts to practice EBPM in different policy areas. Therefore, it can be expected that plan-making nowadays is based on more robust evidence. Since SHMAs provide the main evidence for local housing policy, it is of great necessity to evaluate their qualities and the improvement compare to the previous versions. This research has two objectives. First, to evaluate the methodological robustness of SHMAs, namely the transparency and adequacy of the method and data used to assess housing need. Second, to clarify if there are notable changes regarding weaknesses and opacity surrounding, the research methods pointed out by Ferrari et al. [4]. To achieve these goals, we review the most up-to-date SHMAs and make comparisons with the previous versions. The content will be structured as follows. Section 1 is an introduction to the research background. Section 2 introduces the national housing planning policy of the UK and the role of SHMAs within it. Section 3 reviews related previous studies and Sect. 4 explains the methodology of this research. Section 5 presents transparency of the broad methodology used in current SHMAs. Section 6 explains how current SHMAs assess housing need and compare with previous SHMAs. Then, Sect. 7 discusses notable changes compared to previous SHMAs and weaknesses surrounding the method and use of data. Finally, Sect. 8 summarizes the paper and states our conclusions, then provides suggestions for future research.",
16.0,1.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,09 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-021-00067-0,Microdata analysis about the effects of health status and bequest motive on the elderly household assets in Japan,February 2022,Koji Yasuda,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Throughout the era of high economic growth in Japan from the 1960s to the 1970s, the household saving rate was between 10 and 20%, and the number of assets had been increasing. However, Japan faced a rapid decrease in saving rate since the 1990s, and the number of household assets decreased. Horioka [6] explains that population ageing led to a decline in Japan’s household saving rate. Meanwhile, the elderly household saving rate has also decreased since the 2000s in Japan. According to Horioka [7], the decrease in the elderly household saving rate is due to reduced social security benefits or the increase of consumption expenditures, including medical expenses. In ageing societies such as Japan, identifying the saving behaviour of an elderly household plays a vital role in understanding the trend in the total saving rate. The survival rate of elderly people is also important for determining saving behaviour. Yaari [16] introduces the survival rate into the life-cycle model developed by Modigliani and Brumberg [12]. Yaari theoretically shows that a higher survival rate increases asset accumulation in preparation for consumption or medical expenditure during the ageing period. As for empirical studies that include lifetime uncertainty, Bloom et al. [3] and Kageyama [8] empirically show that longevity increases asset accumulation. Furthermore, some empirical studies analyse the relationship between the aggregate saving rate and ageing population. The ageing population could have both positive and negative effects on the aggregate saving rate. Here, the positive effect indicates that young people save more money preparing for consumption expenses during retirement (behavioural effect), and the negative effect indicates that an increase in retirees in the population (compositional effect) would reduce the aggregate saving rate. That is, the change of saving rate depends on which effect is larger, and these effects are sensitive to the data or sample selection [10, 15]. The uncertainty of social welfare benefits or future income would also be important for decisions pertaining to saving behaviour. According to the life-cycle model, the increase in future pension (or income) reduces the uncertainty of the senior period; therefore, the necessity of saving money would decrease. There are some empirical studies on the relation between future income and asset accumulation [1, 13]. The results thereof show that people save more money when there is the inadequacy of pension or future income. In contrast, Horioka [7] explains that the reduction of the Japanese public pension rapidly increased the elderly dissaving rate. The bequest motive is also an important factor in the life-cycle model. Skinner [14] conducts the primary research that used the bequest motive in the life-cycle model. According to Skinner, longevity has a positive effect and a negative effect on asset accumulation under the assumption of the bequest motive. That is, the positive effect means that longevity promotes asset accumulation during youth, with preparation for consumption during old age. Meanwhile, the negative effect indicates that longevity may decrease the incentive to build up assets for leaving bequests. Skinner [14] also explains that a longer lifespan reduces the demand for a contingent bequest, and the probability of handing-over assets to the next-generation declines. Whether the negative effect is larger than the positive effect depends on the relative size of the bequest of youth and old age. Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes [5] construct a life-cycle model adding medical uncertainty into the above model. The study of Kalemli-Ozcan and Weil [9] concerns retirement and mortality risk. According to this study, the decrease in mortality risk has two effects: the “horizon effect” and “uncertainty effect.” If mortality decreases, the probability of living up to the older age and expected consumption would increase. Therefore, lower mortality risk has a positive effect on lifetime working hours. This is the horizon effect. However, higher mortality decreases the probability of living up to an older age, in which case the people who die during their youth waste savings intended for future consumption after retirement. The people who have a higher life expectancy may increase savings and choose early retirement, but higher mortality increases the risk of dying before they enjoy leisure and consumption after retirement. Therefore, under a higher mortality risk, people continue to work in their old age, and in this case, lower mortality risk reduces the planned age of retirement. This is the “uncertainty effect.” This study shows that the “uncertainty effect” can dominate the “horizontal effect” from the life table in the last century. Moreover, Liang et al. [11] study gender differences in mortality. As longevity promotes, medical expenses are also a serious problem for a stable life after retirement. Some studies show that medical expense promotes uncertainty and asset accumulation. De-Nardi et al. [4] construct a theoretical model of saving behaviour, including out-of-pocket medical expense and life expectancies, and estimates the theoretical model empirically. In the analysis, they use AHEAD data, which is provided by Michigan University. Banks et al. [2] study significant, steeper decline in nondurable expenditures at older ages in the United Kingdom compared to the United States. They show the difference in medical care and medical expenditure risk as the reason for the steeper decline in nondurable consumption in the United Kingdom. As stated above, many studies have been approaching the introduction of longevity or the bequest motive into the life-cycle model, and these factors play an important role in understanding the saving behaviour in recent ageing societies. This study identifies the effect of longevity and the bequest motive on the assets of the elderly person. As already explained, longevity could promote the behavioural effect and compositional effect on aggregate savings. This study aims to identify the saving behaviour of the elderly person; the compositional effect should, therefore, be removed. Therefore, to remove the compositional effect, this study analyses each elderly person’s health situation using microdata. In the analysis, this study uses the interaction dummy between the health status and each variable, and the effect of the health situation on assets is analysed. This study is organized as follows. In “Theoretical model”, a life-cycle model is developed that includes the survival rate and bequest motive of an elderly person based on the model of Yaari [16] and Skinner [14]. In “Empirical results”, the effect of the health situation and bequest motive on an elderly person’s assets is analysed using the interaction dummy. This study also removes the non-retired sample to control for sample selection bias between the retired and non-retired samples. Last, “Conclusion” concludes and outlines the policy implications of this study.",

At present, the continuous rise of commercial housing prices has become one of the most important social problems in China. Scholars often analyze the influencing factors of housing prices from the perspective of economics and finance, but as one of the important elements of economic growth, the population is also an indicator that cannot be ignored and is worth studying. A population is directly connected to the demand and is the most basic link in all economic production and consumption activities. The Central Economic Work Conference held in Beijing from December 10 to 12, 2019 determined that houses should be used for living, not for speculation (Purchasing a house and left it vacant, and sold it after the house price increased, which is called speculation.). This illustrates the close connection between housing and people’s livelihood, and the government is also working to restore the normal supply and demand relationship in the housing market so that the role of demographic factors in this relationship can truly be reflected. Demographic changes have affected the economy in many areas, including the real estate market. Mankiw and Weil [15] first suggested the impact of demographic factors on purchase demand. Research on demographic factors can generally be divided into perspectives that a population’s structure generally includes a natural, social, and spatial structure. The natural structure of a population mainly refers to its age and gender structures, and the social structure is influenced by factors such as society, the economy, and culture. It mainly includes the structure of the family and that of human resources, and the spatial structure refers to the distribution and population transfer between regions. The impact mechanism of demographics can be divided into direct and indirect impacts. The direct impact refers to the direct construction of a model for demographic structures (usually a population age structure denoted by the dependency ratio) and house prices. Meanwhile, the indirect impact refers to changes in demand due to demographic changes, which in turn influences the market. Most studies in this area have investigated the impact of demographic changes on housing demand and explored several intermediate variables such as saving and urbanization rates, cultural factors, etc. In this study, we focused on the direct impact, that is, the relationship between demography and housing prices. We combined the use of the age structure, spatial migration, cultural habits, the hukou system, and other variables, and conducted several fixed effects regressions based on the panel data of 31 administrative units in China covering 16 years (2002–2017); the whole interaction has been rarely mentioned in the literature, which might otherwise help supplement previously conducted studies. We found that the old-age dependency ratio coefficient was positive: an increase by 1% led to a rise in housing prices by 5.51% when other variables were controlled. Meanwhile, the child dependency ratio coefficient was negative: an increase by 1% led to a decrease in housing prices by 3% when other variables were controlled. In addition, under certain conditions, population mobility had a greater influence on housing prices. This could greatly change the supply and demand relationship between regions. Furthermore, inter-generational transfer payments were positively related to housing prices, proving altruistic motivations from the old to young generations, and this could be a reason for the positive relationship between aging and housing prices. However, this was only significant in developed areas; nevertheless, this was also within our expectations. For the government, population policies may not be the best to control housing prices in less developed areas. Regional economic development and population migration could become increasingly important in policy research. In the future, we hope to focus on the diversified developments in the different market sectors, such as the house leasing and second-hand housing markets, the impact of the development of China’s elderly care service industry on housing prices, etc. After conducting a series of studies, we hope to obtain valuable findings to identify the relationship between demographic structures and housing prices. The rest of this paper is divided into four parts. In ""Literature review"", the recent developments in the field are sorted into a literature review. In ""Theoretical framework"", we introduce our theoretical framework. In ""Data and empirical estimates"", the background of China’s housing market is introduced, and empirical study is presented.

However, it is crucial to recognize that none other than the double-edged nature of fossil fuel and money is now misdirecting those advanced nations. By double-edged nature, we mean to indicate that two related edges act in two distinct ways—one positively and one negatively. The double-edged nature of fossil fuel and money is an inseparable pair of driving wheels that have a crucial role in accelerating four formidable predicaments of aging populations [9]: (1) The demographic predicament refers to shrinking population size and inverted population pyramids, associated with a high material standard of living, sufficient medical care, and prolonged education. Promotion of higher education accelerates later marriage, resulting in decreased fertility rates. (2) The industrial structure predicament refers to a rapid industrial shift toward an increase in secondary and tertiary industries and a decrease in primary industry employment. Such shifts are usually accompanied by employee aging and the loss of long-term biophysical productivity and stability that is related to net primary production activity. (3) The budget deficit predicament refers to the extensive issuance of public bonds to cope with persistent budget deficits, combined with heavy interest payments on those bonds. (4) The social security predicament refers to the imminent collapse of social security systems due to a decreasing economically active population and sluggish GDP increase. These four predicaments are closely related. However, this study focuses on how energy consumption patterns change over time; more specifically, changes in Japanese household energy consumption patterns are assumed to reflect the shrinking population and its inverted population pyramid in the aging population. Before framing the crucial dimensions associated with changes in Japan’s household energy consumption patterns, Japan’s demographic predicament will be briefly introduced. Japan provides a striking example of the inevitable demographic predicament based on eight overarching factors: (1) a higher material standard of living; (2) reduction in labor hours; (3) promotion of higher education; (4) late marriage; (5) low fertility rate; (6) longer lifespan; (7) sufficient medical care provisions; and (8) a decent level of pension payments. In fact, between 1980 and 2010, the number of newborn babies in Japan significantly reduced, from about 1.58 million to 1.07 million (a 32% decrease in 30 years). Furthermore, since around 2010, the Japanese population has been in steady decline. For example, the population size in 2010 was about 128 million. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (NIPSSR [15]) predicts that the Japanese population will fall to 90.2 million by 2060, a 30% reduction from its 2010 level. While population size is an important driver of demographic challenges in any country, population structure is more crucial than population size in the case of Japan. The percentage of the Japanese population over 60 increased dramatically, from 12.9% in 1990 to 30.7% in 2010. The population of individuals over 75 years of age will likely increase, in relative terms, from 12.8% in 2016 to 25.7% in 2060, even though the total population size will decrease by more than 29% compared to the 2016 level. Although Japan is the example used in this study, aging and declining populations have become alarming in many developed societies. For instance, the European Union’s population could decrease from 447.7 million in 2020 to 424.3 million in 2070 [4]. The elderly population ratio (the share of those aged 65 years or above) in the EU could increase from 20.6% in 2020 to 30.3% in 2070 [4]. The aging population of Japan has caused dramatic changes in household types as well as numbers. Figure 1 illustrates the relative changes in the number of four types of households, namely, single-person households, elderly couple households (inhabitants over 65 years of age), single-elderly households (over 65 years of age), and single-elderly households (over 75 years of age). It depicts these relative changes every 5 years, assigning the year 1980 a value of 100. Relative changes are predicted up until 2030 (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications [12]). The first observation from this figure is that the relative size of single-elderly households over 75 has rapidly increased and could reach 1,731 in 2030. Increasing number of elderly single-person households. Source: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications [12] In contrast, the relative number of all single households could reach 263. Traditionally, most single-person households once consisted of young people who had moved from local areas to urban areas after either obtaining a job or having been given an independent residence from their parents following graduation from college. Nowadays, single-elderly households have become a sort of norm and represent the typical situation of the aging population in Japan. Figure 1 suggests three crucial effects that provide the theoretical and empirical framework in which demographic changes properly explain changes in the household energy consumption patterns in Japan. These dimensions are (1) the pure aging effect, (2) the family structure effect, and (3) the cohort effect. Elderly people stay home for a larger proportion of the day and usually require more heating and cooling comfort [2].Footnote 1 According to a survey by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan [10], the percentages of Japanese households reporting that “someone was at home almost every day during the daytime on weekdays” increased as household head age increased: 30% (20–29), 42% (30–39), 41% (40–49), 47% (50–59), 62% (60–64), 77% (65–74), and 87% (75 or older). Matsumoto [8] compared winter energy usage between generations, reporting that elderly households consume more energy than younger households, even after controlling the usage time of heating equipment, household income, and housing sizes. The result strongly suggests that as people get older, they seek comfort at home and consequently use more energy. The average household size in Japan could shrink in an aging population. In particular, the relative number of single-person households might rise more rapidly, as suggested in Fig. 1. Subsequently, given a certain consumption level of energy, there must be an optimal size of households, compatible with the economy of scale, which can enjoy a certain acceptable level of comfort in terms of energy consumption. Ironmongner et al. [6] examined the energy consumption of Australian households and identified significant economies of scale in household energy consumption. Based on the findings, they argue that smaller households suffer a double penalty in terms of greater per capita energy use and higher charge per unit of energy. Naturally, single-elderly households are the most penalized. Schröder et al. [17] analyzed Japanese households’ panel data. They estimated that the 5% decline in average household size between 2005 and 2010 caused an economy-wide loss in household economies of scale of nearly 4%. Wu et al. [21] analyzed the panel data of Chinese households from 2010 to 2016 and confirmed substantial household scale economies in electricity consumption. They argue that incorporating scale effect into energy demand projections and sustainability assessments is crucial. These three studies suggest that relative household energy consumption does not necessarily decrease at the speed of population decline. A part of reduced energy consumption based on population decline will be lost due to “diseconomies of scale” that accompany population aging. Thus, the family structure effect must be incorporated into this theoretical model. People establish their lifestyles at a particular life stage and try to maintain them in their remaining life. Establishing particular tendencies based on past common experience can be termed as “hysteresis” [5]. During the establishment of a lifestyle, the socioeconomic conditions influence the daily practices in remaining life and may generate differences in energy consumption patterns between cohorts. The number of traditional three-generation households with grandparents has drastically reduced with the aging population. Today, young people and married couples often live in households independently of their parents. Naturally, the number of homes increases, yet the size of new houses tends to become smaller. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport [13] survey found the average floor size of a new house decreased from 139.3 m2 in 2001 to 119.7 m2 in 2018. Smaller houses usually require less energy for space heating or lighting than larger houses; therefore, young generations living in smaller houses should consume less energy than old generations living in larger houses. The types of energy used in a home vary from generation to generation. Over the last few decades, electrification has been promoted in many countries. As a result, households have reduced the use of kerosene and gas and increased electricity use, whereas elderly households living in old homes may still use kerosene for space heating. In contrast, younger households build homes that solely use electricity. Households using kerosene or gas should be replaced with those using electricity more intensively in the process of population aging. When assessing the effect of population aging on energy consumption, the changes in energy carrier types must be considered. In sum, the demographic predicament might change energy consumption patterns in Japan due to the pure aging effect, the family structure effect, and the cohort effect. The energy expenditure data from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFE) in Japan (Statistics Bureau of Japan [18]) are presented below to investigate these three effects. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section presents a brief review of the progress of population aging and the change in energy consumption in the sampling period. We explain our empirical methodology in the third section, and the results are reported in the fourth section. According to our estimation, household energy consumption increased by about 12% from 1995 to 2015 due to the pure aging effect, while it increased by about 16.6% from 1990 to 2015 due to the family structure effect. However, there are differences in energy usage intensity across generations, and younger generations consume less energy than older generations. The conclusion and policy implications are offered in the last section.",3
16.0,1.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,20 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-021-00070-5,Estimating economic unfairness in Japan and policies toward fairness,February 2022,Sayaka Sakoda,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"As a result of growing income inequality, there has been significant interest in inequality in many countries. Traditionally, many empirical economists have been interested in actual income inequality, which is thought to represent an individual’s socioeconomic background. Classic indices, such as the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve take an equal income distribution as the reference point for measuring deviations from average income. Currently, there is debate about the relationship between responsibility and compensation in distributive justice theory. In political philosophy, this tendency originated with John Rawls [1, 2]. Generally, inequality stemming from responsibility factors within the control of individuals (for example, working hours) is fair, whereas non-responsibility factors beyond the control of individuals (for example, race or gender) are unfair. Fairness and unfairness depend on whether the current situation was caused by “luck” or was the result of “choice”. We also assume that what was caused by “(un)luck” should be socially compensated. All these and similar questions around “fair” income inequality or income distribution are derived from the political philosopher Dworkin [3]. Through a discussion of egalitarian distributional theory, Dworkin [3] critiqued the equality theory of welfare among the fairness criteria of welfare distribution. According to Dworkin’s theory, people are responsible for the consequence of their choice, however, not for the exogenous circumstance. These consequences spread to the economics field. Traditionally, in welfare economics, distributional fairness has been considered based on the subjective welfare of the individual. The same is true for those who are born with a handicap and need a variety of equipment to live their daily lives as healthy individuals, as well as for those who cannot live without consuming luxuries. This means that a welfare equality policy compensates for the individual’s utility deficit caused by their handicap or costly preferences. There is no distinction between such factors as long as social conditions, irrespective of whether it is a factor for which the individual is responsible or not, are assessed based on the “welfare equality” standard. However, the argument that fair redistribution and compensation policies should be perceptive to whether some individuals’ deficits are a responsible factor or not is due to Dworkin [3]. Dworkin believed that the equality of resources theory allows for the presentation of an egalitarian redistributive policy that adequately addresses individual responsibility factors. Welfare equality theory makes all factors affecting the consequences of inequality subject to social compensation, insofar as they lead to the consequences of inequality. Meanwhile, when inequalities between individuals exist in society, resources equality theory sorts the factors that produce them into personally responsible and environmentally non-responsible factors; only inequalities based on environmental factors are subject to correction. The term “resources” here refers not only to transferable resources, such as land, commodities, physical capital goods, etc., but also to circumstantial resources, i.e. abilities and qualities that an individual is accidentally endowed with, such as his or her labour skill level and other qualities, and his or her disability level.Footnote 1 Following Dworkin, there have been vogue studies from both political philosophers such as Arneson [4] and Cohen [5] and economists such as Roemer [6,7,8] and Fleurbaey [9]. Economists have been involved in this discussion since 1985.Footnote 2 The responsible compensation principle is discussed within a microeconomic theory framework, as exemplified by Bossert [11] and Fleurbaey [9, 12, 13]. They recognize responsibility factors within the control of individuals as “effort” and non-responsibility factors beyond individuals’ control as “circumstance”. This idea is called “responsibility-sensitive egalitarian theory” (hereafter, written as RSE). However, as noted by Dworkin himself, one of the significant problems is social stratification based on gender, race, and talent, taking the United States as an example. Dworkin [14] stated that because people’s gender, race, or particular sets of skills and handicaps are aspects of luck, the inequalities resulting from factors of gender, race, and handicaps are unjust. Therefore, he contends that resources should be distributed in a way that is insensitive to the effects of luck. The OECD [15] reported that Japan had a gender wage gap of 25.7% in 2017, which was the third-highest wage gap among OECD countries. Even if there were inequality of pre-redistribution income, it would not be a problem if economic policies were implemented and equality was reached through a redistribution of income, but it has been noted that income redistribution in Japan is limited and the poor remain poor (Moriguchi [16]). This paper aims to estimate economic unfairness in Japan by using Dworkin’s RSE to shed light on gender and age, because these factors are treated as responsible factors in the literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature survey of theoretical and empirical analysis of RSE. Section 3 shows the estimation results using Japanese panel data from 2010 to 2013. More precisely, we estimate labour income based on RSE, and calculate fair income for three models; gender, regional differences and educational achievement. We then illustrated the unfair Lorenz curve and compared it with previous studies’ results based on radical RSE. Finally, Sect. 4 presents the conclusion, policy implications, and vision for further research.",

However, the effects of health shocks on the welfare of households are likely to be greater in developing countries because insurance markets and their associated services are underdeveloped, which make most households more vulnerable and less capable of insulating themselves against health shocks [1]. An understanding of the impact of health shocks is crucial, but to ensure the appropriateness of policy interventions, that understanding must be in the context of the dire economic consequences (economic costs) that health shocks impose on households. These economic costs associated with health shocks come in two forms: (1) the increased health expenditures required to treat such illness and/or injury; and (2) a reduction in income due to lost hours of work and the subsequent decline in productivity [2]. Intuitively, it can be argued that those health shocks are as threatening economically to the wellbeing of the individual as they are to the general health (in terms of labor productivity), and to the growth and development of national economies. A number of empirical studies have examined the effects of health shocks on household outcomes—consumption, hours worked, health care utilization, and health and non-health consumption expenditures—in developing countries. In particular, those studies have focused on examination of the ability of households to protect their income (or consumption) from health shocks, mainly through a risk sharing mechanism. However, the results of most of those studies are inconclusive. For example, whereas Islam and Maitra [1], Kochar [3], and Townsend [4] found that household consumption is not responsive to health shocks in developing countries, Gertler and Gruber [2] and Wagstaff [5] found that health shocks have a decreasing and significant effect on household income and consumption. Regarding labor supply response to health shocks, Zucchelli et al. [6] found that while health shocks increase the risk of men becoming unemployed, they also increase the risk of an early exit for women in the labor market. Pohl et al. [7], and García-Gómez et al. [8] report a similar finding, from which they conclude that health shocks reduce employment. In the absence or limited presence of formal and/or informal insurance mechanisms and schemes, the severity of the impacts of health shocks is even more profound [1]. One way to mitigate those impacts is to make different insurance instruments readily available so as to improve households’ ability to respond to insure themselves against health shocks. Given the structural weaknesses in the financial systems of developing countries, however, financial inclusion (as prescribed by many mainstream economists including those working for the World Bank) emerges an alternative means by which households could protect themselves against health shocks. One way that households could use the financial sector as an instrument for self-insurance against health shocks is through borrowing (e.g., loan acquisition or overdraft) and/or reliance on savings. These loans or savings could increase household access to credit and funds, which would enable access to timely diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases, which in urns could be beneficial to their employment decisions [9]. Since financial inclusion has recently gained currency in development discourse, a number of recent studies have explored the role that financial inclusion plays in assisting households to insure themselves against health shocks. Surprisingly, many of those studies focused on food and non-health consumption smoothing by households (e.g., Annim, et al., [10]; Jack and Suri [11]; Carlson et al. [12]; Mitra, et al. [13], Riley [14], and have paid little attention to the relevance of labor supply, which is a critical factor underlying income and asset accumulation, and leading in turn to consumption smoothing. A literature search found almost no studies analyzing the potential effects of financial inclusion on household working hours and health care utilization during health shocks in Ghana. This limited attention to this important phenomenon motivates the study. Given that many developing countries are working to achieve full financial inclusion and universal health coverage (Giedion et al. [15]), and to increase productivity (high economic growth), a full understanding of health care utilization and labor supply responses to health shocks, and the role of financial inclusion during health shock periods is essential. A number of empirical studies have found health shocks to be one of most common income shocks and a cause of poverty in many households in developing countries [16]. In Ghana for instance, poor health has been shown to have rendered many households vulnerable to poverty and to have distressing effects on individual and household productivity, and on economic growth [17]. In recognition of the above considerations, this study examines the potential effects of financial inclusion on household working hours and health care utilization during health shocks in Ghana. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the potential role of financial inclusion in enabling households to insulate themselves against health shocks in Ghana, using round six of the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS 6) data. We conduct our analysis at the household level rather than the individual level. We argue that when a household member suffers illness and/or injury (health shock periods), it is possible that other members of the household will assume ‘care-taking’, which requires adjustment of their working hours during such periods. Consequently, not only would the working hours of the victim be affected, but also those of other members of the household, which could have a ripple effect on the working hours of the entire household. In the first section of our analysis, we examine the effects health shocks on two outcome variables: working hours and health care usage. We further identify the role played by financial inclusion during health shocks, if any. Finally, we explore the mechanism by which financial inclusion plays such a role. Recognizing that financial inclusion could be potentially endogenous, we use three estimation techniques here with one of them addressing such endogeneity concern: ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variable with (IV). Interestingly, the estimation results from all these three techniques are consistent and lead to the same conclusion, suggesting robustness of our results. Generally, the results from our analysis suggest that households in Ghana are not able to fully insure themselves against health shocks, and thus significantly reduce their working hours by an average of 2.95 h per week during a health shock. At the same time, the probability of households visiting a health facility, or consulting a health practitioner or a traditional healer during a health shock, increases by 56 percentage points. However, with financial inclusion, our empirical findings indicate that financially included households who experience a health shock see their working hours reduced by an average of 8.3 h per week less than financially excluded households. The role of financial inclusion in mitigating the negative effects of health shocks on household working hours is more pronounced when adults in the household experience health shocks than when children experience such shocks. In addition, we find that financially included households are more likely to utilize health care than excluded ones when they experience a health shock. Specifically, the probability of health care utilization increases by 4.2 percentage points more for financially included households than for their excluded counterparts during a health shock. Regarding self-insurance mechanism, our results indicate that financially included households are more likely to acquire a loan (borrow) than excluded ones. The above findings suggest that financial inclusion can be an effective policy instrument by which households in Ghana and other developing countries can insulate themselves against health shocks. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the next section describes the data used with its summary statistics. The third section presents in detail the empirical framework, including empirical model specifications and identification strategy. The fourth section discusses the results, and the fifth section presents conclusions and implications for policy makers.",

Hakan Berument,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Oil is one of the most important commodities to be traded, and its prices affect the external balances of almost all countries as well as their domestic economic performances. The purpose of this study is to assess how the exchange rate regime can be used to control the effect of oil price shock on a domestic economy for an important oil-exporting country: Mexico. The empirical evidence reported here suggests that the exchange rate mechanism might be used to decrease the effects of oil price shocks to a domestic economy. The effects of the oil prices are crucial for all the countries both oil-importing and oil-exporting ones. The Mexican economy is one of the oil-exporting countries that is affected by oil prices [10]. In this paper, the Mexican economy is analyzed, since it is one of the prominent countries that is noted as an oil-exporting country and has maintained a floating exchange rate regime successfully for a relatively long period of time. Besides exporting oil, refined products are one of the most important goods it imports. To illustrate, in 2017, Mexico exported $418 billion, $19.5 billion of which was crude petroleum, whereas it imported $356 billion, $23.4 billion of which was refined products [26]. One of the first variables affected by the oil prices through the current account balance is the exchange rate due to terms of trade. Garcia et al. [10] find that an increase/decrease in the oil spot price appreciates/depreciates the domestic currency against the U.S dollar. Lizardo and Mollick [19], using a vector autoregressive (VAR) model for major oil-exporting and oil-importing countries with two variables (oil prices and the exchange rate) show that an increase in real oil prices leads to a significant appreciation of net oil exporters’ currencies, such as the Mexican peso. Using a GARCH-M framework for five major oil-exporting countries with two variables (oil prices and the exchange rate), Volkov and Yuhn [29] find that the volatility of exchange rates associated with oil price shocks is significant in Mexico and an increase in oil prices leads to a significant appreciation of the domestic currency of Mexico. Mohommadi and Jahan-Parvar [21], using TAR and M-TAR models for thirteen oil-exporting countries with two variables (oil prices and the real exchange rate), find that high oil prices contribute to the real exchange rate appreciation in the long run. Another related study conducted by Jahan-Parvar and Mohommadi [15] exhibits the existence of a stable long-run relationship between real oil prices and real exchange rates, implying that an increase in oil prices leads to real exchange rate appreciation. As a result of these studies, it is worth noting the exchange rate channel in the transmission mechanism. Oil price shocks have a stimulating effect on the Mexican economy. The Mexican peso appreciates, which makes domestic goods relatively more expensive than foreign goods; hence, it can improve the terms of trade and bring down inflation, either through lower import prices or a wage index mechanism. Regarding the effects of oil prices on the Mexican consumer price index (CPI), Delgado et al. [8] cannot find any statistically significant effect created by an increase in the oil prices on the consumer price index. They explain the effects of the consumer price index in terms of the exchange rate channel. According to their studies, the appreciation of the Mexican peso leads to a decrease in the Mexican consumer price index. Others [14, 18, 24] observe that the positive oil price shocks have a positive effect on both CPI and industrial production. They argue that higher oil prices can transmit into inflation through supply channels. Higher oil prices lead to inflationary pressure and create a higher price for final goods. Higher oil prices also transmit using the cost channel, where higher oil prices prompt a higher cost of production. Choi et al. [6] find that a 10% rise in global oil prices increases domestic inflation by about 0.4 percentage points on impact. Various studies have observed the effects of oil prices on output as well. The effects of oil prices on economic performance for oil-exporting countries have been studied. Berument et al. [3] study the effects of oil price shocks on the output growth of selected Middle East and North African (MENA) countries, which are either oil-exporters or oil-importers. Their studies suggest that the effects of world oil prices on GDP in most of the oil exporters and oil importers are positive and statistically significant. Jimenez-Rodrgíuez and Sánchez [16] analyze the effects of oil prices on real economic performance for Norway and the UK and find that oil price shocks negatively affect UK output but positively affect the Norwegian output. Aleisa and Dibooglu [1] state that oil production shocks in Saudi Arabia have a major effect on output through the real exchange rate movement. For instance, Mehrara and Mohaghegh [20] as well as Guerrero et al. [12] find that the effect of world oil prices on the GDP of oil-exporting countries is positive and statistically significant, implying that the source of oil shock is a rise in global demand. Thus, the GDP increases for most of the countries in their sample. For oil-exporting countries, oil price shocks affect GDP growth through direct output and inflationary channels. The direct output channel is where the GDP increases because of higher oil income, the inflationary channel affects the GDP through consumer price index, inflation, investment and foreign indirect investment [27], p. 167). According to Grigoli et al. [11], a decline in oil prices between 2014 and 2016 caused a large deviation in the real GDP growth of Mexico as an oil-exporting country. The efficient use of revenue from energy resources can be a motive for economic growth, wealth and stability in a country. However, the volatility and uncertainty of this income can be a challenge for the economic development of a country. For oil-exporting countries, such as Mexico, where oil revenues represent a significant portion of total government revenue, a sudden change in oil prices can jeopardize the government's fiscal balances and destabilize the economy. OECD Economics Surveys [22] indicate that such oil-producing countries as Mexico have found it difficult to facilitate government expenditure over time and decouple it from the volatility of oil prices, leading to boom–bust cycles. In 2008, when the worst financial crisis in decades occurred, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices plunged down from peak levels above $140 per barrel to about $40 in less than 6 months [9], p. 297). In addition, IMF Article IV Consultation [13] points out that the pace of the Central Bank of Mexico’s passive reserve accumulation can be affected by fluctuations in oil prices, which may dampen the sensitivity of the Mexican peso to such price volatility. Fluctuation in oil prices results in output volatility that weakens the Mexican economy as with other oil-exporting economies. To reduce the vulnerability caused by oil dependence, the Mexican government carried out various oil-hedging programs and established an Oil Income Stabilization Fund (FEIP) in 2000. This paper studies controlling the exchange rate as a policy tool to eliminate the adverse effects of oil price shocks on output. The exchange rate is an essential policy variable and has implications for the economic performance of an oil-exporting economy, such as Mexico. The interaction of exchange rates with oil prices helps the central bank manage currency rates to maximize economic growth and keep inflation under the desired level. Several studies analyze the effects of the exchange rate on output and prices. Using a VAR model for Mexico with four variables (money growth, output, government expenditures and inflation), Rogers and Wang [23] conclude that the effect of devaluation on output is negative and monetary shocks are allowed to affect output with a lag, as is consistent with the conventional point of the monetary transmission mechanism. Copelman and Werner [7], using a VAR model with five variables (the real exchange rate, rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, output, the real interest rate and a measure for real money balance), try to address how the transmission mechanism of monetary policy works. They demonstrate that a decrease in output is observed after a devaluation. They find that the credit view of the monetary transmission mechanism is relevant for the case of Mexico. The credit shocks are mostly due to changes in the nominal depreciation rate, and these shocks to the depreciation rate have a negative effect on output through the credit channel. Furthermore, a shock to the volume of credits causes a real exchange rate appreciation as aggregate demand increases prices. Kamin and Rogers [17] find empirical evidence that the effect of real devaluation has led to high inflation and low output in the Mexican economy, while it leads to a sustained reduction in the real GDP. Their impulse response functions indicate that an increase in the interest rate generally decreases output, while increases in oil prices, the capital account, government spending and real M2 tend to increase the real GDP. To assess the effects of oil price shocks, we employ a VAR model as modified by Bernanke et al. [2] with the monthly data for the period of January 1992 to December 2019. This model enables us to assess the direct and indirect effects of oil price shocks on the Mexican economy by modifying the policy-driven exchange rate under three different specifications. The first one (the base scenario) is the standard VAR model, which allows oil prices to freely affect the exchange rate without any restriction. Alternative Scenario I is where the exchange rate channel is closed, and it does not respond to any macroeconomic variables. Alternative Scenario II is the scenario, where the direct effect of the oil price shock is restricted on the exchange rate, even though indirect effects via other variables are allowed. In the next part of the study, the Mexican exchange rate system is summarized by highlighting the historical turning point of the system. In the third section, the methodology and data used in the study are introduced. In the fourth section, the effects of oil price shocks on the macroeconomic variables are examined in detail. The conclusion part of the paper involves a general evaluation of the study.",

First, the unemployment rate in Kazakhstan is relatively low. The average rate for the last 20 years has been around 6% with an almost steady rate of around 5% for the last 8 years. Second, it appears that the unemployment rate in Kazakhstan is less volatile. Third, uncertainties around income earnings are high (see \(\hat{w}_t+\hat{h}_t\) in the Table 1). In the context of a developing country, it is of great importance for policymakers to fully understand the effects of labor market characteristics on business cycle developments. This paper examines the relevance of labor market structure and shocks for monetary policy in Kazakhstan. In August 2015, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced a switch towards inflation targeting regime.Footnote 1 We assume that the central bank follows a standard Taylor-type rule that reacts to annual inflation, output growth, and the output gap. In the analysis of the role of the labor market, we follow [7] and consider two dimensions along which this role is examined. First, we examine the importance of the shocks generated in the labor market for monetary policymakers, given the existing structure of the labor market in Kazakhstan. We employ the estimated baseline DSGE model to identify the effect of three labor market shocks (shocks to vacancy posting, shocks to the bargaining power of workers, shocks to separation rate) on output and inflation fluctuations. Second, we study how changes in the underlying structure of the labor market in Kazakhstan affect the monetary policy transmission. Towards this end, we alter specific labor market features in the estimated baseline model. These features include the degree of wage rigidity, the bargaining power of workers, the rate of separation, and the vacancy posting costs. The role of the labor market has been studied intensively in DSGE literature. Walsh [17] finds that labor market frictions result in an increased output response and decreased inflation response to a monetary policy shock with respect to the baseline model without such frictions. Krause and Lubik [12] developed a New Keynesian model with sticky prices, labor market frictions, and endogenous job destruction. They find that introduction of labor market frictions fails to explain labor market dynamics. The model does not generate enough volatility of vacancies and the negative correlation between unemployment and vacancies found in data. Furthermore, [12] argue that introducing real wage rigidity to the model helps to improve its fit. Nevertheless, real wage rigidity fails to explain the persistent effects of monetary shocks. Gertler et al. [10] estimate a monetary DSGE model with unemployment and staggered nominal wage bargaining. Authors find that the model with rigid wages fits the data better than a version with flexible wages. The literature on the study of the dynamics of the Kazakhstani economy employing DSGE modeling has been growing in recent years. Abilov [3] examines the role of the banking sector and financial constraints on business cycle fluctuations in an estimated closed-economy DSGE model. Furthermore, Abilov [2] studies the extent of exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices in Kazakhstan via estimating a medium-scale open economy DSGE model. Konebayev [11] estimates a small open economy DSGE model for Kazakhstan with a commodity-exporting sector. Our study contributes to the existing literature on DSGE modeling for the Kazakhstani economy. The main contribution of this paper is the explicit modeling of unemployment and the introduction of a wage-bargaining scheme. We employ a New Keynesian DSGE model with labor market rigidities of [7]. This model incorporates search and matching frictions of [13] and right-to-manage (RTM) bargaining framework of [16]. The RTM framework rests on the idea that workers and firms bargain only about the nominal wage rate. Then, given these wage rates, firms decide on labor input along the intensive margin. The intensive margin dimension deals with hours worked, while the extensive margin is about a firm’s hiring activity. Trigari [16] and Christoffel and Linzert [8] show that the RTM framework provides a direct channel from wages to inflation. The model also includes nominal rigidities in wage and price-setting processes to account for the degree of inflation persistence. Furthermore, following [6], we take into account job-related fixed costs. These costs ensure the endogenous developments affecting the size of unemployment disturbances. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First section presents a New Keynesian DSGE model with labor market frictions. In second section, we discuss the data employed and briefly outline the empirical regularities. Third section employs Bayesian methods to estimate the model to identify shocks generated in the labor market. Afterward, we examine the contribution of these shocks for output and inflation fluctuations. Thereby, we analyze the relevance of the shocks for monetary policymakers in Kazakhstan. Furthermore, in fourth section, we show how different features of the labor market impact monetary policy transmission. Fifth section concludes by summarizing the main findings. The Appendix provides the calibrated values, estimation of a proxy for quarterly vacancy series, and background information on the estimated model results.",1

The enrolment in India has increased notably during the last two decades but it is still very low. The latest National Education Policy, 2020 targeted doubling enrolment rate in higher education by 2035. However, expansion of higher education does not necessarily mean equal opportunities for every group. As higher education expands, it should also be increasingly diversified and differentiated. This can be achieved only when the factors determining enrolment in higher education is taken into the consideration in the policies towards expansion of higher education. The increase in enrolment is determined by the increase in demand for higher education which is an economic decision. The classical economists identified the economic value of education in the sense that higher level of education leads to higher earnings. The human capital theory, based on the contributions of Schultz [24], Mincer [19, 20] and Becker [7], states that education is an investment. It leads to the accumulation of human capital and thus improves productivity and income. Another viewpoint is that education does not increase productivity intrinsically rather it acts as a sign of productivity in the labour market characterized by imperfect information [3, 23, 25]. However, the prevalent inequality at the wider societal and structural level may also result in inequality in higher education. The occupational background of the household plays an important role in determining the choice of higher education. The idea is that students from wealthy families have higher capacity of financing education for a longer duration. Students from low socioeconomic strata remain at a marked disadvantage in access to postsecondary education, and this disadvantage increases with college selectivity [1]. All else being equal, students from underprivileged background are more likely to apply to selective colleges than comparable whites [2]. Research based on longitudinal data shows that the stratification in higher education may continue despite gain among low income students due to even stronger gains among wealthier students [6]. There are few studies focusing on determinants of participation in higher education in India. These studies reveal that during the recent decades the gap between Higher Castes and Scheduled Castes (SC), HC and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Hindus and Muslims in terms of college graduation rates continued and sometimes expanded. Another important aspect is that controlling income and residence, SC experienced greater disadvantage in college graduation than ST [10]. The family background is an important factor in India as it decides individual’s caste, religion, economic background and location. Studies suggest that higher education in India has been exclusive on these lines and has not percolated to the weaker section of the society [11]. Empirical studies based on national sample survey data suggest that inequality in higher education has reduced [10, 15] but it is still high [13, 26]. Students’ socio-religious background, eligibility and economic status [4, 5, 14] are important factors in determining access to higher education in Indian context. The existing studies have analysed inequality at overall level but analysis across courses is limited. Two types of thesis are prominently put forward for explaining the impact of social background status on enrolment: Maximally Maintained Inequality (MMI) and Effectively Maintained Inequality [17]. Another line of enquiry is the role of social origin on higher education enrolment. The MMI thesis contends that if educational expansion makes a transition nearly universal for upper classes, educational inequality will decline at that transition. This implies expanding schools is a route to reducing educational inequality. EMI observes that all outcomes, including educational attainment, have two dimensions: (1) a quantitative dimension (e.g., the number of years of education obtained) and (2) a qualitative dimension (e.g., the program of study pursued). The EMI contends that equalizing quantity is insufficient to undermine inequality, because inequality in the types of education obtained can effectively reproduce patterns of advantage and disadvantage. The MMI theory may hold in general, but differences in the family background mean considerable variations across groups in the relationship between increased participation and reduced inequality of higher education participation. The increasing diversification of higher education has also affected choices in the fields of study of different social groups. This paper, based on the framework of EMI, analyses how individual factors such as social and religious background, income and occupational status of family affect the choice of higher education. The analysis in a comparative perspective analyses the choice of higher education and across courses. The analysis is based on the hypothesis that sharper inequality by courses than the aggregate level would confirm the validity of EMI.",2

The resulting effects were largely felt by emerging economies as prices of assets started to fall, currencies lost value and the growth prospects for emerging economies were in limbo due to high uncertainty regarding their future. According to Sahay et al. [21], market sentiments have shifted in the emerging economies following long periods of monetary policy easing in developed economies, which was meant to neutralize the impacts of the Global Financial crisis and during this period, emerging economies received huge volumes of capital inflows from abroad. Radulescu et al. [20] alluded that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have estimated that the growth of the global population between the period 1960 to 2015 reached 138.2% of the total population and for emerging economies, population growth amounted to 165.1%. On the other hand, population growth with respect to the BRICS peaked to 132.7% of total global population, while comparing with 192% with respect to Latin America and the Middle East and Africa with a population increase of almost 295%. According to the trio, BRICS economies are noteworthy due to their high gross domestic product (GDP) which averaged 7.9% for the period 2000 to 2010 and was being projected to hit 8.1% for the period 2011 up to 2015. It was also believed that strong economic growth prospects in the BRICS economies have made them the global apparatus of economic growth. Furthermore, emerging economies have witnessed massive economic growth prospects as compared to advanced economies around the world and this trajectory has been witnessed ever since 1995. BRICS economies stood at the global levels with interest rates ranging from 7% for the period 2004 until 2008. The economic prospects for the BRICS economies were believed to have been levered by more trade openness, hence prompting massive capital flows in these economies. Radulescu et al. [20] noted that BRICS economies are highly integrated in their financial systems, chief among them being foreign direct investments which increased by 14.8% between 2000 and 2009. According to Ivan and Muresan [15], the BRICS economies accounted for about half of the foreign direct investments influxes in emerging countries. Subic et al. [24], noted that the BRICS economies are more being involved in economic and financial developments at universal levels, although the levels of institutional development and legal security is not in the same direction and level.",
16.0,1.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,24 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-021-00078-x,"Conditional cash transfers to mothers, intrahousehold allocations: the role of unobservability",February 2022,Debosree Banerjee,Stephan Klasen,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes are now among the most popular welfare interventions in developing countries. These programmes transfer resources to poor households with conditions of adoption of socially desirable behaviours such as sending children to school, visiting preventive health services, and increasing human capital outcomes. Non-compliance, on the other hand, would imply stopping payments to the households and sometimes even the return of the fund received previously. The assumption underlying the conditionalities is that without conditions, households might not use transfers pro-socially, and welfare categories, such as health and education, would remain underprovided. CCT programmes vary in design, scope, and outcomes and are used by policymakers for several social-economic issues such as social inclusion [24], development of small businesses [13], smallholders’ welfare [25] and poverty [15]. However, the majority of these CCTs have tended to focus on human capital accumulation, such as mother–child health and schooling for girls [1]. Following the immense success of Mexico’s national CCT programme (“PROGRESA”) in education and health [39, 45], CCTs have diffused widely across many parts of the world. Consequently, there has been an increase in the use of relevant public services such as increased school enrollment and use of health care services [1, 3, 4, 8, 26], and positive human capital outcomes in terms of a higher wage, better child health and educational outcomes and so on [2, 9]. For example, evaluations of CCTs in Latin America show that CCTs have enabled households to invest more in children, improving their health outcomes in Colombia [7], Ecuador [40] and Nicaragua [34, 35]. Also, some studies show that not all CCTs generate positive programme effects. For example, some have argued that the increased use of public services might not always generate higher human capital outcomes [16, 24, 28, 29]. These differences in results in terms of positive or no effects are caused by factors such as the evaluation method, demographic characteristics of the sample and period of the evaluation, i.e., for short-term or medium-term impacts. Though there has been ample literature analysing the impact of CCTs on child health and education, very few of these studies have investigated the mechanisms leading to better human capital outcomes. While previous studies have added important direction to the understanding of probable impacts of CCTs, the association between CCTs and increased human capital accumulation by children needs further scrutiny to investigate whether household members are utilising the fund to facilitate the achievement of the conditions and not differently. Interestingly, CCTs for children have preferred mothers as the primary recipient of the cash. For example, since the early 1990s, several states in India have introduced conditional cash transfers for child development and in a number of these schemes the cash is transferred to the mothers. For example, Balika Samridhi Yojana (Girls Enrichment Programme) is one such scheme, introduced in 1997 by the central government that provided financial incentives of Rs. 500 to the mother if a girl child is born. Under the Apna Beti Apna Dhan programme (Our Daughter, Our Wealth), since 1994, mothers with newborn daughters could apply for financial grants in the state of Haryana, with savings bonds redeemable by the unmarried daughters at the age of eighteen. The rationale behind these policies is that mothers are the primary caregivers to children, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that empowering women with a CCT would generate better welfare outcomes for children in terms of better human capital accumulation and reductions in female feticide, child marriage and child labour. Consequently, mothers have received more attention as the recipient of cash transfers. Under any CCT programme, once the money is received by the mother, how the money will be spent depends to a great extent on intrahousehold decision-making processes. Without a proper monitoring or enforcement mechanism,Footnote 1 if cash received does not facilitate the achievements of the conditions of a cash transfer, objectives of the CCTs might fail. This calls for a better understanding of the various mechanisms of intrahousehold decision-making. Theories of intrahousehold decision-making have discussed extensively how economic studies on household decision-making have increasingly moved from the unitary model [11] to collective models of decision-making with individuals having different demand functions. There are two major variants of the collective models. First, the cooperative models, in which all preferences are observed, and individuals reach a consensus on household resource allocation through a process of intrahousehold bargaining. Household demand with cooperation, then can be seen as a weighted average of individual demand functions, weights capturing the relative bargaining strengths of the individuals in the household. The earliest examples of cooperative models are Chiappori [22]; Manser and Brown, [36]; McElroy and Horney [37]. Second, in noncooperative models, individuals do not enter binding contracts and not all preferences are necessarily observed. Instead, they handle their resources separately and given the behaviour of their spouse, decide about the share of income contributions independently to maximize individual welfare. Therefore, in noncooperative models, an individual's actions are conditional on the actions of others indicating that not all equilibriums are Pareto optimal [12, 32, 33, 48]. By the predictions of noncooperative models, if actions of a spouse are consequential to the actions taken by the other spouse; investment choices of the spouses depend considerably on the observability or prior knowledge of each other’s actions. If decisions are made and implemented separately, and individual preferences remain unobserved, asymmetry in information sharing would cause unobservability of preferences. Unobservability, on the other hand, would cause uncertainties about who would invest how much. As a result, with noncooperation, limited or no observability, and without a contractual agreement, there could be strategic motives among spouses to behave opportunistically and spouses may choose to reduce individual investments in household public goods such as children [7, 14, 31]. Empirical studies on household bargaining, for example, Udry [47], have found evidence in support of the argument that noncooperation causes inefficiencies in resource allocation. Chen [19] finds that noncooperation occurs due to asymmetric information in households with migrant husbands. Ashraf [6] finds that in the Philippines, in the absence of detection, husbands increase their private consumption and decreases monetary transfers to their wives. Castilla and Walker [18], in a Ghanaian context, showed that if spouses choose to exploit their information advantages by concealing resources from each other, resource allocation could be Pareto suboptimal. However, evidence on the role of unobservability among couples in household resource allocations is rare. A benefit of the intrahousehold bargaining models is that they provide a framework to analyse the impact of public policies such as CCTs on household-level outcomes [41, 44]. Many empirical studies have provided evidence of opportunistic behaviour by spouses and resulting inefficiencies, and it has become an increasingly relevant concern in development policy [6, 17, 20, 30, 31]. For this research, the specific question related to the above literature is under what conditions might mothers choose to behave opportunistically and invest less in children, failing the spirit of CCTs? Empirically, women investing more for their selfish motives are not uncommon. Chen [19] showed that irrespective of women’s intrahousehold bargaining status if spouses do not cohabit (for example, the case of migrant husbands), women tend to allocate resources toward goods and services more valued by them. Few studies have even suggested that with asymmetric information, the use of rotating savings and credit organizations (ROSCAs) by the women in Kenya [5] is a strategy to hide their income information from others. Alternatively, it is also possible that investing less in children is not a choice of women but others in the family. For example, Yoong et al. [49] in their research discussed increasing female access to direct transfers do not always guarantee that women or their children will benefit. However, evidence on lower investment by mothers in the literature is still scarce. While, in cooperative setup, lower bargaining power of women could be a potential cause of insufficient investment in children [41], especially when other household members want the resources to be spent differently, the specific focus of this study is not on how individuals in the household bargain over resource allocation. Instead, our study attempts to understand how does information sharing among spouses affect the willingness to invest in children by mothers when spouses decide about their spending separately and do not share their investment preferences. As discussed in the theories of intrahousehold resource allocation, this relates more to noncooperation models of resource allocation in which decisions are implemented separately and there could be asymmetric information among spouses. Assuming that a mother’s motivation to invest in children depends on (1) her affection for children and (2) her future return from the investment in children, in a cooperative setup, her willingness to invest in children remains independent of expected spousal investment. With asymmetry in information sharing, on the other hand, various uncertainties and concerns arises affecting mother’s motivation to invest in children. For example, she may fear that the future returns from the investment in children can be seized by the spouse. Also, due to noncooperation and lack of mutual support among spouses, there could be difficulties in financing her immediate private consumption as well, especially if she allocates large proportion of her income to children. To hedge against such future and present uncertainties, given a certain amount of cash, a mother may be willing to invest less in children and save more. With cooperation, family support, and information sharing among spouses, on the other hand, such uncertainties are generally much less, and given an income, mothers may be willing to invest more in children, save less for private consumption. This would be irrespective of what she expects from her spouse. It is important to note that noncooperation must not always result in unobservability. Even with noncooperation, spouses may reveal their preference through their investments and expenditure [17, 20] informally. Furthermore, at the beginning of formation, a family does not always experience non-cooperation. Initially, there might be cooperation; noncooperation emerges only eventually. Thus, it is not unlikely that even with noncooperation; spouses may possess limited information about each other preferences even with noncooperation. However, these pieces of information are ambiguous, indirect, less accurate or historical in nature and involves higher uncertainties for the mothers to form any definite expectations about spousal investment. With cooperation among spouses, information sharing is rather precise and less ambiguous; and spouses are more likely to have definite information about each other’s preferences. Also, if mother’s motivation to invest in children depends on her affection for children and future return from child investment, her willingness to invest in children remains unaffected by expected spousal investment, no matter how precise her expectations are. Our study focuses on such cases and attempts to capture how uncertain expectations capturing asymmetry in information sharing affects mother’s willingness to invest in children. Understanding the role of unobservability and asymmetric information in family decision-making has relevant policy implications in developing countries in the context of CCTs. Our study attempts to replicate the framework of cash transfers to empirically investigate the possibility of success of CCTs when there exists unobservability between spouses. The hypotheses we test in our study concern how unobservability is (1) negatively associated with mothers’ willingness to invest in children and (2) positively associated with their willingness to save for private consumption. One valid concern is in CCT programmes, cash is transferred to those households that meet certain conditions such as sending children to school or health clinics for regular checkups or immunization etc. Therefore, cash transfers through CCTs are never conditioned on the cash spent on the children but the attainment of the policy-relevant objectives. The rationale of such cash transfers, however, is to compensate for the opportunity cost of child school enrolment or regular health visits [10, 38]. Such opportunity cost may include the income foregone due to the absence of a child in the income-generating activities, or time not spent by a daughter at home to help her mother in domestic activities. Furthermore, there are certain expenses, such as commute costs to the school/ health centres or the cost to buy school accessories, for which households can use the cash, received through CCTs. Such investments then become direct investments in children. In either case, cash received from CCT programmes facilitates the attainments of conditions of CCTs. The issue we address is whether such facilitating roles of cash transfers are impeded by the unobservability of spousal preference. We focus on two categories of human capital, namely food/nutrition and health/medical expenses and the investment behaviour of the mothers. The focus on mothers is because women in the household are often the preferred recipients of cash in CCTs. Our results confirm our hypotheses and show when mothers do not observe spousal investment preferences, they are significantly less willing to invest in children’s food and health compared to those who observe spousal investment preferences. We also find evidence of higher saving motivesFootnote 2 among mothers who face unobservable spousal preferences. The following sections are organized as follows.

Comanor,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The United States and Japan are the two largest markets for branded pharmaceuticals in the world. In a sample of 33 OECD developed countries, these two countries represented 45% of the total volume of prescription drugs dispensed in 2018: with the US accounting for 24% and Japan 21% of the 33-nation total [21, p 19]. Pharmaceutical markets in other OECD countries are much smaller in terms of the physical volume of pharmaceuticals consumed. Comparing dollars spent on pharmaceuticals, the comparisons are different. In that case, the US pharmaceutical market is again the largest, now by an even greater magnitude. It accounts for fully 58% of OECD sales while Japan lies in second place with just over 9% [21, p. 19]. On a per capita basis, Japan spends $580 on pharmaceuticals per person while the US spends more than double that amount at $1420 per capita [21, p 19]. Other countries spend much less, with Germany at just under $40 billion in aggregate sales and $481 per capita [21, p. 19]. What these data indicate is that US pharmaceutical expenditures are much higher than elsewhere even while the physical volume consumed per capita is not unusually high. The clear reason for these differences are higher branded drug prices. The question explored here is how to account for the substantial price differences between the two countries. In the discussion below, we first describe the unique features of both US and Japanese markets along with their different regulatory regimes. However, rather than looking at these regimes as exogenous factors resulting from political forces, the second part employs a recognized economic model to explain regulatory and legislative decisions. Indeed, the discussion there suggests that actions taken by regulatory regimes are endogenously determined and result from underlying economic conditions.",

The GCC includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain. GCC states have made significant efforts to diversify their economies away from dependence on hydrocarbon resources, but oil remains critical to their economic development. Diversification into finance, logistics, aviation, communications, healthcare, and tourism has been spurred by more liberal political and economic climates. The result is greater foreign cooperation, investment, and modernization with improved diplomatic and commercial relations. Mahmah and Kandil [20] argued that fiscal sustainability will be an issue for GCC members due to the persistence of low oil prices and reduced tax revenues. This new normal will force GCC members to adapt to the lower oil price environment with emphasis on reform of government subsidies and increased diversification toward non-oil revenues. They also see accelerating debt issuance by the GCC which raises issues about fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability. However, despite GCC diversification, the weakness of the GCC recovery in 2018 reinforced the perception that carbon-based energy remains the foundation of GCC economies. While global economic growth slowed in 2018 due to international tensions, the steady increase in oil prices in 2018 lifted GCC growth, from an average of − 0.2% in 2017 to 2.0%. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the two largest GCC economies) and Oman, emerged from the recession in 2018 due to increased oil production, the increased capital investment made possible due to the rise in oil revenues, and higher domestic demand [38]. In 2018, GCC fiscal balances improved due to the average increase in oil prices and progress with non-oil revenues mobilization in some countries. This allowed a reduction in fiscal deficits despite increased spending by some GCC countries. The fiscal deficit of Saudi Arabia was reduced in 2018 despite a 10% increase in government spending. Fiscal reforms were undertaken in 2018 by several GCC countries. Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented a 5% Value Added Tax (VAT) in 2018. Bahrain implemented a similar VAT in 2019. In mid-2018, Oman increased corporate income taxes and imposed excise taxes on tobacco, energy drinks, and soft drinks. Higher oil prices led to increased external account balances for most GCC countries. Higher commodity prices led to surpluses in current account balances in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait. Higher petroleum prices and increased sales resulted in doubling Qatar’s current account surplus. While the current account deficit for Bahrain increased due to higher remittance outflows. Most fiscal deficits in GCC countries remained unchanged from 2017 levels. The fiscal health of both Bahrain and Oman improved despite elevated debt levels. With regional exchange rates pegged to the US Dollar, inflation rates remained low for most countries. Pegging regional exchange rates to the US Dollar helped maintain monetary policy credibility and stability. A major area for economic reform is to reduce labor costs by increasing productivity and limiting wage increases to retain international competitiveness. Strategies to improve skills and learning and health outcomes, increase female labor force participation, remove labor market distortions, and increased competitiveness in the private sector. The global outlook continues to be uncertain with the potential for downward pressure on oil prices. Growth in the GCC in 2019 is projected to match that in 2018 with fiscal deficits projected to remain a problem in 2019–2021 for four of the six GCC countries. Consequently, in addition to a renewed focus on non-petroleum exports, there is a continued need to focus on prudent fiscal policies involving stimulus efforts involving taxes and spending. In recent years, several signs highlighted that the oil market has undergone deep long-term changes. Taking into account the expansion of the world economy and the volatility of the markets, the increased availability of oil and its replacement have been facilitated by both technological progress and environmental concerns [33]. This research continues the line of investigation on public finances’ sustainability of some countries or groups of countries, extending it to the GCC area [9,10,11,12, 39, 41, 42]. In addition, it uses both time-series and panel-data analyses at the same time. The originality value of the study lies, above all, in the fact that it is the first applied analysis of fiscal sustainability in the GCC area. Moreover, we investigate this topic both by looking at the government revenues–expenditures nexus and the relationship between government deficit and debt. Furthermore, a battery of recent panel-data tests and estimators is employed, to shed light on this crucial topic. In addition, it should be highlighted the importance of having public accounts in order and fiscal solvency for economies highly dependent on oil, whose price volatility can easily and quickly generate asymmetric shocks. In summary, this research highlights the need for oil-exporting countries to be prepared for a post-oil future—and, therefore, to make their economies less and less dependent on this commodity—already in the short-term. The layout of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section shows the theoretical framework together with a review of the empirical literature. The third section presents the empirical strategy and briefly describes the applied panel-data methodologies, whereas the fourth section gives empirical findings and their discussion. Finally, the last section concludes, suggesting some policy recommendations.",2

This includes developing a society wherein playing an active role is normalized regardless of the characteristics of disabilities. Historically, promoting the employment of persons with disabilities began in response to the rehabilitation of injured military personnel. Accordingly, it only provided for persons with physical disabilities ever since the “Act on Promotion of Employment of Persons with Disabilities” (hereinafter referred to as the “law”) was promulgated. However, with the normalization, the law has been expanded to include those with intellectual and mental disabilities. The law stipulates the statutory employment rateFootnote 1 as an employment obligation on business owners: 2.6% for public institutions, 2.5% for boards of education, and 2.3% for private companies. In addition, a payment system has been established to adjust the financial burden on private business owners who are employing persons with disabilities. In cases where the legal employment rate has not been achieved, business owners are obliged to make a payment, whereas adjustments and incentives are paid to business owners who achieve the desired employment rates.Footnote 2 Moreover, various subsidies are provided for facility maintenance, caregiver placement, and commuting considerations. The law aims at ensuring the right to work for persons with disabilities, pursuing a society where they can demonstrate their abilities with a sense of purpose. Considering the social solidarity perspective, all business owners cooperate with the professional independence of persons with disabilities and have a responsibility to hire them. Specifically, national and local governments are required to take the initiative to hire persons with disabilities and raise the public’s understanding of the employment of such citizens. While the Japanese national government was making consistent efforts, it was revealed in 2018 that the number of employees with disabilities had been inflated by including employees who are not covered under the law and the employment rate of persons with disabilities (hereinafter referred to as “employment rate”) had been disguised for a considerable period (until 2017) in many central ministries and local governments. These institutions should be in a model position when hiring persons with disabilities and their employment rate should not be misrepresented. However, the problem of disguising the employment rate had been neglected for many years. Every institution admitted that it had disguised the employment rate and as a result of promptly making improvements to achieve the statutory employment rate, the following improvements were made. The employment rate in 2020Footnote 3 (2 years after the discovery) was 2.83% for national institutions and 2.75% for prefectural governmental departments. Therefore, these public institutions managed to attain the statutory employment rate, while the prefectural board of education only achieved 2.06%, which was considerably lower than the statutory employment rate, clearly giving rise to a rather difficult situation. Moreover, the number of staff members that forms the basis for calculating the employment rate of prefectural boards of education) is approximately 580,000, which is about twice that of the national institutions and prefectural institutions. Hence, the impact on the employment of persons with disabilities in prefectural boards of education is more significant than the national institutions and prefectural institutions. Therefore, this study focuses on the employment rate of prefectural boards of education. Figures 1, 2 and 3 compare the employment rates of prefectural boards of education, with and without the disguised data, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the employment rate is below the statutory employment rate in several areas, and the gap from the average is extensive. In many cases, the employment rate in neighboring areas is close to one another whereas the employment rates in many regions are concentrated near the statutory employment rate in Fig. 2 with almost no deviation from the average. This study primarily aims to clarify the interpretation of close employment rates in neighboring areas in a natural state without using camouflaged data and common socio-economic factors that affect employment rates.
 Employment rate of persons with disabilities in prefectures (without disguised data) Employment rate of persons with disabilities in prefectures (with disguised data) Prefecture number and prefecture name for Figs. 1 and 2 Considering employment policies around the world,Footnote 4 the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, among others, have enacted laws against discrimination on the grounds of disability for employment conditions and job contents. Moreover, policies that are aimed at trying to realize the social participation of persons with disabilities with reasonable accommodation are implemented in these countries. Additionally, Japan, China, South Korea, and many European countries, such as Germany and France, have promulgated employment allocation laws that impose employment obligations on a certain percentage of persons with disabilities with specific policies being implemented alongside anti-discrimination laws. Many studies have evaluated the employment of persons with disabilities in corporate management. They include analyses of the impact of economic fluctuations due to the employment of persons with disabilities on corporate management. Kaneko [4] analyzed the impact of cooperation between employment measures for persons with disabilities and barrier-free measures on the national economy. Nagae [13] analyzed the impact of information disclosure on the employment situation of persons with disabilities on the stock market. Nagae [14] also analyzed the relationship between profits and a company’s ability to achieve the statutory employment rate as well as the relationship between the employment of persons with disabilities and productivity. Morozumi [11] analyzed the impact of employment policies for persons with disabilities such as the payment system on corporate management. Mori and Sakamoto [16] analyzed the impact of the employment quota system on the employment of persons with disabilities in the manufacturing industry and the relationship between the employment of persons with disabilities and the profit margin of the same industry. Mitra and Sambamoorthi [10] analyzed the determinants of employment of persons with disabilities in India based on individual characteristics and the presence or absence of public assistance. Edzes et al. [2] revealed spatial inconsistencies between the regional distribution of businesses and the residential areas of persons with disabilities in the Netherlands. Lalive et al. [5] analyzed the effect of the employment quota system on persons with disabilities in Austria. However, many Japanese public institutions that are not subject to the payment system have presumably achieved statutory employment rates for many years. To our knowledge, no research exists in this regard. In addition, most of the empirical studies on the employment of persons with disabilities in private companies target the economic effects of the payment system, and no studies concerning the employment rate itself could be identified. This study aims to answer the following three questions: (1) What is the relationship between the employment rates of the prefectural board of education, the governor’s department and private companies within the same area? (2) Which factors affect the socio-economic characteristics of the employment rate of the board of education? (3) Does the employment of persons with disabilities in a specific area affect the employment in surrounding areas? All persons with disabilities employed by the prefectural board of education have obtained a teacher’s license, which requires university graduation. Accordingly, the number of targeted people in most cases is limited, giving rise to Question (3). The answer to Question (1) can be estimated using a conventional linear regression model (LRM) to analyze events in the same area. However, for Questions (2) and (3), it is necessary to measure the influence between adjacent areas, which cannot be estimated using the conventional LRM. Therefore, the relationship between the prefectural boards of education is evaluated using the spatial econometric model. “Analytical framework” explains the analytical framework, including the analysis method and model selection. “Analysis results” discusses the analysis results, particularly the characteristic results obtained using the spatial econometric model. “Conclusion” summarizes the results, concludes the paper, and discusses matters of future concern.",1

Following the full liberalization of the retail electricity market in April 2016, the retail city gas market was also fully liberalized in April 2017. The number of new entrants into these markets is increasing, and suppliers are engaged in price competition and marketing strategies such as the bundling of electricity, gas or other services. There exists a substantial theoretical literature investigating whether bundling strategies affect market competition in a variety of contexts. Bundling strategies can cause both efficient economic effects and anticompetitive harm to the market. When a consumer who purchased bundled services previously switches a supplier of one of those services, the consumer needs to restructure the current service combination along with switching suppliers. Such inconvenience or troublesomeness can increase consumers’ switching costs, and increased switching costs may reduce consumers’ switching of suppliers. Klemperer [13] and Farrell and Klemperer [9] illustrate that switching costs make an individual firm’s demand more inelastic, thus reducing competition in the market. This paper empirically examines and qualifies the extent to which the bundling strategies of retailers affect consumers’ switching behavior in Japan’s retail energy markets. A discrete choice model approach using consumer micro-data is employed. The dataset is collected for this study; it contains detailed information on consumers’ energy subscriptions and bundling status. The results imply that consumers who subscribe for electricity and gas from the same supplier as a bundle are significantly less likely to switch their electricity supplier than those who do not bundle. It is increasingly recognized in competition policy that consumer switching behavior plays an important role in market competition. Japan’s regulatory authorities are concerned about consumers’ switching rate in determining the extent to which the deregulated markets may become competitive, and they have adopted policies to facilitate consumer switching, especially for the telecommunications market. Investigating whether bundling reduces the likelihood of consumer switching and, if so, how much is useful for policymaking in Japan’s retail energy markets. This paper contributes to the recently growing empirical literature on bundling and provides some policy implications for competition reviews of Japan’s retail energy markets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a literature review, followed by an overview of Japan’s retail energy markets. Section 4 presents an econometric model and the data. Section 5 shows the results and discussion. Section 6 provides conclusions.",

The Paris Agreement on climate change and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), unanimously adopted in 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, respectively, have promoted corporate practices relevant to ESG. Against a backdrop of these international public policies, according to Global Sustainable Investment Alliance [15], sustainable investment assets in Europe, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan stood at $30.7 trillion at the start of 2018, compared with $22.9 trillion in 2016 and $18.3 trillion in 2014. In conjunction with the developing market of sustainable investment, academic research has contributed to the discussions on relations between ESG performances and financial performances at the firm level. Previous research, for example Friede et al. [11] and Clark et al. [7], found that firms with higher ESG performances have experienced higher financial performances in many instances. However, the majority of previous studies analysed linkages between ESG performances and equity investment return, enterprise value [cost of capital, Tobin's q, Price-Book Value Ratio (PBR), etc.], and company revenue [Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Asset (ROA), etc.], so the number of research on relations between ESG performances and debt financing is limited at present. Several studies by Amiraslani et al. [1], Devalle et al. [9], and Hoepner et al. [16] revealed that higher firm-level ESG performances are positively related to variables for debt financing such as credit ratings, but there is no consensus about the relations. In addition, as previous studies have conducted analyses on U.S. and European markets, the volume of empirical analysis targeted at Asian markets including Japan is limited. Especially, in Japan, debt financing is important, since the share of borrowings from financial institutions in financial arrangement is high compared to other countries. Thus, this paper conducts an empirical analysis to examine the effect of firm-level ESG performances on creditworthiness in Japanese listed companies. First, this paper provides a literature review of previous studies on the effects of ESG performances on creditworthiness and generates the four hypotheses described later, based on our core hypothesis: firm-level ESG performance positively affects a company’s creditworthiness. Next, we present the ordered logit model and variables used in the model: the dependent variable is S&P Credit Ratings, and the independent variables are ESG evaluations by Arabesque S-Ray with six control variables. In the following results section, we report estimation results and indicate whether the results support the four hypotheses. Then, based on the estimation results, we also discuss implications on how to address ESG evaluations for business companies, financial institutions, and financial authorities. Finally, this paper concludes by summarising main findings and limitations of this research.",

Abdul,Muhammed Ashiq Villanthenkodath,S. Shibinu,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the world, India has the largest diaspora, with a diversified global presence of about 17 million [1]. It is observed that the North American region consists of nearly 3 million, while six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries contain 9 million emigration stock [1]. However, it found from the literature that the Gulf emigration of low-skilled workers from India is due to the distress factors such as relatively higher earnings quest, unemployment and poverty [2,3,4,5]. Moreover, large-scale economic activities due to the discovery of oil in the Gulf region create employment opportunity for low-skilled workers [6, 7]. Although the emigration to the Gulf region has already been well established in the literature, the emigration of relatively skilled employees from India to the United States of America (USA) is yet to explore. Thus, it is necessary to find out the determinant or motives of emigration from India to the USA. A variety of economic, social, demographic and conditions in the destination and origin countries motivate the potential migrants to leave their origin country. It is true that migration tendency takes place when the mentioned conditions deteriorate in the origin country (i.e., push factors) or these factors improve in the destination country (i.e., pull factors). After calculating the socio and economic costs and benefits, the potential migrants take the decision to migrate, provided the benefits of migration exceed the costs of migration [8]. Thus, understanding the chemistry of what motivates the migration is necessary to frame a policy for discouraging the brain drain and encouraging brain gain. In this vein, economic and non-economic factors that determine migration have explored the economic research for decades. However, not yet fetched a uniform conclusion about the determinants. Hence, understanding the determinants would help the policymakers to make domestic policies for migration to have a direct or indirect impact. Further, the implications of migration can be drawn by policymakers. Therefore, socio-economic and political factors have been explored in the literature [9,10,11]. Moreover, the present focus migration studies focus on micro-level aspects and panel-level studies [2, 12, 13]. Thus, it is unable to fetch adequate conclusions for formulating country-specific policies at the macro level. Further, the existing studies in the literature explore the determinants of low-skilled workers' emigration from India [2, 3]. However, no study has been conducted to identify determinants of high-skilled workers' emigration from India. Hence, focusing on such determinants helps us to discourage the brain drain and encourages brain gain. As a result, this study considers the USA as the destination of high-skilled workers from India due to many reasons. First, in the early nineteenth century, Indian immigrants began arriving in the United States and settling in communities along the West Coast. Despite the fact that they arrived in small numbers initially, new possibilities arose in the mid-twentieth century, and the population grew in the decades that followed. As of 2019, there were over 2.7 million Indian immigrants in the United States [14]. Second, Indian immigrants presently account for around 6% of the foreign-born population in the United States, making them the country's second-largest immigrant group, ahead of Chinese and Filipino immigrants. The Indian immigrant population in the United States surged 13-fold between 1980 and 2019. Indian immigrants are well-known for their diversity as well as their large numbers. Indian immigrants are more likely than the general U.S. and foreign-born populations to be well educated, work in management positions, and be businessmen, IT and health professionals [2]. Third, according to the World Bank report, the United States sent USD 68 billion in inward remittances to India in 2020. All of these underline the significance of high-skilled workers’ emigration to the USA from India in the recent past. Given the background of this study, attempts have been made to examine the economic, social and demographic determinants of emigration from India to the US. Understanding the factors that influence emigration is crucial for two reasons. First, it aids immigrants' social and economic assimilation into their host countries. Understanding what drives high-skilled emigrants to leave their home nations allows us to better understand their motivations for emigrating and better accommodate those motivations in host countries. Second, examining the factors that influence movement increases the effectiveness of migration policy. The rest arrangement of the study is as follows. Section 2 offers a review of related literature. Section 3 contains the model, data and econometric procedure. Section 4 contains results and discussion. The final section concludes with policy suggestions.",

Policymakers are interested in public health interventions, particularly for physical inactivity, to change people’s lifestyles in response to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Physical inactivity is more prevalent in Japan than in the rest of the world [2, 3], and it is among the leading preventable causes of death in Japanese adults [4]. Incentive programs, which use insights from behavioral sciences to encourage individuals to engage in healthy behaviors primarily focusing on physical activity, have been implemented in Japanese municipalities as a feasible intervention. Incentives of various types, sizes, frequencies, and durations are used to change health behaviors and improve health outcomes, such as smoking cessation, weight loss, diet, fitness, and physical activity [5,6,7]. The impact and cost-effectiveness of such intervention schemes, however, remains unclear [5, 8] and requires compelling evidence. Although incentive schemes lead to costs for system management and incentive payments, projects’ potential benefits can offset such costs. One of the potential benefits of interventions is that they may reduce medical care costs because of improved health, as evidenced by previous studies [9,10,11,12,13]. However, other studies have found no effect of physical activity on medical care costs [14]. Given that physical activity is clearly beneficial in lowering the risks of chronic diseases [15], the effectiveness of an intervention may depend on how well the scheme is designed to encourage individuals to become physically active. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the short-term economic benefits of an incentive scheme. The novelty of our study is that it is based on data from a large-scale experimental project conducted in six Japanese municipalities. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study in Japan to evaluate the economic benefits of an incentive scheme. Here, economic benefit is the reduction in medical care costs due to the implementation of a project minus its operating costs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the data used in this study and empirical methods used to estimate the impact of the intervention on medical care costs and the economy. Sections  4, and 5 discuss the study’s results, policy implications, and conclusions, respectively.",

However, as  Morikawa  [13, 14] pointed out, it is difficult to measure output and value added in the service sector because in the service sector, the quality of the services offered differs greatly. As a result, in the field of medical care services, performance is measured by factors such as mortality among emergency patients and during emergency surgery and the length of hospital waiting lists [4]. In the case of educational services, performance is measured by factors, such as students’ test scores, grade point average, and school evaluation [5]. Considering both the manufacturing and service sectors in Japan and South Korea, Lee et al. [11] calculated the management practice scores of Japanese and Korean firms by applying the method developed by Bloom and Van Reenen [2] and examined the relationship with firm performance. In their study, service sector performance was measured in the same manner as manufacturing, with nominal output (sales value) adjusted using an industry-level deflator, but the quality of the service was by no means adequately considered. Based on previous studies on management practices, our study focuses on the relationship between firm performance, considering several outcome measures in addition to standard output and value-added measures, and its management practices in a specific service industry. This study analyzes this relationship in the Japanese passenger bus business. The business differs from oft-analyzed manufacturing in three ways. First, the “number of passengers” can be used as an indicator of the real performance of the business. Second, like those in medical care and educational services, companies in the passenger bus business can be both privately and publicly operated, making it possible to compare the management quality of these two types of companies. Dealing with a sector with differing operational formats not only allows us to investigate whether differences in management quality depend on operational format, but also provides an opportunity to consider the quality of service after privatization.Footnote 1 The final factor is the existence of the regulations. Because passenger bus operators must run their businesses with due regard to road safety and also receive subsidies from the government, they are subject to heavy regulations even if they belong to the private sector. Additionally, there is a licensing system for bus routes, and although participation is regulated, the determination of fares is also restricted. Bloom et al. [4, 5] considered the relationship between management quality and service quality in the health care and educational service sectors, which are also heavily regulated. Therefore, we also intend to consider the issues of management quality and performance while controlling for the existence of regulations. We raise discussions from not only the viewpoint of productivity analysis, but also from the viewpoint of social welfare policies, that is, the importance of bus transport policies in an aging society. As shown in  “Overview of regular passenger bus business in Japan” section, the number of bus users has clearly declined since Japan’s period of high growth. However, given the aging society, the use of busses as a means of everyday transport is likely to be reviewed amid increasing concerns about elderly people driving themselves. In this case, because the elderly are the main users, offering services that take full account of safety is likely to become important. Furthermore, we propose a hitherto unconsidered angle, in that our study deals with management practices as a means of improving service quality. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  “Literature review” section presents a review of previous research on management practices and quality improvements in such service sectors.  “Overview of regular passenger bus business in Japan” section provides an overview of the bus businesses in Japan. Our survey of management practices for bus operators is outlined in  “Overview of the survey” section. In  “Management practice and performance” section, we analyze the survey results. The analysis was broadly divided into two phases. First, there is a comparison of the survey results for private- and public-sector companies and management practices at metropolitan and local bus enterprises, which provides an overview of the characteristics of bus operators’ management practices. Second, using simple quantitative analysis, we investigate some features of the relationship between the evaluation of management practices (as obtained from the survey results) and various management performance indicators of bus enterprises. In the final section, strategic problems are discussed, as well as a summary of the results of the analysis.",1

In response, the country has frequently devalued its currency when it was fixed against the British Pound (GBP) and the US Dollar (USD). Likewise, it allowed the Rupee to depreciate vis-à-vis the USD after it had adopted a managed floating exchange rate regime in the early eighties. In 2018, Pakistan once again experienced a balance of payments crisis; the third in the last ten years. The Central Bank of Pakistan (SBP) allowed the Rupee to depreciate by fifty-two percent between November 2017 and June 2018, in line with the advice of donor agencies. In the economic literature, exchange rate misalignments are considered the most common cause of balance of payments crises [16, 35]. A depreciation will push the real exchange rate towards its equilibrium level [42], which will reduce imports and raise exports thereby improving the country’s trade balance [33]. However, the trade balance will only improve if the Marshall–Lerner Condition (MLC) holds, i.e., the sum of the import and export elasticities needs to be greater than one.Footnote 1 In the long run, a depreciation may improve factor productivity and thereby enhance economic growth [13, 29, 36, 43, 44, 49]. As factor productivity and economic growth are driven by a myriad of other factors, the present study assesses the effectiveness of the SBP exchange rate policies by analyzing the impact of the real exchange rate on imports and exports. By providing estimates of import and export elasticities, we can test whether the MLC condition holds for Pakistan. Our work contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, the determinants of exports, imports, the real exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves are modeled simultaneously. Previous research on the MLC has used import and export equations. We add equations for the exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves, as these variables not only affect imports and exports, but are also affected by imports and exports. Therefore, ignoring these feedback mechanisms on the trade balance may lead to misleading results. The system of equations is then used to estimate the import and export elasticity of the real exchange rate. Second, we incorporate three dummy variables, reflecting the periods spent by Pakistan under IMF programs, the financial liberalization carried out since 1992, and the country’s decision to detonate nuclear devices in 1998 which led to trade sanctions, respectively. These events may have had a profound impact on Pakistan’s trade balance, but their contributions have never been quantified before. We use the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to deal with endogeneity and simultaneity. The exchange rate, imports, exports, and foreign exchange reserves are strongly related, causing serious endogeneity problems. GMM provides consistent and efficient estimates in the presence of one or more endogenous regressors. We use annual data from 1968 to 2019. Our findings suggest that a depreciation of the real exchange rate increases exports and decreases imports. In addition, we find that imports affect exports indicating that the decrease in imports in response to a real exchange rate depreciation is likely to have a depressing effect on exports. Moreover, our results suggest that the income elasticity of imports is very high. Overall, our findings show that a depreciation of the real exchange rate does not improve the trade balance, i.e., the Marshal–Lerner Condition does not hold for Pakistan. As a robustness check, we also estimate our model using three stage least square (3SLS) and seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) estimators. The outcomes are similar to the GMM estimates, suggesting that our results are robust. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section “Stylized facts about the exchange rate and trade dynamics in Pakistan” discusses the exchange rate dynamics in Pakistan, while Section “Literature review” presents a brief literature review. Section “Model” provides analytical details of the model, and Section “Methodology” discusses the methodology adopted. Section “Results” presents the estimation results, while Section “Conclusion” offers our conclusions.",

Since then, a rich literature has focused on the measurement of intergenerational income elasticity and several empirical studies have investigated the determinants affecting the intergenerational income mobility [28, 35, 6, 7, 14]. Income mobility seems to be mainly associated to investment in human capital and income inequality. The negative relationship between income inequality and income mobility has been shown in various studies, starting from the work by [34] to the recent meta-analysis by [2]. The importance of investment in human capital for a country in increasing the income mobility is recognized in several contributions [31, 40, 17]. However, other socioeconomic factors may affect income transmission. Recently, particular attention amongst the neighbourhood factors has been given to crime, empirical studies show that a decline in crime increases the expected income rank [11, 33]. There is evidence that health shocks could contribute to intergenerational mobility (i.e., less ability to work, high medical expenses), as well as people moving out of an income class may have very different life expectancy patterns than those staying [18, 8, 22]. Kearney [21] reports evidence that there are improved economic opportunities for women and minorities, but gender and racial wage gaps persist. Urbanization is usually connected with a high rate of social mobility in developed countries, but it will not automatically improve prospects for mobility for the urban poor [15, 30]. This brief review of studies shows that, if on the one hand, there is a rich literature on income mobility and its relationship with income inequality and education opportunity; on the other hand, there are few studies on the association between income transmission and other socioeconomic factors, such as health conditions, urbanization, crime, gender and racial gaps. Furthermore, since growing up under disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions may negatively affect the life chances of children, an important role may be assumed by the adoption of public policies that aim to create opportunities for people living into disadvantaged backgrounds [11, 29, 37, 32, 33]. In particular, to improve the disadvantaged conditions, government expenditure should be devoted to social protection, education, health care, public order, housing and community development. Government spending for education has been identified in various studies as an important policy instrument for income mobility and redistribution [10, 27, 36, 38]. Other components of public spending may also play a crucial role in improving the life chances of children born in disadvantaged conditions towards upward economic mobility [39], but the literature on the analysis of the impacts of the components of government expenditure is limited to few studies [24] show, for selected components of public spending (education, welfare, health, housing and community development), that government expenditure has a greater impact on the income of children from the poorest families than on the income of children coming from rich families. More recently, Nam [25] investigates the moderating role of government spending, considered as aggregated of the previous mentioned components, in the association between income inequality and intergenerational income mobility. Huang et al. [20] find that there is greater income mobility in high-spending regions. While there is a growing number of studies facing if and how the socioeconomic conditions and government expenditure affect intergenerational income mobility, there is a limited number of studies that have empirically examined the effects of socioeconomic factors on intergenerational income mobility conditioned on public spending. To address the question, using a moderated regression analysis with cross-country data, this paper investigates the role of the components of government expenditure in the association between intergenerational income mobility and socioeconomic characteristics, which are relevant for the life chances of children. The findings of the paper confirm a consistent pattern for the socio-economic variables: the intergenerational income mobility increases in the countries with less inequality (income, racial and gender), less crime, more education and more life expectancy. The findings also show that there is a moderating role of the components of public spending in reducing income persistence, which differs amongst the socioeconomic characteristics. Finally, the results show that the existence of disadvantaged conditions may decrease the government expenditure effectiveness leading to less income mobility, as well as public investment devoted to improve those socioeconomic conditions that create income opportunity may lead to less government effectiveness. The paper proceeds as follows. (“Measurement of intergenerational income transmission”) provides a brief presentation of the main theoretical model beyond the measurement of intergenerational income transmission in empirical studies. (“Analysis of the socioeconomic effects”, “Analysis of the effects of public spending decomposition” respectively, investigate the effects of socioeconomic factors and public spending decomposition. (“Moderated regression model”) presents the moderated regression model and discusses the role of government expenditure and its effectiveness in the association between income mobility and the socioeconomic characteristics. (“Conclusions”) sets conclusions.",

Japan ranked 28th worldwide (sixth in Asia) in the number of inbound travelers in 2008 and 15th (second in Asia) in the number of outbound travelers in 2007. Table 1 shows that the number of foreign visitors grew by an average of 30% yearly from 2003 to 2009. Despite the general growth in the number of inbound travelers, this study reveals a significant disparity among Japanese prefectures in the number of foreign visitors as measured by the number of nights spent by foreigners. Foreign visitors spend an overwhelmingly high number of nights in a few prefectures. It is important to reveal what causes this geographic concentration in the number of nights that foreigners spend in Japan’s 47 prefectures. This paper provides the first empirical evidence of this remarkable geographic concentration in travel destinations and analyzes its causes. Previous studies have examined international travel flows from the perspective of trade in services. Neiman and Swagel [16] found that post-9/11 changes in visa policy were unimportant in explaining the sharp decline in travel to the US following the attacks. Yasar et al. [23] also investigated visa policy and revealed that the US Visa Waiver Program (VWP) contributed to increased bilateral trade, especially for US exports, between the US and selected VWP countries. Several studies [5, 10, 17] analyzed travel as an input that facilitates trade or innovation by face-to-face communication. Earlier studies [14, 19] employed time-series econometric techniques such as cointegration and Granger-causality approaches to explore the relationship between trade and international travel. Kulendran and Wilson [14] found two-way Granger causality between total travel and real total trade using data for Australia and four important travel and trading partners. Shan and Wilson [19] also found two-way Granger causality between international travel and international trade for China. Katircioglu [11] also employed the Granger-causality test and revealed that growth in international trade (exports and imports) stimulated an increase in international tourist arrivals to Cyprus. Fischer and Gil-Alana [6] used a methodology based on long-memory regression models and revealed that German tourism to Spain has an effect on German imports of Spanish wine that lasts two to nine months. Unlike previous studies, this study focuses on the geographic concentration of foreign visitors and analyzes the relationship between the number of nights foreign visitors spend in a prefecture and that prefecture’s factor endowments, GDP, and distance from visitors’ countries of origin. The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 explains and briefly describes the data used in this study. Using locational Gini coefficients, Sect. 3 reveals the geographic concentration of foreigners’ travel destinations as measured by the number of nights they spend. Using gravity equations, Sect. 4 examines what determines the number of nights spent by foreign visitors. Section 5 summarizes and concludes the paper.",

The agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1994 determined the minimum standard of IPR protection and strengthened enforcement procedures backed by the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is expected that the harmonization of IPR protection accelerates international trade, but there has been conflict between developing countries, which pursue access to technology and knowledge, and developed countries, which favor reinforcement of IPR protection. As a result of this confrontation, multilateral and regional free trade negotiations have made little progress. Moreover, as seen in US-China trade friction, the delay in the harmonization of IPR protection developed into a trade war. It remains even unclear as to whether the harmonization of the IPR system spurs international trade. Therefore, policymakers and researchers have long been interested in the impact of global IPR reform on international trade. This study provides empirical evidence to the debate regarding how IPR harmonization is related to trade by estimating structural gravity models. This study contributes to the literature that explores the link between IPR protection and trade [2, 5, 13, 15, 19, 20]. Existing theoretical conjecture between IPR protection and trade is that strengthening IPR protection in an importing country brings opposite effects on bilateral trade flows. These are known as market expansion effects that induce imports from abroad and market power effects that discourage imports due to strengthened monopolistic power [15]. Most empirical studies have paid attention to the question of how strengthening IPR protection in developing countries affects imports from developed countries, introducing the strength of IPR protection in importing countries into the right-hand side of the gravity equation. However, it is a fact that trade in patent-sensitive goods is heavily concentrated in trade between developed countries. In relation to this point, De Groot et al. [7] report that bilateral trade is promoted by institutional similarity between the two countries. In other words, exports of patent-sensitive products are likely to enjoy the market expansion effect in destination countries with similar patent systems which are expected to reduce transaction costs. Unlike previous studies on this topic, the main feature of this study is to focus on not the strength of IPR protection in destination countries but rather the difference in IPR law between the countries of origin and destination. The present study argues that institutional harmonization in terms of knowledge production plays an important role in trade of patent-sensitive goods. The existing framework can be useful to provide insights on how the disparity in IPR law is related with bilateral trade flows. Specifically, in the case in which IPR protection in the destination country is weaker than in the origin country, exported products will be exposed to a high risk of profit loss from counterfeit goods and imitation of their technologies due to reverse engineering. On the other hand, stronger IPR protection in the destination country than in the origin country would hinder exports to the destination, as it implies that the monopolistic power of firms in the destination country is stronger than in the origin country. In the end, market expansion effects are expected in the case in which IPR law is harmonized between bilateral trading partners. Another feature of this study is characterized by applying structural gravity models based on a micro foundation to the estimated equation for bilateral trade flows while most previous studies on this topic rely on non-structural gravity equations, except Awokuse and Yin [2] and Briggs [3]. Gravity equations are a hot research field and recent progress in developing micro-founded models is significant, as seen in the model based on the Ricardian framework [9], the model that incorporates the conceptual framework of multilateral resistance [1], and the model with heterogeneous firms [4, 11, 16]. Based on micro-founded theory, these models derive structural gravity models with constant trade elasticity. In addition, the feature of constant elasticity of trade costs is recently relaxed by Novy [17], who derives a structural gravity model by applying the general equilibrium translog model to the demand system. The translog preferences as represented by Diewart [8] and Feenstra [10] are more flexible than constant elasticity of substitution (CES) type preferences are, and generate the gravity model in which trade costs elasticity is no longer constant. More specifically, trade costs elasticity differs according to bilateral trade intensity between the two countries. The results from the estimation of the structural gravity models reveal that the harmonization of IPR law measured by the difference in the Index of Patent Rights [18] between exporters and importers is positively correlated with bilateral trade share, as predicted. However, this significant sign is observed in only patent-sensitive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, medical chemicals, and medical equipment. This result suggests that transaction costs caused by institutional disparity matter for trade of patent-sensitive products. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Intellectual property rights and international trade” presents related studies on this topic. “Empirical framework” elaborates on the theoretical framework and derives the estimable gravity equation. “Data” explain data used in the estimation of the gravity model. “Estimation results” presents the estimation results of the structural gravity model. “Conclusion” summarizes and concludes.",
17.0,1.0,International Journal of Economic Policy Studies,28 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-022-00104-6,Ownership structure of nuclear power plants for fair competition and efficiency: private low-cost access versus public ownership,February 2023,Yusuke Ikuta,Takashi Yanagawa,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How to manage the transition to competitive market conditions after deregulation is an important policy issue [6]. Deregulation has been implemented in several industries. One way to create a level playing field in the electricity industry is vertical unbundling between the transmission network and power generation within the incumbent firm [17, 20, 21]. Vertical unbundling is deemed to be necessary to secure fair access to the transmission network. However, it may not be sufficient to create fair downstream competition after deregulation. The reason is the existence of ex ante cost advantage for the incumbent firm created by policy intervention.Footnote 1 If the liberalization policy gives opportunity only for equal access to the transmission network, the cost gap between the incumbent firm and the entrant firms will be carried over. As a result, ex post-intervention would be required to amend the cost imbalance which has been brought by intervention under regulation. If the initial competitive conditions are in favor of the incumbent firm after deregulation, it would dominate the market.Footnote 2 The construction of initial conditions to guarantee fair post-deregulation competition is an important policy issue. In this paper, we study how to utilize cost advantageous plant which is unevenly distributed in the context of the electricity industry. Under which equal accessibility to the transmission network is secured, the incumbent firm, which owns the cost-efficient plants, has an advantage. An appropriate example to study this kind of issue is nuclear power plant utilization in the liberalized retail electricity markets in France and Japan. There are three reasons: first, nuclear power is a good example of policy intervention before market liberalization; second, nuclear power is cost efficient, and has significant share of installed capacity for each domestic market;Footnote 3 third, both countries have proposed different reforms for the utilization of nuclear power. When the retail electricity market is liberalized, the incumbent firm has cost advantage over new entrants. The incumbent has low-cost generation while the entrant has high-cost generation. This situation harms fair competition. To level the playing field, the entrant should also have access to low-cost generation. As for the use of existing production capacity, it is important to consider how to design the cost-efficient power plant ownership structure as cost-efficient technology exclusively held by the incumbent firm. This study aims to clarify the effect of cost-efficient power plant ownership structure on the retail electricity market in terms of efficiency and fair competition. Given the aforementioned situation, we compare two scenarios. In the first scenario, the incumbent firm owns both the cost-inefficient technology (e.g., thermal power) and the cost-efficient technology (e.g., nuclear power), and it allows the entrant firm access to the cost-efficient one, namely private low-cost access. The first scenario is associated with the “Nouvelle organization du marché de l’électricité” (New Organization for the Market of Electricity, NOME) law, which is a law France approved to promote competition in the retail electricity market. In this study, we model “l’accés régulé à l’électricité nucléaire historique” (regulated access to incumbent nuclear electricity, ARENH), which is the regulated access price the entrant firm pays for nuclear power held by the incumbent firm.Footnote 4 The second scenario involves introducing a public firm which is not subject to profit maximization and aims to balance its revenue and cost, all of cost-efficient power plants are owned by the public firm instead of the incumbent firm. The second scenario, namely public ownership, should be compared to the first one since it seems to assure that the incumbent and the entrant have equal access to the cost-efficient plants. Furthermore, public ownership may induce more output than the first scenario, namely private low-cost access. Which scenario of cost-efficient plant ownership structure is better? To answer this question, we establish a simple model to compare the outcomes under the two scenarios, private low-cost access and public ownership. In both scenarios, we analyze the model under the following assumptions. The incumbent firm and its entrant rival engage in a Cournot duopoly competition under three alternatives. First, neither cost-efficient power’s capacity constraint, nor its fixed cost is considered. Second, only the capacity constraint is considered. Third, both the capacity constraint and the fixed cost are taken into account in the model. Cost-efficient power’s capacity constraint is considered since the installed capacity of cost-efficient power does not satisfy all electricity demand. The power plant’s fixed cost is considered and assumed to be larger than that for thermal power. In the French context, the nationalization of nuclear power plants, the public ownership alternative to the private low-cost access in this study, presents a meaningful discussion for the following reason. The incumbent firm EDF owns all French nuclear power plants, and the French government holds 83.69% of all EDF shares according to the company’s report [16]. From this fact, one might assume that as a public entity, EDF is not subject to a profit-maximizing behavior. However, EDF is supposed to exhibit a profit-maximizing behavior, driven by big-scale industrial customers in a deregulated market where retail electricity prices are determined by supply and demand. We use and modify the setting of Créti et al. [12] which undertook an economic analysis of the NOME law. Their study assumes that the incumbent firm A owns nuclear power plants and an entrant firm B owns thermal power plants. None of the firms supposedly has any capacity constraint. \(K\left(>0\right)\) represents the transfer rights to sell nuclear power from firm A to firm B. If firm A sells nuclear power to match firm B’s market share \(\alpha\), then firm B can use nuclear power for \({q}_{B}\le \alpha K\), where \({q}_{i}\) denotes the quantity of electricity supplied by firm \(i \left( =A, B\right)\). Otherwise, firm B would switch to thermal power. The literature shows that, under Cournot competition, the total quantity of power supplied increases due to private low-cost access. Créti et al. [12] found that it is desirable to introduce the NOME law and leave nuclear power plants in the hands of the incumbent. However, the authors did not consider an alternative policy that takes nuclear power plants from the incumbent and transfers them to a state company. Hence, we consider the issue of public ownership. If such a policy is adopted and the marginal cost of both the new market entrant and the incumbent is the same, the market outcome can be improved. Therefore, in the current study we compare private low-cost access with public ownership to determine which policy leads to a better performance of the electricity market. The study has three main conclusions. First, public ownership outperforms the private low-cost access if cost-efficient power’s capacity constraint and fixed costs for cost-efficient power plants are ignored. Second, when both capacity constraint and fixed costs are taken into account, social welfare is identical under the private low-cost access and public ownership equilibria in terms of efficiency, while equilibrium under the private low-cost access is better in terms of fairness. Third, we derive the conditions under which the private low-cost access is preferable to public ownership, not only for the incumbent firm, but also for society. The above results are intuitive for the following reasons. First, cost-efficient power -generated electricity is supplied to fully meet the demand of the incumbent firm and the entrant firm under public ownership, contrary to the private low-cost access. The public firm does not discriminate between the two suppliers when purchasing low-cost electricity. Second, cost-efficient power -generated electricity is supplied at marginal cost under the private low-cost access and at average cost under public ownership. Hence, total electricity output is larger under the private low-cost access than under public ownership. Third, when cost-efficient power’s average cost is close to less-efficient power’s marginal cost, total electricity output under the private low-cost access is larger than under public ownership. Furthermore, when the transfer ratio of cost-efficient power-generated electricity is no more than half of the entrant firm’s market share, private low-cost access is profitable for the incumbent firm. As TOB to EDF is being considered in France at the time of writing this article in 2022, this paper provides an analytical perspective on the nationalization of EDF. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Nuclear power in France and Japan” explains the liberalization of the retail electricity markets in France and Japan. “Model” presents the model’s framework. In “Benchmark equilibrium”, we present the first scenario’s benchmark equilibrium without policy intervention. In “Equilibrium under the private low-cost access”, under the private low-cost access second scenario, we obtain the equilibria with and without capacity constraints, and with and without cost-efficient power plant fixed costs. In “Equilibrium under public ownership”, we obtain the corresponding equilibrium under the third scenario of public ownership and compare the welfare effects of the alternative policies. We show that the private low-cost access is better than public ownership in terms of social welfare. In “Comparison of approvable private low-cost access and public ownership”, we consider the problem that would arise if an incumbent firm adopted the private low-cost access over public ownership as a political compromise. Finally, we provide concluding remarks in “Concluding Remarks”.",
