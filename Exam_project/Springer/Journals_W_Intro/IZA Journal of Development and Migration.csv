1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,31 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-1-13,Does aid induce brain drain? A panel data analysis,December 2012,Darwin Ugarte Ontiveros,Vincenzo Verardi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The international mobility of workers is perceived by several authors as a key issue in economic development. South to north migration has increased substantially over time and reached very high levels. To give a broad idea of the situation, estimates from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2008), reveal that more than one half of OECD countries have a stock of immigrants that exceeds 10% of their total population. Many of these immigrants come from developing countries (LDCs). As stated by Docquier et al. (2007), in 2000 developing countries accounted for 64.5% of total immigrants and 61.6% of skilled immigrants in the OECD (15% points higher than in 1990). The selection of international emigrants by education level is a central issue for both research and policy analysis since its extents explains the migration’s positive and negative consequences for both sending and receiving countries. To caricature, we could summarize the debate by asserting that migration hosting countries are interested in managing low-skilled (and illegal) immigration while migration sending countries are interested in retaining human capital by reducing the outflow of the highly skilled. The desire of reducing low-skilled migration in OECD countries rests on the fact that low skilled immigration lowers the low-skilled wage in hosting countries (Borjas, 2003), and reduces the working possibilities for lowly qualified native workers (Borjas, 2006). Furthermore, it increases the net tax burden on the natives (Lee and Miller, 2000). From the perspective of LDCs, they are concerned by the emigration of the highly skilled. Even if the debate is ongoing (brain gain), see Beine et al. (2011), most authors view brain drain as a threat mainly because it reduces human capital formation and consequently long-term growth (Bhagwati and Hamada, 1974, and Wong and Yip, 1999). Beine et al. (2008) estimated that countries that are small, relatively poor and have high emigration rates suffer substantial net losses of human capital. In order to deal with these disequilibria, it has been suggested that, to reduce both skilled and unskilled migration, it could be necessary for OECD countries to target some of their development aid specifically to migration (see for example Böhning and Schloeter-Paredes, 1994, IOM and UNCTAD, 1996, Stalker, 2002, Lowell and Findlay, 2006, UNCTAD, 2007, and OECD, 2008). The underlying idea being that aid would act against the alleged root causes of migration. Rotte and Vogler (2000) and recently Berthélemy et al. (2009), contradict this vision showing that aid and migration are complements rather than substitutes. However, from a policy perspective, a more detailed analysis of emigration selection is needed to understand the welfare consequences of migration for both sending and receiving countries. In this paper we assess the effectiveness of foreign aid to reach its migration objectives, and investigate the impact of aid on the schooling gap between emigrants and non emigrants (migration selection), and on the skill composition of emigrants (i.e. skilled, and unskilled migration). Using a recent panel database on international migration constructed by Defoort and Rogers (2008) and linking it to the international aid database (available from the OECD) we find evidence that, on average, aid is associated with the migration of the more educated. Our finding is that 1% of GDP increase in aid induces a 7% increase in skilled migration, and an increase in the selection rate of around 3% (i.e. the ratio high to low skilled among emigrants and non emigrants). The effect on the unskilled migration rate is small (2.5% in case of a 1% of GDP increase in aid). These results are robust to different identification strategies and specifications. We also test some specific mechanisms to improve our understanding of the influence of aid on the selection path of emigrants. Relying on the seminal papers of Roy (1951) and Borjas (1987), several authors have studied the determinants of the composition of international migration focusing in particular on the education level of migrants. Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), Fernández-Huertas (2008), (forthcoming) and Grogger and Hanson (2010), for example, find that the major determinants of self selection among emigrants (by skill levels) is the distribution of income in host and home country, and the pecuniary and non-pecuniary moving costs. In this framework, it is likely that international cooperation may influence self-selection of emigrants, by helping reducing transaction costs (e.g. by providing opportunities for the highly skilled to migrate thanks to the attribution of scholarship grants), or even informational costs (e.g. by providing information on the donor countries to both skilled and unskilled natives). The clear identification of the latter is however difficult as project aid might induce screening of high level professionals (e.g. by creating opportunities for highly qualified native professionals in LDCs). Moreover, aid could help softening the budget constraint of potential migrants by increasing incomes in LDCs. We test for these specific mechanisms in section 5. We are not the first to study the channels through which aid induces migration. Indeed Berthélemy et al. (2009) suggest, in the last section of their paper, that skilled migrants are more sensitive to bilateral aid (attraction effect), while unskilled migrants are more influenced by the effect of total aid on the budget constraint softening. Our finding is however slightly different. Indeed, we find that skilled migrants are highly reactive to both the attraction effect of aid and its budget constraint softening properties. The outcome is particularly important when aid is bilateral or when it is technical cooperation. On the other hand, we only find weak evidence that unskilled migrants react to aid through the budget constraint mechanism. We hope that by using panel data (and dealing with unobserved heterogeneity) we will bring new evidence on the mechanisms of the influence of aid on migration and complement the findings of Berthélemy et al. (2009). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we provide a description of the data as well as some stylized facts. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology designed. Section 4 displays the results. Some mechanisms are sketched out and tested in section 5, whereas in section 6 we conclude.",2

Article 12: People’s Republic of China Labor Law (2012) Workers enjoy the right to employment on equal footing and to choice of jobs on their own initiative in accordance with law. In seeking employment, workers shall not be subject to discrimination because of their ethnic backgrounds, race, gender, religious beliefs, etc. Article 3: People's Republic of China Law on Promotion of Employment (2012) There is a nascent but growing academic literature focused on how China’s ethnic minorities have fared in China’s economic transition. Researchers have addressed disparities in rural and urban income (Gustafsson & Li 2003) (Ding & Li 2009), rural poverty (Gustafsson & Ding 2008), occupational attainment and job segregation (Hannum & Xie 1998), job search, hiring, and promotion (Hasmath 2011, 2012b; Howell and Fan 2011), and labor force participation (Maurer-Fazio, Hughes, & Zhang 2007, 2010). Although the specific research questions asked, and methodologies applied, have varied considerably, most of the above papers find that China’s ethnic minorities have not fared well in comparison to the majority Han during China’s transition to a market economy. However, some of the differences in Han and minority wellbeing are attributable to differences in education levels and residential location. It is particularly important to sort out whether and to what extent observed differences in the labor market outcomes of majority Han and ethnic minority participants are due to differences in Han and ethnic minority attributes (differences in productive characteristics) or to the treatment of those attributes, that is, to discrimination. A number of the above mentioned studies apply decomposition techniques to try to discover what share of the differences in labor market outcomes can be “explained” by differences in productive characteristics. The “unexplained” differences, that is, the residual differences in income or labor force participation or occupational attainment are then often attributed to discrimination but may in reality be due to model misspecification, omitted variables, and/or unobservable aspects of productivity differences. This study takes a more direct approach to studying discrimination. Using a resume audit approach we directly measure the extent of ethnic discrimination in the hiring practices of Chinese firms. The resume audit methodology allows us to strictly control aspects of job candidates’ productivity experimentally while varying their ethnicity (as denoted by ethnically differentiated names)1. Resume audit studies have been used to study discrimination in a wide variety of country and labor market contexts2. This, however, is the first application of a resume audit study to test for discrimination against ethnic minorities in the hiring practices of Chinese firms. In our resume audit study, conducted in the summer of 2011, we submitted 21,592 applications to 10,796 positions advertised on Internet job boards in 6 Chinese cities. The positions varied over three types of occupations. We randomly paired Han applications with one of three minorities with ethnically distinct names: Mongolian, Uighur, and Tibetan. We found significant discrimination against each of the minorities except in Hohhot and Urumqi-- two autonomous minority areas. Discrimination was less prevalent in tight labor markets. Although candidates of each minority group experienced discrimination, not all firms discriminated. Close to half the firms treated their paired applicants equally. State-owned firms were significantly more likely to treat candidates equally and much less likely to discriminate in favor of Han candidates than private firms. In the following sections of this paper, we first provide some context on China’s ethnic minorities and then review the literature that examines how they have fared during China’s economic transformation to a market economy. We then briefly review the literature on ethnicity-focused resume audit studies and go on to describe our own experimental design. We then present the analysis of our results—first from the perspective of individual applicants and then from the perspective of the firms selecting applicants for callbacks. We summarize our findings in the concluding section.",31

2004) 1. However, individual employment outcomes and benefits of education are inherently tied to location decisions. After completing their education, individuals have to decide where to begin their careers. Many college graduates will choose to begin their careers in different geographic areas than where they attended college, but some will remain in the same area as where they attended college (Huffman and Quigley
2002; Groen
2004; Oosterbeek and Webbink
2011). There are both benefits and costs in deciding whether to migrate and relative employment prospects likely play an important role. Migration decisions are often viewed as human capital investments (Sjaastad
1962). In this framework individuals maximize their own expected utility and choose to live in the location that offers the highest expected utility. Thus, upon completing her degree, a college graduate will move to a new area if it gives her greater expected utility than the place where she earned her degree. The expected utility that an area offers will depend on a number of factors including wages and employment opportunities, the local cost of living, consumer amenities and quality of life, and the tastes and preferences of the individual making the migration decision (Clark and Hunter
1992; Franklin
2003). Chen and Rosenthal
(2008) suggest that young college graduates are often most strongly attracted to large metropolitan areas with high wages and a strong labor market. Whisler et al. (
2008) argue that cultural and recreational amenities also play an important role in college graduate migration decisions. Furthermore, Berry and Glaeser
(2005) and Waldorf
(2009) suggest that educated individuals are attracted to areas that already have large numbers of educated people. While some areas are certainly better than others at attracting and retaining recent college graduates, the optimal location will not be the same for all individuals. Individuals have different skill sets and different preferences for various locations. Furthermore, some graduates may develop human capital that is specific to the location where they earned their college degree (DaVanzo
1983; Krupka
2009; Winters
2011). For example, they may develop networks with professors and local employers that enhance their employment prospects in the area. Alternatively, recent graduates may have built strong friendships and developed a taste for local amenities that help tie them to the area where they attended college. These preferences for the place where they attended college may even incline some recent graduates to accept lower paying jobs to stay in the area that they have grown to love. To date there has been very little research examining how employment outcomes for recent graduates are affected by staying in the area where they attended college. Previous researchers have examined the effects of migration on income and employment for various groups (e.g., Axelsson and Westerlund
1998; Yankow
2003; Boheim and Taylor
2007; Anil, Sjoquist, and Wallace
2010; Blackburn
2010a,
b), but have not explicitly examined the effects of staying in a college town for recent graduates. Many recent college graduates might be better able to find gainful employment by relocating to a different labor market and of course many graduates do leave the area where they completed their education. Recent graduates who stay in the area where they earned their degree may pay a price for doing so, and this price is likely to be especially large in smaller labor markets that produce large numbers of college graduates, i.e., “college towns.” This paper seeks to fill an important gap in the research literature by investigating differences in employment outcomes between recent college graduates who stay in the college town where they obtained their degree and those who leave after completing their degree. Using decennial census data, we classify 41 U.S. metropolitan areas as college towns and examine differences in the probability of employment, annual wage income, hourly wages, annual hours worked, and a measure of the education level of a worker’s occupation. The results suggest that, on average, college town stayers earn lower annual and hourly wages and work in less educated occupations. Thus, it appears that college town stayers generally experience worse employment outcomes than those who leave. These results continue to hold when we employ a difference in differences approach that treats recent graduates from large metropolitan areas as a control group and when we control for differences in the cost of living across labor markets.",4
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,27 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-1-10,Payments for ecological restoration and internal migration in China: the sloping land conversion program in Ningxia,December 2012,Sylvie Démurger,Haiyuan Wan,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The past decades have witnessed a deterioration of natural environment in China, which led to water shortage, soil erosion, desertification, or ecosystem degradation. After a series of serious drought and flooding in 1997–98, restoring the ecological environment has become a prime task for the Chinese authorities and various reforestation projects have been put on the agenda. As for forest protection itself, the background for the implementation of specific policies can actually be traced back to May 1957 when the State Council passed the “People’s Republic of China (PRC) Soil and Water Conservation Program”, which stated that the original terraced fields on steep slopes should be gradually returned to forest or pasture. Nevertheless, the most significant changes in the conversion of mountain areas into forest and pasture use as well as in the protection of forest and grassland did not take place before the 1990s, with key legislative steps taken in June 1991 (PRC Law on Water and Soil Conservation), in August 1998 (revised Article 39 of the Law on Land Administration of the PRC) and in January 2000 (Implementation Regulations of the PRC Forestry Law). A component of the national ecological restoration plan, the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP)1 has been set as a priority in the Central Committee’s Document No. 2 and the meeting on the Development of China’s Western Region in January 2000. 2This large-scale program aimed at reducing soil erosion by returning about 15 million hectare of crop land on steep slopes back to forest or grassland between 2001 and 20103, of which 4.4 million hectare of land with a slope over 25 degrees (Xu et al.
2004b
). The program also entailed the objective of restructuring the rural economy and reducing poverty through a compensation scheme, which granted participating households the payment of in-kind and cash subsidies for a period of 3 to 8 years. 4A pilot phase started in 1999 in three provinces (Shaanxi, Sichuan and Gansu). In March 2000, the pilot project was officially extended, and upon its full-scale implementation by the end of 2002, it involved 25 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and 1,897 counties (Xu et al.
2004a
). The total project area covers 710 million hectares, accounting for 74 percent of the total country land area, and the total population in the area is 712 million, of which 78 percent is agricultural population. The Sloping Land Conversion Program falls into the category of programs implemented worldwide under a scheme of Payments for Environmental Services (PES). As stated by
Engel et al. (2008
), PES can be defined as “a voluntary transaction where a well-defined environmental service (or a land use likely to secure that service) is being ‘bought’ by a (minimum one) service buyer from a (minimum one) service provider if and only if the service provider secures service provision” (p. 664). The United States started such programs in 1986 with the implementation of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a long-term reforesting program funded by the government. Similarly, Canada implemented a Permanent Cover Program (PCP) in 1989, and the European Union introduced two land conversion programs as part of the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992 (
Chen et al. 2009
). Various PES programs have also been implemented in developing countries including Costa Rica (Payments for Environmental Services Program), Bolivia (Ecological Compensation System program), Mexico (Payments for Hydrological Environmental Services program), Colombia (Environment Protection Project), or El Salvador (Environment Conservation Program). Generally speaking, these programs have been found to have a positive impact on environmental protection and on the reduction of soil erosion (
Ribaudo et al. 2001
;
Ferraro and Kiss 2002
;
Mapemba et al. 2007
; Munoz-
Pina et al. 2008
). In contrast, evidence is mixed regarding their economic impact, especially for household activity choice and labor migration. In the case of the United States and Europe,
Cooper and Osborn (1998
) and
Ferraro and Kiss (2002
) found that the implementation of PES programs activated labor migration, but on the contrary, some papers argued that government payments to farmers decreased off-farm labor participation (El-
Osta et al. 2004
;
Dobbs and Pretty 2008
), notably because they created an important income effect that outweighed the substitution effect (
Ahearn et al. 2006
). As for developing countries, the empirical findings on the impact of PES programs on migration are also inconclusive. On one hand, a body of literature shows that reforestation policies have a significant and positive impact on labor migration as well as on household income (
Resosudarmo and Thorbecke 1996
;
Pagiola et al. 2002
; Alix-
Garcia et al. 2005
;
Asquith et al. 2008
). According to
Pagiola et al. (2005
), the PES program in Latin America increased migration possibilities of rural farmers by about 10%. On the other hand,
Wunder (2007
) found that the payment price from conversion was too low to change the benefit-cost comparison for rural peasants and their incentives to migrate in Asian developing countries. The SLCP has also generated considerable interest regarding its effectiveness and its ecological and economic impact5 (
Yin 2009
). So far, most economic papers have analyzed and evaluated the effects of the policy on peasants’ income, poverty, and off-farm labor decisions, but very few have been specifically devoted to measuring its impact on labor migration. Table 1 reviews the existing econometric literature and highlights mixed evidence on the labor allocation impact of the program. Papers that used data collected a few years after the program was launched did not find evidence of any impact of the program on off-farm labor participation (Xu et al.
2004a
;
Uchida et al. 2007
), although econometric assessments using more recent data found a positive impact of the SLCP on off-farm labor participation (
Uchida et al. 2009
;
Groom et al. 2010
;
Yao et al. 2010
). A range of descriptive papers argued that most peasants were not willing to participate in the program and that subsidies and free job training would not change their cost-benefit comparison. These papers concluded that the policy had little impact on peasants’ participation and labor migration (Xu et al.
2004a
;
Weyerhaeuser et al. 2005
). In the case of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
Zhang et al. (2008
) also pointed out the limited opportunities for farmers to develop off-farm businesses because of a pervasive lack of investment and policies in local social capital development. They also highlighted the lack of farmers’ participation in the policy-making process as a major concern about the sustainability of the program. In contrast, some papers highlighted the attractiveness of the program to households because of the subsidy mechanism, and found that it actually induced a rapid growth of labor migration. For instance,
Xu et al. (2006
) argued that the SLCP stimulated a small adjustment of the local economies and that participating farmers improved their livelihoods.
Liu et al. (2008
) reported anecdotal evidence on the large number of surplus laborers generated by the policy that contributed to and facilitated the surge in labor migration across China.
 This paper uses a dataset collected in 2009 in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to assess whether and to what extent the SLCP has influenced rural labor migration. It aims at answering the following research questions: i) How labor migration changed in response to government subsidies under the SLCP framework? ii) How government policies contributed to the massive rural labor exodus observed in China since the beginning of the 2000s? Despite the number of studies on the socio-economic impact of the SLCP, there is a lack of knowledge on its impact on labor migration decision at the individual level. Case studies reviewed above are largely based on a few household surveys carried out only a few years after the program implementation in a limited number of provinces (as a matter of fact, most studies focused on the three pilot provinces that started the program first). Our contribution is three-fold. First, compared to the existing literature, we use a recent dataset that covers the full implementation period of the program and that may enable us to better capture the potentially slow adjustment of household labor allocation decision. Based on these data, our analysis adds to the available literature by examining the SLCP’s longer-term impact on labor migration. Second, we specifically focus on labor migration and on individual decisions. The existing literature has mainly assessed the impact of the SLCP on off-farm participation, including local off-farm work and self-employment, and usually only considered labor participation decisions at the family level (to the exception of
Uchida et al. 2009
). As the drivers of labor migration and other off-farm decision (local self-employment or wage-work) may differ in many respects, focusing on labor migration enables us to provide a somewhat more detailed and consistent analysis by concentrating on the mechanisms through which the policy affects peasants’ migration. In terms of the program sustainability, examining labor migration rather than all off-farm activities also makes sense since it not only involves a change of activity out of the farm, but also a displacement of the population out of the countryside. Third, we focus on an autonomous region populated with both Han and minority people that has not been much studied so far, and we use a fairly large and representative sample. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 gives an introduction to the reforestation policy and illustrates how SLCP may affect farmer’s decision to migrate. Section 2 provides data description. Section 3 gives an overview of the empirical approach, discusses the identification strategy and reports regression results with the difference-in-difference approach. Section 4 proposes a sensitivity analysis using propensity score matching method. Section 5 concludes.",16
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,24 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-1-9,From the bottom to the top: a more complete picture of the immigrant-native wage gap in Britain,December 2012,Priscillia Hunt,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"International migrants comprise an increasing proportion of the population in many countries throughout the world. This is evident in the United Kingdom (UK) where the proportion of international migrants (immigrants) increased 60%, from 6.5% to 10.4% of the population from 1990 to 2010 (United Nations 2009). Where the UK differs from many other developed countries, however, is that immigrants earn more on average than natives (Dustmann et al. 2010). After controlling for a number of factors known to influence earnings, analysis suggests immigrants should be earning even more (Denny et al. 1997; Dustmann and Fabbri 2005; Bell 1997). Whilst differences in human capital endowment and socio-economic characteristics explain some of the lack of earnings assimilation (Elliott and Lindley 2008), there are still unexplained differences in earnings between immigrants and natives. In order to better understand wage differentials, decomposition techniques are used to estimate the ‘explained’ portion of a wage gap due to differences in observed characteristics and the ‘unexplained’ portion of the wage gap due to differences in returns to those characteristics (typically referred to as discrimination). When the earnings distribution is quite wide or skewed, there are also questions about whether discrimination differs across the conditional distribution. In order to more fully describe wage assimilation in Britain, this study estimates wage differentials of immigrant and native males using Blinder-Oaxaca (B-O) decompositions. We also apply the Machado and Mata (2005) technique to estimate B-O decompositions across the distribution using quantile regressions. We utilise data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for countries of Britain over the period 1993 to 2009 and focus on prime working age males in non-self-employment. This is the first study we are aware of that decomposes wages of immigrant and native males in Britain over this period and also describes decompositions across the conditional wage distribution. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Chapter 2 surveys literature looking at sources of the immigrant-native wage gap in the UK and outlines the theoretical underpinning of the empirical strategy. Chapter 3 describes the empirical model and estimation strategy. Chapter 4 presents the data set and Chapter 5 presents results. The final chapter 6 concludes with policy implications and areas for further research. In most developed countries, salaried immigrants earn less than salaried natives. In Britain, however, immigrants’ raw wages are greater than natives’ (Dustmann et al. 2010) and immigrants have more years of education (Clark and Drinkwater 2009). When controlling for human capital and socio-economic characteristics, a different picture emerges and immigrants’ conditional earnings are less than natives’. Research has mainly focused on the role ethnicity plays in describing this wage gap because Britain experienced a shift from largely South Asian and East African immigrants to European migrants following several European Community-related policies on free movement since the 1980’s. Denny et al. (1997) use the approach developed in Jenkins (1994) to examine discrimination indices across the distribution in Britain using General Household Survey (GHS) data from 1974 to 1993. Comparing different ethnic groups, authors find non-whites in Britain face wage discrimination generally and non-white immigrants face slightly more discrimination. Whilst the GHS is a useful household survey, the sample size and immigrant demographic profile are limited for labour market analysis given relatively low numbers of immigrants in Britain. Using LFS data over the period 1993 to 2000, Dustmann et al. (2003) find non-white immigrants earned 10% less than white natives, even after accounting for a variety of characteristics known to affect wages. One explanation for the lack of wage assimilation for non-white immigrants is that they were overrepresented in low paid occupations (Elliott and Lindley 2008). Another explanation for the wage gap is that immigrants earned less for the same observable characteristics and, thus, faced discrimination in the labour market (Bell 1997; Clark and Lindley 2006). Given the methods applied, however, it is unclear whether immigrants earn less than natives due to differences in the distributions of their characteristics or immigrants face discrimination. As for white immigrants in Britain, they earn more than their white native counterparts, yet this dissipates over time. Some of this pattern appears to be due to selection into higher paying jobs rather than positive discrimination in favour of white immigrants (Elliott and Lindley 2008). Although recent studies utilise better data and techniques to minimise biases known to affect earnings assimilation, the immigrant-native wage gap in Britain is not fully explained by human capital and socio-economic characteristics. One way to estimate the explained and unexplained portions of a wage gap is to apply decompositions techniques. We identify only one such study in Britain for immigrants. Elliott and Lindley (2008) apply the B-O technique to break down the wage gap between immigrant groups and the base category of white natives for full-time employed males using British LFS data over the period 1993 to 2003. Authors find a majority of the observed mean earnings difference between white and non-white immigrants is attributed to unexplained differences, including ethnic discrimination. As immigrants’ earnings performance varies widely (Shields and Price 2002), the unexplained difference may diverge for those at the bottom than the top of the skills distribution. Rather than focusing investigation on decomposing the mean wage gap for a variety of ethnic-immigrant groups, we investigate differences of decompositions across the conditional distribution. Following the enhanced human capital regression approach of Mincer (1974), we initially estimate a single wage equation on a pooled sample of immigrants and natives of the form:
 where w

i
 is logarithm of gross hourly wages for individual i, X

i
 is a vector of typical human capital and socio-economic characteristics applicable to natives and immigrants (education, experience, part/full-time, industry, ethnicity, marital status and an intercept term) explaining wages for individuals i, M

i
 is a dummy variable indicating whether individual i was born in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland (UK-born) and 1 if born abroad (non-UK-born), T

i
 is a set of dummy variables controlling for year of the survey (1993-2009) and R

i
 is a set of dummy variables that control for eleven regions of Britain (nine government office regions of England, Scotland, and Wales). The error term, ε

i
, captures the unobserved components of wages. The coefficient of interest, π, indicates the wage premium associated with being an immigrant. We also estimate equation (1) separately for immigrants and natives to observe whether there are differences in returns for immigrants and natives. We then estimate this model for immigrants only with a further set of human capital and socio-economic characteristics to investigate immigration-specific factors potentially driving the value of π. Research shows assimilation can occur over time with increasing length of stay in the host country (Constant and Massey 2003). We, therefore, include years since immigrated in X

i
. Earnings assimilation may be also affected by the time period in which immigrants arrived (Borjas 1995). Economic or social conditions of the host country can lead to differential wage profiles for different cohorts and we, therefore, include in X

i
 a set of dummies for cohort groups of entry. Since home country conditions, language and culture may influence the returns to human capital characteristics, we estimate the model separately for those from English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries (Manning and Roy 2010; Constant et al. 2012). Thus far, the empirical approach estimates the differences in earnings controlling for observable characteristics. In order to more fully describe the wage gap and determine whether immigrants would earn more or less as natives, this paper estimates a decomposition model established by Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973). Blinder-Oaxaca (B-O) decompositions have been shown to be a useful technique in immigration research to determine whether various dimensions, such as ethnicity or language, drive differences in labour market assimilation (Constant et al. 2012). We then estimate an extension of the B-O technique to quantile regressions (QR) as in Machado and Mata (2005). The wage gap becomes the difference between immigrants’ predicted wage at each quantile, θ, using a generated wage distribution and the counterfactual distribution for natives (Chernozhukov et al. 2012). Of particular interest is the gap in pay immigrants would face at the θth quantile if their distribution of characteristics were the same as natives but they received immigrant returns, or discrimination. Depending on the extent to which returns vary, immigrants at the bottom of the conditional wage distribution may experience less wage assimilation than immigrants at the top (known as a ‘sticky floor’), or vice versa (a ‘glass ceiling’). The definition used for sticky floors and glass ceilings in this paper is provided in Arulampalam et al. (2007). A sticky floor refers to a situation in which the wage gap at the 10th percentile is at least 2 percentage points greater than the 25th percentile wage gap. A glass ceiling is observed if the 90th percentile wage is 2 percentage points greater than the wage gaps estimated at the other parts of the wage distribution. A potential bias of our approach is selectivity in which only employed persons are included and individuals facing employment discrimination, or choosing ‘zero’ wages or self-employment due to weak employment offers, are excluded. We do not correct estimates for employment selection bias for two key reasons. First, the selectivity component of the raw wage gap in Britain has been shown to be minor with the white/non-white earnings gap changing by 1% when correcting for selectivity (Blackaby 2002). Second, correction methods often depend on the selection of arguable instruments that potentially introduce another imprecision. Furthermore, it does not appear to be essential because Elliott and Lindley (2008) show the ethnic earnings gap in Britain is robust to selection effects.",7

Some migrants return to their countries of origin after a period in the country of destination. Return migrants may bring skills or capital to the home economy and thereby contribute to the positive effects of migration in the source countries. Mexico has become the largest source of immigrants in the United States. Mexican immigrants accounted for 31.3 percent of the new arrivals in the 1990s (Chiquiar and Hanson,
2005). Their return migration rate is also high. The 2010 Mexican census shows that of the 994,869 individuals who left their country to live in the United States from 2005 to 2010, 307,783 returned to Mexico by 2010. In other words, 30.9 percent of the migrants returned home.1 In this article, we investigate the self-selection patterns among the return migrants in Mexico. We focus on two important questions regarding Mexican return migrants: 1) Is selection stable over time? 2) Are there gender differences in selectivity patterns? This is the first paper focusing in changes in selection among return migrants over time. Hence, this paper contributes to the understanding of the self-selection patterns among return migrants in the long-run. Also, we show that women face different selection patterns than men. This is an important result that has not been addressed in previous literature on Mexican return migrants. The high proportion of return migration among Mexican migrants in the U.S. suggests that the economic effects of return migration could be large. If the migrants acquire some skills as a result of their migration or if they overcome credit constraints, then return migration has a positive effect on the source economy. To determine the self-selection patterns, we calculate the counterfactual wage distributions of the return migrants had they stayed in Mexico. To calculate this counterfactual wage, we follow DiNardo et al. (
1996) method and reweight the wage distribution of the non-migrant population in Mexico (stayers) such that the distribution of observable characteristics between return migrants and stayers is as similar as possible.2 This is a similar empirical strategy employed by Coulon and Piracha (
2005) for return migrants in Albania. Using the 1990, 2000 and 2010 population censuses, we find that the self-selection patterns among return migrants have changed over time. In 1990, average counterfactual wages of return migrants were higher than average wages of stayers for both men and women. In other words, the selection was slightly positive for both men and women. In 2000, the selection among the women stayed positive, but the men were drawn more from the middle of the wage distribution. The result changed in 2010. The selection among men became negative and the women were drawn more from the middle of the distribution. Both men and women show negative selection on average by 2010. Moreover, migration allows those who return to obtain higher wages because the increase in human capital or savings can be invested on productive activities. There is a wage premium associated with migration and return. As in the case of selection, the wage premiums to migrate and return have worsened over time for both men and women. Similar patterns hold when restricting to geographical subgroups and with other robustness tests. Our identification strategy only uncovers selection in observed variables (i.e. age, education, geographical variables). Following Reinhold and Thom (
2012), we find suggestive evidence that this wage premium is in part due to the migration experience and not to positive selection in unobserved ability among return migrants. In the next section, we review the literature on selection and examine how return migration is related to selection and productivity improvements. Section 3 explains the identification strategy. Section 4 provides more details about Mexican return migration and describes the datasets employed in this study. In section 5, we present the results. We discuss some implications of our findings in section 6. Finally, in section 7, we conclude this paper.",16

1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,28 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-1-6,The impact of parents’ years since migration on children’s academic achievement,December 2012,Helena Skyt Nielsen,Beatrice Schindler Rangvid,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In Western Europe, there is increasing concern about the assimilation of the children of the large cohorts of guest worker immigrants. Contrary to what one might expect, results from the international PISA, PIRLS and TIMMS studies show that in most Continental European countries immigrants continue to lag significantly behind their native peers even in the second generation (Schnepf 2007; OECD 2010). In the face of a rapidly growing population of second-generation immigrant youth, this is a puzzle of major importance. In this paper, we focus on the effect of parents’ years since migration on second-generation pupils’ achievement and thus on intergenerational, or inherited, integration. It turns out that the second-generation immigrants, whose parents have spent fewer years since migration in the country of destination before having their child, inherit severe disadvantages from their immigrant parents. The literature on immigrant outcomes typically focusses on the time (first-generation) immigrants have lived in the host country. For the first generation, time since migration (or age at arrival) reflects both their own and their families’ time since migration and thereby their potential integration in the host country. By contrast, second-generation immigrants are typically considered a homogenous group with respect to their potential for integration, since they all – by definition - have been born and raised in the host country. However, they still differ by their families’ potential for integration, i.e. their parents’ years since migration, and thus by their own potential for intergenerational, or inherited, integration and its derived effect on educational outcomes. Thus, in this study, we analyse the effect of parents’ time since migration (before the child’s birth) on children’s educational outcomes at the end of lower secondary education. We analyse father’s and mother’s years since migration separately, since parents have not necessarily migrated to Denmark jointly, in which case their time since migration varies. In our sample, 70% of pupils have parents, who arrived in Denmark more than three years apart in time. One particular source of this variation is the widespread practice among immigrants in Denmark and other European countries of marrying a marriage migrant from their country of origin.[1] This practice may result in substantial differences between father’s and mother’s years since migration, since one of them may have migrated to Denmark with his/her parents as a child and thus has been raised and educated in Denmark, while the other is a recent immigrant at the time of childbirth. The literature on effects of immigrants’ age at arrival or years since migration is rooted in the theory of transmission of human capital and language capital over generations. Looking first at the parent generation, these studies document that age at migration matters for immigrants’ own assimilation as measured by e.g. language proficiency, educational attainment and wages, because there exist certain critical ages in which migration hampers language proficiency and educational progression.[2] As a consequence, the effect of parents’ age at migration may be transmitted to the children, and the transmission may work through several different channels. While there is a small body of literature on the effects of first-generation immigrants’ age at arrival on educational outcomes (Böhlmark 2008; Cortes 2006; Gonzalez 2003; Van Ours and Veenman 2006), previous research on the effect of parents’ years since migration on their children’s education is rare. To our knowledge, this is studied only in one recent paper by (Aslund and Skans 2009). They look at a sample of primarily guest-worker migrants from Nordic countries in Sweden and exploit sibling-fixed effects to identify the effect of the mother’s years since migration on e.g. education. They document that a ten-year earlier arrival would increase the length of education by 0.2 years (or 0.1 SD), which should of course be seen in the light of the relatively advantaged sample of mainly Nordic immigrants that they look at.[3] The authors focus on the effect of the mother’s years since migration, and thus they neglect potential effects of diverse migration of the two parents. Yet, the effect of parents’ language proficiency, which is one of the channels through which parents’ years since migration may influence their children’s education, on children’s education and employment has been analysed. Both (Bleakley and Chin 2008) and (Casey and Dustmann 2008) show that the parents’ language skills translate into higher English proficiency of and better educational outcomes for their children.[4]Bleakley and Chin (2008) employ an instrumental variables technique in which the instrument for parents’ language skills is the interaction between age at migration and non-English speaking country of origin. Casey and Dustmann (2008) employ a “selection-on-observables” strategy where they exploit rich background information such as parental education and permanent earnings, years since migration, country of origin dummies as well as survey information about parents’ contact with residents in the host country. These papers focus on transmission of capital from each of the two parents. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the sources of the second-generation gap by investigating an important potential source: the impact of each parent’s years since migration on their children’s academic achievement. Parents’ years since migration is a measure of the potential for integration that encompasses the time the parents had to get accustomed to life in Denmark, learn the language, obtain host country education and labor market experience before they started child rearing. Therefore, it is informative over and above detailed measures of education, employment and language proficiency. Formally, we use ordinary least squares and sibling-fixed effects specifications, we estimate the effect of each parent’s years since migration, assuming that variation in parental time since migration/spacing between birth of siblings is random, conditional on observed or unobserved permanent characteristics at the family level. The present paper contributes to the literature by being the first study to investigate the effect of parental years since migration on children’s educational outcomes in a sample that is similar to other current immigrant populations in Continental Europe: refugees and children of guest-worker migrants from non-Western countries. Furthermore, our analysis is novel in its focus on both fathers’ and mothers’ years since migration, and possible asymmetries in the effects, and in its focus on educational achievement early in the educational career. In Figure 1, we describe the timing of the set-up in the case in which the father immigrates to Denmark first (e.g. as a guest-worker), and then the (future) spouse follows, and then they have a child.[5] This is the example illustrated in the figure. A similar set-up applies to the cases in which the mother arrives first, or both parents migrate together. 
Timing of set-up.
 Although the research question is clearly relevant also for other Western countries, the availability of data in Denmark gives us an advantage in this type of investigation, because we can link family members in the Danish registers and follow immigrants from arrival and onwards. Therefore, our empirical analysis is based on Danish register data allowing us to combine information on all pupils in the form 9 cohorts of 2002–2009 with information about their parents’ background characteristics in the year of immigration. To be specific, we study the impact of each parent’s years since migration prior to birth of the child in question on pupils’ achievement as measured by subject-specific exam grades in the school exit exams, drop-out and no exam in form 9. We find that generally the mother’s years since migration are most important for grades in Danish, while the father’s years since migration are most important for grades in math and for drop-out and no exam. This emphasizes the importance of our distinction between each parent’s years since migration, which contrasts the approach in the earlier literature. When we split the sample by gender, we find that the positive effect of mother’s years since migration only persists for boys. This indicates that family-specific effects influence girls and boys differently. A plausible explanation is that family-specific effects include factors that are closely related to norms and attitudes regarding education and gender role patterns, and that this is what shows up in the results. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data which are used for the study. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy, while Section 4 contains the results of the empirical analyses. Section 5 concludes the paper.",12

In 2012, the number of foreign born residing in Sweden amounts to 14 percent of the population. Problems of integration on the labor market have recently been recognized both in Sweden and most other European welfare states (see e.g. Zimmermann, [2005]). However, unlike most other European countries Sweden has, as a consequence of staying out of the Second World War, a fairly long history of immigration. This is reflected by about 25 percent of the population having at least one foreign-born parent. The increased share of immigrants and children with foreign-born parents motivates research regarding their long-term economic assimilation. In this study, we analyze intergenerational earnings mobility among immigrants and the earnings of second-generation immigrants, i.e. children with foreign-born parents in Sweden. Most empirical studies on intergenerational transmission of human capital and earnings mobility in economics departs, in one way or the other, from the Becker and Tomes’ ([1986]) model. In the Becker and Tomes model the parental generation renounces a share of their consumption possibilities and invests it in the skill formation of their children. These investments generate a pattern of persistence in labor earnings over generations. In order to study intergenerational mobility among different ethnic groups, Borjas ([1992–1994]) extends the Becker and Tomes model by introducing “ethnic capital”, a ethnic group specific component in the intergenerational transmission of human capital, which works as an externality in the human capital accumulation process. Thus, in Borjas’ model, labor market outcome and earnings in the second generation does not only depend on parental investments but also on the average quality of the ethnic environment where parents make their investments. If the effect of “ethnic capital” is sufficiently strong, ethnic differences in labor market outcome and earnings in the first generation are likely to persist over several generations. Another implication of this model is that there will be less overall intergenerational income mobility in the entire group of immigrants, consisting of different ethnic groups, than within an ethnically homogenous group. Borjas’ model can thus be used as an explanation to the empirical observation that there is less intergenerational income mobility among immigrants than natives. A limitation with Borjas’ extension of the Becker and Tomes model is, however, that it only explains persistence in the economic position. The model cannot explain why certain ethnic groups improve their relative earnings position in the child generation, whereas the relative earnings position of other ethnic groups deteriorates. As in Borjas ([1992]), we find less intergenerational earnings mobility among first and second generation immigrants than among natives. We make, however, a very different interpretation of our findings. In the context of the Becker-Tomes model, our interpretation is that the family is more important for intergenerational transmission of human capital among immigrants – since they have less access to, and are likely to be less influence by, the society outside the family, such as educational systems and social networks. Our interpretation is supported by the fact that there is less intergenerational mobility also within comparatively homogenous ethnic groups and that ethnic groups with relatively low intergenerational earnings mobility, i.e. relatively high degree of intergenerational transmission of human capital, improve their labor market position in the second generation. The contribution to the research area on immigration and intergenerational earnings mobility is obvious since we are studying several dimensions of intergenerational earnings mobility and human capital transmission among immigrants. Firstly, we are studying intergenerational mobility among the total immigrant population as well as between different immigrant groups. Secondly, in contrast to previous research, we are also studying intergenerational earnings mobility within different groups of immigrants. The intergenerational earnings mobility within different groups of immigrants is used as a measure of human capital transmission and helps us to understand how immigrant offspring from different immigrant groups perform on the labor market. We use a unique data set which, in addition to demographic information and data on educational attainments, contains information on labor earnings from 1975 and 1980 for all male immigrants arriving in Sweden before 1970. It also contains corresponding information on all their biological children obtained for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. A native individual has been matched with each first-generation immigrant with respect to occupation, region of residence and age, to form a comparison sample of natives to the original data set. These data also contain corresponding information on the next generation. Because of the large size of the data set − almost 70,000 male second-generation immigrants, which is a total survey rather than a sample − we are able to divide the data into 20 sub-groups with respect to geographical origin, which allows for a separate analysis. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the history of immigration to Sweden and immigration policy up to 1970. Section 3 describes the data used in this study and Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes.",16

However, there is an argument that as the number of working years increases the strength of the education signal diminishes. For instance, Belman and Heywood ([1997]) has shown that “the returns to education signals will attenuate with workforce experience” as the skills used and/or developed in previous jobs become more important in determining the real productivity level of potential employees 1. Skills gained through professional experience might be from jobs that do not match the individual’s education level and, thus, might affect future job prospects in a diverging way. For example, having accumulated experience and skills below the education level may result in a lower probability of getting job offers that match the formal educational qualifications. Conversely, having advanced in a previous job to a position involving more knowledge and skills than the ones matching formal education may result in getting subsequent offers for jobs that require a relatively higher education level as well 2. Recent research on immigrants’ over/under-education has typically focused only on the formal education qualifications of migrants and has compared the possible labour market mismatch of immigrants or ethnic minorities (i.e., second/third generation migrants) with natives. There is an almost universal consensus in the literature that immigrants are more often over-educated than their native counterparts and researchers forward different, and very plausible, arguments for this disparity. These range from imperfect international transferability of human capital to discrimination in the labour market to, perhaps, a combination of language and country of origin effect (Chiswick and Miller [2009]; Green et al
[2007]). However, the extant literature on the labour market mismatch of immigrants does not appear to have explored the possible impact of home country work experience signal, particularly the existence of education-occupation mismatch prior to migration. We attempt to fill this gap by including the role of home country over-/under-education as an additional determinant of immigrants’ over-/under-education in the host country’s labour market. In other words, we want to explore the possible role of the home country’s labour market signal on the incidence of mismatch in the host country. Our main hypothesis is that the imperfect transferability of human capital or discrimination in the host country does not exhaust the possible explanations for an immigrant’s mismatch: we explicitly test for the possibility that the last job held prior to migration is a strong signal of a migrants’ ability for a host country’s employer. This analysis, therefore, will provide some evidence towards the role of the level of skills accumulated in previous jobs in the home country (i.e., below or above the education level) in explaining the incidence of subsequent mismatch in the host country, instead of, or in addition to those typically inferred to in the existing literature. The significance of the human capital mismatch as an economic problem arises from its link with productivity and, in turn, its consequence on domestic wage inequality. Mismatched workers do not use efficiently their competences. This inefficiency is costly to the individuals involved, as they do not receive a salary commensurate with their abilities. It is also costly to society, as it does not make an efficient use of the finite stock of human capital available to it. In the case of over-education the cost is compounded by the fact that education is publicly subsidized; hence there is also wastage of public resources that could have been used otherwise. In the case of under-education, the cost is the lost opportunity, in terms of future potential output, of not giving enough formal education (or setting adequate incentives for doing so) to otherwise capable people. Within the over-/under-education literature, a line of research has consistently found that immigrants are significantly more over-/under-educated than comparable natives. The higher and persistent incidence of mismatch amongst immigrants is a potential problem for countries where foreigners form a substantial part of the labour force and where employment growth is mainly driven by immigration, as in Australia. Migration policy may in fact involuntarily contribute to destabilise, and not only expand, the domestic supply of skills by selecting people with a higher propensity to become mismatched. In such circumstances, understanding whether the source of such mismatch is attributable to institutional factors of the home or host countries is essential to identify which policy tools can be used to alleviate this problem. If this arises from an inefficient domestic labour market, then the host country may be able to improve the outcome of new immigrants through better coordination between immigration and labour market policies. This would however be void if the source of the mismatch occurs pre-migration. In that case, the host country may decide to revisit the criteria applied by an ineffective selection mechanism. In order to conduct the analysis, we exploit the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA), which contains detailed information about immigrants’ education level, their occupation in Australia since arrival as well as their occupation in the home country in the 12 months prior to migration. Australia has a selective immigration policy, favouring immigrants who are young, highly educated and with prior work experience that is likely to be immediately transferable to the Australian labour market. Still, several studies have shown that immigrants are often employed below their education level and argued that immigrants’ skills are not fully utilised in the Australian labour market (see for example Green et al.
[2007]). Our paper complements these studies in a specific way. Unlike the existing literature, our focus is not the comparison of immigrants’ and natives’ incidence of over-education, but the role of the signal from work experience in the home labour market in determining the labour mismatch in the host country. Our results show that immigrants’ education-occupation mismatch in the host country is, to a large extent, explained by their mismatch at home. The inclusion of dummies for the education-occupation mismatch in the home country along with covariates typically used in previous studies almost doubles the explanatory power of a probit model for over-education and almost quadruples that for under-education. Furthermore, after correcting for the sample selection bias into employment, we find that having been over-educated in the last job held in the home country increases the probability of being over-educated at five months after immigration by 45 percent. Similarly, having been under-educated in the home country increases the likelihood of under-education in Australia by about 61 percent. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses previous literature and outlines theoretical motivations while Section 3 presents the data. The empirical model used in the paper is presented in Section 4 and the discussion of results appears in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.",30

Despite likely productivity advantages, immigrants typically face a wage penalty upon entry to the host country. Studies suggest that poor English language ability and the possession of foreign qualifications make it difficult for immigrants to assimilate to the labor market of the host country (Trejo, [1997]; Friedberg, [2000]; Shields and Wheatley Price, [2002]). Over time, through investments in location specific human capital, immigrants tend to assimilate though their wages and employment do not always converge to those of natives (Chiswick, [1978]; Carliner, [1980]; Borjas, [1985], [1995]; Trejo, [1997]; Friedberg, [2000]). Similarly, there is a consistent finding that immigrants tend to be healthier upon arrival to their new homes but eventually assimilate to the less healthy patterns of their host countries. This is often termed the healthy immigrant effect (e.g. Hao and Kim, [2009]; Antecol and Bedard, [2006]; McDonald and Kennedy, [2005]). Many of these studies focus on weight-related health outcomes and note that immigrants are less likely to be obese than their native-born counterparts. There is also a substantial literature on the link between obesity and labor market outcomes (see Averett [2011] for a review of this literature). The evidence from these studies is mixed as to whether or not the obese face wage and employment penalties in the labor market. Our objective is to explore the complex interactions among immigration, obesity and labor market outcomes1. We know of only one study to date that specifically examines the potential double penalty faced by obese immigrants in the labor market (Cawley et al., [2009]). Specifically, Cawley, Han and Norton use a large US dataset comprised of immigrants from developing countries to examine the effect of Body Mass Index (hereafter BMI) and indicator variables for the clinical weight classifications for overweight and obese on several labor market outcomes2. They find few significant wage penalties except for obese female immigrants who have been in the country a short time. Whereas most of the previous literature on immigrant health, wages, and assimilation has focused on immigrants to the US, our study uses data from a nationally representative dataset from the UK covering the period 2004 to 2006. We extend the Cawley et al. ([2009]) analysis in two ways. First we examine immigrants in a European country that has recently experienced substantial immigration. Second, we expand their analysis to compare immigrants with non-immigrants. The UK presents a different context to examine the effect of immigration and body weight on labor market outcomes because most immigrants to the UK are not from developing countries. We find some significant associations between weight and labor market outcomes for immigrants. Our results indicate that immigrants overall do not fare poorly in the UK labor market, although, overweight and obese male immigrants face a wage penalty relative to both other immigrants and overweight and obese natives. To set the stage for our analysis we begin with a brief overview of migration to the UK and a description of the labor market conditions faced by these immigrants. We follow this with a review of the relevant literature. Following the review of the literature we turn to our empirical analysis. We first describe the key features of our UK data set. Then we replicate the Cawley, Han and Norton models on a sample of immigrants only. Our data allows us to extend the work of Cawley, Han and Norton by directly comparing the experiences of immigrants and natives with respect to both weight and labor market outcomes. We conclude with policy implications and directions for future research.",5

In Germany, their labor market situation is of particular concern.1 In 2011, more than every third welfare recipient was an immigrant (36 percent, comprising first and second generation), while the corresponding share in the population was less than 20 percent (Statistisches Bundesamt 2011). Persons claiming welfare benefits are forced to actively look for employment and to enhance their employment chances. In order to improve the employability of welfare recipients, German welfare agencies offer a number of active labor market policy (ALMP) programs. Given the overrepresentation of immigrants in welfare, this group can be perceived to have also a higher need of support by ALMP.2 Nevertheless, relatively little is known so far about the impacts of ALMP programs for immigrants. This lack of evidence is not specific for Germany. There are only a few international studies that analyze ALMP programs with a particular focus on immigrants.3
 A reason for the scarce evidence may be the lack of ALMP programs specifically designed to the needs of immigrants. In Germany, for example, with language courses being the only exception, immigrants participate in programs that have been designed for all welfare recipients. Within Germany’s ALMP programs, so-called short-term training programs have been widely used for native and immigrant welfare recipients. These programs last for a maximum of 3 months comprising aptitude tests, intensified counseling, courses improving job search skills, and measures providing specific skills and abilities required for employment. Programs’ content can be flexibly arranged according to the individual’s needs. Participation should help to improve the employability by increasing the search efficiency and improving productivity. Similar programs are used in many other countries, usually referred to as job search assistance programs. Leaving aside country-specific differences in labor market institutions, detailed program characteristics, and enrolment rules, the overall picture of the employment effects of these programs tend to be positive.4 Whether these programs reach their purposes for immigrants (like for natives) is not clear ex ante and varying impacts can occur for a number of reasons. Differences in placement may result from a different value of the programs for immigrants compared to natives. If programs are designed with respect to the needs of the average native welfare recipient, then they may not work (well) for immigrants, and policy makers should think about redefinition of programs addressing the specific needs of immigrants. On the other hand, if programs are particularly effective for immigrants even though not initially designed for this group, policy makers may intensify the use. We evaluate the effects of four short-term training programs on taking up employment for male native and immigrant welfare recipients in Germany. In particular, we try to answer the following research questions: First, how effective are programs for immigrants (compared to natives)? And, second, if differences in effects are observable between natives and immigrants, can we identify potential reasons of these differences? Determining the source of differences in program effectiveness between groups is important. If, on the one hand, differences in program effectiveness are driven by differences in the socio-demographic composition of native and immigrant welfare recipients, this implies a general potential for welfare agencies to improve the targeting of programs to participants. If, on the other hand, differences are due to the immigrant characteristic, then this points to other reasons, e.g. discrimination, and the use of programs for either immigrants or natives should be reconsidered. The empirical analysis is based on comprehensive register data of the inflows into welfare in 2006. Individuals are followed until July 2008. Regarding the first question, we estimate effects of participation in a short-term training program during the first year on welfare using propensity score matching estimators in a dynamic setting, where treatment effects vary conditionally on the preceding duration in welfare. To answer the second question, we decompose differences in treatment effects in observable and unobservable components. To do so, we identify differences in treatment effects between natives and immigrants that result from the attachment of the individual to the immigrant group (immigrant fixed effect). The estimation is carried out with a matching estimator considering only treated individuals of both groups, where group attachment is the treatment in question. To preview our results, the picture is mixed. On the one hand, courses providing skills and aptitude tests have positive effects on employment. These effects differ only slightly between immigrants and natives once we control for observable differences between both groups. On the other hand, job search training and combined programs are ineffective irrespectively of migration background. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents details of the German welfare system and of the programs evaluated. The data used in the empirical analysis are described in section 3. Section 4 discusses the evaluation approach. The empirical results are presented in sections 5 and 6. The final section concludes.",5

Motives behind Immigrants’ Religiosity,December 2013,Teresa Garcia-Muñoz,Shoshana Neuman,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The religiosity of immigrants has received the increasing attention of social scientists. The Religiosity of immigrants is important from a social perspective as well due to the massive inflow of immigrants into Western countries, who now constitute a significant share of the population in many countries and substantially affect the economy and society in their countries of residence. Religiosity is an important factor in the adaptation process and reflects on social and economic outcomes. Because religiosity has behavioral aspects (e.g., marriage and fertility), it also has long-term consequences and will affect future demographic and cultural transitions. A better understanding of the various facets of immigrant religiosity can lead to improved forecasting of these future transitions and a better preparation for the outcomes. Comprehensive databases, including cross-national and longitudinal surveys, are now accessible, thus facilitating careful statistical analyses. However, many questions concerning the immigration-religiosity intersection still remain unanswered. While it is believed that immigrants tend to be more religious than the native population, the incentives behind the intensified religiosity of immigrants are less clear. In particular: is immigrants’ religious performance driven by socio-economic motives relating to the establishment of networks and bridges that connect them to the local population, or does it stem from psychological bonding and comforting motives, serving as a “balm for the soul” and as a buffer against the hardships of integration? These two types of motives have been discussed in the literature (e.g., Casanova 2007; Fonner and Alba 2008; Connor and Koenig 2013; see the more detailed review below) but have not been tested empirically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first innovative attempt to disentangle the two types of motives and show which of the two is dominant. We claim that the dominance of one type of incentive over the other is country specific. While in the United States the religiosity of immigrants serves as a bridge that leads to the integration of immigrants in the host population, in Europe the bonding motives are more powerful. The question of the principal incentive is important and has long-term consequences: a dominant bridging motive leads to the better integration of immigrants, while a buffering/bonding motive could lead to alienation and hostility against immigrants. The constant inflow of immigrants into Europe and the United States, and in particular the growing share of the Moslem immigrant community, intensifies the social perspectives of the immigration-religiosity intersection. Based on the existing literature and on statistical analyses of several datasets (the International Social Survey Program – ISSP: Module Religion, 2008; the European Social Survey – ESS, waves 2002-2010; and the American General Social Survey – GSS, waves 2002-2010), we aim to offer quantitative contributions to the literature on the motives behind the immigration-religiosity interaction on the two sides of the Atlantic - Europe and the United States. We first start with descriptive statistics on foreign-born populations and the religious landscape of the native and immigrant populations in European countries and in the United States. In particular, we examine the religion and religiosity of immigrants, compared with the religion/religiosity of natives in the receiving countries. These immigrant-native differences, coupled with differences in fertility, will obviously shape future changes in the religious landscapes of European countries. Second, following background information, we explore a core issue that relates to motives and incentives behind immigrants’ religiosity. The bridging versus the bonding theories is tested and cases of European countries versus the United States are contrasted. The historical differences in the state-religion relationship, immigration policies and concepts lead to the expectation of different motives. It is likely that immigrants’ religiosity has a bridging motive in the United States, given that the country was founded on the immigration of people from different religious backgrounds, while Europe has instead strong national religious connotations. In Europe, the religiosity of immigrants will therefore stem from bonding motives and serve as a buffer against the adversities of adaptation. Regression analysis indeed unravels a pronounced ‘bridging’ motive in the United States versus a noticeable ‘bonding-buffer’ component in Europe. It should be noted that our empirical analysis tries to disentangle and identify indicators of motives/incentives for the religious performance of immigrants and sort them out between ‘bridging’ versus ‘bonding’ motives. We do not look into the relationship between the religiosity of immigrants and consecutive economic and social integration outcomes, such as educational attainments, employment, earnings or occupational attainments1. The article is structured as follows: the next section presents background information and a literature overview on immigration and religiosity in the United States and Europe, focusing on the ‘bridging’ versus the ‘buffer-bonding’ elements. An empirical analysis aiming at unraveling the motives behind immigrants’ religiosity follows in the third section, while the last section summarizes and concludes.",4

The textbook model of a competitive labor market suggests that higher levels of immigration should lower the wage of competing workers and increase the wage of complementary workers, at least in the short run. Despite the common-sense intuition behind these predictions, the empirical literature seems full of contradictory results. Some studies claim that immigration has a substantial impact on wages in receiving and sending countries (e.g., Borjas 2003; Mishra 2007), while other studies claim the impact is negligible (Card 2005; Ottaviano and Peri 2012). This paper takes a step back from the empirical debate and asks a simple question: What does factor demand theory have to say about the potential wage impact of immigration-induced supply shifts? Since Marshall’s time, economists have had a good understanding of the variables that generate elastic or inelastic labor demand curves, and how the elasticity of labor demand is affected by substitution and scale effects1. Unfortunately, much of the empirical literature on the wage impact of immigration (particularly in the 1990s) disregarded practically all of these insights, and instead took a data-mining approach: running regressions or estimating difference-in-differences models to examine if the wage evolution in labor markets most affected by immigration differed from that observed in other markets. Few of these studies were guided or informed by the implications of factor demand theory. More recently, beginning with Card (2001) and Borjas (2003), the literature has taken a turn and begun to pay closer attention to the underlying economics of the problem2. This paper derives the implications of factor demand theory for the study of the wage impact of immigration in competitive labor markets. Specifically, it examines the question in the context of a general equilibrium model that explicitly introduces such factors as the elasticity of product demand, the rate at which the consumer base expands as immigrants enter the country, the elasticity of supply of capital, and the elasticity of substitution across inputs of production. The analysis makes two contributions. First, the model generates a closed-form solution of the wage effect of immigration, allowing us to easily generate back-of-the-envelope estimates under a large number of potential scenarios. Not surprisingly, factor demand theory imposes severe constraints on the potential sign and numerical value of these presumed wage effects. These constraints can be used to check the plausibility of the many contradictory claims that appear throughout the empirical immigration literature. Second, the model demonstrates that the impact of immigration on the wage level in the receiving country depends on completely different parameters than its impact on the wage distribution—as long as the analysis builds in technical restrictions that are widely used in the empirical literature. The “separability” of these results again allows simple back-of-the-envelope calculations that suggest the possible range of estimates for the distributional impact of immigration. It is important to emphasize at the outset that by deriving the wage impact of immigration in the context of a competitive labor market, the analysis may be overlooking potentially interesting implications introduced by the possibility that some (many?) immigrants are employed by firms with market power. Unfortunately, the implications of immigration-induced supply shifts in the context of imperfectly competitive labor markets have not yet been fully developed. Similarly, the analysis uses the “standard” assumption of constant returns to scale to derive the implications of supply shocks for the wage structure. It is obvious that the implications could be quite different when there are either economies or diseconomies of scale. The growing literature that examines the impact of high-skill immigration (Waldinger 2010; Borjas and Doran 2012) attempts to determine if high-skill immigrants impart sufficiently strong human capital externalities on the pre-existing workforce to generate increasing returns. In contrast, there has been remarkably little interest (Rasmussen 2013) in examining the impact of immigration in the presence of fixed factors that lead to decreasing returns.",25
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,07 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-21,Are temporary work agencies stepping stones into regular employment?,December 2013,Joakim Hveem,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The growth of temporary working agencies (TWAs) in Sweden and Europe has been rapid since the 1990s and the sector is still expanding in Sweden. The 2011 level of penetration1 was about 1.4% (Bemanningsföretagen 2011) which amounted to an all time high: 62,863 employees (yearly full time equivalents). Thus, it is interesting to investigate whether this development has been of any advantage for the unemployed in terms of increased transition rates into regular employment. Undoubtedly the deregulation of the market in 1993 was a major contributor to the rapid development since it made TWAs legal, only prohibiting agencies from charging employees for their services and imposing a six months TWA contracting stop if a job position has been terminated. The driving force behind the temporary work industry (TWI) is primarily the demand side of the labor market. Increased competitive pressure has forced employers to change their organizational structure towards the 'lean’ production model: the permanent work force is adjusted to the minimum production levels and increased demand is met with atypical employment such as temporary workers or workers hired through a TWA. The rationale for hiring through a TWA instead of recruiting a regular temporary employee is that there are costs associated with hiring and firing which can be mitigated by the TWAs. Furthermore, the tasks required at a company might not comprise enough to constitute even a part-time position. TWAs have the advantage of bundling together different tasks into one or several employment positions. Since recruiting is the TWAs’ main function, it is argued that they have the advantage of economies of scale, which would imply that they are more efficient in both the time elapsed until sealing an employment contract and the quality of the match. This matching efficiency is a theoretical result by (Neugart and Storrie 2006) and also claimed by the TWI itself. Empirically, there is however only inconclusive evidence. Previous studies that in various degrees might lend support to the stepping stone hypothesis are (Andersson et al. 2007; Ichino et al. 2008; Lane et al. 2003; Summerfield 2009; Garcia-Perez and Munoz-Bullon 2005; Amuedo-Dorantes et al. 2008), while (Kvasnicka 2008) does not find any evidence of such an effect. (Autor and Houseman 2010) takes advantage of a quasi-experimental research design which give a small but negative result. However, heterogeneous effects with respect to country of birth are not explored in these studies. In the Swedish setting, research is scarce on this question and causal inference is as yet inconclusive. (Andersson and Wadensjö 2004) focus on the TWA’s stepping stone role for non-European immigrants. Their findings (based on register data) show that immigrants—in relation to natives—more often leave a TWA for another type of employment. This could be interpreted in favor of the stepping stone hypothesis. The causal inference is however weak and mainly relies on reasoning based on probit correlations. In a recent study, (Jahn and Rosholm 2012) investigate the effect of TWAs on the duration until exit from unemployment into regular employment for immigrants. They find significant and positive results when measuring in-treatment effects but nothing significant when examining the post-treatment effect. However, when dividing the sample into smaller groups, such as non-western immigrants, they found a post-treatment effect but no in-treatment effect2. The study was performed in Denmark, implying that the results might be applicable to the Swedish labor market since they are not that different from each other. There is evidently no real consensus in the field, the results span from positive, none, to negative, underscoring that this is a relatively unexplored research topic. When client firms hire personnel from a TWA they assume—after accounting for hiring and firing costs—that the worker provided is the best possible match and that their own effort in recruiting would not be able to compete with the TWA’s outcome. One hypothesis is that the TWAs increase the probability of a worker’s gaining permanent employment in the regular labor market by increasing their human capital, signaling working ambitions, expanding the worker’s network, and serving as a cheap screening device. The last two effects are especially vital for immigrants since they are likely to be subject to statistical discrimination. The type of screening service that a TWA offers in effect is likely to be one of the most powerful remedies against statistical discrimination since the client firm will be able to observe the real productivity without hiring the worker. Since employers usually have a hard time adequately assessing an immigrant’s abilities, education, and skills acquired in a different environment, TWAs could be a remedy, working as a cheap probation device where the uncertainty and risk has been incorporated into the TWA itself. It is also reasonable to believe that the immigrant’s working network is weaker than natives’ and just getting a job helps build up country-specific human capital, such as language skills and a deeper knowledge of how the labor market works3. Another reason to further investigate the effect on immigrants is their over-representation in the industry (Andersson Joona and Wadensjö 2010). All these things taken together give reason to believe that immigrants may specially benefit from TWA employment. The opposite sign is of course also possible due to stigmatization. In the present paper I will estimate the causal impact of employment in a TWA on the medium and long-run transition rate from unemployment to regular labor market employment, with extra focus on non-western immigrants4. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the definition of the treatment group. Section 3 presents the estimation framework and outlines the matching estimation. The results from the various estimations are reported in Section 4, both for the matched and the unmatched sample, ending with a brief summary of the robustness check. Section 5 concludes.",6

Of particular interest have been the location decisions of recent immigrants to the United States and their responsiveness to state-level welfare benefits (Borjas 1999). The extent to which immigrants move within the U.S. in response to such public benefit levels is clearly of importance to state and national policy makers, as well as economists aiming to better understand migration decisions. At the same time, is it well known that the vast majority of working-age immigrants in the U.S. are employed and make-up a large share of the low-skilled labor force (Orrenius and Zavodny 2008). Thus, a full understanding of immigrants’ location choices within the U.S. needs also to focus on the relative attractiveness of working in each state. Perhaps surprisingly, relatively little work has been conducted on the effects of exogenous changes in offered wages on the location decisions of immigrants within the U.S1. The purpose of this paper is to examine this question, by asking whether state-level minimum wage increases attract lower-educated immigrants to the states that enact them. Wages constitute a larger share of immigrant income when compared to welfare benefits, so the focus on expected earnings as a determinant of immigrant location is natural2. In addition, since recent immigrants are likely more mobile within the U.S. than natives are, immigrants are a straightforward choice for testing if minimum wage changes have any effect on labor migration decisions. Using a panel of states, I estimate the effect of within-state changes in the minimum wage on state immigrant counts, taking into account key economic indicators in the calculation of expected earnings and controlling for state and national trends. Data on immigrant counts and wages comes from the 2000 5% Census, the 2001-2007 American Community Surveys (ACS), and the Current Population Survey’s Monthly Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORG) for the years 1994-2007. Before I look at the effect of state minimum wage changes on immigrant counts, it is important to understand how this analysis differs from previous studies. Section 2 discusses the advantages of using immigrant samples and of using minimum wage increases. In Section 3, I establish the importance of the minimum wage for the earnings of low-skilled immigrants by estimating various specifications of hourly wages on minimum wage levels using the CPS MORG data. Similar to previous studies, I find robust evidence that minimum wages are a highly significant component of low-skilled immigrant earnings and that increasing the minimum wage does not significantly decrease immigrant employment. Together, these results indicate that higher minimum wages increase “expected” earnings, supporting the potential for a positive migration effect. Section 4 explains how I measure immigrant counts. Since there is migration in and out of a state each year, immigrant counts reflect the difference between state inflows and outflows (the net flow) and will be referred to simply as the total “count”. In Section 5, I present my estimation strategy for measuring the impact of minimum wage increases on immigrant mobility. I find that immigrants are mobile in response to minimum wage increases, but the effect is highly dependent on the number of years an immigrant has resided in the U.S. Low-skilled immigrants who have been in the U.S. for two to four years are mobile in response to changes in minimum wages. A fifty cent increase in a state’s minimum wage is associated with up to a 13% increase in the number immigrants with two to four years in the U.S. While the percentage effect is large, after interpreting its magnitude relative to state counts and considering a number of other relevant factors, the induced migration varies dramatically across states. The results of the mobility analysis are confirmed using a number of robustness checks and extended to separately analyze immigrants from Latin America and Mexico exclusively. In Section 7, I discuss why the number of years an immigrant has been in the U.S. is important, address potential concerns regarding endogeneity of the minimum wage, and present evidence supporting identification. I do not expect the effect of minimum wages on an immigrant’s choice of state to be the same for recent and established immigrants. This paper suggests a migration scenario in which an immigrant is not most sensitive immediately upon arrival into the U.S., but is after a couple of years. In light of the fact that certain states have traditionally been hubs for new immigrants, it seems plausible that an individual arrives at a migration hub in the U.S. with information provided by a relative or a contact already in the U.S. The immigrant then reevaluates his or her present value of moving against that of staying using a new set of information better suited to analyze the different costs and benefits across states. Over time, as immigrants find a strong state match, set roots within a community, and accumulate human capital, the minimum wage is less binding and thus has little effect on their mobility decision. In Section 8, I conclude by briefly discussing the policy implications of my results and potential extensions.",6
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,19 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-16,Who contributes? A strategic approach to a European immigration policy,December 2013,Giuseppe Russo,Luigi Senatore,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 and the Tampere Meeting in 1999 have been early attempts to lay out the foundations of a common EU immigration and asylum policy. More recently, the Lisbon Treaty calls for the fair sharing of the financial burden necessary for border control and for the development of a European border surveillance system (Eurosur) (articles no. 77 and 80). In spite of these aspirations, results have been deceiving: member states still control the most important aspects of immigration policy, and the Constitutional Treaty reiterates the right of the EU members to determine national immigration quotas (article III-267 (5)).1
 So far, the main attempt to move immigration control to a supranational level has been the establishment of the Frontex agency in 2005. The intent of Frontex is coordinating the national immigration policies at the European level, but it is still far from being a full-fledged authority. The promotion of a EU immigration policy, the development of Eurosur and the expansion of Frontex will require important financial resources (European Commission 2008Jeandesboz 2008). However, although the Lisbon Treaty states that the cost of implementing UE policies “shall be governed by the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between the Member States”2, it does not provide any rule on how to share these costs in practice, nor does it regulate the institutional framework in which the funds have to be gathered. According to Schain (2010), this is the key indication of the failure of immigration policy to take off at the European level. This paper studies to what extent it is possible to implement a EU immigration policy when the member states interact in the absence of a regulator. The literature on this issue is still in its beginning, even though authors concerned with the analysis of asylum policies have addressed similar problems: they have stressed the cross-country spillovers caused by refugees entitled to free mobility within a federation, and they have studied the welfare effects of a coordinated policy. This literature is in fact particularly interested in studying the gains from coordination. For instance, Hatton (2004) adopts a standard social planner approach, while Facchini et al. (2006) study the welfare properties of policy coordination in a representative democracy framework. However, we move from a political economy perspective, and our work is mainly related to two contributions: Mayr et al. (2011) and Haake et al. (2010). The first article studies the joint funding of immigration restriction when a border country may legalize illegal immigrants who are then entitled to move to an interior country. Still, the analysis is limited to the consequences of an immigration amnesty. The second article proposes a mechanism-design approach in order to redistribute resources for immigration control from northern countries to southern countries3. The tools provided by mechanism design might be useful in this respect, but the lack of a federal regulator allowed to tax and redistribute suggests that it is still too early to put forward such an approach4. In what follows we investigate the possibility of sharing the cost of external border control in the framework of the current EU institutions. The simplest method for trying to achieve this aim would be transferring EU funds to the countries that lie on the external border of the Union. In this respect, two crucial points must be emphasized: 1) there is no federal regulator, 2) free mobility in the Schengen area implies that countries enforcing the external border -i.e. Southern European countries- provide a public good.5
 These features are typical of contribution games, which therefore provide a proper modelling framework for our purposes.6
 However, immigration policy has a peculiarity that deserves special attention: immigration is restricted because the potential supply of foreign workers is overwhelming, and different countries have different preferences over the number of immigrants to be let in. In other words, countries have a national immigration target. Several authors have studied the determination of this target in various theoretical frameworks. To mention but a few, the seminal paper by Benhabib (1996) is an example of median voter models. Facchini and Willmann (2005) adopt a common agency approach. Mazza and Van Winden (1996), Amegashie (2004), Epstein and Nitzan (2006), Russo (2011), determine immigration quotas from voting, lobbying and/or bargaining models. What do these targets imply for the funding of immigration control in a federation? Not only this issue has not yet been investigated, but it also requires the development of a specific contribution game, since the possibility of a target has not been explored in the theoretical literature. We build such a game by observing that deviations from a target cause disutility. We capture this point by introducing loss functions in a contribution game. In order to clarify our approach, it is important to note that we want to depict a situation in which national governments try to achieve their own interests in a federal assembly. For our purposes, therefore, the national targets are exogenously given.7
 Our model includes a central country (henceforth C) and a border country (henceforth B). B shares its border with an emigration country and provides border enforcement for both countries. Both C and B should contribute to border control, but they have different immigration targets and contribution cannot be enforced. We believe that these features fit quite well the current EU situation. Our procedure brings to light several important results. First of all, we find that the difference in the national targets is crucial, and it could easily prevent contribution although information is complete and symmetric. Thus, imperfect information is not the main obstacle to a European immigration policy. Then, we compare simultaneous and sequential decisions to check whether there exists an institutional framework that dominates the others in terms of total contribution or incentive to contribute. In the sequential case we explore what happens when the leader is C or B.8
 By confronting the alternative regimes we find that: 1) in order to obtain positive contributions, the immigration targets of C and B must not be too different, 2) the admissible difference in the immigration targets is wider in the sequential game, 3) when both contributions are positive, total contribution is unambiguously higher in the simultaneous game, 4) equilibrium contributions are Pareto-inefficient, 5) in each game a simple condition determines whether C or B contributes more. Results 1) and 2) reverse the well-known conclusions in Varian (1994): they show that the presence of a target incentivizes contribution when preferences are similar and that free riding is less likely in the sequential game. With respect to the prospects of a European immigration policy at the current stage of the integration process, our results suggest that a simultaneous regime, in which central countries decide jointly with border countries, produces tighter border enforcement but is more vulnerable to free riding. On the other hand, the sequential regime provides better incentives to contribute in spite of a smaller total contribution. The paper is organized as follows: the next Section introduces our model, Section 3 presents the results when decisions are sequential or simultaneous, Section 4 studies the effect of the cost asymmetry on the equilibrium contribution, Section 5 is devoted to compare the equilibrium contributions under the different institutional frameworks, Section 6 proves that the equilibrium contributions are Pareto inefficient, and Section 7 concludes.",1

Furthermore, it is often argued that labour market integration of immigrants may be important for social integration and cohesion, and there may be long-term effects through integration of children of immigrants. In this paper, we investigate the effect of active labour market programmes (ALMPs) on the duration until regular employment for non-western immigrants in Denmark receiving social assistance (cash benefits).1 The reason why we focus on social assistance recipients is that the majority of non-western immigrants in Denmark are not members of an unemployment insurance fund, implying that they are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits when they become unemployed; instead they receive social assistance, and they are heavily over-represented among social assistance recipients, especially among long-term recipients. For instance, in 1998 (the second year of our estimation period) immigrants from non-western countries made up 4.8% of the population and received 38% of the total amount of social assistance benefits; see Pedersen (2000). Immigrants from western countries are much more similar to natives in terms of labour market attachment and only few receive social assistance benefits. Like other recipients of social assistance in Denmark, immigrants are offered active labour market programmes administered by the job centres. Because a large fraction of non-western immigrants are social assistance recipients, it is very important to assess whether these programmes have positive effects on immigrants’ employment prospects. If some programmes show positive effects, further targeting of such programmes to immigrants may have large positive effects on labour market integration and, indirectly, on social integration in general. We use rich administrative data covering all immigrants in Denmark, and we employ the timing-of-events duration model of Abbring and van den Berg (2003).2 We find large positive post-programme effects, and, surprisingly, most in-programme effects are positive too. We find the largest effects for subsidized employment programmes, but effects are also large and significant for direct employment programmes as well as for other programmes. Effects are larger for programmes beginning after six months of unemployment. Implications of our estimates are illustrated by calculating marginal effects on the expected duration to regular employment over a five-year period for typical starting times and programme durations. Subsidized employment programmes shorten the social assistance spell by about 10 months for women and 15 months for men. The effect of direct employment programmes is 3.7 months for women and 4.6 months for men, and the effect of other programmes is 1.5 month for women and 2.6 months for men. Only very few papers have investigated the effects of ALMPs specifically for immigrants, but most of these studies find large and positive effects; see the survey in Rinne (2012). The study most closely related to this paper is Clausen et al. (2009) which investigate effects of programmes offered to newly arrived non-western immigrants in Denmark. This is a much smaller and very different group of immigrants compared to the sample of the present paper where more than 60% had been living in Denmark for more than 5 years. Effects of ALMPs may be very different for immigrants receiving social assistance 5, 10 or 20 years after immigration than for newly arrived immigrants who are offered ALMPs as part of an ‘introduction programme’. The former group is much more selective and may have more serious social problems and health problems. Clausen (et al.
2009) find that post-programme effects on the hazard rate to regular employment of newly arrived immigrants are significantly positive for wage subsidy programmes, but not for other types of programmes. Bolvig et al. (2003) reach a similar conclusion investigating effects of ALMPs for social assistance recipients in the second largest municipality in Denmark, but they do not estimate separate effects for natives and immigrants. The overall finding in previous studies on programmes for unemployed workers is that earnings effects as well as employment effects are small; see the surveys in Stanley et al. (1999), Heckman et al. (1999), Kluve (2010), and Card et al. (2010). Stanley et al. (1999) summarise the effects of several US programmes. They find that temporary wage subsidy programmes increase the probability of finding jobs in the subsidy period, but not in the long run, and that job search courses and counselling shorten unemployment duration. The surveys in both Stanley et al. (1999) and Heckman et al. (1999) conclude that effects are heterogeneous: some ALMPs may have positive effects for unemployed with a weak position in the labour market, but for other groups the effects are smaller if at all positive. Our findings of rather strong positive effects for non-western immigrants in Denmark are consistent with these previous results, since these immigrants in general have a weak position in the Danish labour market because of language problems and a low level of education or non-transferable education from their country of origin. The findings in the surveys of European labour market programmes by Kluve (2010) and Card et al. (2010) are similar to those for the US: ‘private-sector incentive programmes’ (including wage subsidies) and ‘services and sanctions’ (including job search assistance, counselling, and sanctions for non-compliance) typically have positive employment effects, whereas ‘traditional labour market training’ (including classroom training and on-the-job training) has much smaller and often insignificant effects, and ‘direct employment programmes in the public sector’ are rarely effective and often have negative employment effects. Card et al. (2010) do show, however, that these negative effects tend to become smaller when effects are studied over a longer time perspective. Compared to the general findings in the literature, and also compared to the results for newly arrived immigrants in Clausen et al. (2009), our results indicate very large positive ALMP effects for the group of non-western immigrants. This suggests that ALMPs should be applied more extensively for this group than was the case in Denmark during our estimation period. A similar conclusion may apply for other western countries. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting. Section 3 develops the econometric model. Section 4 describes the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 concludes and discusses policy implications.",21
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,06 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-14,The working hours of immigrants in Germany: temporary versus permanent,December 2013,Martin Kahanec,Michael P Shields,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The decision to migrate, whether internal or international, is often viewed as an investment. The costs of migration, which include the physical costs of the move as well as the costs of adjusting to a new location, are incurred in order to earn higher income in the future. When exploring international migration, these adjustment costs have been viewed as the costs of adapting to the labor market in the destination country. A large part of these adjustment costs may be the costs of investing in human capital at the destination, such as becoming more fluent in a language. Decisions regarding migration partly depend on whether the move is viewed to be permanent or temporary. One of the issues concerning temporary migration is that temporary migrants may invest less than permanent ones in human capital that is specific to the host economy. According to the human capital theory and the household production model (Becker (1964, 1965), the shorter the intended stay, the less such investment will be made. An example of this type of investment is learning the language of the host country. Another type of investment that is less likely to occur for temporary migrants involves job training conducted by employers. A free rider problem may be more severe for temporary migrants than for other workers in that firms may be hesitant to invest in job training for temporary migrants because they will lose the benefits of this investment when the migrant returns to the home country. As a corollary of underinvestment in human capital specific for the host country, instead of spending time accumulating specific human capital temporary migrants can be expected to work more hours in order to accumulate savings and invest in financial capital that can be transferred back to their country of origin when they return. In spite of the importance of this implication for migration and integration policy, it has received little attention in the literature. In this paper we will concentrate on the demand for migrants in Germany and the adjustments migrants make when living in Germany. We will explore temporary migration and how temporary migrants differ from permanent migrants in their labor supply decision making and behavior. In the first section we will shed light on temporary migration and review some of the literature on behavioral differences between temporary and permanent migrants. Next, we will develop and discuss a model of temporary migration. Third, we will discuss the data and the estimation procedures to be employed in testing the model. Finally, we will discuss the conclusions implied by these estimates and some implications for policy. Temporary migration differs from permanent migration in terms of the migrant’s attachment to the labor market in the host country. The temporary migrant intends to return to the country of origin. This intention may be reinforced by contract, by immigration laws or it may simply be the intention of the migrant. Temporary migration is a common and growing phenomenon (Dustmann, 2000). Temporary migration exists when the migrant expects to return to the home country and behaves accordingly while in the host country. One type of temporary migration entails temporary residence permits which reinforce the intentions to return. Examples include temporary migration from South Asia and South-East Asia to countries in the Persian Gulf and migration from Eastern Europe to the European Union. However, temporary migration without these temporary residence permits is common in the US and in Europe. Indeed, European migration after the recent EU enlargements is predominantly temporary, at least when judged by migrants’ intentions1. Amin and Mattoo (2005) develop a model where the country receiving immigrants faces a tradeoff between the lower social costs attributed to temporary migrants and external benefits of job training which are higher for permanent migrants. They identify social costs of migration such as the provision of publicly provided services not fully supported by the tax contributions of the migrants. Temporary migrants might have lower social costs in part because they are less likely to move their family with them, thus decreasing the demand for medical, educational and social services. They also might be less of a perceived threat to a society with xenophobic issues. However, permanent migrants may invest more time assimilating to the host country. Furthermore, the skills acquired through on the job training are less likely to be lost for temporary migrants because their probability of return is higher. The authors argue that countries face a commitment problem in that they cannot credibly commit to returning temporary migrants particularly when they receive training by firms. As a result of this commitment problem, host countries restrict migration to a level below the optimum level but have too many permanent migrants. The reduction of these social costs has become a major concern in the migration literature. Social costs can be categorized as economic costs and cultural costs. Much of the attention has focused on economic costs. Chiswick (1978) and Borjas (1987) find that assimilation does occur. Chiswick (1978) argues that gradual cultural assimilation of immigrants in the US has resulted in increased earnings. Furthermore, this assimilation came through personal investment in human capital and not from on the job training provided by firms because firms are reluctant to invest in training immigrants partly because they perceive a higher risk of job mobility. Borjas (1987) argues that the heterogeneity of immigrants is the source of assimilation differences and that immigrants, such as political refugees, who are more attached to the destination are the most likely to assimilate. Since temporary migrants have less attachment to the destination than permanent migrants, we would expect less assimilation. Migration, both temporary and permanent, has had a considerable impact on the economies and cultures of industrialized nations. Germany has perhaps the most experience with assimilating migrants. From 1945 until 1960 about twelve million people of German descent migrated to West Germany2. Because these migrants were forced to move by political changes and their language was German, they were almost entirely permanent migrants and their assimilation was relatively easy. A rapidly expanding economy and a good experience in assimilating migrants resulted in a policy of bringing in new, temporary workers into Germany beginning in the 1950s. These workers were from Southern Europe and Turkey. The vast majority of these workers returned to their home country3. They were replaced by new immigrants, sometimes from the same country. This pattern of migration is called circular migration, which results in a large proportion of workers that are not native born, being temporary instead of permanent migrants. The result of this immigration pattern is that many German immigrants are and continue to be temporary. Temporary migrants may differ from permanent migrants in many predictable ways. First, they may be expected to save more and remit more of their income. For example, Bauer and Sinning (2011) find that permanent migrants in Germany save less that native Germans. This might be because part of what they would save is invested in acquiring human capital that aids in assimilation such as learning German. Temporary migrants, however, make much less of this type of investment. The study finds that their savings were similar to that of natives and, hence, higher than permanent migrants. Their savings might have been higher than the savings of permanent migrants because of a greater desire to accumulate and transfer assets to their home country. Another feature of temporary migration concerns home ownership. Germany has a very low rate of home ownership. According to Constant et al. (2007) only 42% of Germans own their own home compared with about 63% of Americans. Much of this low rate is probably due to the high requirements for down payments on loans in Germany. These requirements can be as high as 40% of the purchase price. Migrants, particularly temporary migrants may be expected to be much less likely to own a home than the population in general. It is not surprising that the home ownership rate for migrants is only 20%. The authors find that migrants classified as having strong cultural attachments to German are much more likely to own their home, even if they also maintain strong attachments to their country of origin. A third feature of temporary migration concerns the response to economic adversity in the destination. An adverse experience with unemployment might shorten the stay of the migrant. This might particularly be the case for migrants who come on a short-term visa. Bellemare (2007) models the dynamics of their behavior. Since migrant workers who experience high unemployment have less time to recoup lost income, their stay becomes undesirable, and they leave sooner than intended. The study points out that this is more likely to occur for unskilled workers because they face higher rates of unemployment. Hence, skilled temporary migrants might be encouraged to stay and unskilled temporary migrants might be encouraged to leave. A fourth feature of temporary migration, which is our primary interest, is that temporary migrants may on average work more hours than permanent migrants. Part of the reason for this higher anticipated number of hours is because they may invest less in becoming assimilated to the local labor market. This assimilation has been studied by Chiswick (1978) who found that in the US, wage rates of migrants and natives converged with time due to early investment in human capital specific to the destination labor market. Most studies have followed Chiswick (1978) in looking at earnings. For Germany, the results are mixed depending upon the design of the study. For example, Dustmann (1993) found a large and persistent earnings gap while Schmidt (1997) finds little initial gap upon accounting for education differences4. Temporary migrants, being less interested in assimilation and more interested in accumulating assets and transferring these assets to the home country, may supply more labor. This hypothesis has received surprisingly little attention. Dustmann (1997) and Dustmann and Schmidt (2001) consider the labor supply of immigrant women. They find that these women, while receiving lower wage rates than native women, are more likely to have a full-time job. We would expect a similar manifestation of behavioral differences between temporary and permanent migrants when we look at the supply of working hours. The hypothesis that temporary migrants supply more hours than their permanent counterparts can be operationalized using a household production model as developed by Becker (1965). In this model the household does not receive direct utility from consuming goods. Instead, the household receives utility from consuming commodities. These commodities are produced using time and goods purchased on the market. The household receives utility from consuming these household produced commodities. The implicit prices of these commodities are derived from the household production functions. These prices will differ with the human capital of the household, other features of the background of household members and, of particular concern here, the location of the household. Household production models have been formally extended to migration decisions by Shields and Shields (1993) and Shields (1995). In these models, the household technology differs by location. These differences are reflected in the implicit prices of commodities consumed. For example, assume the household maximizes the utility of consuming commodities at the two different locations. In other words a migrant maximizes

The person or family is assumed to have already migrated. Hence, all variables refer to future values. In this case, a permanent migrant is at a corner solution where Z

 are both zero. The household technology for producing these commodities depends on the location of the household, its human capital, where this human capital was developed and the strength of its ties to that location. Since the initial human capital of migrants was developed while they were residing in the source country, the human capital is partly specific to the source. Therefore, the implicit price of commodities would be expected to be lower at the source, particularly for recent migrants than at the destination. Consequently, we would expect that the shadow price at the destination exceeds the shadow price at the source. In other words, that
 Furthermore, family ties to the source would be expected to further widen this difference in shadow prices because contacts with these family members may be an important commodity which the household consumes. Temporary migrants can take advantage of this difference in shadow prices. The optimal strategy might well be to temporarily migrate in order to generate savings that can then be transferred to the source when the migrant returns, where the cost of commodities is much lower than at the destination. Consumption would be suppressed at the destination because of its higher costs coupled with the desire to transfer this consumption to the source for future consumption at lower prices. A permanent move would imply higher costs of consumption for a much longer period of time and, even though it may imply higher wage rates, it could be sub-optimal. If the motivation for a move is for higher wages, instead of for political or lifestyle reasons, the wage rate at the destination will exceed the wage rate at the origin, w

. Permanent migration will be preferred to remaining at the source country if real income, evaluated in terms of shadow prices, is higher at the destination. In other words, if:
 Higher wage rates at the destination would have to be large enough to cover higher living costs plus the costs of a move in order for a family to migrate. However, even if inequality (4) holds, the family may still prefer temporary to permanent migration. The difference in shadow prices, equation (3), provides an incentive for temporary migration. A migrant family can earn income at the destination, where income is higher, save and transfer the foregone consumption to the origin where consumption costs are lower. To illustrate the investment nature of temporary migration, consider two time periods. The first period begins at the time the household made the migration decision. This decision involves whether to remain at the origin, to temporarily migrate or to permanently migrate. Consumption in each period is denoted as z1 and z2 in periods 1 and 2. The temporary migrant consumes

 in each period. This framework can be used to characterize the expected lifetime consumption of the household at the time of the migration decision. There are three possible choices. They are not to migrate, to temporarily migrate and to migrate permanently. In making this decision, the family will need to evaluate differences in the shadow prices of commodities with differences in full income. On the simplifying assumption that shadow prices and full income are the same in each period, the choices will amount to selecting different paths of lifetime consumption. Lifetime consumption for households that do not migrate is

 Note that the bracketed terms in (5), (6) and (7) represents savings from the first period used to augment consumption in the second period. Since interest rates and exchange rates will influence the rate of return on savings, they will also influence the temporary versus permanent migration decision. It should be emphasized, however, that exchange rates will not be able to generate parity in the costs of commodity consumption. This is because commodities are non-tradable. They are produced, by the household, from inputs of time and goods. Even if all goods are tradable, time is not. Hence, exchange rates cannot equalize the shadow prices of commodities in the two markets, origin and destination. This is a key difference in emphasis between the household production approach and standard approaches in terms of the costs of buying goods. Exchange rate shocks, however, will still influence household decisions. While using a conventional model, Yang (2008) tests the investment nature of the savings of temporary migration. Yang (2008) argues that exchange rate shocks are a source of transitory income for families with a temporary migrant outside the source country. A deterioration in the value of a source country’s currency with respect to the currency in the destination will increase the value of savings at the destination that can be remitted back to the family in the source. The study found that this windfall had a positive and significant effect on investment, in physical and human capital, at the source but had no significant impact on consumption at the source. This result would also hold for a household production approach because there would be a windfall due to the lower cost of purchasing goods when the migrant returns to the origin. Migrants have choices regarding the types of investment they wish to make upon arriving at their destination. They can invest in human capital specific to the destination. This will increase their rate of assimilation thereby increasing the wage rate they will earn. Permanent migrants are more likely to make this sort of investment. They could alternatively accept a lower wage rate and invest in financial assets that can be transferred if they return to their home country. Temporary migrants are more likely to make this sort of investment. They would suppress the consumption of commodities in the destination and work more hours in order to transfer money for later consumption at the origin. The first type of investment is more attractive to those intending to migrate permanently and the second is more attractive to temporary migrants. Consequently, temporary migrants would be expected to, on average, work more hours than permanent migrants. It is this proposition that we will test in the next section. The German Socioeconomic Panel is the main source of data for this study. It is a household-based study that annually surveys a representative sample of the German population, and has been doing so since 1984. The study includes many socio-economic and demographic variables including variables that can be used to identify the attachment immigrants have to the German labor market. Respondents are asked about their intentions to remain in Germany. Up to and including 1995, respondents were asked if they “planned to return to their native country.” After 1995 respondents were asked if they “wish to remain in Germany permanently.” A dummy variable, permanent, was created (permanent = 0 for those with a desire to either leave Germany or to return to their native country depending upon the phrasing of the question). The hours worked by migrants in a month5 will be estimated as a function of the following variables: permanent (defined above), female (the gender of the person equals 1 if female and 0 otherwise), age, age2, years of schooling (years of formal education), and years since migration. Permanent, as discussed previously is expected to be negatively related to hours worked because temporary migrants will spend less time investing in human capital specific to the German labor market. Age and age2 are related to human capital. Workers initially are expected to work more hours as they become more experienced, accumulate more relevant human capital and become more attractive to employers. Eventually, however, their mental and physical skills may diminish and they either become less able to work or more likely to retire. Consequently, we might expect age to have a positive impact on hours worked and age2 to have a negative impact. The sign of married would be negative if marriage results in at least one spouse having less attachment to the labor market. Years of schooling is also assumed to represent human capital. Since education is thought to be general human capital6, it enhances the migrant’s ability to adapt to changing economic conditions and to more easily maintain steady employment. Hence, years of schooling is expected to have a positive impact on hours worked. Finally, the length of time the migrant has been in Germany, years since migration, is expected to be related to human capital specific to Germany and, hence, positively related to hours worked. Since the data set is a panel, we know the year the questions were asked. We also know the state within Germany in which the person lived in that year. The region and year are both expected to influence hours worked. Furthermore, they are both expected to influence the number of permanent versus temporary migrants. Temporary migrants may be recruited to work in areas and in years when workers are in short supply and leave when they are no longer in high demand. Consequently, the proportion of migrants who are temporary may be higher in years and states with a prosperous economy. Consequently, fixed and random time and state effects need to be considered to correct for possible biases. Another possible source of bias comes from the likelihood that permanent is endogenous. The plans and attitudes of migrants toward remaining in Germany will in part depend upon their success in the German labor force. Those workers who experience difficulty in finding stable employment and thus work fewer hours than they wish may, as a result, become less attached to Germany. Consequently, the endogeneity of permanent could imply that those migrants who indicate that they are temporary work fewer hours. Recall, however, that we expected temporary migrants to supply more labor. Consequently, the endogeneity bias in a model with hours worked on the left hand side and permanent on the right hand side would be in the positive direction. Since we believe the structural direction is negative, we would expect reduced form estimates to be biased toward the null hypothesis or even lead to an incorrect sign. Hence, our main model will attempt to solve the endogeneity problem by introducing an instrumental variable. The instrument we have chosen is whether the household reports family networks in another country. Relatives abroad is a candidate to be an instrument because it is exogenous to the labor market in Germany. The dummy variable, relatives abroad?, reporting the existence of these networks is expected to be negatively related to the attachment an immigrant feels towards Germany. It picks up the existence of relatives living abroad other than mother or father, (ex-spouse, children, siblings or grandparents) with whom the respondent has close contacts7. Those immigrants, for which relatives abroad = 1, are expected to be less attached to Germany for numerous reasons. First, the existence of such a network might indicate an emotional attachment to another country. Second, regardless the strength of this emotional attachment, the existence of such a network provides information about another labor market and perhaps a greater opportunity of a successful move to that market. Note that for these arguments to hold it is not necessary that these relatives live in the country of immigrant’s origin. For the analysis we consider foreign born males (1,542 individuals with 13,477 observations) and females (1,024 individuals with 7,275 observations) with at least 10 and at most 350 hours worked per month, 1.5 to 300 EUR hourly wage, and 16–60 and 16–55 years of age for males and females, respectively. We prudently omit individuals who are very recent arrivals with less than one year since migration, as these might include a large share of temporary seasonal workers and posted professionals. We also disregard individuals with missing information for the considered variables. Table 1 summarizes the key variables. We consider permanent migrants, those that do not want to stay permanently, and those that would like to return within next three years. We observe that hours worked decrease with tenure whereas the wage rate increases with tenure8. These raw results are in line with the theoretical model developed above. Looking at Table 1, we see that permanent migrants in Germany work an average of 159.4 hours per month. The average hours worked per week is then approximately 37. There is considerable variation in hours worked with a monthly standard deviation that is about 50 hours per month. Temporary migrants, on the other hand, work 163.8 hours per month, i.e. 37.8 per week, with a standard deviation of 45.8. Whereas permanent migrants earn 12.3 per hour on average, the corresponding figure for temporary migrants is 12.0. Descriptive statistics hence support the view that temporary migrants supply more hours, and earn less, than permanent ones. Let us now look at the results of the empirical strategy to see whether this finding is robust with respect to the various confounding factors.",8

Currently, estimates show that as many as 89 million women are demographically missing in various Asia-Pacific countries, with China and India jointly accounting for 84 million (UNDP 2010). Moreover, in the developed world which is absolutely more prosperous than the developing world, it is interesting to examine if missing women also exist here (Dubuc and Coleman 2007; Abrevaya 2009; Almond et al. 2009). A concern is that parents preferring sons to daughters may resort to prenatal sex-selection techniques to establish the birth of a son (Hu and Schlosser 2012). One important study in the field shows that sex-selection incentives become more pertinent as a household approaches its own predetermined family size limit, as the opportunity cost of having a child of the less preferred gender increases (Abrevaya 2009). Therefore the predictions are that son-biased gender selection tendencies most likely manifest themselves through abnormally high male-birth likelihoods at later birth parities, when family size limitations start to bite, as well as at births following daughters. This paper extends the scarce literature on missing women in the developed world by investigating whether these two irregularities in male births are present among Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the UK. We also present the determinants of a household’s sex-selection choice. To the best of our knowledge, there has been one important study which examines missing women in the UK (Dubuc and Coleman 2007). However, by employing national birth data, this study does not analyze the underlying causes of sex-selection at the household level by observing the gender composition of previous births. Our study addresses this gap by examining the implied incidence of sex-selection amongst Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the UK, based on data from the General Household Survey 1971–2006. We find higher male-birth likelihoods for Indian families, relative to English families, both at later birth parities and when following the birth of daughters. Moreover, the results suggest that higher levels of education increase the propensity to sex-select. We also provide evidence that a larger family size among Pakistani families potentially mitigates their tendency to sex-select as early as the third parity. One of our main findings for better educated Indian families both in the UK and India is a desire to balance the family after the birth of two sons by having a daughter thereafter. Additionally, this study disentangles the ‘explained’ and ‘unexplained’ components that constitute the average differences in male-birth likelihoods between Indian immigrants and English natives, using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method, and finds that 87% of that difference can be attributed to the effect of ethnicity. Lastly, our study quantifies the number of missing women among Indian immigrants in 1993–2006 and calculates this value as 914.",3
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,19 June 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-9,Skilled migration and the transfer of institutional norms,December 2013,Michel Beine,Khalid Sekkat,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Labor migration is a central feature of the current international economy inducing high attention from both academics and policymakers. The most recent available estimates suggest that by 2000 there were 60 millions migrants (i.e., aged 25 or more) living in the OECD area of which 20 millions are highly skilled migrants (i.e., foreign-born workers with tertiary education). Developing countries are major suppliers of such migration. They accounted for 64.5 percent of total immigrants and 61.6 percent of skilled immigrants in the OECD. This is 15 percentage points higher than in 1990 (Docquier et al., 2007). An intense debate is taking place on the causes and consequences of such a phenomenon. Thanks to the availability of new data sets on migration, a new generation of research is now able to address empirically various aspects of migration. An important part of this literature focuses on skilled migration and brain drain. The recent literature starts pointing to channels through which the brain drain may positively affect the sending economy Docquier and Sekkat (2006). These include a set of “feedback effects” such as remittances, return migration, the creation of business and trade networks, and the effect of migration prospects on education. Remittances often represent a major source of income in developing countries: about $US 150 billion in 2004, roughly the same amount than foreign direct investments and about three times as large as the official development aid (World Bank, 2006). Although the magnitude of return migration is difficult to measure, the fact that migrants accumulate knowledge and financial capital in rich countries before spending the rest of their career in their origin country is also a potential important and positive feedback (Dos Santos and Postel-Vinay, 2003
1996). Prospects of migration can also induce more people to invest in education at home (Mountford, 1997;Stark et al., 1998;Vidal, 1998
2001 and 2008). Moreover, the creation of migrants’ networks can facilitate the movement of goods, factors, and ideas between the migrants’ host and home countries.1 (Rauch and Trindade 2002) have found that ethnic Chinese networks affect trade in differentiated goods. In the same vein, (Docquier and Lodigiani 2006) find that skilled migration has a stimulating effect on FDI. So far, the reported findings deal with the economic impacts of brain drain on the origin country. A very recent strand of the literature is now focusing on the non-economic impacts on the origin country. Such impacts cover a wide range of dimensions including ethnic discrimination (Docquier and Rapoport, 2003), fertility (Beine et al., 2012), corruption (Mariani, 2007) and democracy (Spilimbergo, 2009
2009). The present paper contributes to this literature by focusing on the quality of “market friendly” institutions as measured by Kufmann et al. (1999). These are among the most widely used measures of the quality of institutions. The relevance of such focus is based on the following findings of the literature. First, there is the primary role of the quality of institutions in shaping economic growth. Second, there is a growing evidence that institutions, or at least a part of them, are not frozen but could be changed and that human capital can play an important role in this respect. Finally, the recent literature supports the existence of feedbacks from emigration to the origin country. These aspects are examined in the Section 2. On the light of these findings, we address the three following questions: i) What is the impact of international migration on the quality of institutions in the sending country? ii) Is the level of education of emigrants important for such an impact to take place? and iii) Does a change in the quality of institution in the home country depend on their quality in the host country i.e. is there a transfer of norms? The answer to each of these questions has two components: existence or not of an impact and the sign of the impact. The possibility of a positive or a negative feedback of emigration on the home country’s institutions depends on these two components. For instance, emigration may have a negative impact if individuals that can effectively voice in favor of an improvement in the quality of institutions tend to leave the country. The impact might be positive if the same individuals rely on the liberal climate in the host country in order to advocate for an improvement in the origin country. In a similar vein, the feedback through the transfer of norms can only be positive if the host country benefits from good quality of institutions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the main relevant findings in the literature that motivate the question of the paper. Section 3 presents the econometric methodology, the data, and the construction of the various indicators to be used and discusses their main features. Section 4 focuses on the results and Section 5 concludes.",26

For instance, while about 800,000 migrants entered Germany on average annually between 1962 and 2005, more than 560,000 left (German Federal Statistics Office); Jasso and Rosenzweig (1982) report that of the 1971 cohort of immigrants in the U.S., the fraction that returned by 1979 could be as high as fifty percent; Aydemir and Robinson (2008) calculate an out-migration rate of 35 percent by 20 years of residence for working-age male immigrants in Canada. Immigrants’ return migration behavior, along with their saving decisions in the host country, has important implications for their home countries. McCormick and Wahba (2001) and Demurger and Xu (2011) find that the probability of entrepreneurship among return migrants in Egypt and China, respectively, increases in their accumulated savings in the host destinations. Sinning (2011) report, for immigrants in Germany, that return intentions have a positive effect on financial transfers to home country. Return migrants could benefit their home countries also through the transfer of human capital they acquire in the host country. In fact, Dos Santos and Postel-Vinay (2003) show that return migration can contribute to the source country economy through knowledge diffusion, and Mayr and Peri (2009) find that return migration could turn brain drain into brain gain in the context of intra-European migration. Non-economic benefits of return migration have also been reported in the literature; for instance, Batista and Vicente (2011) find that migrants who return from countries with good governance improve governance in their home countries. Finally, return migration behavior has important implications for the host country as well. For instance, Kırdar (2012) finds that immigrants’ net contributions to the German social security system are substantially influenced by their return migration behavior. This paper examines how purchasing power parity (ppp) and relative wages between the host and source countries influence immigrants’ optimal migration duration in the host country. While some immigrants originate from poor countries, other immigrants come from countries with relatively similar characteristics to those of the host country. For instance, are intra-European immigrants from high wage and low ppp countries or immigrants from developing countries with low wage and high ppp more likely to stay longer? Moreover, while some developing source countries maintain long periods of economic growth, others are hit by occasional economic crisis, which sometimes result in substantial changes in ppp and wage ratio between the host and source countries. For instance, ppp between Germany and Turkey increased by 35 percent in the aftermath of the 1994 financial crisis in Turkey. Using a model of joint consumption and migration duration decisions, I first examine the impact of ppp and relative wages on the optimal migration duration decision of immigrants. Then, in the empirical part of the paper, I test the implications of the theoretical model using a rich longitudinal data set on immigrants from four source countries (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkey) in Germany. The empirical context is appropriate for testing the hypotheses derived from this theoretical model because the empirical literature has provided ample evidence on the savings accumulation motivation for immigrants originating from these Mediterranean countries in Germany. Paine (1974) and Kumcu (1989) report saving rates in excess of 35 percent for Turkish immigrants in their first few years in Germany. The theoretical part of the paper shows that the effect of ppp on optimal migration duration is negative unless the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption is well above the empirically-established levels. However, in the case that immigrants do not plan to work after returning to their home countries – which is empirically relevant in certain contexts, the effect of ppp on optimal migration duration is always negative (regardless of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption). The major contribution of this paper is empirical. While Yang (2006) and Kırdar (2009) uncover empirical evidence on the effect of ppp on return migration rates, this study provides the first empirical evidence, to the best of my knowledge, on the effect of ppp on the migration duration in the host country. The empirical results reveal that the impact of ppp on optimal migration duration is negative and large; for instance, a 10 percent increase in ppp lowers the migration duration of a 20-year-old arriver by 20 percent. This paper also provides an empirical answer for the first time, in the German context, to an important question posed by Stark et al. (1997): is it possible that immigrants from poorer source countries stay shorter in the host country? This is, in fact, the case in the German context; immigrants facing Turkish ppp and relative wage values have a shorter predicted migration duration than immigrants facing the ppp and relative wage values of wealthier EU countries in the sample, when all other characteristics of immigrants are the same. Finally, this study also shows that data on individuals’ revisions to intentions can be valuable. Manski (2004) claims that, “Research that measures revisions to expectations and associates them with observed event realizations can be informative1”. In fact, using revisions to intended migration duration over time, as well as observed event realizations, this study shows that the realizations of ppp values lead to revisions to intended migration duration. Moreover, this finding as to the effect of ppp on migration duration, using data on intentions, is consistent with the findings of Kırdar (2009), who investigates the same relationship using actual realizations of return migration2. The next section reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the theoretical model, and Section 4 explains the data. The estimation method is covered in Section 5, and the empirical results are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.",6
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,29 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-7,Where is the grass greener? A micro-founded model of migration with application to Guangdong,December 2013,Peter Simmons,Yuanyuan Xie,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economic models of migration can be put in a general framework in which each possible location is perceived by an individual to have costs and benefits (Krugman 1992). Migration of an individual occurs when the net gain from changing location exceeds the migration cost. Previous research has identified some key pull factors motivating migration as an expected income gain (Harris and Todaro 1970; Johnson 2003; Todaro 1969), improved employment opportunities (Fan 1996; Greenwood etal. 1986; Zhao 1997), benefits from the infrastructure of an alternative location both economic and cultural infrastructure/amenities (Chen etal. 2008; Docquier and Rapoport 2005), and marriage opportunities (Fan 2002; Fan and Huang 1998; Frutado and Theodoropoulos 2008; Seeborg etal. 2000),. An individual may of course be motivated by more than one of these push-pull factors and different possible locations may provide different mixes of these factors. The economic costs to migration include the immediate transport cost but also other fixed and variable costs in the destination location like education for children (Meyerhoefer and Chen 2011; Plantinga etal. 2012), housing market conditions (Vermeulen-and-Ommeren 2009), regulatory and institutional barriers reflected in national immigration controls and systems of internal administrative control on migration like the hukou in China (Chan and Zhang 1999; Renard et al. 2011; Whalley and Zhang 2007). Typically the costs will vary with destination but, (apart from the immediate transport cost) not with the original location. The combination of all these forces applied to each individual will determine who moves where. In a matching equilibrium, the population distribution between locations and the specific features of different locations are such that no individual has an incentive to move. Matching theory results by Ekeland etal. (2004) and Heckman etal (2002) in particular are relevant to our purpose in which heterogeneous individuals are sorted into different outcomes by a market system which allows for pricing by type of individual. Our approach applies some of the insights of this literature to the migration process, recognising that migration is essentially a disequilibrium event. The aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework1 which allows for a menu of alternative migration pull factors in a geographical domain with multiple possible destinations. Each individual currently resides in a particular location and has to weigh up the alternative menu of factors available in each different location, together with the costs of moving to that location. The outcome is a migration decision for each individual and, aggregating these over individuals in each current location, we derive the net migration flows between locations. Apart from the theoretical insights gained into modelling multiple motives for migration and multiple locations, our second main aim is to use this framework to generate an empirically applicable migration equation system. We then apply this to econometric analysis of intra-province migration patterns in Guangdong, one of the provinces of China with the highest such migration rate. Our main theoretical result is that the interplay of multiple motives and multiple possible destinations for migration will lead to agglomeration. Individuals will typically want to move to a location seen as best for the combinations of its advantages. However individuals already living in such a favoured location, but whose individual circumstances have turned out poorly there, may wish to leave and move to the location offering the second best advantages. Our approach establishes these tendencies in quite a general framework. We add some assumptions to the framework which results in a net migration equation which can be empirically applied in a setting with multiple migration motives and multiple locations. We apply this to intra-province migration in Guangdong for the period 1990–1999 with 18 locations and 4 migration motives. We find that the approach represents the data quite closely and that there is a high degree of preference homogeneity between individuals in different locations. This implies that if moving costs are low, the equilibrium spatial population distribution should yield equality between locations in the factors which cause migration. However this is not the case for all factors, in fact regional inequality has been growing for these despite the high net migration flows. We conclude that spatial equilibrium in Guangdong has not yet been reached. Section 1 briefly reviews existing knowledge of factors causing migration and empirical work on Guangdong, Section 1 develops the theoretical framework, Section 1 describes the data, outlines the econometric strategy and presents the empirical results. Second 5 contains a conclusion.",

2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,18 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-4,On the differential impact of the recent economic downturn on work safety by nativity: the Spanish experience,December 2013,Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes,Cristina Borra,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Migration across national borders generates vigorous political and policy debates that are unlikely to diminish as the share of the world’s population residing in a country other than their country of birth rises. For instance, it is frequently argued that immigrants take jobs that natives do not want, such as more dangerous jobs. This popular belief is consistent with stylized facts for many countries, as well as for Spain, where the immigrant work injury rate, 5.03 percent, is above the 4.20 percent rate of natives (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for details). Yet, it remains unclear how the most recent recession may have impacted differences in work injury and fatality rates by nativity when present. The latter could have widened if immigrants have endured, overall, worse job prospects than natives and/or accepted riskier jobs. Alternatively, the aforementioned gaps could have narrowed if: (a) fear of dismissal and unemployment have reduced immigrants’ reporting behavior to a larger extent than that of natives, (b) workload reductions have been more prominent in sectors with a higher concentration of immigrants, or (c) selection of less accident-prone workers into employment has been more acute among immigrants than natives. We examine work injury and work fatal accident rates among immigrants and natives in Spain over the 2001–2010 decade. We start by investigating whether, after accounting for a variety of factors potentially correlated to immigrants’ higher work injury rates –such as educational attainment, language proficiency, assimilation to the host country or industry and occupation of employment, we observe significant differences in work injury and fatality rates by nativity and region of origin. Unlike previous studies, we include data on legal as well as undocumented immigrants during an interesting decade that encompasses the immigration boom experienced from 2000 through 2008, as well as the most recent recession. Subsequently, we examine how the economic downturn has impacted work injury and fatality rates by nativity and region of origin, paying close attention at its likely determinants. The focus on Spain is of special relevance given the purpose of the study and the time period being examined. During the 2001–2010 decade, Spain displayed one of the largest rates of immigration in the world –three to four times as large as the average immigration rate in the United States between 2000 and 2008. Just between 2003 and 2008, the foreign-born population four-folded and, by 2010, twelve percent of Spanish residents had a foreign nationality and 14 percent were foreign-born (Vasileva 2011).1 The large and rapid inflow of immigrants may have resulted in significant disparities in work safety by nativity for numerous reasons –such as immigrants’ lack of awareness of job risks, their need to get a job upon their immediate arrival, or their greater willingness to take on a riskier job (relative to natives) in exchange for a higher pay. Furthermore, Spain is one of the recent immigrant-receiving economies most hard hit by the latest recession. Unemployment rates have climbed to double-digits and currently hovered around 25 percent. Some risk prone industries with a higher concentration of immigrant workers, such as construction, have particularly suffered. Workload reductions, workforce composition biases and the pressure felt by more vulnerable and uninformed workers to misreport work injuries in order to avoid dismissal could have impacted work injury rates differently by nativity. Thus, Spain offers the ideal scenario to examine work injury and fatality gaps by nativity, as well as their evolution following the recent economic crisis. This article is structured as follows. In the next section, we review the literature on work injuries and fatalities, focusing our attention on studies investigating differences by nativity or over the economic cycle. In section 3, we provide some background information on immigration to Spain and on the regulation of work injury and fatality rates in the country. Section 4 discusses the data and provides some interesting descriptive statistics on the evolution of work injury and fatality rates by nativity in Spain over the past decade. We then describe the methodology and discuss our findings in sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, section 7 concludes the study with a summary of our findings and some closing remarks.",4
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,05 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-3,Ethnic disparities in higher education,December 2013,Aslan Zorlu,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ethnic disparities in higher education have received little attention in European studies from scholars from any discipline, in contrast to an overall ethnic gap in educational attainment Chiswick and DebBurman, (2004); Van Ours and Veenman, (2003); Nielsen et al., (2003); Riphahn, (2003); Gang and Zimmermann, 2000). Most research has stressed educational achievement of ethnic minorities in lower segments of the education system, especially on the level of secondary school Colding (2006); Colding et al., (2009); Kalmijn and Kraaykamp, (2003). However, there is good reason to assess degree achievement of ethnic minorities in higher education. Recent studies show that ethnic minorities leave the education system relatively early in the Netherlands (Herman et al. 2007). Only a small percentage of young people from ethnic minorities continue their education in colleges and universities, although this percentage is steadily growing. Still, a relatively high portion of ethnic minority students do not finish their course of study compared to Dutch students Bijl et al. (2005). Although higher education increasingly gains importance, little is known about the performance of ethnic minority students in higher education. The lack of attention is likely related to a small number of students from disadvantaged minority groups in higher education. Correspondingly, survey data used in these studies include a small number of ethnic minority students which is hard to analyze statistically. In the European context, there is little attention to ethnic differences in the degree performance of native and ethnic minority students. In a study on ethnic minorities’ achievement in the UK higher education system, (Leslie 2005) attributes the weaker degree results of ethnic minority students to their lower prior-qualifications and the choice of subjects associated with a low probability of degree achievement. In contrast to Europe, educational disparities for racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have received much more attention Strayhorn, (2010); Warikoo and Carter, (2009); Arbona and Nora, (2007); Kao and Thompson, (2003). This paper addresses ethnic disparities in the achievement of students in the Dutch university education (WO) and high vocational education (HBO). Theoretically, the degree performance of ethnic minority students can be either higher or lower than native Dutch students. This will be lower if ethnic minority students face particular difficulties to attend the higher education. Such difficulties can arise from parental socioeconomic disadvantages or from social exclusion by institutions. Parents of ethnic minority students are relatively low-educated, and they have lower earnings and higher unemployment and welfare dependency compared with the native Dutch population Zorlu and Hartog, (2012). Studies on the educational achievement of ethnic minorities have led to a consensus among social scientists that socioeconomic background, often approximated by the education level and income of parents, plays an important role in predicting ethnic and racial disparity in schooling performance Cameron and Heckman, (2001); van Ours and Veenman, (2003); Schnepf, (2007); Herman et al. (2007). Alternatively, the degree performance of ethnic minority students will be higher if ethnic minority students are a selective group of most able students who were successful in overcoming all obstacles in their earlier educational achievements. Such a positive selection can arise when only a small portion of pupils from a large potential pupil population, who are qualified for higher education, tends to go on into higher education. This is more relevant for minority ethnic students from non-western countries, compared to Dutch students who more often continue to attend higher education. If this type of positive selectivity for ethnic minority students is at work, these students will complete their study more likely than Dutch students who face less difficulty in educational upward mobility. This paper contributes to the literature by examining differences in degree achievement between ethnic minorities and Dutch in the Netherlands higher education. Using unique administrative data of the entire 1996 intake cohort in 2005, we consider effects of the pre-higher education qualifications, choice of study track and subject, and parental background. Data include information about the educational career of students who enrolled in a higher education institution in 1996 during 10 years, from 1996 through 2005. We apply parametric duration models to examine degree achievement across the major ethnic groups in the Netherlands. Administrative data provide accurate information about pre-college education, students’ formal involvement in the higher education system, their degree achievement within ten years and parental labor market status but data do not include attitudinal variables and a measure of ability that can potentially affect the performance. We deal with this problem by accounting for unobserved individual heterogeneity in data. The results of this study can be informative for policy makers and scholars. A relatively high achievement of ethnic minority students can be seen as an early indication for social and economic integration while a low performance may be regarded as persistence of ethnic disadvantages. In addition, it is often argued that ethnic minority graduates from most disadvantaged groups would serve as an example for other ethnic minority pupils. The Dutch higher education system is organized as a binary system (in the German style): higher vocational colleges (HBO; Hogere BeroepsOnderwijs in Dutch; literally translated: higher vocational education) and scientific education (WO; Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs in Dutch; literally translated: scientific education), as illustrated by Figure 1. The fundamental difference between these two tracks is the curriculum offered by these institutions, not fields of science: the HBO institutions provide higher professional education in applied sciences, while the WO institutions (universities) conduct scientific research and provide scientific education and academic training. The WO track includes both the social sciences and the humanities. 
Main flows in the Dutch educational system.
 In the Netherlands, university-level training is provided by fourteen public universities (of which one offers only distance learning), which are publicly funded. There is only one private university which specializes in management courses. In 2000, there were about 55 HBO institutions, of which about 90%, are also publicly funded Rijken et al., (2007). It is important to note that the Dutch higher education system is strongly dominated by publicly funded colleges and universities which is a crucial difference from the US higher education system. The HBO programs are practically-oriented, not research-oriented. HBO institutions offer a wide range of programs, many of which in other countries are offered by universities, such as teacher training, management programs, journalism etc. In line with the orientation, the entry requirement conditions for access are different for the HBO and WO (see Figure 1). Candidates for the WO are required to have a certificate from pre-university education (VWO, Voorbereidend Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs; literally translated: preparatory scientific education) or to have a completed the first year of an HBO program, while the minimum requirement for access to HBO programs is either a certificate from senior general secondary education (HAVO, Hoger Algemeen Voortgezet Onderwijs; literally translated: higher general continued education) or a level-4 diploma from the senior secondary vocational education program (MBO, Middelbaar BeroepsOnderwijs; literally translated: intermediate vocational education). In addition, higher education institutions can impose supplementary requirements regarding some specific skills and talent, or fitness for profession. Generally, all students with a high school degree have access to higher education. The Dutch education system was different from the Anglo-Saxon Bachelor-Master type until the 2002/2003 when the higher education system in the Netherlands was organized as Bachelor-Master structure in the framework of the harmonization of educational systems in the European Union, regulated by the Bologna agreement (1999). For new entrants since September 2002, the new system has been applied. The most relevant implication of this new system is for WO programs. Universities now offer bachelor programs of three years and master programs of one or two years in the second phase, similar to the American system. Before this new structure, both study types formally lasted 4 years. Completion of any university degree led to the doctorandus (Drs.) degree which was comparable to a master of science degree (MA) in the United States while HBO students received a different level of degree which was equivalent to a Bachelor degree. Note that Dutch universities did not offer a separate bachelor degree. The educational path through universities led directly to a MA degree. These two tracks are linked in two ways. First, a student satisfying HBO entry requirements can first complete the first year of a HBO program and may then switch to a closely related program at a university. Alternatively, students can first complete a HBO-degree and subsequently start with a university program. Since our data are on the entrants in 1996 only, for this study, the old higher education system applies. It is of particular importance for this investigation that the formal duration of study is 4 years. However, some earlier graduations can not be excluded since any (unobserved) compensation for earlier training can shorten this formal period. Labor market prospects of students following either educational track are often different although there are many overlaps regarding jobs and occupations. University graduates are usually expected to perform more complex and abstract and theoretical tasks while HBO graduates are supposed to perform more executive tasks. In the Dutch higher education system, the role of income is less pronounced because of the relatively low tuition fees, and the rather generous system of student support. Regular full-time students are eligible for publicly provided student support for the nominal duration of a higher education program. It is also worth noting that quality differences between educational institutions providing similar level of education are likely to be considerably lower in the Netherlands than in the US. Most students choose their educational institutions on the basis of geographical distance and availability of desired subject rather than the academic reputation of the institution. This study decomposes ethnic minority students in the Netherlands higher education into four major groups taking into account parental immigration history and socioeconomic position of these students and their own educational attainment1. The first group includes students from Turkish and Moroccan origin (Mediterranean). The second group comprises students from Suriname and the Dutch Antilles, (Caribbean). The third group is an aggregate of students from other non-western countries (ONW) which is a heterogeneous group. The fourth group covers students originating from western countries (Western). The first Turkish and Moroccan immigrants came to the Netherlands as guest workers in the 1960s while immigration flows from Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles have been derived from colonial relations. Immigration from Western countries has been related to economic conditions. The category ‘other non-western’ covers a variety of more recent immigrants from developing countries who frequently entered as asylum seekers or family migrants. This historical background reflects the socioeconomic position of these groups and their cultural distance from the host society. Caribbean migrants often speak Dutch and adopt cultural norms similar to those of the Dutch through their colonial relations. Their labor-market position is somewhat less favorable than that of the native Dutch. In contrast, the predominantly Muslim Mediterranean migrants are frequently less well educated, hardly ever speak Dutch prior to immigration, and have a greater cultural distance from the Dutch. There is some empirical evidence that these migrants face significant difficulties in the Dutch education system, labor and housing markets. They have a high drop-out rate in education, they are frequently unemployed and they are concentrated at the bottom of the occupational distribution. It should be noted that a large portion of ethnic minority students were born in the Netherlands or immigrated at young ages and passed through primary and secondary education in the Netherlands. This implies that these students, different than their parents, have been exposed to mainstream norms and values in the Dutch society. Only a small share of ethnic minority students possibly came for study. Also these students should satisfy standard entry-requirements of higher education, including language. These entry conditions ensure that students will not face basic language problems and they will not lack relevant information. So, any differences in performance of the groups distinguished will reflect ethnic disparity. Such disparities can stem from many sources, such as motivation, ability, wrong choice of study/institution and social class. In contrast to Europe, racial and ethnic disparities in US higher education have received considerable empirical and theoretical attention. American research has documented a significant achievement gap between less-advantaged groups such as African Americans, Hispanics and native Americans and more advantaged groups such as whites and Asian Americans although this gap has narrowed in general over the last three decades Kao and Thompson (2003). Much of the discussion of minorities’ educational achievement follows three main arguments. The first argument credits the structural position of ethnic groups, emphasizing immigration history and the skills immigrants brought with them. The impact of the structural position of an ethnic group is conventionally approximated by variables measuring parental socioeconomic status. The structural position of ethnic groups in society often has implications for the quality of pre-college qualifications and the choice of study subject and institution Arbona and Nora, (2007); Leslie, (2005). Students from less-advantaged minority groups are likely to be less well qualified for higher education and they tend to choose more likely colleges rather than universities which are more prestigious than colleges. In addition, these students often prefer certain study subjects, such as law, business and medicine that are regarded as prestigious in their own ethnic community and that are supposed to provide higher income. In the Netherlands, access to higher education is conditional on the completion of pre-determined secondary education, no entrance examination is needed. Financial constraints play hardly any role in determining student transit to the higher education which may be more relevant for less advantaged ethnic minority groups. The second line of argument emphasizes the role of structural and cultural constraints implicit in society that generate educational disparities for disadvantaged minorities Strayhorn, (2010). Students from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to come from disadvantaged families and are thought to lack the relevant social and cultural capital necessary for success in college. Social capital refers to productive relationships or networks that provide access to opportunity or lead to favorable outcomes Coleman, (1988). Cultural capital refers to high-status linguistic and cultural competences like value, preferences and tastes that are inherited from parents, peers and other institutional agents Strayhorn, (2010); Stanton-Salazar, (1997). Deficiency in the proficiency of majority language within a minority group is likely to be an important source of a low level of cultural capital. Students from developing non-western countries, especially Mediterranean students, potentially comprise such a minority group possessing less social and cultural capital owing to their less-advantaged position within Dutch society. A low level of social and cultural capital is associated with a greater cultural distance from the host society, which will potentially hamper establishing relevant connections with individual and collective agents who serve as translators and mediators of dominant cultural values (Bourdieu, 1986; Stanton-Salazar, (1997). Collective cultural agents refer to academic programs, informal peer groups, cultural centers and student organizations while individual agents refer to faculty administrators, staff and other students. (Museus and Quaye (1999) draw attention at the significant role of staff from racial/ethnic minority groups on campuses in bridging social and cultural gap between students and institutions as well as the awareness of college educators regardless of their race and ethnicity about the cultural challenges that minority students face. They show that persistence of racial/ethnic minority students is positively correlated with the extent and intensity of students’ connections with cultural agents who share common cultural background with these students. The third line of research proposes a model in which the quality of the match between the student and the institution plays a central role in explaining student persistence in colleges Arbona and Nora, (2007); Light and Strayer, 2000; Nora and Cabrera, (1996). The quality of student-institution match will vary for minority students if some institutions provide minority-unfriendly social environment while other institutions will offer facilities to meet the specific needs of minority students such as language support, additional supervising and a platform for mutual support among ethnic minority students. Our data include information neither about differences in ethnic-group specific facilities between higher education institutions nor for the quality of student-institution match. Nevertheless, we are able to control for differences in potential effect of institutions on the degree performance in the regression analysis, so that these differences will not affect our estimates of ethnic disparities. The analysis uses the Central Register of Higher Education (CRIHO) which includes information about the subject of study, type of education (vocational college -HBO, or university -WO), institution of study, and month and year of graduation, in addition to basic personal characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity. In addition, the study uses data about parental economic position in 1999 which comes from the Social Statistical Database (SSB). The SSB includes variables measuring relevant labor market characteristics of the parents (employment, benefits and taxable income). Both data-sets are derived from individual register data ensuring a high quality of measurement. We selected the entire cohort of students in the CRIHO who started in the Dutch higher education system for the first time in 1996, and look at their position in 2005 to determine whether they successfully completed their study. The CRIHO also includes the year of the diploma and the effective enrolment in the higher education so that the duration of study can be calculated in terms of the number of months. Detailed information about students during 10 years from the beginning allows us to identify whether a student changed subject or graduated between 1999 and 2005. Table 1 shows the covariates used in the analysis and their mean values by ethnic background. Registers distinguish ethnic minority students on the basis of their country of birth and the country of birth of their parents. To be able to conduct statistical analyses, we cluster ethnic minorities into four major ethnic groups that are most homogenous in the Dutch society regarding their proficiency of the Dutch language and their socio economic position. The ethnic groups differ significantly regarding their characteristics and performance. The majority of the ethnic minority students are second generation: they were born in the Netherlands or immigrated before they were six years old. There is a relatively lower percentage of second generation Caribbean students then might be expected, when compared to first generation students. This is possibly related to the fact that the Netherlands attracts a large cohort of first generation Caribbean students, who come explicitly for higher education. The lower percentage of second generation students from non-Western countries might be a reflection of their short immigration history in the Netherlands. Interestingly, the majority of Mediterranean students are male while other groups are mainly composed of female students. The male-biased gender composition of Mediterranean students is likely related to a less favorable position of women in Muslim communities and the skewed-gender balance of the Mediterranean population in the Netherlands owing to immigration flows of predominantly male laborers from Turkey and Morocco in the 1960s and 1970s. This group is also older than the other students, which is an indication of a longer duration of pre-college education among Mediterranean students. Considering the student performance by ethnic group ten years after starting in higher education, there are great differences. A large share of students started with HBO and graduated in HBO, while a relatively small share of these students graduated in WO. Although this pattern holds for all ethnic groups, there are interethnic differences. Mediterranean and Caribbean students are more likely to enroll in HBO and more likely to switch to WO while Western students are more likely to choose a study in WO. In general, a study in WO takes longer than a HBO-study. Remarkably, Mediterranean and Caribbean students seem not to benefit from their choice of a relatively short lasting study period. They are also less likely to finish their study compared to the Dutch students. After ten years, about 40 percent of them had not graduated compared with 22 percent of Dutch students, and these may be called dropouts. The choice of a HBO or WO study is often predetermined by preliminary training as described above. Mediterranean students have more frequently an MBO preliminary training, attend high vocational education (HBO) and switch to university education (WO). The choice of study subject also differs across ethnic groups. A large share of Mediterranean, Caribbean and ONW students prefer a study in business, economics and law. These non-western groups also have the most disadvantaged parents. Their parents are less likely to be employed, are more likely dependent on welfare benefits and their labor income is the lowest when they are employed. Caribbean students are usually from a small household consisting of a single parent while Mediterranean students are most likely to be from a household in which the number of children is the biggest. The parents of Dutch and Mediterranean students are most likely to be together. For 41 percent of Caribbean students, the father is not present. To identify ethnic differences in student performance in the Dutch higher education, we use non-parametric and parametric survival analyses. Survival models are suitable to simultaneously capture the conditional likelihood of the completion of a degree and the duration of program, rather than frequently employed conventional logit models which consider only the likelihood of a binary outcome, e.g. completion of a degree versus not-completion or persistence versus drop-out. In order to describe the duration pattern of study and dropout rate, we start with estimating non-parametric survival models (Kaplan-Meier) for the ethnic groups for the separate study types: HBO and WO. Figure 2a and 2b indicate that HBO-students graduate quicker than WO-students. However, after ten years a larger share of WO-students has graduated compared with HBO-students. The probability of graduation significantly decreases with time for HBO-students, especially after 60 months, while this remains relatively high for WO-students. In both study types, the performance of Dutch students is the highest. They are followed by Western students, and ONW. Caribbean and Mediterranean students are most likely to drop out and need more time to finish the study. 
a. Non-parametric (Kaplan-Meier) survival models for the completion of a degree in vocational colleges (HBO) by ethnic group. b. Non-parametric (Kaplan-Meier) survival models for the completion of a degree in universities (WO) by ethnic group. The time taken to complete the course of study is given as a continuous random variable, T: and the density and the cumulative distribution functions of T are given by f ( t) and F ( t) =P (T ≤t). The survival function is defined as S(t) = P(T ≻ t) = 1 − F(t)and the hazard function as h ( t) = f ( t) / S ( t), which is the conditional probability of finishing the study. We model the duration of study as a parametric survival model which is akin to ordinary linear regression Gutierrez, (2002); Hougaard, (1995). Our initial non-parametric analysis of the data shows smooth and well-behaving survival functions. Thus a parametric model can be expected to fit the data adequately. In addition, a parametric model can be checked relatively easily Lambert et al., (2004). In contrast to proportional hazard models, in the accelerated failure time models, the covariates directly affect the log failure time, rather than the hazard function. In this model, the logarithm of the survival time is given as a linear function of the covariates (x

i
). The parametric hazard model is given as: where β is a vector of coefficients to be estimated and ε

i
 is the error term. In this parametric model, the distributional form of the error term needs to be predetermined to estimate the parameters. This form determines the regression model. The investigation of the underlying distribution shows that a generalized gamma regression model fits our data best. To select the best fitting model, we fitted parametric models with exponential, log-logistic, log normal and gamma distribution separately. Subsequently, we conducted post-estimation tests such as likelihood ratio and Wald tests as well as Akaike information criteria (AIC) Lambert et al., (2004; Gutierrez, (2002). The generalized gamma distribution has one scale parameter (μ) and two shape parameters (k and σ). The density function for the generalized gamma distribution is given as where γ = |κ|− 2, ε = sign(κ){ln(t) − μ}/σ and u = γ exp(|κ|ε). The hazard function of the generalized gamma distribution is extremely flexible, allowing a large number of shapes. For instance: when the shape parameter k= 0, the density function reduces to the standard normal distribution for ε. When the shape parameter kappa equals 1 (k= 1), it reduces to the standard extreme-value distribution. If k= 1 and σ= 1, then t has an exponential distribution as a special case of the Weibull distribution, etc. Model (2) will not provide consistent estimates if there are unobserved students’ characteristics that affect the hazard of graduation. To address individual heterogeneity, we consider a frailty model for students of HBO and WO, as described by (Gutierrez 2002) and (Hougaard 1995). A frailty model considers an unobservable multiplicative effect k on the hazard, so that conditional on the frailty: where k is some positive quantity assumed to have mean one and variance θ. Individuals having k ≻ 1 will have an increased risk of finishing their study for reasons which can not be explained by the covariates. Individuals with k ≺ 1 will survive longer for reasons that are unobserved. The survival function can be written as: Since k is not observed, it must be integrated out of (4). When k is assumed to be distributed as an inverse Gaussian, the population survival function becomes: We start with estimating separate duration models for students who started with HBO and WO acknowledging a distinct pattern of performance of HBO and WO students as shown by Figure 2. For both groups, we estimate two models: the first model (basic model) includes individual demographic variables and the subject of study. The second model (extended model) includes additional variables which measure the socio-economic position of both parents. This strategy is applied to isolate the impact of parental background, because immigrant background is strongly correlated with socio-economic position. In view of the well-established correlation between educational achievement and parental socio-economic position, it would be informative to identify the influence of parental background on student performance in higher education. Subsequently, we account for unobserved heterogeneities in the population that may affect the size of the ethnic performance gap, since available variables are unlikely to capture all relevant factors affecting individual study performance. Therefore, we estimate a similar model with a component for unobserved heterogeneity assuming an inverse Gaussian frailty structure, as described by (3). The parameter estimates of separate duration models for students who started with HBO and WO are presented in Table 2. The estimated coefficients are given in an accelerated failure time metric, which adjusts survival functions for the effects of covariates. For the sake of interpretation, we sometimes interchangeably use the term likelihood, instead of hazard which refers to conditional likelihood as discussed above. Ethnic groups from non-western origins (Mediterranean, Caribbeans, other non-western) have a significant lower likelihood of graduation compared with Dutch students (the reference group). Western students perform better than non-western, but they still have a lower likelihood than Dutch students. A comparison of the basic and extended models for HBO (the first and second columns), as well as for WO (the third and fourth columns), indicates that including parental background variables leads to only modest decline in the ethnic performance gap, especially for HBO. Parental socioeconomic position has no effect on the performance gap between Dutch and Mediterranean students in WO. So, the estimated ethnic performance gaps referring to a lower likelihood of graduation are robust to differences in parental socio-economic position. Since institutional environment is evidenced to be influential for students’ performance, we account for differences between the institutions by correcting standard errors for clustering in institutions2. The subject of study appears to be important. Among HBO studies, a study in natural sciences lasts much longer compared with social sciences (the reference category) while a study in health & social services needs less time. Among WO studies, the likelihood of graduation is significantly higher for educational studies while the likelihood for humanities is lower. Students whose parents are together have a higher likelihood of graduation given the number of children in the household, compared to the reference category: parents are alive but not together. The impact of parents’ economic position on performance is limited. If the mother is on social welfare or a house-wife, the student is less likely to graduate compared to students with an employed mother (the reference). Fathers’ economic position has, however, no significant effect on a child’s study performance. Furthermore, switching form a HBO study to a WO study appears to need more time while the opposite does not hold, as expected. After considering the differences between HBO and WO studies, we aim now to estimate general ethnic performance gaps in the Dutch higher education pooling both student populations. Using controls for HBO and WO-studies, we estimate a parametric duration model with an unobserved heterogeneity component based on the pooled population in addition to a basic parametric duration model. A comparison of the model with and without frailty suggests that ethnic performance gaps become slightly smaller after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity but remain statistically significant (see Table 3). The estimated parameters for ethnic minority groups are less informative when hazards over time are considered. To see the shape of the hazard functions, we plot the hazard functions for HBO and WO by gender and ethnicity, based on the extended conditional frailty model for the pooled population. Since the largest ethnic disparities are found for Mediterranean and Caribbean students, we consider the hazard of graduation for these groups in comparison with Dutch students. Figures 3a-3d show the hazard functions for HBO and WO by gender and ethnic origin. It immediately appears that there are marked differences in the shape of the hazard functions of Mediterranean and Caribbean students on the one hand, and Dutch students on the other hand, both in HBO and in WO. Within each sub-category, the hazard of Mediterranean students lies systematically below the hazard functions of Dutch students. The differences in the hazard rates are more pronounced for the slightly different periods for WO and HBO: between the 30th and the 60th month for HBO, and between the 30th month and the 70th month for WO. More specifically, Figure 3a and 3b show that the hazard of graduation is significantly higher for Dutch women than that of Mediterranean and Caribbean women. Figure 3c and 3d reflect similar disparities for Mediterranean and Caribbean men, compared with Dutch men. Furthermore, there are obvious differences between the hazard of graduation of men and women as well as between the hazard of graduation of students in HBO and WO studies. Female students have a hazard function rising steeper than male students’ hazard function, and the hazard function of HBO -students is much steeper than that of WO, indicating higher hazards of graduation for women and HBO-students, as discussed before.

Hazard functions for the completion of a degree in vocational colleges (HBO) from selected ethnic groups; men. d. Hazard functions for the completion of a degree in universities (WO) from selected ethnic groups; men. Since the share of ethnic minorities is small in the student population, background characteristics of Dutch students may dominate estimates. To verify the impact of variables within ethnic groups, we estimate separate parametric duration models for Mediterranean, Caribbean and Western in addition to Dutch. For each ethnic group, we estimate a model without correction for unobserved heterogeneity (Without) and another model with correction for unobserved heterogeneity (With UH), except for Caribbeans for whom a frailty model does not converge. Taking into account unobserved heterogeneity does not lead to large shifts in parameter estimates. The models with correction for unobserved heterogeneity generate only slightly different coefficients. From a comparison of these two models for other ethnic groups, we can assess, however that possible biases due to unobserved heterogeneity would be modest. Female students have a higher hazard of graduation for all ethnic groups but the gender difference is the largest for Dutch and Western students. Second generation ethnic minority students also have a higher hazard of graduation. Strikingly, the choice of study subject has little relevance for ethnic minority students. Mediterranean students attending a study in natural sciences, and Caribbean and Western students attending health and social services have a higher hazard of graduation than those who study a course in social sciences. Their high concentration in economic studies and law has little to do with their low performance. For Dutch students, the study subject is more often a predictor of study performance. Those who study humanities, education and social sciences have a lower performance than other Dutch students who have chosen a course in social sciences. Also the impact of parental background has little importance for the performance of Mediterranean and Caribbean students (Table 4).",4
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,04 March 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-2-2,Skills or culture? An analysis of the decision to work by immigrant women in Italy,December 2013,Antonio Accetturo,Luigi Infante,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The immigrant labor force makes an essential contribution to the growth and development of most of the industrialised countries. At the beginning of the 2000s, 85 million people residing in the OECD countries had been born abroad, almost three times more than in the 1960s. The share of immigrants over total population is quite high for economically advanced countries and it ranges from 6 per cent in Italy to almost 25 per cent in Canada. In many European countries, characterised by a rapidly aging population, the economic integration of immigrants is a necessary condition for the achievement of the Lisbon targets of full employment and sustainable growth under the European Employment Strategy. However, although labor market integration for immigrant men is not generally an issue, employment rates for women are often low and characterised by great variability according to country of origin. There are two possible explanations for this fact. The first is based on “cultural bias”. For certain nationalities, gender differences in the division of the family burden may play an important role in the labor supply. In other words, traditions may relegate women to the more traditional roles and tasks of housekeeping and child-raising. The second is a skill mismatch on the labor market. In this case, immigrants are willing to work outside the family but their human capital does not satisfy local employers’ requirements. The aim of this paper is to disentangle these two effects by assessing the impact of cultural background on women’s decision to participate in the labor market. In particular, we investigate whether the observed high variability in the employment and activity rates across nationalities is attributable to a cultural or a skill effect by estimating individual reservation wages. We make use of an extremely rich database compiled by the non-governmental organization Iniziative e Studi sulla Multietnicità - ISMU (Initiatives and Studies on Multiethnic Society) from surveys of immigrants from the least developed, emerging and transition countries now resident in the region of Lombardy in the North-West of Italy. The fact that the interviews are collected in the same (relatively small) area of Italy is particularly useful for our analysis. Interviewees should face the same labor market conditions; moreover, given Italy’s recent tradition in immigration, they are most likely to preserve their cultural attitudes with respect to labor market participation. The integration of immigrant women in the labor market is particularly important for policy making. If the cultural bias explanation were true, the best response for a policy maker willing to raise the labor market participation would be focusing on the borders: visas should be issued mainly to the nationalities that are more willing to participate in the labor market. In the case of skill mismatch, instead, the policy options are more complex and may range from selective migration for immigrants whose characteristics are more compatible with the host country’s needs to labor market policies aimed at educating and training workers to help them become more suited to local labor market requirements. This paper relates to the very large literature on the assimilation of immigrants in the host labor markets. This literature aims at establishing two main facts: whether there is a gap in the labor market performances (in terms of wages, employment opportunities etc.) between natives and immigrants and how these evolve over time 1. Using German data Constant and Massey (2003) find that an assimilation process is at work: once in the host country, immigrants tend to start a process of human capital accumulation that reduce the gap with respect to natives; the authors, however, also highlight a significant disparity in wages between genders. In the UK, Clark and Lindley (2006) find a relevant heterogeneity among ethnic groups: non-white immigrants show a lower dynamics in wages compared with white immigrants. For Spain, Amuedo-Dorantes and de la Rica (2006) report a significant difference in the probability to be employed for immigrants: the employment gap is even larger when gender is accounted for, along with immigrants’ origin. However, the assimilation of immigrants has also relevant non-economic aspects. Bisin et al. (2008) show that Muslims integrate less with respect to non-Muslims in UK, a feature that appears to be smoothed, but still significant, in second-generation immigrants. The role of culture has been particularly underlined in the analysis of economic assimilation of immigrant women. Compared with the native group, many studies (Dustmann and Schmidt, 2000
; Constant et al., 2006
; Bevelander and Groeneveld, 2007
; Dustmann and Fabbri, 2005
; Adsera and Chiswick, 2007) find that the probability to work for an immigrant woman is significantly lower even after controlling for observable characteristics. This is generally attributed to an unbalanced family burden and a cultural bias. Moreover, as Dustmann and Schmidt (2000) point out, the same motives also prevent women from accumulating human capital. By using the British Time Use Survey, Zaiceva and Zimmermann (2007) obtained a similar result for the UK and showed that non-white females usually spent more time in “traditional” duties such as religious activities and food management than white females. The poor labor market outcomes by foreign women is usually attributed to culture or religion. For the US, Fernandez and Fogli (2009) find that intergenerational transmission of cultural attitudes helps to explain the low contribution to the labor forces by second generation immigrant women. Vella (1994) obtains a similar result for educational choices. Heineck (2004) confirms the influence of religion, finding that the frequent attendance of places of worship reduces female participation in the labor market in Germany. This paper aims at contributing to the literature on the effects of culture on the economic performance of immigrant women. However, compared with the previous literature, we aim at disentangling between demand (skill) and supply (cultural) components in the decision to participate in the labor market. This is a novelty since most of the existing papers just correlate the immigrant’s cultural attitude to the labor market performance. Our results show that culture has a low impact on the decision to work by immigrant women in Lombardy. Low activity and employment rates for certain national groups (mainly those from North African, the Middle East and central Asian) are involuntary since their estimated reservation wages are no greater than those of nationalities characterised by higher employment levels (for example, Central and Eastern Europeans) 2. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the ISMU dataset and shows some of the descriptive statistics; Section 3 explains the most relevant econometric issues; Section 4 presents the results; Section 5 concludes the paper. Appendix 1 shows how countries of origin are aggregated into clusters of nations while Appendix 2 presents a comparison between our estimated reservation wages and labor Force Survey (LFS) data.",141

After several crises, and therefore high poverty, unemployment, and few economic prospects, the emigration rate increased strongly since the end of the 1980s. Destination countries are the United States and Europe, especially Spain. Current emigration from Ecuador is mostly illegal and therefore expensive and permanent. A migrant has to pay to a facilitator between US$ 10,000 and US$ 14,000 to travel to the United States (Soruco et al. (
2008
)). Often the whole family takes a loan to finance migration, and first remittances are often used for repaying these loans. Main motivation for most of the Ecuadorian migrants is thus not the prospect of a better life in another country, but the possibility to provide financial support for relatives in the home country (Pew Hispanic Center and Benedixen and Associates (
2003
)). Migration and migrants’ remittances take an important position in the economy of Ecuador. In 2006, remittances account for 7 percent of GDP. The inflows have the potential to reduce poverty, liquidity constraints, and income volatility. Moreover, they can increase household expenditures on education and health, categories which are considered as especially important for economic development. Women form an increasing part of the migratory movement, whether as migrants, who send remittances, or as head of the households, who receive international transfers. The impact of remittances depends mainly on their use, and the literature suggests gender‐specific preferences in the use of income. The aim of this study is to examine, whether remittances‐receiving households have higher expenditures on education and health, and how this relationship is affected by female bargaining power. To this end, we evaluate the impact of (i) remittances on households’ expenditure patterns, (ii) the gender of the household head who receives remittances, and (iii) the gender of the individual who sends and who receives remittances. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. The next section briefly summarizes the impact of remittances on development. It also examines the most salient results from the intra‐household expenditure literature. Section three presents the data. Section four describes the empirical approach, and the parametric and semiparametric estimation procedures in particular. Moreover, the econometric strategies to identify the impacts of remittances and gender are explained. The fifth section discusses the results and relates them to the literature.

3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,31 December 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-014-0023-6,What active labour market programmes work for immigrants in Europe? A meta-analysis of the evaluation literature,December 2014,Sebastian Butschek,Thomas Walter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Immigrants are under-represented in employment and over-represented in unemployment in most European countries. In 2009/2010, their employment rate was on average 2.9 percentage points lower than that of natives across all European OECD countries. At the same time, their unemployment rate was 4.3 percentage points higher (OECD, [2012]). To facilitate immigrants’ labour market integration, European governments use a wide range of Active Labour Market Programmes (ALMPs). These include language and introduction courses, job search assistance, training programmes, and subsidised public and private sector employment. They also involve substantial government spending. While evidence on the effectiveness of single programmes exists, it has not been reviewed systematically to establish empirically which types of programmes actually facilitate immigrants’ employment uptake. To shed light on this question, we review the small but growing literature evaluating the employment effects of ALMPs on immigrants in Europe. By means of a meta-analysis, we try to identify which ALMPs work for immigrants and which ones do not. Our results should help policy-makers employ activation measures more efficiently. With respect to ALMPs’ effects on all unemployed workers (natives and immigrants), recent analyses have strengthened a growing consensus: job search assistance and, to some extent, wage subsidies are effective in the short run, while training works in the longer run; subsidised public sector employment (also known as public works), however, is generally ineffective (Heckman et al. [1999], Greenberg et al. [2003], Kluve, [2010], Card et al. [2010]). Also, the findings of the ALMP evaluation literature on heterogeneous treatment effects on women or young workers have been reviewed (e.g., Bergemann and van den Berg, [2008], Card et al. [2010]). For immigrants, two surveys of the literature on the effect of ALMPs exist. Nekby ([2008]) provides a qualitative review of four studies evaluating labour market programmes for immigrants in the Nordic countries; she concludes that the same types of ALMPs work for immigrants as for the general population of unemployed workers. Rinne ([2013]) discusses the findings of three studies evaluating language/introduction courses designed for immigrants and eight recent evaluations of general labour market programmes’ effects on immigrants. He suggests that “programs that are relatively closely linked to the labor market (for example, work experience and wage subsidies) appear the comparatively most effective programs” (Rinne, [2013], p. 548). While both surveys present relevant evidence, neither of them considers the full range of existing studies or formally aggregates the findings of the studies reviewed. We provide an accessible quantitative summary of the existing empirical evidence. To this end, we collect the relevant studies following a search protocol and then condense their findings in two steps: first, using descriptive analysis and second, performing a meta-analysis with sign and significance of the effect estimate as our outcome variable of interest. As Stanley ([2001]) argues, “The most important strength of meta-analysis is that it moves literature reviews away from casual judgments about “good” studies that deserve attention and “poor” studies that should be set aside, and instead provides a replicable statistical framework for summarizing and interpreting the full range of evidence”. The key ingredient of such an analysis is then an exhaustive data set of relevant studies. We find 33 micro-econometric papers that estimate 93 short-run treatment effects up to two years after programme start. The interventions evaluated were implemented in the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland), Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland between 1984 and 2007. Our descriptive analysis looks at the distribution of impact estimates conditional on study characteristics in order to provide an absolute indication of the effectiveness of different types of ALMPs. Performing a meta-analysis of the same sample of effect estimates allows us to go beyond the descriptive analysis in two ways. First, we can control for different study characteristics when investigating which ALMP types are associated with significant or insignificant impact findings, simultaneously addressing such issues as methodological differences or changes in programme effectiveness over time. Second, we can provide a summary measure for whether the evidence suggests that one type of ALMP works better than some other. We find that subsidised employment in the private sector is significantly more likely estimated to have a positive effect on immigrants’ labour market outcomes than training. For the other ALMP types, our meta-analysis yields mostly insignificant results. Combining our conclusions from the meta-analysis with the descriptive analysis suggests that wage subsidies not only work better than other programmes but also do have positive employment effects on immigrants. The finding that only wage subsidies are effective for immigrants is in contrast with recent meta-analyses’ conclusion for the unemployed in general that job search assistance programmes are also effective (Kluve, [2010], Card et al. [2010]). However, it points in the same direction as Rinne’s conclusion that interventions such as work experience and wage subsidy programmes appear most effective (Rinne, [2013]). Despite the positive effects of wage subsidies, immigrants seem under-represented in this type of programme. For Germany, for example, data on the immigrant share in ALMP participation shows that, compared to natives, immigrants are more often assigned to training and public works programmes than to wage subsidy programmes. In addition, wage subsidy programmes are the smallest category in absolute immigrant participation numbers (Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit, [2013]). In light of our results, these figures suggest that there is room for improving the allocation of ALMP resources. The remainder of this paper consists of four parts: section 2 provides background information on immigrants in European labour markets; section 3 describes the data and presents some descriptive analysis; section 4 discusses the findings of our meta-analysis and performs a sensitivity check; section 5 concludes.",38

More recently the consensus over the use of GDP per capita as a measure of a country level of success has started to fade (Stiglitz et al. [2010]). New ways of measuring well-being have emerged that tend to combine multiple objective statistics (for example, the well-known Human Development Index (UNDP [2011])) and, less frequently, also subjective measures that capture people’s perceptions and expectations (Cummis [2012]). The growing research on subjective well-being has promoted the use of people’s evaluations of their own life as indicators of the quality of life in a country (Layard [2005]). However, there are some concerns about the suitability of these measures for international comparisons. Issues related to adaptation and changes in aspirations pose some challenges to the use of subjective data for measuring well-being (Dolan and White [2007]). Moreover, cultural differences and translation problems raise additional concerns about the validity of cross-country comparisons (Stevenson and Wolfers [2008]). This paper provides new evidence on the relevance of subjective measures for international comparisons by investigating the determinants of destination choices of potential migrants, i.e., those people revealing a desire to permanently leave their country. While hard statistics such as GDP per capita and unemployment rates are commonly used by governments to measure a country’s progress, people may use alternative criteria to assess a country’s level of success. The analysis of migration decisions of potential migrants, i.e., those people willing to leave their country, can help identify measures that best capture what makes some countries more attractive and, in those terms, more successful. Research on lifestyle migration, defined as the relocation of people within the developed world searching for a better way of life, shows that migrants explain their specific choice of destination considering factors such as the relative cost of living, pace of life, health benefits and feeling of community (Benson and O’Reilly [2009]). Information on potential migrants’ choices offers the opportunity to test which metrics best capture these various aspects of quality of life from the perspectives of those people that show an explicit interest in improving their own life experience. People form their opinions on the level of well-being and opportunities in other countries through various sources of information, contacts or personal traveling. The analysis conducted in this paper focuses on respondents in European countries since the flow of information in these countries is likely to be more homogeneous and comprehensive than in developing countries. In particular, the analysis uses individual-level data from the Gallup World Poll on about 11,000 individuals, obtained from comparable surveys in 25 European countries. Individuals are asked to express their desire to move permanently to another country and to state in which country they would like to move. This paper is the first to combine individual-level potential migration choices with subjective wellbeing measures in the destination countries. This study differs from those pertaining to the migration literature mainly because the preferences over destinations are not influenced by external commitments (for example job or family) and do not necessarily imply that the migration plan is feasible. The trade-offs in using potential migration versus actual migration data are more extensively explored in the next sections. The analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of potential migrants show that they tend to be younger, more educated and richer than other respondents. They also evaluate their own life less positively and are more likely to perceive that the businesses and the government in their home country are corrupt. The analysis of migration destinations is conducted using a conditional logit model that relates people’s choices to the characteristics of the most selected destinations. Beyond national-level measures commonly used in migration studies, such as income and unemployment, the analysis includes other measures of quality of life such as the average life satisfaction and perception of corruption. The inclusion of these variables provides new insights into which measures, beyond standard objective statistics, better proxy what makes a country appealing and, therefore, successful in the view of the people. The results show that potential migrants are attracted by countries where the average life satisfaction is higher and the average perception of corruption is lower, although this latter effect is less robust. On the other hand, GDP per capita is negatively associated with the probability of choosing a particular destination, and unemployment levels have a negative but small influence on a country’s attractiveness. The results suggest that average life satisfaction measures and, to a lesser extent, people’s perceptions over corruption better reflect the level of success of a country than standard macroeconomic statistics. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature on subjective well-being and migration. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy adopted to analyze the characteristics of the potential migrants and the determinants of preferred migration destinations.

In 2012, remittances represented a quarter of the GDP’s of countries such as Moldova, Lesotho and Nepal, and reaching even half of Tajikistan’s GDP.1 Remittances are also important because their growth is both faster and more stable than official aid. For instance, the average annual growth rate of remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa has amounted to 13.9% over the 1995–2010 period.2 These transfers help recipients in countries of origin to cope with adverse shocks, and foster investments in various domains, such as education, productive assets and innovative technologies, but also in financial development, housing and social capital.3 In the face of such a major phenomenon benefiting recipient countries, economists have analyzed migrants’ behavior, and in particular their motivations to send remittances. Migrant altruism towards the family left behind is among the most widely acknowledged motives for remittances. Practically all other motives can be related to the existence of some implicit contract between the migrant and the recipient. Such contracts involve mutual insurance and various forms of investments made by migrants in the country of origin, in human, physical, financial and social capital. Although this literature is relatively vast, the analysis of the motives for remittances has until recently overlooked important elements of the migrant’s decision process. While the link between remittances and return migration plans has recently been observed, theoretical analysis of the motives for remittances under endogenous return migration is scarce. More importantly, empirical studies show strong discrepancies between planned and actual duration of stay in the host country, due to uncertainty about their professional prospects and about their capacity to assimilate in the host country. Yet, theoretical analyses assume perfect foresight by migrants. Finally, a proper analysis of migrants’ remittance behavior should include alternative strategies of transferring resources to the future, such as savings, whereas theoretical and empirical studies generally analyze either remittances or savings, but not both. Addressing the following questions may therefore improve our understanding of migrants’ remittance and return migration strategies. Are migrants more or less likely to remit or to save under uncertainty? How do prior beliefs in terms of expected gains and risks from migration affect migrants’ remittance-saving portfolio? How do these decisions interact with labor market performance in the host country? In this paper, we present a model of endogenous remittances, savings and return decisions under uncertainty. Remittances foster investments in the host country, and these investments also benefit the migrant.4 In our setting, migrants make remittance and saving decisions at an early stage of migration, when both labor market performance and return options are uncertain. Over time, when information about professional prospects is acquired, and conditionally on past savings and remittances, migrants choose to become either a permanent migrant or a return migrant by comparing the consumption levels they would obtain in each location. It must be noted that this setting is in line with long-term international migration rather than circular migration.5 Savings and remittances are two technologies to transfer resources to the future, but they differ in some important aspects. When migrants consider whether to stay in the host country or return, they view savings as completely mobile, in the sense that these may be withdrawn and used in either location. In contrast, remittances lead to investments which have location-specific returns. Indeed, a migrant eventually opting for a permanent stay in the host country will only enjoy part (if any) of the remittance investment. For instance, investments in physical capital (e.g. houses, small businesses, inheritance,…) will incur transaction costs to be repatriated in the host country. Other types of investments in the origin country, for example in social capital (prestige, social status) are simply immobile and illiquid and therefore sunk. These considerations have strong implications in terms of return plans under uncertainty. For instance, we show that migrants who tend to remit large amounts in the early stages of migration have, ceteris paribus, a higher probability of return. Also, ex-ante, returns to remittances are random since they depend on the uncertain final location. In other words, unlike savings, remittances affect the distribution of future consumption through (i) their different returns in each location and (ii) their impact on return migration. This paper contributes to the literature by providing an original framework to analyze migrants’ behavior. It allows us to relate profiles of migrants based on their beliefs in terms of economic performance to various patterns of remittance-saving portfolios. More specifically, we show that migrants forming high expectations about the benefits of migration tend to remit less to save more.6 Also migrants whose labor market outcomes are relatively risky in the host country tend to remit more. Combining these prospect and risk characteristics, the model predicts that low-skill, illegal migrants are likely remit, whereas highly-educated and documented migrants are less likely to remit. Intermediate remitters are for instance legal migrants with low levels of education, and student migrants, whose returns from migration are potentially high but risky. Also, the model reproduces a series of recent stylized facts, linked to the determinants of remittance behavior, to the relationship between remittances and return intentions, and to the economic performance of returnees. First, all empirical analyses of remittance behavior highlight the existence of a large share of non-remitting migrants. Bettin et al. ([2012]) develop an econometric model which distinguishes various reasons for not remitting, either due to credit constrains, or due to the mere non-willingness to remit. Our framework captures these different possibilities, and explains why some unconstrained migrants may prefer not to remit. Since remittances increase the likelihood of return migration ex ante, and remittances have a higher return in the country of origin, returns to remittances are potentially convex. This convexity is a source of corner solution in remittances. Also, migrants who ex ante have high expectations about their economic outcomes in the host country are less likely to return. Because of this, they are also more likely to bear transaction costs to repatriate returns to remittances, which limits the attractiveness of such a form of investment. An additional reason for not remitting is related to the location of risks in host and origin countries. Migrants facing relatively low risk in the host country have no incentives to remit, as remitting affects the probability of return, and as a result increases the exposure to risks from the origin country. Conversely, this result is consistent with the observation that migrants facing high uncertainty in the host country are more likely to remit (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo [2006]; Sinning [2011]). The arguments on the impacts of expected gains and risks from migration provide a rationale for the important flows of illegal migration and their support by family members in developing countries. Indeed, our results imply that it is in the interest of migrants with low/risky prospects to remit. Therefore, relatives financing the migration of this type of agents are likely to receive transfers, independently of any pressure mechanisms.7 These results are strongly related in our model to the positive effect of past remittances on the likelihood of return. Dustmann and Mestres ([2010]) prove the existence of this “feedback effect” in their thorough analysis of the impact of return plans on remittances. They show that failing to take it into account leads to biased estimates of that impact. Finally, the empirical literature provides mixed evidence on the economic performance of return migrants. Our model provides rationales for this phenomenon, and may explain cases of negative selection of return migrants. For instance, Coulon and Piracha ([2005]) and Campos-Vazquez and Lara ([2012]) show that the average counterfactual wages of return migrants had they never migrated are lower than the average wages of stayers, despite the existence of a migration premium derived from the human capital accumulated in the host country. In our model, there is first a potential negative selection at the first stage of migration since, as explained above, migrants who have relatively low and risky benefits from migration are the most likely to remit, and therefore are likely to receive support. Second, because of transaction costs, the more migrants remit, the more they are ready to concede low wages in the origin country. Furthermore, the low prospect, high risk migrants are the most likely to remit and are therefore the most susceptible to return and earn low wages. In line with the explained empirical evidence, this model allows us to identify two distinct types of investment motives for remittances.8 First, when the expected returns to remittances are larger than the returns to savings, we say that remittances are sent with a “pure investment motive”. Second, when the migrant’s risk structure across locations is such that remittances reduce the total variance of future consumption, remittances may be sent with a “precautionary investment motive”. Illegal migrants are particularly subject to this second motive. The paper is organized as follows. A review of the recent literature is provided in Section 2. The general setting is introduced in Section 3. The case of risk neutral migrants is presented in Section 4, while the case of risk averse migrants is analyzed in Section 5. In Section 6, we provide an extension of the model allowing for differences in purchasing power between the host country and the origin country. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 7.",5

A strong consensus has emerged among modern evolutionary biologists that human racial categories represent a social construct, not a biological datum (Lewontin [2006]; Graves [2006]). Biologists have no objective means for assigning various human populations to discrete racial groups. Social dominance creates different environmental conditions for the emergence and persistence of socially constructed races in America (Graves [2006]). Consequently, for empirical economists, race is an important explanatory variable in regression models of social outcomes; yet, the empirical insights from evolutionary biology are that race is also a dependent variable. An empirical examination of recent changes in racial self-identity among Arab and Islamic Americans presents an opportunity to address this empirical challenge. Arab and Islamic Americans are overlapping and diverse populations. There are of 3.5 million Arab Americans, with ancestral origins in all 22 Arab countries (Arab American [2014]). Sixty percent are Christians, 24% are Muslims, 13% other religions, and the rest are unaffiliated. Eighty percent of Arabs are citizens and 40% are college educated. Arab Americans are relatively affluent, with a mean income 22% above the national average. There are 2–7 million Muslim Americans (Lipka [2014]; U.S. Department of State [2014]). They represent the most racially diverse religious group in the America. No single racial or ethnic identity applies to more than 30% of the Muslim American population. Most (63%) are first generation immigrants, coming from at least 77 different countries. Eighty-one percent are citizens. African American Muslims, that is, adherents to the Islamic faith whose cultural roots extend back to American slavery, are variously considered to be one-fifth to one-third of the total for all Muslim Americans (U.S. Department of State [2014]). Muslims represent the fastest growing segment of the Arab population. Muslim American education and income are close to the national average: 24% have college degrees and median income is about $50,000. Excluding African American Muslims and focusing solely on persons with ancestral origins in predominately Muslim countries, the US Arab and Islamic populations have a high percentage of first and second generation immigrants seeking to integrate into and acculturate into the American society. An important element of their acculturation involves negotiating the white-black racial identity norm that is everywhere present in American society. For this study, America’s Arab and Islamic population consists of a heterogeneous group of people whose ancestral origins are mostly Northern Africa and Western Asia, but who also include sub-groups from Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and Eastern Asia. Some are ethnic Arabs, but many are not. For example, most of the people of Iran are ethnic Persians. Some Arab and Islamic Americans have very dark skin shade, for example, North Africans and Pakistanis, but many much less so. Despite differences in ethnicity, nativity, skin shade, and religion, all persons of North African and West Asian ancestry are classified as “white” in the US Census (Office of Management and Budget [1997]). Further, all are subject to anti-Muslim and anti-Arab stereotypes - even those who are neither Arab nor Muslim. But, many members of this population do not self-identify as white and recent historical events may have had a substantial effect on racial self-identity. During the 2000s Arab and Islamic American racial identity was subjected to three sets of large scale racializing events: 1) the public and private reaction to the Al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001 (“9/11”); 2) the US invasion of Iraq during March 19, 2003 - May 1, 2003, the controversial war that followed, and its discussion in the 2004 elections; and, 3) the racially charged US presidential election of 2008, where an African American Christian with a Muslim father and an Islamic name was elected President of the United States, as well as the congressional election of 2010. The Al Qaeda attacks were the initial exogenous events, clearly demarcating a period whereby there was a structural increase in the intensity of US stigmatization of persons with Islamic religious affiliation and Arab ethnicity. The political events of 2003-2004 and 2008-2010 reinforced the stigmatization ushered in after 9/11. This stigmatization created an exogenous reduction in the expected payoff to acculturation relative to non-acculturation. To the extent that self-identifying as white reflects Arab and Islamic acculturation into American society, we should observe a discrete reduction in the fraction of Arab and Islamic Americans self-identifying as white during the years following 2001. The post-9/11 events are a natural experiment that corresponds closely to an exogenous reduction in the public’s willingness to accept Arab and Islamic acculturation into US society. This paper tests whether these racializing events altered the distribution of racial identities among Arab and Islamic Americans. We use nearly two decades of cross-sectional microdata (1996-2012) from the March Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Hence, we are able to examine Arab and Islamic racial self-identification for a substantial period before and after the epochal events of September 11, 2001. Respondent and parental nativity variables allow easy identification of a large sample of 1st and 2nd generation Americans. Although we cannot completely identify 3rd and higher generation Arab and Islamic Americans, language usage, religion, or skin shade, we do find that our results are robust with respect to ancestral origin. Separating the sample according to the timing of racializing events and comparing 2002-2012 to 1996-2001, there is a statistically significant decrease in the unconditional and conditional probability that Arab and Islamic Americans will self-identify as white.",5

Many studies have attempted to analyse the earnings assimilation process of immigrants, and they indicate that many variables affect assimilation outcomes. Self-employment is an important form of employment for immigrants, but it has not been extensively examined by previous economic studies. This paper examines the effect of ""ethnic capital"" (e.g. ethnic network and ethnic concentration) on immigrant choices to engage in self-employment as opposed to employment as an employee. Self-employment provides immigrants with another niche for assimilation. There are several socio-economic factors that significantly influence immigrants' self-employment decisions. Chiswick ([1978]) argued that, compared with natives, immigrants are disadvantaged in the host country's labour market because they lack English-language skills, social networks, knowledge of local customs, information about job opportunities, transferability of skill and firm-specific training. For these reasons new immigrants whose first language is different from the language of the host country face barriers to finding a job. As such, it may take a long time for their income to converge to the income level of comparable natives in the host country. However, rather than seeking employment in the waged sector, immigrants can choose to operate their own business in order to avoid at least some of the disadvantages listed in the preceding paragraph. Thus, immigrants may be more inclined to choose self-employment. A growing number of international studies have found that there are an increasing number of immigrant-owned businesses in countries that traditionally accept immigrants. Light and Sanchez ([1987]) found evidence that immigrants have been more likely than natives to be self-employed for the last one hundred years. In this paper we focus on this important but less studied form of immigrant employment. The literature on ethnic capital or networks generally adopts either ethnic concentration (e.g. Edin et al. [2003]; Andersson and Hammarstedt [2011]) or linguistic concentration (e.g. Bertrand et al. [2000]) as the proxy for immigrants' network in the host country's labour market. In addition, prior empirical studies of immigrant earnings or employment have assumed that the labour market performance of an individual is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In this paper, we propose an approach based on the influence of self-employment decisions, typically made by other members of the ethnic network in a locality, on an immigrants' self-employment decisions during a specific year and location. This spatial approach, we believe, shows more clearly the effect of the quality of the ethnic network. We also relax the assumption of i.i.d. in the previous models by introducing a dynamic spatial autoregressive model of immigrant choices, and we examine the effect of this new approach on results. In addition, we incorporate a spatial approach to estimate the magnitude and significance of the network effect on immigrants' employment decisions. This is fundamentally different from conventional models. The spatial approach allows researchers to capture the correlation of self-employment choices by an ethnic group in a locality in each time period. Conventional models have at best controlled for national level or local average group characteristics. We argue that our modelling approach of a `dynamic ethnic spatial' network variable demonstrates the network impact more clearly. This variable has been dubbed the `weighted ethnic spatial lag' and is discussed in our model outline. This approach allows an individual's self-employment decision to be geographically and ethnically correlated with that of other individuals. We hypothesize that ""ethnic capital"" is a key resource which provides assistance to immigrants in establishing their own businesses, which may be particularly helpful for immigrants whose first language differs from the language of the host country. We construct a dynamic ""ethnic spatial network"" variable (also known as ""weighted ethnic spatial lag"", (Wy), as specified in the model section of our paper (Section 3.1.2), from individual-level data to account for networks in order to capture the effects of social and resource networks for immigrant groups. We apply this analysis to a new and rich longitudinal data set on immigrants. This approach offers three advantages: (1) It provides a better estimation of the quality or the degree of association of immigrants' networks; (2) Compared to the conventional approach, the spatial approach provides a better data fit; (3) The spatial model also provides a better estimation of the impact of personal characteristics and human capital variables. We show in our paper (Section 3.1.2) that when we exclude this variable, other coefficients partly capture the network effect, resulting in a bias. We show that in our analysis other socio-economic variables were particularly affected by omitting this variable. This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides hypotheses based on ethnic capital. In Section 3 we discuss the econometric models. Section 4 describes the data set used in this study. Empirical analyses are provided in Section 5, followed by the conclusion in Section 6.",7
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,24 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-014-0017-4,"Migration, risk attitudes, and entrepreneurship: evidence from a representative immigrant survey",December 2014,Catia Batista,Janis Umblijs,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The deepening economic crisis in many western countries has resulted in a general trend of increasingly restrictive policies toward immigration (OECD [2010]). As governments around the world are struggling with rising unemployment rates, there is growing political pressure to increase restrictions on international migration. This political pressure is often based on the popular perception that the presence of migrants reduces employment opportunities for native workers. Increasingly restrictive immigrant policies can, however, be misguided as they ignore the potential positive effects that migrants can have on host economies. Self-employment and entrepreneurship are generally acknowledged as being crucial for economic growth. Small enterprises play a crucial role in both developed and developing countries and are often credited with providing specialist goods and services, intensifying competition and increasing economic efficiency (Parker [2004]). High rates of self-employment and entrepreneurship among migrants can have many positive effects such as bringing new skills to the labour market (Hunt [2011]; Ottaviano and Peri [2012]), increasing domestic demand and creating jobs with positive consequences on both employment rates and social security systems (Lacomba and Lagos [2010]). This set of benefits is likely to be particularly relevant in times of recession when standard employment opportunities fall and unemployment rates increase – although this fact is somehow qualified by the Constant and Zimmermann ([2014])'s finding that even though self-employment is an important way to get out of unemployment in times of recession in Germany between 1983 and 2003, migrants are actually less likely than German natives to engage in self-employment as a mechanism to avoid unemployment in economic downturns. But more generally, the importance of self-employment and entrepreneurship for an economy and its growth is such that several countries (such as Germany, Portugal or the USA) provide visa benefits to arriving immigrants who pledge to invest substantial amounts and/or create new jobs in the host country. While the majority of studies looking at the link between risk aversion and entrepreneurship (for non-migrant populations) find a significant negative relationship (Stewart and Roth [2001]), this finding is not unanimous and variation exists in the significance and strength of the effects found. Indeed, while Van Praag and Cramer ([2001]), Cramer et al. ([2002]), and Ekelund et al. ([2005]) find a statistically significant negative relationship between risk preferences and the probability of being self-employed, Blanchflower and Oswald ([1998]) find risk preferences not to be linked to the probability of being self-employed. In addition, Caliendo et al. ([2009]) used the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data to find that individuals with lower risk aversion are more likely to become self-employed, but that this effect is only significant for individuals in transition from regular employment, not for those coming out of unemployment or inactivity. Finally, one more study highlighting the subtleties in the relation between risk aversion and entrepreneurship is that of Dohmen et al. ([2011]), who find a statistically significant negative link between risk aversion and self-employment for domain specific self-evaluation measures, but not when using a hypothetical lottery question. Taking a different perspective, Hormiga and Bolívar-Cruz ([2014]) look more specifically at the relationship between risk perceptions and entrepreneurship amongst migrants to find that being an immigrant in Spain seems to be associated with lower perceived business risks, which correlate positively with higher entrepreneurship rates – a finding consistent with the negative correlation between risk aversion and entrepreneurship found in other studies. A limitation of this study is that the indicator used to capture risk aversion is a question regarding `fear of starting a new business'. While fear of starting a business and risk aversion might be related, fear is not a direct measure of risk aversion. In this setting, the study of risk preferences and migration seems of special interest. Jaeger et al. ([2010]) is the only work directly examining the relationship between risk preferences and migration. It finds that, for the case of internal migration of Germans in Germany, individuals who are more willing to take risks are also more willing to migrate between regions within the country. Bonin et al. ([2009]), however, find that first generation immigrants have lower risk preferences than natives, which only equalize in the second generation. Related recent research (such as Umblijs [2012]) has shown that new immigrants without significant networks (be it family, friends or fellow countrymen) at the destination country tend to be more risk loving than those new immigrants who have these networks available at the time of arrival1. This paper investigates the motives behind migrant entrepreneurship, focusing specifically on the role that risk preferences play in the probability to become self-employed2. We look at the difference in risk attitudes within migrant communities, and propose a novel methodology to improve comparability of risk preferences between individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Our risk variable is based on a self-evaluation measure of willingness to take risks in the domain of employment that combines several self-evaluation risk questions with anchoring vignettes. The vignettes allow us to measure risk preferences in a more accurate way, by reducing the bias caused by Differential Item Functioning (DIF), in which individuals interpret the response scale in a non-uniform way. This bias is especially pronounced when the characteristic being measured is subjective and related to earlier experiences of the individual, as is likely to be the case for risk preferences. This bias is further compounded when the population being studied is culturally heterogeneous, since the use of scales has been shown to vary between individuals from different origin countries3. This context suggests that our vignette-adjusted measure should be especially important in the measurement of risk preferences in immigrant populations. Our vignette-adjusted measure of risk aversion is tested using a unique tailor-made representative survey of the migrant population in Greater Dublin, Ireland, conducted by the authors. Respondents were asked to rate three hypothetical individuals on their willingness to take risks in their work life, and were then asked to rate their own willingness to take risks on the same scale. The information from the hypothetical vignettes is used to perform an econometric adjustment of the self-evaluation responses, eliminating the bias caused by DIF. The results confirm the existence of a negative relationship between risk aversion and entrepreneurship when using the DIF-adjusted measures, while the correlation of the unadjusted measure with entrepreneurship was not statistically significant. Given the importance of vignette-adjustment to our results, we use a Compound Hierarchical Probit (CHOPIT) specification to look at the heterogeneous effects of individual vignette choice on the self-evaluation risk measure. We find that entrepreneurs inflate the most risk-averse values and undervalue the most risk loving value of the self-evaluation scale, relative to non-entrepreneurs. The results also suggest the existence of a routine bias in the use of scales between individuals from different countries of birth, as well as male and female respondents. Our paper is unique in that it uses a new tailor-made survey instrument that combines self-evaluation risk questions with anchoring vignettes that correct for measurement error caused by DIF. In this way, it provides an improved measure to test the relationship between risk preferences and entrepreneurship in heterogeneous populations, such as the sample of immigrants used in this study – this is also an original contribution to the existing literature on risk aversion and entrepreneurship. Our results suggest that the use of uncorrected DIF measures could be a possible explanation for the variability in the results on the correlation between risk preferences and entrepreneurship reported in previous studies. These are relevant results in light of the economic importance of entrepreneurship and self-employment in particular. The rest of the article is organized in the following way: Section 2 outlines the methodology used; Section 3 provides the econometric framework; Section 4 introduces the data; Section 5 presents the results; and Section 6 finally concludes.",9

If differential behavior on the part of firms exists, it could potentially have a lasting economic impact on second-generation immigrants in terms of future wage growth and career prospects. Differential behavior toward second-generation immigrants could potentially operate at various stages: in the pre-labor market, in the competition for an apprenticeship, during labor market entry, in wages paid for equivalent work, with opportunities for training, and in terms of involuntary separations. In the traditional wage equation-based analysis of differential behavior toward minority groups, key labor market factors, such as the job-offer arrival rate and the layoff rate, are often not taken into account. Incorporating these explanations is difficult without a model of how each may contribute to the wage densities of individuals. Search models are particularly well suited for this task since they are easily adapted to include many of the behavioral features of interest here. According to search theory, wage dispersion is largely a consequence of search friction and cross-firm differences in productivity. It is possible that the job-finding rate and the job-retention rate are different for ethnic natives and second-generation immigrants, either because these two groups search through different channels, their networks differ in quality, they do not receive the same number of offers or they experience different layoff rates. By estimating our models separately for matched samples of ethnic natives and second-generation immigrants, we gain new insight into whether observationally equivalent ethnic Danes and second-generation immigrants entering the labor market for the first time face differing labor market prospects.2 Estimating equilibrium search models (ESMs) requires a rich longitudinal data set, including information about an individual’s labor market history on a weekly or monthly basis. In contrast to many studies, we use register data containing the labor market histories of the population of immigrants in Denmark, which allows us to observe and estimate models for both second-generation immigrants and comparable ethnic Danes. The paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 reviews the two strands in the migration literature. Section 3 looks at the theoretical and empirical search models. Section 4 introduces individual-level panel data and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the estimation results and Section 6 presents the conclusions.",1

The decision was approved by the EU parliament in April 2003. On the 1st of May 2004, these 10 countries, mainly situated in Eastern Europe (EU-10)1, joined the Union. On the 1st of January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania (EU-2) followed. A central institutional change connected to the acceptance of the new member states in the European “club” was the introduction of the freedom of movement for workers. According to this legislation, every citizen in the EU can start working in another EU country without the need for a work permit. For potential migrant workers, this regulation significantly reduces the cost of moving abroad. Within a common labor market, the size and composition of migration flows are not determined by the decisions of local immigration officers, but by the aggregate of individual migration decisions in the source regions. Thus, national governments partly delegate their sovereignty of determining the size and composition of the population to millions of potential migrant workers who can freely decide where to settle. Since the standard of living in the new member states was well below the average level in the old EU-15 member states2 at the time the legislation was brought into force, the accession initiated a debate about the sustainability of the welfare state. Sinn ([2002]) warned that the introduction of the freedom of movement for workers in combination with access to public benefits in the EU-15 would result in an erosion of protection levels. According to his reasoning, national governments could be expected to avoid inflows of migrants claiming welfare by reducing the generosity of benefits. A race to the bottom dynamic in the EU-15 could thus cause an erosive process. Kvist ([2004]) drew less drastic conclusions by arguing that the effects of “welfare migration” are too small to directly affect the decision-making process on the national level. However, he also considered that governments in the EU-15 might engage in strategic interactions with respect to decisions on national social policies. Certainly also as a result of these political controversies, the so-called 2 + 3 + 2 rule found its way into the accession treaties. This rule concedes EU member states the right to postpone the realization of the freedom of movement for workers for up to 7 years after the accession. It applies to workers from the EU-83 and the EU-2 member states. In summary, the option of applying the 2 + 3 + 2 rule led to a very asymmetric opening of the labor markets in the EU-15 towards the East. Ultimately, national decision makers in EU-15 countries were endowed with two policy instruments to potentially influence the inflow of workers: the generosity of the welfare state and the postponement of the labor market opening through the 2 + 3 + 2 rule . The main goal of this study is to analyze how these political decisions influence the migration flows to the EU-15. How relevant is the “welfare magnet” effect in the EU-15? How did the “welfare magnet” effect interact with the application of the 2 + 3 + 2 rule? Did a race to the bottom in the generosity of welfare states take place? In a first step, I present the strategic instruments of the national policy makers in a stylized way. I illustrate the development of the welfare state in the different EU member states in the aftermath of the 2002 decision in Copenhagen. Several indicators characterizing welfare state generosity like the ratio of social expenditures to the GDP level, the social expenditures per capita and the net replacement rate that defines the out-of-work benefit level are described. In addition, the asymmetric application of the 2 + 3 + 2 rule in the different countries is discussed. Secondly, an analysis of the effects of the policies in the EU-15 member states on the immigration flows is pursued. Using micro data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), I estimate the effects of a rich set of determinants that influence the individual migration decision and thus the migrant inflow to a destination country in the EU-15. A special focus is put on the “welfare magnet” effect since the significance and strength of this effect determines the magnitude of clustering in generous welfare states. The stronger the effect is the more intense should be the interaction of national governments in reducing social expenditures. As micro data from the EU-LFS are used, some light is shed on the effect of the composition of the diaspora and the source population on the migration flows. Information on socio-economic characteristics of the surveyed is included in the regressions which allows for a deeper analysis of the network relationship of the sending and receiving country. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the literature on “welfare migration” and the effects of networks and institutional restrictions on individual migration decisions. In Section 3, I present some stylized facts about the potential race to the bottom dynamics in the EU-15 after the enlargement decision of Copenhagen in 2002. The development of the welfare state generosity and the asymmetric application of the restrictions on the freedom of movement are shown and discussed as strategic instruments of national policy makers. Section 4 presents the data and a descriptive analysis of migration flows from the EU-10 and EU-2 member states. Section 5 is devoted to the empirical analysis of the determinants of migration flows using the EU-LFS and to the discussion of the major findings. Furthermore, I present results from a sensitivity analysis which includes alternative concepts of welfare state generosity and a comparison of the results with the previous findings. The last section concludes.",6

The gap can be decomposed into an explained component and an unexplained component. The explained component is the part of the gap that can be attributed to differences in observed skills (mainly schooling and work experience) between immigrants and natives. In the U.S., for example, immigrants have on average fewer years of schooling than natives, which explains to a large extent their lower wages (Card, 2005; Smith 2006). The unexplained component of the wage gap reflects the extent to which the observed skills of immigrants are not valued as much as those of natives in the host country’s labor market. Canada is a good example of how significant the unexplained component can be. Unlike their U.S. counterparts, immigrants in Canada have better observed skills than natives (mainly because of Canada’s immigration policy which is based on a point system), but still earn substantially less than them. To paraphrase Abramovitz (1956) on the Solow residual, the unexplained component can be viewed as a measure of our ignorance. It can be attributed to a variety of factors that cannot be easily measured such as discrimination (Oreopoulos, 2009), institutional rigidities, market failures, or the inability of employers to recognize foreign credentials (Reitz, 2005). The purpose of this paper is to improve our understanding of the determinants of immigrant wages. By doing so, we explain a larger part of the wage gap and thus reduce our ignorance in that regard. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the schooling and work experience acquired by immigrants in their country of birth may be of different quality than those acquired by the natives of the host country. Bloom, Grenier and Gunderson (1995), Schaafsma and Sweetman (2001), and Bonikowska, Green and Riddell (2008) all use the difference in quality argument in their analyses of immigrant wages in Canada, and Bratsberg and Terrel (2002) does the same for the U.S. However, our analysis of the immigrant wage gap is novel in that it provides a general methodology that can directly account for the quality of schooling and work experience in immigrant wage regressions. Differences in human capital quality across immigrants from different countries have been typically measured using the results of cognitive tests (see, for example, Bonikowska, Green and Riddell, 2008; Coulombe and Tremblay, 2009). There are two major problems with this approach. One is data availability. Test scores from the International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey (IALS) are available for only 27 countries and for very few years (in Canada, the last one was conducted in 2003 and the previous one in 1994). The other problem is more fundamental. While it may be suitable to use the results of cognitive tests as measures of schooling quality, it is inappropriate to use them as measures of work experience quality because they are not designed to assess the value of work experience. Indeed, while, for example, a lawyer with 25 years of experience is certainly much more productive for a firm than a recruit who just recently graduated, one can easily envision the former being outperformed by the latter in a cognitive test such as IALS. The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology that can be applied to analyze immigrant wage gaps for a large set of countries for which common statistics on natives and immigrants are available. This methodology is applied to the case of Canada. Building on the work of Coulombe, Grenier and Nadeau (2014) in a first step, we show how GDP per capita can be used as a cross-country proxy for the quality of schooling and work experience in Mincerian immigrant wage regressions. Essentially, the ratio between the GDP per capita of an immigrant’s country of birth and that of Canada, measured at the time of graduation or at the time of immigration, is used as an indicator of schooling quality and of work experience quality and is interacted with the years of schooling and work experience variables. The approach is appealing for a number of reasons. First, we should expect GDP per capita to be a good indicator of human capital quality as rich countries generally allocate more resources to education and provide better on-the-job learning opportunities—because of their high levels of technology and capital/labor ratios—than poor countries. Second, there is empirical evidence that the returns to schooling and work experience are positively related to a country’s GDP per capita (see, for example, Coulombe, Grenier and Nadeau, 2014, and Lagakos et al. 2012). Third, data on GDP are available for most countries in the world and for long periods of time1. Finally, unlike in cross-country growth studies, GDP per capita is can be considered as an exogenous variable in an empirical analysis of immigrant earnings. In a second step, we estimate our wage regression equations using 2006 Canadian census data on male and female immigrants and natives. Results reveal that the returns to schooling and work experience significantly increase with the GDP per capita of an immigrant’s country of birth, even when incorporating country of birth fixed effects and occupation and industry controls in the regression. In particular, we find that schooling and work experience acquired in a country whose GDP per capita is similar to that of Canada have annual rates of return that are respectively 1.6 and 0.8 percentage point higher than schooling and work experience acquired in a country whose GDP per capita is one-tenth that of Canada (schooling and work experience acquired in India for example). In a third step, we use a variant of the Blinder-Oaxaca method to decompose the immigrant wage gap into an explained component, an unexplained component and an immigrant specific component that includes human capital quality effects. We find that lower human capital quality completely negates the endowment advantage that immigrants have in the areas of schooling and work experience and is by far the major reason why they earn less than Canadian natives. We also find that after controlling for human capital quality, the unexplained component of the wage gap (which is sometimes associated with labor market discrimination) is reduced by almost 62 percent for male immigrants and virtually eliminated for female immigrants. The results of the analysis in this paper have important policy implications. Among other things, they suggest that if a country wants to adopt an immigrant selection policy based on a point system such as that of Canada, then for the same number of years of schooling and of work experience, the number of points should vary depending on the assessed quality of those years of schooling and work experience. In particular, more points should be allocated if schooling (especially the highest diploma) and work experience have been acquired in Canada—or in a highly developed country—than if they have been acquired in a less developed country. Another (and possibly more efficient) immigrant selection approach, would be to rely less on the number of years of schooling and of work experience in selecting immigrants, and more on cognitive and professional accreditation tests. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the issue of controlling for human capital quality in studies of the labor market integration of immigrants and justifies the use of GDP per capita as an indicator of human capital quality. Section 3 presents the statistical framework. Section 4 discusses the data used along with summary statistics. Section 5 presents the empirical results and Section 6 concludes.",14
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,14 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-3-13,Cultural diversity and subjective well-being,December 2014,Simonetta Longhi,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"One of the consequences of international migration is that in many countries local communities are becoming more diverse in terms of country of birth, ethnicity, and religion. This increase in diversity may have consequences for the well-being of residents. If diversity has a negative impact on well-being, a rapid increase in diversity may generate social problems and may decrease social cohesion (Putnam 2007). Despite this, the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (UNESCO 2001) states the importance of cultural diversity not only for economic growth, but also “as a means to achieve a more satisfactory intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual existence” (Article 3). The academic literature has provided arguments both in favour and against diversity. Arguments in favour of diversity point to positive correlations between diversity and employment (Nathan 2011; Ottaviano and Peri 2005), productivity and wages (Ottaviano and Peri 2005, 2006), the amount of (ethnic) services such as shops and restaurants (Mazzolari and Neumark 2012). Arguments against diversity point to the possibility of misunderstandings among people of different cultures (Horwitz and Horwitz 2007), a decrease in social capital (Alesina and La Ferrara 2000; Letki 2008; Sturgis et al. 2011), and social conflicts (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002; Sturgis et al. 2011; Putnam 2007). The ones mentioned above are all different aspects of people’s lives that may be positively and negatively affected by diversity; all these aspects may contribute differently to people’s overall well-being. Given the relevance that governments nowadays place on subjective well-being (Waldron 2010), and since the impact of immigration and of a diverse society is a highly debated topic (Finney and Simpson 2009), surprisingly little research has been done on the impact of diversity on well-being. This paper focuses on the impact that diversity has on people’s overall satisfaction with their lives. In addition, rather than limiting the analysis to one measure of diversity, this paper compares three ways to operationalise the concept of cultural diversity: diversity by country of birth, ethnicity, and religion. In most studies the choice of how to measure diversity depends on data availability. It is unclear, however, whether people value different types of diversity differently. Finally, rather than restricting the analysis on the impact that diversity has on natives, this paper also analyses the impact that diversity has on ethnic minorities and foreign born people since it is possible that people belonging to a minority perceive the costs and benefits of diversity differently than people belonging to the majority. This paper is related to research by Betz and Simpson (2013) and Akay et al. (2012). Betz and Simpson (2013) use cross-section data from the European Social Survey to analyse the impact of immigration on well-being of natives across European countries. They find that immigration, and especially recent immigrants, have a positive but very small impact on well-being of natives. The small impact may be related to the fact that Betz and Simpson (2013) compare countries, most of which are geographically rather large. In contrast, Akay et al. (2012) use the German Socio-economic Panel to analyse the impact of immigration on well-being across German regions and conclude that immigration has an impact on well-being of natives only in those regions where assimilation – either in terms of wages or measured by ‘feeling German’ – is low. In regions where immigrants are more assimilated, immigration does not seem to have any impact on well-being of residents. Rather than on the impact of immigration, the focus of this paper is on the impact of diversity, which can be interpreted as the result of various waves of immigration and emigration of foreign born (and of natives), and of fertility and adaptation of previous waves of immigrants. Although related, assimilation of immigrants in the way measured by the previous literature is a different concept from diversity: even people who feel they belong to the host country may still have diverse lifestyles that are inherited from their cultural upbringing. Similar to Akay et al. (2012), the focus of this paper is on one country to allow the use of a more detailed geography, since diversity in the local area is likely to be much more relevant for individual well-being than diversity in the whole country. The results suggest that diversity has a negative impact on well-being of UK residents; this impact, however, varies across groups and partly depends on the way diversity is measured. White British people living in more diverse areas in terms of countries of birth and ethnicity have lower levels of life satisfaction on average than those living in areas where diversity is low. In contrast, the average level of life satisfaction of non-white British people and of foreign born does not seem to be affected by the level of diversity. It is possible that people belonging to minorities have different preferences for diversity. The level of diversity in an area may be one characteristic which is included in the choice of the area of residence by minorities, but is overlooked by people belonging to the majority, with resulting externalities. The results show no obvious differences between people living in rural rather than urban areas; however, there are relevant differences between homeowners and renters. The correlation between diversity and life satisfaction is more likely to be negative for those who have spent only few years at the current address and for those who do not feel that there is a large social capital in their neighbourhood. These results point to the possibility that people may adapt to diversity. If this is the case, the problem that policy makers face is not the level of diversity, but the relationship between how quickly diversity increases, and how quickly residents are able to adapt to it.",28
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,02 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-3-12,Immigration status and property crime: an application of estimators for underreported outcomes,December 2014,Georgios Papadopoulos,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"International migration is a topic that has been heavily debated by policy makers, especially in countries that experienced important immigration inflows, such as the UK. Consequently, academic communities have devoted extensive research to understand the actual impact of immigration on several outcomes of both the host and home countries, including the effect of immigration on the labour market (Borjas 2003; Dustman et al. 2005; Card 2009) and the welfare state of the host countries (Borjas 1999), the impact of brain drain on the countries of origin (Beine et al. 2008) and the impact of ethnic diversity on economic performance (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005), to mention only a few. Following the substantial inflows and debates, the general public also started developing negative beliefs towards the migrant population, since they perceived immigrants not only as a major competitor in the labour market, but also as a main factor for deteriorating several problems of the host countries, especially crime. Indeed, at least for the UK, data from the British Social Attitudes survey (BSA), reveal that British citizens generally believe that immigrants increase crime rates (see, Appendix A: attitudes towards immigrants in the UK for details). It comes as a surprise that although academics started debating the impact of immigration on crime more than 100 years ago (see, for example, Hart 1896), only recently have researchers started investigating whether a relationship exists empirically. Interestingly, a high proportion of the empirical research does not share the hostile views dominating individual opinions. For example, most research for the US indicates that if any, this association is negative (Butcher and Piehl 1998, 2007; Ousey and Hubrin 2009; Wadswarth 2010), while the results for Europe are mixed for property crime but no association is found for violent crime (Bianchi et al. 2012; Bell et al. 2013; Bell and Machin 2013; Jaitman and Machin 2013). Main objective of the present study is to shed more light on the differences in criminal behaviour between immigrants and natives in England and Wales, with a particular focus on property crime. For this purpose, the 2003 Crime and Justice Survey is used, a national representative survey of crime self-reports1. Because underreporting of criminal activities is a major concern in crime self-reports, regression strategies that do not take into account this problem will result in inconsistent estimates of the determinants of criminal behaviour. Therefore, in this paper we tackle this problem by utilising regression models that attempt to control for underreporting. These models allow for consistent estimation of both the determinants of true criminal activity and the determinants of reporting behaviour by only using the information of observed self-reported crime. Our estimates suggest that responses of criminal behaviour are considerably underreported. However, if anything, immigrants underreport by less than natives. In addition, once controlling for underreporting and basic demographic characteristics, we find that on average, immigrants are less involved in property crime, although the estimates are imprecise. Even though the estimated immigration-crime difference is not statistically significant in our baseline models, all sensitivity analysis shows that it is very robust. This may suggest that this relationship exists, but the nature of the regression models in combination with the data in hand do not allow for more precise estimates. Finally, recognising the high heterogeneity of immigrant population, we investigate whether the immigration-crime association depends on certain groups of covariates, such as ethnic status or location. We actually find that immigrants who are located in London and black immigrants are significantly less criminally active than their native counterparts. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses theoretical views on the immigration-crime link and presents a short literature review on the topic. Section 3 presents the regression models that allow for underreporting, while Section 4 discusses the data. Section 5 and 6 present the main results and the robustness checks, respectively. Section 7 investigates whether the effect of immigration status on property crime depends on ethnic status or the location of immigrants. Finally, a brief discussion and concluding remarks follow in Section 8.",7
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,23 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-3-11,Does the design of correspondence studies influence the measurement of discrimination?,December 2014,Magnus Carlsson,Luca Fumarco,Dan-Olof Rooth,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Correspondence studies are an increasingly popular method for measuring discriminatory treatment against, e.g., ethnic minority and female workers in the labor market (see Riach and Rich, 2002, for a survey). In the standard correspondence study, matched pairs of qualitatively identical job applications are sent to employers that have advertised a job opening. The only difference between the fictitious applications is the name of the applicant, which signals ethnicity or gender. The degree of discrimination in hiring is quantified by calculating the difference in the callback rate (i.e., the fraction of invitations) to a job interview between the groups. The advocates of correspondence studies argue that the method provides the most clear and convincing evidence of discrimination. Their main argument is that a carefully designed correspondence study can identify discriminatory treatment by employers since the signal of group belonging is randomized. This circumvents the problem with unobserved individual heterogeneity – a common problem in studies using administrative data. The method’s ability to identify discriminatory treatment by employers is certainly attractive, but it should be noted that correspondence studies cannot distinguish between preference-based (Becker, 1957) and statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain, 1977; Arrow, 1973; Phelps, 1972). Somewhat simplified, preference-based discrimination is based on employer prejudice, while statistical discrimination arise when employers act upon perceived group differences in the mean or variance of unobserved variables (i.e., variables not included in the job applications). However, the inability to separate between these two types of discrimination may not be a huge drawback unless the aim is solely to identify preference-based discrimination. In many countries, both preference-based and statistical discrimination against, e.g., ethnic minorities and women are illegal1. Hence, the level of discrimination being measured by the standard correspondence study is an unbiased measure of the degree of discrimination as defined by the law for these countries. More problematic is that, despite being an unbiased measure of what the law defines as discrimination, which includes the case when employers act upon perceived group differences in the variance of unobserved variables, it may not be very informative. The problem is that when employers perceive a group difference in the variance of unobserved variables, the degree of discrimination in a correspondence study depends on the level at which the experimenter standardizes the observed characteristics in the job applications2. As a result, the standard correspondence study only tells the true level of discrimination against ethnic minority or female applicants who have similar qualifications as in the fictitious job applications. In the extreme case, a badly designed correspondence study may measure the degree of discrimination against a very atypical, or even non-existing, ethnic minority or female job applicant. In order to obtain an informative measure of discrimination in the market, the level of standardization must reflect the qualifications of a representative ethnic minority or female job applicant. Although the idea of perceived group differences in the variance of unobservables has a long tradition in economics (e.g., Aigner and Cain, 1977), the issue has been essentially ignored in the empirical literature on correspondence studies until the appearance of the method proposed by Neumark (2012)3. In short, Neumark’s method implies estimating the perceived relative variance in unobserved variables across groups, which then makes it possible to decompose the measured degree of discrimination into two parts. The first part captures discrimination in hiring due to employer preferences and/or a perceived group difference in the mean of unobserved variables, while the second part captures discrimination in hiring due to a perceived group difference in the variance of unobserved variables. In our study, the second part is of main interest, since it reveals to what extent the result of a particular correspondence study is affected by its design, i.e., the level of standardization of the qualifications included in the job applications. Neumark applies his method to the data in the seminal correspondence study conducted by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) and finds indicative evidence of that the degree of discrimination depends on perceived group differences in the variance of unobserved variables. Baert et al. (2013) also applies Neumark’s method, but to their own data, and find a similar result. In the current study, we use Neumark’s method to analyze to what extent a perceived group difference in the variance of unobserved variables is an issue in a number of already published correspondence studies. To this end, we use data from three experiments conducted in the Swedish labor market between 2005 and 2007. In two of the experiments, our results indicate that the degree of discrimination depends on perceived group differences in the variance of unobservables, while in one experiment there is no evidence of a dependency4. The next section explains the issue with perceived group differences in the variance of unobserved variables and the level of standardization (henceforth the HS critique, since it was first discussed in the seminal paper by Heckman and Siegelman, 1993). Section 3 explains Neumark’s method in more detail, Section 4 describes the correspondence studies used to implement Neumark’s method, Section 5 presents the main results, and Section 6 concludes.",12

While income maximization is often viewed as a major determinant of international migration, maximizing income alone may not lead to utility maximization, since other factors such as weather, culture, and the crime rate are also considered by potential migrants in making a final migration decision (Borjas 1989). However, many of these migration determinants are unobserved and interrelated (Massey et al. 2010). For instance, due to income transfers, individuals with a family member abroad, a factor known to facilitate international migration, may have a higher income level than individuals lacking such a link (Massey et al. 1993). Even if we are able to disentangle and measure these unobserved factors, it would be unclear how to quantify their aggregated effects on migration. In this study, we look for a comprehensive measure that can capture many of the aggregate effects of multiple migration determinants, including both the effect of income difference and the effects that income difference fails to capture as indicated by Borjas (1989). As a measure of the quality of life, subjective well-being (SWB) may be a plausible candidate for such a measure. Oswald and Wu (2010) found a link between SWB and several objective factors, indicating that SWB contains “genuine information about the quality of human lives”. Therefore we expect that SWB may capture some objective factors which influence migration decisions. Furthermore, many unobserved determinants of migration may alter a potential migrant’s subjective perception of well-being, and thus could be captured by SWB which reflects both objective and subjective conditions (Diener 1984). Freeman (1978) raised a similar point that satisfaction,1 an important component of SWB, depends on some unobserved factors. Otrachshenko and Popova (2014) also noted that life satisfaction may be used as a proxy for unobserved factors. Some studies use SWB as a predictor, where it can help explain human behavior such as quitting a job, child development, or even wearing a seatbelt (Clark 2001; Park 2004; Goudie et al. 2012). To test the validity of using SWB to explain international migration, another human behavior, we estimate the effects of SWB on international migration desires. Using actual migration data might generate different results, as a desire does not necessary translate into action due to obstacles such as policy and physical barriers. But a link between actual migration and individual SWB is not investigated here due to lack of access to follow-up interview data. Fortunately, migration intentions and aspirations have been shown to be good predictors of future actual migration behavior (Van Dalen and Henkens 2008 and 2013; Creighton 2013) and in the Result section we test the validity of using migration desire for the purposes here. While many researchers use the term “migration intention” to describe future possible migration behavior, we use the term “migration desire” since the main survey question we used is not about planned actions. However, our results are also robust to a question related to migration intention (see Appendix A for more details). Literature has found that the level of SWB may be affected by many factors. In a review paper of the determinants of SWB, Dolan et al. (2008) summarized that “poor health, separation, unemployment and lack of social contact are all strongly negatively associated with SWB.” Income is expected to be a major determinant of SWB, since higher income would allow an individual to purchase more goods and thus help enhance utility. Although the Easterlin paradox suggests that higher income does not increase happiness at the country level (Easterlin 1974), researchers have posed challenges to Easterlin’s finding in recent years. For instance, using the Gallup World Poll data, Deaton (2008) demonstrated a log-linear relationship between average SWB and GDP per capita across countries. Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) found a positive relationship between GDP per capita and SWB across countries. Kahneman and Deaton (2010) found that high income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being. Researchers also claimed that an income-SWB link might not be consistent across the income levels. For instance, Diener and Seligman (2004) indicated that the income-SWB link may be less significant when income exceeds certain level. However, using the Gallup World Poll data, Stevenson and Wolfers (2013) studied the income-SWB link at both individual and country level and found a significant and consistent income-SWB link for both poor and rich countries. A positive income-SWB relationship is important for our analysis. If SWB were not associated with income, given that income is an important determinant of migration, it would be hard to justify that SWB is a comprehensive measure of the determinants of migration. Simpson (2013) made a similar point that “the relationship between income and happiness is central to the study of happiness and migration.” However, another concern may arise: since income is associated with both migration and SWB, a SWB-migration link may be due to the confounding factor – income. We are unconcerned about this endogeneity in this study since we do not attempt to find a causal relationship between SWB and migration, but rather a correlation between two. In other words, we do not investigate what causes migration; instead, we look for a comprehensive indicator for it. In a similar study focusing on the effects of happiness on emigration rate, Polgreen and Simpson (2011) also had a research scope: “the correlation between happiness and migration, instead of the direction of causality.” In sum, while SWB and income are highly correlated, SWB is expected to capture many unobserved factors that income may not be able to capture, and thus may be a more comprehensive indicator of migration than income. Previous studies mostly focused on how actual migration experience affects SWB. For example, while migration experience by a household member increases the life satisfaction of the members who do not migrate (Cárdenas et al. 2009), immigrant’s life satisfaction may decrease after migration or be lower than residents in destination countries (De Jong et al. 2002; Bartram 2011). Simpson (2013) presented a detailed literature review on the relationship between happiness and migration. Some measures which may be similar to SWB have been employed to study their effects on migration. For instance, for a survey conducted in Texas, respondents with “a lot of joy” from their neighborhood are less likely to move in the next year, as compared to respondents with “little or no joy” (Bucchianeri 2007). In Latin America, people satisfied with their economic situation are less likely to migrate (Graham and Markowitz 2011), and people with high life satisfaction have less intention to migrate abroad (Chindarkar 2014). In Central and Eastern Europe, people dissatisfied with life have a higher intention to migrate (Otrachshenko and Popova 2014). These results indicate that SWB and migration may be correlated in certain regions. If so, it becomes important to investigate if this relationship holds globally. But responses to a consistently-worded question over many regions have not been analyzed heretofore. Our study is also different in that we use the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale (Cantril 1965) to measure SWB, while previous related studies used life satisfaction (Chindarkar 2014; Otrachshenko and Popova 2014) and happiness (Bucchianeri 2007; Graham and Markowitz 2011). Kahneman and Deaton (2010) speculated that the Cantril question is “a purer measure of life evaluation than the life satisfaction, which has an emotional aspect.” Migration, a big decision for an individual, is unlikely to reflect mainly emotional behavior, so we choose to focus on responses to the Cantril question.

Yet, it quickly became apparent that any legislative success will have to inevitably come at the expense of increased immigration enforcement. In 2012, investments in immigration enforcement reached $18 billion –a figure that far exceeded government spending on all the other major federal law enforcement agencies combined (Meissner et al.2013). However, to this date, there remain important questions regarding the effectiveness and consequences of such investments at the federal, state and county levels. In this paper, we focus on one particular lateral consequence of stepped up immigration enforcement –namely, how it may impact remittance flows. Remittances play an important role in developing economies, including those in Latin America and the Caribbean (Maldonado et al.2010). Nowhere in that region are remittances larger than in Mexico, where they represent the second source of income after oil and reached $22.5 billion in 2012 (Fundación BBVA Bancomer 2013). Increased immigration enforcement could curtail these vital money flows in various ways. First, the growing number of initiatives at the state and local level targeting the removal of undocumented immigrants might reduce immigrant inflows. According to the Pew Hispanic Center analysis of Mexican government data, the number of new immigrant arrivals from Mexico fell from one million in 2006 to 404,000 in 2010, with recent net migration being close to zero (Passel and Cohn 2012). In line with those figures, the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics showed that border patrol apprehensions in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972 as fewer people were trying to cross the south border. Second, increased immigration enforcement might further disrupt the historically cyclical pattern of Mexican migration. Undocumented Mexican immigrants, who accounted for approximately 60 percent of all illegal immigration in 2011 (Hoefer et al.2012), are now more likely to stay in the U.S. for longer periods of time (Massey et al.2002). This practice may weaken their ties with the home community, reinforce the development of new ties and responsibilities in the United States, and ultimately their lower remittance outflows (Hagan et al.2008Amuedo-Dorantes and Mazzolari 2010). Third, the expanding use of employment verification (E-Verify) systems might reduce Mexican migrants’ earnings –especially among the undocumented. They might be forced to look for work in the informal sector, where pay discrimination and other abuses are more dominant. Their lower earnings can, in turn, constrain their ability to remit money home. Despite the various channels through which increased immigration enforcement might lower remittance flows, there is evidence of the exact opposite (World Bank 2006, Mahuteau et al.2010, Varsanyi 2010, Vaira-Lucero et al.2012, Piracha 2012, Piracha and Zhu 2012, Gatina 2013). Specifically, fearing that their time in the country may be cut short, migrants may save and remit more as an insurance mechanism (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006). Alternatively, legal migrants in a position to send money home might increase their money outflows altruistically to help deported family members or to make up for lower remittance payments from undocumented relatives. In this study, we assess how increased immigration enforcement at the county and state levels impacts Mexican migrants’ remitting patterns. At the state level, we focus on the role played by E-Verify mandates and a few 287(g) agreements signed by states with the U.S.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). At the county level, we consider 287(g) agreements –typically signed at the county level, as well as the Secure Communities program. Due to the similarity in spirit of 287(g) agreements and the Secure Communities program –designed as a continuation and replacement of the 287(g) agreements, we combine those two measures into what we refer to as police-based initiatives, and explore their impact along with that of employment-based initiatives, such as E-Verify mandates. We combine: (a) data on migrants’ remitting patterns from the Mexican Migrant Project, and (b) data on the adoption date and geographic scope of the aforementioned immigration enforcement measures. We then exploit the geographic and temporal variation in the adoption of tougher immigration enforcement measures to gauge their impact on Mexican migrants’ remitting patterns. Since, by definition, immigration enforcement targets undocumented immigrants, it is natural to explore how this group’s remitting patterns are impacted by the aforementioned initiatives relative to those of their documented counterparts. Yet, it is worth noting that more than 16 million undocumented immigrants in the United States reside in mixed-status families (Passel and Taylor 2010Debry 2012).1 Therefore, legal immigrants may also react to the various measures in place. For instance, they might face growing financial responsibilities now that other household members are unable to work and, consequently, become less likely to remit. Still, legal migrants in a position to remit might increase their remittances for multiple reasons. Perhaps, they wish to make up for their undocumented family members’ restricted ability to remit or, if some of their family members were deported, they might need to increase their remittances to support those relatives as well. Alternatively, legal immigrants may want to build up some savings with the purpose of returning to Mexico in the future, perhaps to join other family members, or they might want to ensure themselves against what appears to be an increasingly hostile environment in the United States. Furthering our understanding of how increased immigration enforcement at the county and state level is impacting remittance flows is now more important than ever for, at least, three reasons. First, remittance flows to Mexico are not only the second source of revenue for the country after oil and the largest in Latin America and the Caribbean, but have also been shown to have significant multiplier effect on economic development and growth in that region (Taylor, Mora and Adams 2005Adams and Page 2005). Second, increased immigration enforcement may not only negatively impact Mexico via reduced revenues, but also the United States by curtailing Mexican migration. After all, low-skilled immigration over the past decades allowed for a substantial reduction in the price of locally-traded goods and services that are immigrant-intensive in the United States (Cortés 2008).2Third, any successful comprehensive immigration reform proposal will most likely have to increase immigration enforcement and expand E-Verify nationwide. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of how immigration enforcement and, more broadly, U.S. immigration policy impacts remittance flows is critically important when drafting viable economic development policies.",4

Economic and community decline
 From a business perspective, with lower levels of social cohesion there is less trust and lending, as well as higher default rates among microfinance cooperatives (Costa and Kahn 2003; Alesina and La Ferrara 2005; Putnam 2007), since individuals do not feel bound to maintain face before their friends and neighbors by not defaulting. There are also problems in innovation and coordination leading to successful competition in the international market by small vs. large firms. This has been pronounced in the case of Italy and several other European countries (Ramazzotti 2010). At a continental level, the seminal work by Easterly and Levine (1997) has shown that heterogeneity leading to decreased social cohesion in Africa is associated with more clans, more crime, more black markets, and much lower levels of country-wide growth than otherwise similar countries in the continent with lower levels of heterogeneity and higher social cohesion. These effects are understandably affected by levels of political stability and democratic rights. Other work, however, has found little effect of crime in mitigating the social cohesion-diversity relationship. This is true although Putnam (2007) initially posited a very strong effect in this area (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002; Mohan et al. 2011). At the community level, there is less fundraising in schools, lower rates of participation in social reform projects, fewer people volunteering or giving to charity, less contribution to schools, fewer friends, lower levels of happiness and more television watching (Putnam 2007; Poterba 1997). In a sense, one possibility is that with lower levels of social cohesion and more heterogeneous communities, there is simply more difficulty in sharing resources in ways individuals deem to be equitable (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002). While a lack of social cohesion owing to diversity may have the benefit of causing greater private production - or even “patronage”, as in publicly provided private goods - (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005), there will be lower levels of provision of the public good and other ills just described, making it unclear which is really the best strategy to employ. 
Measuring social cohesion
 Social cohesion is generally conceived of as either social capital maintenance or else methods of creating solidarity and equality of access. While there are other conceptions and definitions of this term, these two appear to be the most commonly used in the literature and closest to their initial intent—especially in the burgeoning economics literature. Measures of social cohesion have included, as a few examples: membership in networks, social solidarities, membership in clubs/associations/volunteer work, social trust, social order, common values, civic participation, and place attachment (Galabuzi and Teelucksingh 2010; Demireva 2011; Vigdor 2004). It is for this reason that the present analysis focuses on volunteering in clubs (the most frequently employed measure, aside from “general social trust”) as well as employing measures of voting in one of the auxiliary analyses. While social cohesion has been extensively discussed, there is no commonly agreed upon method for choosing the outcome (or outcomes, if multi-faceted and, perhaps, a “better” measure) representing social cohesion. It does appear that stated levels of trust or club participation (such as volunteering) have received the most support as measures of social capital maintenance. An additional reason for using club associations are their high documented correlation with social trust (Glaeser et al. 2000; Alesina and La Ferrara 2002) —although the direction of causality is unclear. Hence, the focus of the current work on volunteering behaviors. The use of clubs and associations/volunteer memberships runs afoul of the possibility that these groups maintain the embedded class structure and reflect individuals that have access to resources. Scholars have begun to reconsider and give less credence to this idea, since membership in voluntary associations and religious groups has indeed become much more heterogeneous—exhibiting both “bridging” (relations to out-groups) as well as “bonding” (relations to the in-group) types of social capital. For the reasons mentioned above, voting is used to generally confirm and extend the main results of the present analysis. 
Immigration and social cohesion
 After seeing the societal ills an erosion of social cohesion can cause-either in the real world, theoretically, or in experimental games (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005) - and after understanding what social cohesion actually means, it is apparent that when Putnam (2007) demonstrated that immigration (as a form of increasing ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity) in Italy eroded social cohesion, he caused quite a commotion. If, in fact, immigration causes a significant decline in social cohesion leading to economic decline, countries need to reevaluate their immigration policies. Although immigration and diversity in general has many, possibly longer-term, benefits, not the least of which are an increased opportunity for innovation by immigrant entrepreneurs and scientists, a richer culture, long-run growth, positive (or at least neutral) effects on native student achievement, and the benefits of “portfolio diversity insuring against risk” (Costa and Kahn 2003; Putnam 2007; Neymotin 2009), the negative effects are numerous. In terms of economic stability, it would then be very possible that it is these same effects which are responsible for our current economic decline. For this reason, among others, a literature has recently developed to test the veracity of Putnam’s claims and, more generally, the strength of the relationship between immigration/diversity and social cohesion worldwide. For the most part, evidence in the aforementioned and other studies showing that immigration and heterogeneity decrease social cohesion at the country level has been shown to be overstated, since accounting for income inequality decreases the strength of the stated relationship (Green et al. 2011; Kesler and Bloemraad 2010; Demireva 2011; Letki 2008; Alesina and La Ferrara 2005). After including measures of inequality—whether Gini coefficients, the fraction of individuals below the poverty line, the 90/10 ratio, or the average to median income in communities or countries—the effect of immigration on social cohesion declines in magnitude and significance. This is especially true for European studies, with U.S. studies breaking with the general trend by generally maintaining a clear and significant effect of immigration in decreasing social cohesion (Becares 2011; Galabuzi and Teelucksingh 2010; Hooghe et al. 2009). Nevertheless, some of the problems with which very few of these studies have been able to contend (whether Putnam’s original study) or later work, have been (1) difficulty controlling for selection based on preferences for local good provision, (2) issues with the small size or highly-aggregated nature of the data, and (3) difficulty finding credible measures of inequality and fractionalization. As Simpson (2006) notes, fractionalization may actually not be measuring what we want it to, so that the current reliance on the fractionalization index which is actually quite crude as a measure may be faulty. The present analysis is an attempt to address these issues. Immigrants, generally a lower income group, will, on average, increase the number of people with “low levels of access,” thus, the relationship is almost definitional. However, the use of income inequality may be more than a truism, since Putnam’s definition of social cohesion falls closer to the idea of “social capital” and its maintenance. Unfortunately, many of the measures of both social capital and social cohesion as inequality reduction are very similar—making it difficult for researchers to decide exactly which ones to employ. Work by Alesina and La Ferrara provides a good framework and reasons why immigrants should have lower levels of social trust and cohesion. Specifically, it could be said that immigrants exhibit many, if not all, of the characteristics of individuals likely to have reduced levels of social capital, and hence low social cohesion as measured by social capital maintenance. Immigrants are often in the lower income tiers, and may additionally suffer from discrimination—by language if not always by ethnicity, although generally the wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants represents a minority to the United States. Also, immigrants have lived in the area for a shorter period of time with fewer ties to the location—although some would argue that, although individual immigrants have weaker ties to other individuals, their communal ties tend to be stronger than those for natives—see for example Gorney and Torunczyk-Ruiz (2011). Lastly, immigrants tend to locate in areas of higher income inequality (selection) making them less likely to have high social capital.",1
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,27 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-3-4,The wider economic impacts of high-skilled migrants: a survey of the literature for receiving countries,December 2014,Max Nathan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Skilled migrants are becoming an increasingly important element in global migration flows, especially to more developed nations. Between 2000/1 and 2010/11, for example, OECD countries saw total migrant stocks rise by over 20% to about 100m people. During the same period, the number of tertiary-educated arrivals rose by 70%, over three times faster than the global count, reaching 27.3m in 2010/11 (UN-DESA, OECD 2013). Skilled migrants now comprise nearly 29% all migrants in OECD countries, up from 24% in 2000/1. These shifts seem to be structural; during the past two decades the US and many European countries have experienced not just one-off migration ‘shocks’ but continuous ‘waves’, leading to permanent changes in population and workforce composition (Vertovec 2007). In turn, this has prompted many researchers to look beyond the short-term impacts of migrants on the labour market (about which we know quite a lot) towards longer term, dynamic effects on the rest of the economy (about which we know much less). In recent years, the economics of migration field has seen a rapid rise in studies exploring what we might call ‘the wider effects of migration’ – and the role of high-skilled migrants in these processes (Chiswick 2005; Huber et al. 2010b; Kerr and Kerr 2011; George et al. 2012; Hanson 2012; Lewis 2012; Nathan 2012a; Kerr 2013). ‘High-skilled migrants’ are usually defined in terms of formal qualifications (education to degree level or beyond). In other cases the focus is on occupations requiring advanced training (scientists, engineers, researchers and other professionals). Alternatively, human capital is defined in terms of attitudes and soft skills (entrepreneurial drive and aptitude) as well as qualifications. Nesting high-skilled migration within models of long-term economic development (Lucas 1988; Romer 1990) helps identify some potential ‘wider impacts’. For instance, migration may pre-select entrepreneurial individuals who contribute to new business formation, or ‘stars’ who generate new ideas (Bonacich 1973; Borjas 1987; Zucker and Darby 2007; Honig et al. 2010). For firms, diverse workforces may generate production complementarities, particularly in high-value, knowledge-intensive sectors (Fujita and Weber 2003; Page 2007; Nathan and Lee 2013). Access to co-ethnic networks can assist knowledge diffusion, lower co-ordination costs and thus improve international market access (Kapur and McHale 2005; Saxenian 2006; Saxenian and Sabel 2008; Foley and Kerr 2013). We may also see indirect effects on market structure. New firm entry spurs competition in domestic markets, forcing incumbents to innovate and raise their productivity (Aghion et al. 2012); migrant diasporas may help shift overall patterns of trade between home and host countries (Docquier and Rapoport 2012). In theory, as we shall see, there are constraints on all these channels, and their effects are ambiguous in size, sign and significance. In practice, the available evidence often – though not always – turns up small, robust positive aggregate impacts. The wider economic impacts of high skilled migrants are still poorly understood, and future research needs to plug a number of important gaps – not least, the distributional impacts of skilled migrants on different native workers and sectors (Collier 2013). However, the importance of these issues should already be clear to policymakers in more developed countries, who are faced with both an opportunity (more skilled migrants) and a challenge (developing policies that optimise welfare gains and minimise losses). Given their traditional focus on jobs and wages, the ‘wider impacts’ research agenda has potentially profound implications for migration policies in many countries. This review is based on research originally commissioned by the UK Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), and follows the broad outlines of that brief1. The 78 studies reviewed involve a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches, drawing on large-scale data sets, surveys, case studies and in some cases historical analysis2. The field focus is on economics, but papers are also drawn from geography, urban studies, management, entrepreneurship, innovation and trade. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets out a simple two-part framework for thinking about the impacts of high-skilled migration on the receiving country. Section 3 discusses these channels in more detail. Section 4 sets out the empirical evidence, by channel and country covered. Section 5 summarises, outlines some policy implications, and identifies areas for further research.",49
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,24 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9039-3-3,Relative labor supply in intermarriage,December 2014,Olga Nottmeyer,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Marriages between immigrants and natives, here termed “intermarriage”, are often viewed as indicator of social proximity and possibly a driving factor of individual economic success. Being intermarried seems to signal greater commitment and better integration in the hosting country, as, on average, intermarried immigrants tend to have better education, are more likely to work in high-qualified jobs and earn more than singles and immigrants who live with other immigrants1. Structural characteristics of the marriage market, such as availability of potential partners within the own ethnic group, interference of third parties, personal characteristics such as age at immigration, years elapsed in the country and education are among the most important factors determining intermarriages (see Kalmijn 1998). Besides determinants of intermarriage and intermarriage patterns, research has increasingly focused on intermarriages’ potential effects on economic outcomes such as immigrants’ wages in the U.S., Australia, and France, and on employment and self-employment rates, e.g. of U.S. immigrants2. However, little is known about what happens within the household and in particular how intermarried couples differ from immigrant and native couples with respect to the division of labor. Some studies, starting with Baker and Benjamin (1997) and followed by Blau et al. (2003) and Basilio et al. (2009), look at labor market behavior of immigrant families upon arrival. They find mixed evidence for the “family investment hypothesis” which states that immigrant wives tend to take on “dead end” jobs upon arrival in order to finance their husbands’ human capital investment. While this is supported by findings from Canada (Baker and Benjamin 1997), immigrant couples in the U.S. seem to equally invest in human capital accumulation upon arrival and findings by Blau et al. (2003) do not support this hypothesis. Equally, such behavior is not found for immigrant couples in Germany (Basilio et al. 2009)3. This investment strategy affects the degree of labor market participation within immigrant partnerships and is therefore related to the question addressed in this paper: The difference in relative labor supply and the degree of specialization of intermarried couples in comparison to immigrant and native couples, and its relation to differences in bargaining power. Diverging degrees of specialization could arise from smaller comparative advantages in intermarriage due to positive assortative mating by education and differences in partners’ perceived bargaining position. The former implies that spouses have similar education levels, which leads to more similar productivity levels and therefore similar wages. As a consequence, opportunity costs are similar and both partners have similar incentives to work in the labor market. In this context, potential earnings and wages are two possible measures for bargaining power as, for instance, Lundberg and Pollak (1996) discuss in detail. Another potential measure of power is the perceived influence on financial decisions. Friedberg and Webb (2006) use self-reported information about who has the “final say” in financial questions, and Beegle et al. (2001) look at ownership of household assets to measure bargaining power. This paper uses similar variables, namely “distribution of income” and “final say on financial decisions”, to relate intermarriage to self-perceived bargaining power. Given the interdependencies between perceived power, wages and hours worked, it is however difficult to determine the direction of causality, so the aim of this paper is not to identify causality but rather to highlight some interesting correlations. The empirical analysis builds on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), which offer the possibility to incorporate unobserved, time-invariant factors (due to its panel structure) and various individual’s and couple’s characteristics (an advantage of the richness of personal aspects covered)4. It is assumed that the degree of specialization is the outcome of an underlying optimization problem where each couple maximizes its combined utility function. Complete specialization - in the sense that one partner is the main bread-winner and the other partner focuses exclusively on home production - is thus one optimal solution of this problem. As a consequence, a two-limit Random Effects Tobit model is used to account for these corner solutions in the couple’s maximization problem. To control for possible endogeneity between intermarriage and relative labor supply, the functional form assumptions of the Tobit model are successively relaxed, leading to an instrumental variable (IV) estimation. In that IV regression an ethnicity-gender ratio is used as identifying restriction - similar to those proposed in previous studies on intermarriage, e.g. by Meng and Gregory (2005). Even though its use as instrument is not indisputable it serves well as a first indicator for how intermarriage relates to specialization. The analysis considers cohabiting (heterosexual) couples and proposes a gender-neutral specialization index to measure to what extent one partner contributes to the mass of couple’s working hours. This approach is motivated by work by Stratton (2005) and Bonke et al. (2008) who use a similar design to study differences in the degree of specialization in household tasks between married and cohabiting couples - and between couples in the U.S. and Denmark respectively. The decision of how much to work relative to the partner depends, among other factors, on the expected gains from specialization and the bargaining strength of each spouse. If expected gains are low and the risk of divorce is high, less specialization is optimal. Plus, if bargaining strength is high more labor supply is expected. Empirical findings indicate that intermarriage is, indeed, related to less specialization: Especially mixed couples of immigrant men and native women are less specialized than immigrant couples. (For immigrant women this relation also holds but is somewhat weaker). Furthermore, intermarried immigrant men are less likely to be the sole decision maker in the household, while in immigrant households financial decisions are mostly made by the husband. This indicates more bargaining power of the native partner, especially the native wife, probably due to better and more similar education, better outside options and thus different threat points, that is different, presumably better prospects in case of divorce5. In contrast, natives in intermarriage seem to specialize more than native couples, possibly indicating that natives view female labor force participation differently than immigrants, and that intermarried natives adapt to their partners’ views in order to mitigate conflict potential within the partnership. Hence, native couples may have more egalitarian views which may lead to less specialization compared to couples with more traditional role models. In the next section the determinants and economic implications of intermarriage are discussed. In addition, an outline of the theory behind intra-household division of labor is given. Section 2 then explains the construction of the specialization index, followed by a summary of definitions and the data description in Section 3. In Section 4 the empirical results are presented and discussed including a subsection that contains some robustness checks based on measures of bargaining power. The paper concludes with a summary of results and an outlook for further research.",7

However, the distributional effects of migration may changethe skill composition of labor in the receiving and sending countries. This is the caseif, for example, a country experiences a steady inflow of workers whose skill level ison average higher than the skill level of the average native worker. The induced changesin the labor force have the direct effects on inequality through changing the shares of“poor” and “rich” people in the economy, as long as skills arecorrelated with wealth. They affect the wages of high and low skilled labor in theeconomy. Individuals may react to such changes in labor force quality by changing theirinvestment decisions, including those regarding their investment into human capitalacquisition. As another example, low skill immigration may increase the overall qualityof the labor force, if it brings about a larger increase in the quality of the nativelabor force. We measure the quality of the labor force by the incidence of skilledworkers in it. We define skilled and unskilled workers by their highest attained levelsof education, albeit we understand that skill is a broader category than education. The economic consequences of migration have been one of the central topics of laboreconomics since Chiswick (19781980) andBorjas (19831985). While variousdistributional effects have been considered in the ensuing literature summarized inKahanec and Zimmermann (2009), there is little empirical evidenceon the relationship between migration and inequality, although the distributionaleffects of migration drive public attitudes towards immigration and the related policydiscourse (Constant, Kahanec, and Zimmermann, 2009; Epstein, 2013). We consider the relationships between economic inequality, the quality of the laborforce, and international migration from the perspective of developed countries receivinginflows of migrants. We first start from Kahanec and Zimmermann (2009) to link inequality to the share of skilled workers in the labor force.In the Appendix, we prove in a theoretical framework that skilled immigration promotesincome equality. We econometrically investigate the relationship between (i) labor forcequality and immigration and (ii) inequality and labor force quality using countrystatistics from the OECD Statistical Compendium and a unique compilation of inequalitydata provided by the WIDER institute at the United Nations University. We find evidencesupporting the hypothesis that skilled immigration supports equality.",9

Building on thisliterature, this paper adds new insight on the interaction between the individualdecision to migrate and aspirations for the future, by asking whether aspirations arethe cause or rather the consequence of migration, or both. Using longitudinal household survey data from two waves of the Indonesian Family LifeSurvey (IFLS) collected in 2000 and 2007, our research is motivated by a puzzle we haveidentified by comparing recent migrants and non-migrants with respect to their currentsubjective well-being and their (economic) aspirations for the future. In terms ofcurrent well-being, we find a rural–urban divide with higher levels of subjectivewell-being reported in urban areas, which is a known phenomenon also in other contexts(see Knight & Gunatilaka (2010) for China, or Fafchamps &Shilpi (2008) for Nepal). Interestingly, no significantdifferences in subjective well-being are observed between those respondents with recentmigration experience and the non-migrants, neither in rural nor in urban contexts.However, migrants express strikingly higher levels of aspirations for the future thannon-migrants, with only weak differences between rural and urban populations. Whilemigrants are as (un-) satisfied with their current economic situation as non-migrants,migrants are much more ambitious about the future. The key question is now: Whatexplains this difference in aspirations? Are migrants simply a self-selected group ofindividuals with higher aspirations? Or, are these higher levels of aspirations rather aconsequence of the migration experience itself, that is, does the migration experiencegenerate higher aspirations? And if there is a relationship between aspirations and thedecision to migrate, is it non-linear with highest migration propensities forindividuals with ‘middle-range’ aspirations? Section 2 discusses the concept of aspirations by providing a theoretical rationale forits relevance as an individual-specific cause and consequence of migration decisions,and specifies hypotheses to be tested in this paper.

Blau,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In this paper I examine the relationship between gender roles in immigrant source countries and immigrant and second generation behavior in the United States. I particularly highlight the role of assimilation, which results in immigrants becoming closer to their native counterparts over time and across generations versus the role of culture, which is associated with the persistence of immigrant-native differences. My consideration of these issues is based on my recent work on this topic with Lawrence Kahn, Albert Liu, and Kerry Papps (i.e., Blau et al. 2011; Blau et al. 2013; and Blau and Kahn forthcoming). I am greatly indebted to my coauthors, most especially Lawrence Kahn, with whom I developed this research agenda. Our work builds on earlier research for the United States suggesting a role of culture—measured by source country characteristics—on the gender roles (i.e., fertility and labor supply) of immigrants and their children. Blau (1992) found a positive effect of source country fertility rates on immigrant women’s fertility, and Antecol (2000) found that source country female labor force participation rates were positively correlated with US labor force participation of immigrant women. With respect to their descendants, Antecol (2000) also reported a positive, though weaker, correlation between US and source country participation for “second and higher generation” immigrants defined by their answer to the 1990 Census question on ancestry. Similarly, Fernández and Fogli (2009) found the labor supply and fertility behavior of US-born daughters of immigrants (the second generation) to be positively associated with both female participation and fertility rates in their parents’ country of origin based on 1970 Census data . Fernández and Fogli’s work, in particular, is important in rigorously testing the importance of culture in the context of the second generation. The major contribution of the line of research that I summarize here is to empirically analyze and rigorously probe the evidence on the role of source country gender roles in influencing the behavior and outcomes of immigrant women the United States. Further, this work sheds new light on the assimilation process, both over time in the United States and across generations, by analyzing it in the context of the impact of source country culture. Prior work showing positive correlations between source country gender roles on the relevant behavior of immigrant women in the United States is highly suggestive of a role of culture. Our work on immigrants (Blau et al. 2011; Blau and Kahn forthcoming) aims to move this research forward by its detailed and more rigorous analyses of the cultural link, comparable to previous work on the second generation. Our findings help not only to establish a role for culture on immigrant women’s behavior but also, in our view, provide reassurance that immigrants can constitute a reasonable group among which to examine the possible impact of culture on behavior in the face of concerns that immigrants are a selected group and that the immigration process itself can impact behavior, e.g., through disruption (Fernández and Fogli 2009). Our richer tests of the role of culture in impacting immigrant women’s behavior described below include the following. First, in Blau et al. (2011) we show that differences in U.S. labor supply behavior between immigrant women from high versus low female labor force participation source countries persist with time spent in the United States. While there are alternative possible interpretations of the source of this association, it is indeed suggestive of a role of culture. In addition, in contrast to most earlier work,Footnote 1 we control for a variety of other source country characteristics which may affect immigrants’ labor supply behavior in the United States, thus increasing the likelihood that our models estimate the true effect of source country female labor supply rather than the impact of omitted factors that are correlated with this variable. Second, in all the research described below for both first- and second-generation immigrants, we employ a “falsification test” by examining male behavior. For immigrants, we examine the relationship between source country female labor supply and male immigrants’ US behavior and outcomes. The lack of an association for males strengthens our confidence that we are indeed identifying the effect of gender roles in the source country on female behavior rather than the impact of a source country factor like unmeasured productivity or work orientation that affects men and women similarly. To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to employ this approach for immigrants and, indeed, in the published literature, for research on the second generation as well.Footnote 2 Third, in Blau et al. (2011), unlike previous work on immigrants, we explore a number of specifications which distinguish the impact of husbands’ and wives’ source country variables similar to Fernández and Fogli’s (2009) study of the role of culture in second-generation women’s behavior. For example, for husbands and wives from different source countries, we distinguished between the effects of a woman’s own source country female labor supply from that of her husband’s. Consistent with a role for culture, we find both matter, though, as one might expect intuitively, women were more responsive to their own source country’s culture than their husbands’. In addition, we investigated the impact of source country female participation of immigrant men on the labor supply behavior of their native-born wives and do find such an effect, a result highly suggestive of a role for husbands’ source country culture. Finally in Blau and Kahn (forthcoming), we use the New Immigrant Survey to provide evidence that further bolsters the claim that the impact of source country female labor force participation represents in large part the effect of culture. We first show that the impact of source country female labor supply on the US labor supply behavior and wages of immigrant women overwhelmingly remains even when we control for the women’s own pre-migration work experience. This demonstrates that the finding of the impact of source country female labor supply likely reflects the effect of a community level characteristic like culture rather than the fact that women from high labor supply source countries are more likely to have worked themselves before migrating. As explained in more detail below, this is conceptually similar to an approach employed in Fernández and Fogli’s (2006) examination of the impact of culture on second generation women’s fertility. Second, by distinguishing between the impact of source country female labor supply on the labor supply versus the wages of immigrant women in the United States, we are able to provide evidence that suggests that the major portion of the impact of source country female labor supply is due to its effect on culture rather than its effect of social capital.Footnote 3 Third, we also give detailed attention in this paper to the possibility that our results are driven by immigrant selection, concluding that selection does not provide a plausible alternative to culture in explaining the pattern of our results. In our work on the second generation (Blau, Kahn, Liu, and Papps 2013), we examine the process by which source country culture gets transmitted to future generations in the host country by looking explicitly at intergenerational transmission from immigrants to their children born in the United States. This stands in contrast to earlier work on the second generation (e.g., Fernández and Fogli 2009), which focused on the impact of source country characteristics on the behavior of second generation immigrants. One of the purposes of our paper is to shed light on the rate of assimilation across generations, and we provide explicit estimates of intergenerational transmission rates. Our preferred, parsimonious specification includes simply the parental generation characteristics and controls for the individuals’ age, family type (immigrant father and native mother; immigrant mother and native father, with the omitted category being both parents immigrants), and survey year. We exclude potentially endogenous individual characteristics like education, location, and marital status. We thereby allow parental generation characteristics to influence respondent’s outcomes both directly and indirectly through their effects on respondent’s education, location, and marital status. I focus on these results below. However, I note that when we expand our basic specification to include controls for these other individual characteristics (i.e., education, location and marital status) as in Antecol (2000) and Fernández and Fogli (2009), the results are similar providing suggestive evidence that parental generation characteristics do affect individuals’ preferences. In addition, we also examine the impact of source country characteristics on second generation behavior, finding similar results to earlier studies (Antecol 2000 and Fernández and Fogli 2009). This more directly tests the hypothesis that source country characteristics influence the behavior of second generation immigrants in the United States. Finally, as in the case of our studies of immigrants, we estimate our basic models for second-generation men. Of particular interest is that for immigrant generation education, a plausibly gender neutral variable, we find strikingly similar results for second-generation men and women. For immigrant women’s labor supply, a potentially gender-linked variable, we find evidence of a stronger effect on labor supply for second-generation women than for second-generation men; and for immigrant men’s labor supply we find evidence of an effect on second-generation men’s labor supply but no evidence of such an effect for second-generation women. Our work on the second-generation advances the literature in a number of other ways. First, our data source, the Current Population Survey (CPS) has information on the country-of-birth of both parents, permitting us to gauge the relative importance of the characteristics of immigrant mothers versus immigrant women from the fathers’ source country, as well as the strength of intergenerational transmission for individuals with two foreign-born parents compared to those with only one. Previous studies like Fernández and Fogli (2009) are only able to match second-generation individuals with their fathers, due to the incomplete Census data on the birthplace of foreign-born mothers. If gender role transmission from mother to daughter is especially strong, this omission could be particularly important for a study of the transmission of gender roles. In fact, we find that second-generation women’s education, fertility and labor supply are significantly positively affected by the immigrant generation’s levels of these variables but that the effect of mother’s source country fertility and labor supply is generally larger than that of women from the father’s source country and the effect of the education of men from the father’s source country is larger than that of women from the mother’s source country. Second, our data on the second generation from the 1995–2011 CPS provides an updated consideration of the issues of gender and culture compared to the 1970 Census data employed by Fernández and Fogli (2009). (The 1970 Census was the last Census to collect data on foreign parentage.) Since 1970, there have been considerable changes in the composition of immigrant parents by source country, as well as in aggregate female labor force participation and fertility rates in the United States that might affect the findings. US gender roles in the 1990s and 2000s were considerably different from what they were in 1970, with far higher levels of female labor force participation, as well as lower fertility rates (Blau et al. 2014). And, immigration to the United States has shifted from being a largely North American and European phenomenon to a largely Asian and Latin American one. Further, there is a growing gap between the labor supply of US-born and immigrant women today than in earlier years (see below). Thus, the process of assimilation of second generation women into the US labor market may very well have changed since 1970. Before delving into the specifics of our research, it is useful to consider the context and motivation for the work. This comes from two sources: first, the increasing importance of immigrants and their children in the population of the economically advanced nations, including the United States, which is my focus here, and second, the increasing interest of economists in the influence of culture on economic behavior and outcomes. Turning first to the growth of immigration, as in much of the economically advanced nations, immigrants are comprising an increasing share of the population in the United States. The share of the foreign-born in the population has increased from 4.8% in 1970 to 12.9% in 2012 (US Bureau of the Census web site: http://www.census.gov). Further highlighting the growing quantitative importance of immigrants is the growing share of US children who were either immigrants themselves or who had at least one immigrant parent, increasing from 13 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 2008 (Fortuny 2010). Not only has the immigrant population increased in size, also of importance is that there has been a substantial shift in the source countries of immigrants: in 1970, 70.4% of the foreign-born population came from Europe or North America, while, by 2012, 81.6% were from Asia or Latin America (US Bureau of the Census web site: http://www.census.gov). As the share of the US population born abroad increases and as immigrant source countries shift towards regions with different cultures and traditions from the predominantly European origins of earlier arrivals, the extent of assimilation and the role of culture move increasingly to the forefront. This has particular salience for gender roles, since immigrants increasingly come from countries that have a more traditional division of labor by gender than the United States in that they have, on average, lower female labor force participation rates and higher fertility rates than the United States (Blau et al. 2011). Mirroring this, there has been a growing gap between the US labor supply of native and immigrant women since 1980. This raises a number of questions that I will address in this paper. Are immigrant-native differences in labor supply related to source country characteristics? What happens to the time pattern of this gap—do immigrant women assimilate to native patterns over time? Do persistent immigrant-native gaps plausibly reflect the role of culture, or are alternative explanations likely? And, do immigrant generation-native differences in labor supply and other traits carry over to the second generation, or do second generation women fully assimilate to native patterns? Heightening the interest in examining immigrants and their descendants through the lens of culture is a growing attention among economists on the role that culture may play in economic life. “Culture” may be defined as the impact of preferences, beliefs, or values developed in a different time or space (either geographic or social) on economic behavior (, Fernández 2008). While tastes and preferences play an important role in economic models, it is seldom possible to observe the determinants of preference formation. Relating the behavior of first and second generation immigrants in the United States to source country characteristics provides a mechanism for studying the role of culture and thus getting inside the “black box” of taste formation. Correlations between source country characteristics and immigrant behavior may, however, be due to a variety of factors. Hence such correlations need to be probed to ascertain their likely source in cultural differences, and I summarize our efforts to do so below. One particularly intuitive alternative explanation for such correlations is that, rather than reflecting the impact of culture, they are due to the impact of “social capital.” Social capital denotes social interactions or community-level characteristics that enhance skills or productivity and hence wages. Social capital can, for instance, take the form of role models, expectations, behavioral norms, and interpersonal networks (see, e.g., Dasgupta 2008; Borjas 1992; Coleman 1988; and Wilson 1987). While the mechanisms of transmission of culture and social capital may overlap, the crucial distinction between the two is that culture operates mainly through preferences and beliefs, whereas social capital is expected to impact productivity and wages. As I describe in more detail below, this distinction forms the basis of Kahn’s and my effort to distinguish between the two empirically (Blau and Kahn forthcoming). In particular, following Fernández and Fogli (2009), we assume that social capital is correlated with an impact on wages but culture is not. In our context, this means that we test the role of culture vs. social capital by examining the extent to which the impact of source country female supply on immigrant women’s US labor force participation is due to its effect on wages (i.e., a movement along the supply curve) and the extent to which it cannot be accounted for by wages (i.e., is due to a shift in the supply curve). We acknowledge that this distinction between culture and social capital is not watertight. For example, a preference for market work could also have the consequence of increasing productivity through its effect on increasing the amount of work experience accumulated. And, conversely, higher wages may induce greater work experience, which might itself affect one’s attitudes toward and preferences for market work. Nonetheless, examining the role of wages in explaining the source country labor supply effect is likely to be instructive.",14

The largest of these movements was the migration of ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people from the republics of the former Soviet Union (further fSU) to Russia. According to the 2002 Census, 5.2 million people living in Russia in 2002 resided outside the country in 1989. That is, 3.6% of the 2002 population immigrated to Russia since 1989. Almost all of them (3.4% of the population) immigrated from the former Soviet republics. Most of them arrived to Russia in the early and mid-1990s, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The majority of migrants arrived from Kazakhstan (1.4 million), Ukraine (0.8 million) and Uzbekistan (0.6 million.). In this paper I study two sides of the labor market effects of the immigration from fSU countries to Russia. The first side is the process of assimilation of migrants in Russia’s labor market. The second side is the effect that inflows of immigrants had on the labor market position of the local population in Russia. This is the first comprehensive study of the labor market effects of the one of the largest migration waves in Europe in the recent past. I use a large individual level panel dataset, distinguish between short term and long term effects and apply instrumental variables approach to estimate the displacement effects. This study aims to contribute to the vast literature on the effect of international migration on the host country labor market. Specific features of the post-Soviet migration wave to Russia help to isolate this effect from the typical confounding factors such as the effect of ethnic networks on the allocation of migrants, poor skill transferability and host country language proficiency of migrants, self-selection into migration and native outmigration from locations receiving immigrants. The collapse of the Soviet Union is a natural experiment which helps to at least partly address these problems. Geographic position of the source countries and the large size of the host country together create exogenous variation in the local shares of migrants within Russia, which allows identifying the displacement effects using a spatial approach. The natural experiment approach has been used in a number of earlier papers: the most famous example is Mariel Boatlift (Card 1990); Hunt (1992) studied the effect of repatriation of Europeans from Algeria to France in 1962; Angrist and Kugler (2003) used the Balkan wars in 1990s as a natural experiment affecting the number of immigrants in European countries. In this study, similarly to Angrist and Kugler, I rely on the distance between the Russian regions and the source countries, which creates exogenous variation in the share of immigrants to identify labor market effects. Another advantage of my study is the use of micro-level panel data spanning a long period of time (Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for 1995–2009), which allows tracing dynamic long term effects of the influx of immigrants. While there were substantial movements of people among the republics of the Soviet Union before 1991, the reasons for migration and the demographic characteristics of migrants in the post-Soviet period have been quite different from earlier migrations. The existing literature on migration flows in the former Soviet Union since its collapse has emphasized the socio-political factors of migration. Locher (2002) finds that ethnic sorting was the major determinant of migration among the fSU countries, with the stage of transition and the wealth level of countries playing a minor role. Yerofeeva (1999) shows that ethnic repatriation was one of the main reasons for the migration from northern and eastern Kazakhstan. As these studies show, the pushing factors behind ethnic repatriation were the political changes in fSU countries that altered the relative position of non-titular nationalities and, at the same time, removed barriers to migration. Economic factors also affected migration flows to Russia; however, they became more prominent in the late 1990s (Becker et al. 2005). While the decision to migrate was mainly caused by exogenous political factors mentioned above, the choice of location within Russia was to some extent endogenous to the regional labor market conditions. Endogeneity of location choice may bias the estimates of the displacement effects. However, the choice of location by immigrants was not completely unconstrained due to the costs of migration related to the distance and access to information. Given these constraints, there is a relative crowding of immigrants in the regions of Russia that are closer to the border with fSU countries. Russian migration to Russia is a unique case of migration that has some features of both international migration and internal migration. First, as several studies of location choices by international migrants show, this choice is confounded by the presence of co-ethnics in the locality (see Bartel 1989; Chiswick and Miller 2004, 2005; Jaeger 2007; Damm 2009). Migrants in this study are mostly ethnic Russians; hence, ethnic network effects are not very important. For the same reason, Russian migrants to Russia are much less likely to be discriminated against on the labor market than typical international immigrants1. Second, there is a common problem in estimating the effects of migration: people may self-select for migration based on their unobserved characteristics (ability, motivation, risk aversion) which affect their labor market position in a host country (see Chiswick 1999; Bauer et al. 2002). This is much less of a problem in my study as migration was mainly forced by an external political shock, although there is still some scope for selectivity. The estimation results show that male immigrants from fSU countries were fully integrated into the Russian labor market, while female immigrants faced significant wage and employment gaps upon arrival, with their assimilation being quite slow. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogenous choice of the place of residence I find a negative effect of the inflows of immigrants on the local population’s employment (both in terms of increased unemployment and reduced labor force participation) but not on wages. The displacement effects are much more significant for men, which is consistent with the fast assimilation of male immigrants. Apparently they were good substitutes to the local men in the male-dominated occupations. I also show that displacement effects gradually declined and eventually disappeared after approximately ten years since the peak of migration wave. The results of this study have implications for the debate on the effect of immigration on local labor markets, in particular on wages and employment opportunities for the native population. The majority of existing studies find only minor negative effects of migration on the labor market position of locals (see the meta-analysis in Longhi et al. 2005, 2006, surveys in Friedberg and Hunt 1995; Kerr and Kerr 2011, recent evidence in Ottaviano and Peri 2012; Manacorda et al. 2012). My results suggest that immigrants who are close substitutes to the local labor force due to the common language and similar education have more significant effects on the labor market outcomes for the local population. The finding that the displacement effects in Russia dissipated quite slowly may be partly due to the very low migration rates of the local population throughout the transition. Internal migration may dampen the labor market shocks caused by immigrant inflows (see Borjas 2006), but in Russia only around 2% of the population changed their region of residence each year during the 1990s; this number further declined to 1.4% in 2000s. There are studies of the labor market effects of the two other large migration movements following the collapse of fSU: migration from fSU to Israel (about 1 million people during 1990s) and migration of ethnic Germans from fSU and Eastern Europe to Germany (about 2.8 million people). These studies also find quite significant labor market effects of migration inflows (Cohen-Goldner and Paserman 2011; Glitz 2012). My study is the first one to estimate the effects of the largest post-soviet migration wave. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses a framework for the analysis of the location choice of immigrants. Section 3 provides a socio-economic portrait of Russian migrants based on RLMS data and some evidence on their regional distribution. In section 4, I analyze the labor market assimilation and displacement effects of immigrants on the local labor markets in Russia. The last section concludes.",9
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,13 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-015-0043-x,Can immigrants help women “have it all”? Immigrant labor and women’s joint fertility and labor supply decisions,December 2015,Delia Furtado,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The highly time-intensive nature of childrearing implies a tradeoff between fertility and labor supply, particularly for women given their traditional role of performing household work (Becker 1985; Willis 1973). Within-country empirical analyses indicate a consistently negative association between fertility and female labor force participation. However, Engelhardt et al. (2004) find that this relationship has weakened substantially since the 1960s, particularly in the United States, suggesting that women are finding it easier to combine their roles as workers and mothers. Cross-country studies reveal a positive correlation between fertility and labor force participation since the 1980s (Adsera 2004; Brewster and Rindfuss 2000). There is evidence suggesting that high unemployment and unstable employment contracts in Southern Europe combined with the generous maternity benefits in Scandinavia can at least partially explain why countries with the highest fertility rates also have the highest female labor force participation rates (Adsera 2004). Cross-country differences in the cost, availability, and quality of child care, driven mostly by child care subsidies, might also explain why women in certain countries can more easily combine motherhood with labor force participation (Brewster and Rindfuss 1996). Formal child care is typically provided by the private market in the US, and any childcare subsidies are targeted to single mothers at the margin of receiving welfare payments (Blau and Tekin 2007). However, in light of the evidence that immigrant inflows are associated with decreases in the price (Furtado 2015) and likely improvements in the convenience of child care (Cortés and Pan 2013), this paper examines whether and how the increased immigration to the US between 1980 and 2000 has contributed to the decreasing tradeoffs women face when making joint work and fertility decisions. Consistent with the notion that combining mother and worker roles has become easier over time, fertility has been increasing for college-educated women (Shang and Weinberg 2013), the very women with the highest labor force participation rates. Although home appliances, such as microwave ovens, and time-saving products, such as frozen foods, have been found to play a role in explaining increased female labor force participation rates (Greenwood et al. 2005; Coen-Pirani et al. 2010), most of the diffusion of these technologies seems to have occurred before 1980 (Greenwood et al. 2005). Hazan and Zoabi (2014) present evidence of a U-shaped relationship between education and fertility among the newest cohorts of US women. They explain this with a model showing that high wage women substitute housekeeping and babysitting services for their own time in household production thereby allowing them to increase fertility without sacrificing their careers. The authors’ empirical results suggest that this new pattern is attributable to the change in the cost of child care relative to high-skilled women’s wages. Another line of research investigates the relationship between childcare costs and the likelihood that mothers work (Blau and Robins 1988; Connelly 1992; Kimmel 1998; Kornstad and Thoresen 2007). In a survey article, Blau and Currie (2006) highlight the wide-ranging estimated elasticities of employment with respect to child care costs and attribute cross-study discrepancies largely to variation in biases from different estimation strategies. Newer studies estimate mothers’ labor supply decisions by exploiting cross-time and regional variation in the price or availability of care resulting from differences in the implementation of childcare-related public policies (Baker et al. 2008; Cascio 2009; Lefebvre and Merrigan 2008; Lundin et al. 2008; Havnes and Mogstad 2011; Bauernschuster and Schlotter 2015; Nollenberger and Rodríguez-Planas 2015). While these studies generally find that decreased childcare costs increase maternal labor supply, the estimates differ quite substantially. In fact, some studies find little to no causal impact of subsidized child care on mother’s employment (Cascio 2009; Havnes and Mogstad 2011). It may be that subsidized child care simply crowds out informal childcare arrangements (Havnes and Mogstad 2011), but it is also possible that women respond to less expensive child care by having an additional child which then depresses labor supply, perhaps temporarily. Exploiting variation generated from a Swedish childcare subsidy reform, Mörk et al. (2013) find that lower childcare costs lead to more childbearing. Another potential source of variation in the price, convenience, and quality of child care comes from cross-city differences in the availability of low-skilled immigrant labor. My analysis complements a growing literature, pioneered by Cortés and Tessada (2011), examining the relationship between immigration and labor supply decisions of highly skilled native women. Cortés and Tessada find that low-skilled immigration to large US metropolitan areas led to increases in the number of hours worked by women at the top of the wage distribution. Similar conclusions have been drawn for Spain (Farré et al. 2011), Italy (Barone and Mocetti 2011), and Hong Kong (Cortés and Pan 2013). Using data from several countries, Forlani et al. (2015) find similar results and show that effects are larger in countries with less-supportive family policies. Fertility rates of high-skilled US-born women have also been shown to increase in response to immigrant inflows (Furtado 2015). Consistent with the labor supply impacts of immigration literature, Furtado (2015) finds increased likelihoods of women working 50 or more hours a week in response to immigration, but perhaps paradoxically, she also finds decreases in labor force participation rates, a result potentially attributable to women temporarily leaving the labor force upon giving birth but then working long hours upon returning.Footnote 1
 Regardless of whether women respond to immigrant-induced decreases in childrearing costs by increasing labor supply and decreasing fertility, increasing fertility and decreasing labor supply, or even increasing both, lower childcare costs should make it less important to leave the labor force after giving birth. Thus, we should expect that in cities with larger immigrant inflows, the negative correlation between childbearing and labor force participation should become less strong. This is precisely the result in Furtado and Hock (2010). However, the problem with using correlations to measure the difficulty with which women combine their roles as worker and mother is that correlations cannot directly quantify changes in observable outcomes of individuals. In this paper, I start by considering the direct impact of immigration on the likelihood that a woman chooses to both give birth and participate in the labor market shortly thereafter, certainly a more tangible measure of mother-worker role compatibility. Next, I estimate the impact of immigrant inflows on the likelihood of childbearing, the likelihood of participating in the labor force, and the correlation between the two. The structure of the model allows me to then combine these estimates to construct an indirect measure of the impact of immigration on the joint likelihood of childbearing and labor force participation. I then decompose this effect into three components: the effect on childbearing, the effect on labor force participation, and the effect on the correlation between the two. In so doing, I can then determine how much of the increase in the joint likelihood of childbearing and working is attributable to a decrease in the tradeoffs women face when making fertility and labor supply decisions. The difficulty with any empirical analysis of immigration that exploits cross-city variation in foreign-born concentrations is that immigrants do not choose where to live randomly. They may be more likely to reside in areas with an industry mix more (or less) conducive to combining work and family for highly skilled women. It is also plausible that immigrants tend to move to areas with more demand for childcare services precisely because women in these areas want to both have larger families and to work. Following other studies in this literature, I take an enclave-based instrumental variables approach pioneered by Card (2001) which exploits historical settlement patterns of immigrants from different countries. Using US Census data from 1980 to 2000 in conjunction with 1970 data to construct the enclave-based instrument, I find that inflows of low-skilled immigrants between 1980 and 2000 resulted in a higher joint likelihood of childbearing and labor force participation among high-skilled women. These increases were a result of increases in fertility that were accompanied by reductions in labor force participation (LFP) rates. I find that that about 24% of the impact of immigration on the joint likelihood of childbearing and working was attributable to a weakening of the negative fertility-work correlation. This suggests that indeed low skilled immigration has made it easier for women to combine work and family responsibilities. Additional analyses suggest that these results are quite robust and are unlikely to be driven by omitted variable or selection bias. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I describe the model of decision making that underpins my investigation of childbearing and labor force participation patterns. A brief description of the data used in the analysis follows in Section 2. After presenting the main results in Section 3, I discuss how the estimated parameters may be interpreted. I also conduct specification checks concerning the validity of the estimation method and the extent to which geographic selection might affect the results.

The choice to move is typically modelled as an investment decision where the potential migrant weighs the costs and benefits of migration based on the relative economic and non-economic advantages of the source and possible destination locations. Despite the similar decision problem, the destination locations of immigrants to Canada and Canadian interprovincial migrants are quite different. The purpose of the paper is to use Canadian census data for 1981–2006 to compare differences in the location outcomes of these two migrant groups, document how these outcomes have changed over time and to offer some explanations for the differences observed. The puzzling differences in destination locations of the two groups of migrants is of interest in its own right as it may shed new light on migrant decision-making. In addition to academic interest, the differences may have implications for immigration policy. To the degree that both sets of migrants are equally well-informed about economic prospects across Canada but differ in qualifications and regional preferences, the observed differences may reflect optimal decisions by the migrants themselves, suggesting that policy aiming to change locational outcomes is unnecessary unless there some external effects associated with migrant locational choices. Alternatively, the very different locational distribution of immigrants could indicate suboptimal locational choices by one or both of the migrant groups. Perhaps, for example, interprovincial migrants are better informed about regional economic opportunities than new immigrants. If so, differences in the destinations of the two groups may reflect uninformed locational choices by immigrants that result in suboptimal immigrant economic outcomes. Indeed a factor such as this may help explain the deterioration in immigrant outcomes documented in the literature, see, for example, Picot and Sweetman (2005). Such suboptimal outcomes would suggest that an immigrant locational distribution, more like that of interprovincial migrants, may be warranted. Another possibility, with similar policy implications, is that an overconcentration of immigrants in a few key cities may be harming the economic prospects of immigrants. Baglay (2012), for example, cites Canadian work suggesting that “immigrants who live in large cities tend to earn less and face greater challenges in finding work and housing.” Baglay also notes that this “concentration may place greater strain on resources and services in major destination areas,” which also suggests that immigrant locational outcomes may be problematic. Unless these problems are more than offset by other benefits to having immigrants clustered in their current most favored locations, policy aimed at altering immigrant choices may be able to improve well-being. In practice, the locational preferences of immigrants have other implications of concern to policy-makers. In Canada, the lack of immigration in some regions has raised concerns about the economic future of these regions. Little immigration means both a declining population share and an inability to use immigration to deal with regional skill shortages. These types of concerns have given rise to the Canadian government’s Provincial Nominees Program, which aims to create a more balanced regional distribution of immigrants, see Baglay (2012) and Pandey and Townsend (2011). Studies of actual locational outcomes and their determinants, like the present paper, may shed some light on the reasons for the differences in migrant locations and hint at whether a policy response like the Provincial Nominees Program is indeed warranted.Footnote 1 The results may also suggest possible alternative approaches. If, for example, the differences in migrant location choices reflect skill differences between the two migrant groups, the observed location differences may truly represent the best set of outcomes given each group’s skills. This might suggest that no policy is needed or, if policy is thought to be justified in order to achieve regional development goals, it might suggest changes to the selection mechanism for economic migrants that would result in a selection of immigrants that would give locational outcomes more like those of interprovincial migrants.",1

4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,10 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-015-0037-8,International knowledge flows and technological advance: the role of migration,December 2015,Kacey N Douglas,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Standard growth theory points out that technological progress is critical for achieving sustainable economic growth. However, the existing immigration literature analyzing the costs and benefits of immigration has often ignored the possibility that immigration affects the growth of technology in both source and destination countries. Perhaps this failure is due to the fact that the traditional labor market models on which most immigration analysis is based do not address technological change. This paper looks outside the realm of traditional labor market models of immigration to investigate whether immigration can create technological advance and thus long-run economic growth. Traditional labor market models of immigration conclude that international migration leads to an increase in income in the host country and a decrease in the source country. However, if this migration could create knowledge flows from host to source countries, the detrimental effects on source countries associated with outward migration may be less than expected. There are several avenues through which migration can send knowledge from host countries back to source countries. Mayr and Peri (2008) suggest that technology flows back to source countries when migrants return; for example, they provide evidence that highly skilled migrants increasingly migrate temporarily and, therefore, bring back with them the knowledge they acquire abroad. However, with the rapid expansion in information and communications technology (ICT), migrants no longer need to return home in order to influence technologies in their homelands. Migrants in destination countries create “diaspora networks” with the purpose of sharing knowledge with their source countries. In 2005, UNESCO’s Diaspora Knowledge Network (DKN) project was initiated in order to strengthen these networks and their abilities to utilize ICT (Grossman 2010). Though some groups have been more successful than others, the diaspora networks have the ability to advance social and economic development in the home countries (de Haas 2006). Saxenian (2002) also argues that immigration can benefit the source country because immigrants in host countries support their counterparts at home. Using the case of Silicon Valley, Saxenian shows that the numerous ethnic groups, who account for a large number of the Valley’s highly skilled workers, maintain relationships, both social and professional, with their professional colleagues at home, creating information flows back to the source country. This paper extends the existing literature to investigate empirically the relationship between international migration flows and international knowledge flows. Specifically, patent citations are used to measure the relationship between knowledge flows from the United States to a sample of foreign countries and US immigration. First, the methodology for capturing knowledge flows is explained. Next, the econometric model and the data are described. Then, the results of the regression analysis are presented and discussed. Next, sensitivity analyses are performed on the model to determine robustness. Finally, all results are discussed and future refinements and extensions to the hypothesis, the model and the paper are explored. This paper investigates the hypothesis that migration creates knowledge flows from host to source countries. If true, such knowledge transfers and the potential positive growth effects would mitigate some of the detrimental effects of out migration on source countries. According to the literature, this detrimental effect is exacerbated when the migration is “brain drain” migration, namely, highly skilled labor leaving one country to find better economic opportunities in another. As a result, increased knowledge flows offsetting brain drain migration specifically would have a greater impact on reducing the welfare losses associated with outward migration. Thus, we may ask whether the sample countries in this paper have experienced outward brain drain migration. As a partial answer to this question, Saint-Paul (2004) uses US and European census data to reveal that the brain drain process is indeed occurring from Western Europe to the US; Europeans living in the US are vastly outperforming both their American and European counterparts. To this point, the table below shows the percentage of the expatriate population with tertiary education versus the corresponding percentage in home country and the whole US in 1990 and 2000. According to Table 1, Europeans living in the US are more likely than their US counterparts and approximately twice as likely as their European counterparts to have tertiary educational attainment. Furthermore, the table below shows the percentage of European expatriates with a Ph.D. as compared to the percentage of the whole US population in 1990 and 2000 (Table 2). The above table reveals that European expatriates are more likely to hold Ph.D.s than the US as a whole. Likewise, Murakami (2010) suggests that Japan is also suffering from brain drain migration to the US. He writes that “…a considerable number of Japanese researchers and engineers are moving overseas, primarily to the United States.” He goes on to add that “…the number of Japanese individuals living in the United States who have an undergraduate or higher level of education, and who have a degree in a field related to science or engineering is as high as 59,400.”Footnote 1 Thus, the results of this analysis are very relevant in that migration leading to knowledge transfers can, in fact, help mitigate the detrimental effects associated with the brain drain process. To investigate empirically the relationship between migration and knowledge flows, one must first capture some measurement of the flow of knowledge. Knowledge flows, however, are difficult to measure; they rarely leave a paper trail to follow. Different methods have been employed in an attempt attempt to quantify these flows. Regets (2001) uses the existence of international coauthors to measure, in some sense, international knowledge flows. Regets finds that the percentage of a foreign country’s internationally coauthored articles with the US increases with the amount of US doctorates received by immigrants from that country. His findings suggest that migration increases knowledge flows. Coe and Helpman (1995) use R&D expenditures as a proxy for the stock of knowledge with the intent to measure its effects on productivity. They find that foreign R&D increases domestic productivity, indicating some international flow of knowledge. Another method, which is employed in this paper, uses patents; patents contain information that can be used to measure knowledge flows. A patent creates a temporary property right over some piece of knowledge, technique, process, or method; it is granted to an inventor or applicant by a sovereign state, in most cases a country. Often, a patent is an extension of previously patented technology. If so, that subsequent patent (the citing patent) must cite the previous patent (the originating patent) upon which it builds—just as an author of an academic article must cite previous knowledge used. Each patent is recorded as a public document containing detailed information regarding the inventor, including their geographic location. By examining the location of the inventor of both the originating patent and the citing patent, it becomes possible to ascertain the path of knowledge flows—from the location of the originating-patent inventor to the location of the citing-patent inventor. Thus, patent citations can be used as a proxy for knowledge flows. Jaffe et al. (1993) use patent citation data to measure technology flows within North America. Their study finds that citing patents are more likely to occur in the same geographic location as the originating patent, indicating that knowledge flows are geographically localized. Agrawal et al. (2003) use the same methodology as Jaffe et al. to capture knowledge flows in the US and Canada, examining patent activity in areas where inventors previously resided. They find that patents are cited disproportionately where the inventor receiving the patent previously resided, revealing that knowledge flows do result from migration. Though citing patents can be used to measure knowledge flows within a country or region, they have been more difficult to trace internationally. However, a global Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), concluded in Washington Diplomatic Conference on the Patent Cooperation Treaty 1970, made great strides in providing transparency of patents’ information. The PCT currently has 148 contracting member states, and any patent application from a member state is required to include citations of all previous patents upon which this new patent builds. Though patent protection can only be offered within a country, the PCT requires the search for all previous patents be performed on an international scale.Footnote 2 As a result, an inventor seeking to patent in a member country must cite all prior patents, including those from other member countries. The widespread membership of the PCT has successfully ensured the existence of international patent citations. However, while this documentation of international citations exists, it is not widely available. Many patent databases contain only citations of national patents. Even those that do contain international information often have only a limited number of countries included in their database. These data limitations quickly become cumbersome for empirical analysis. As a result, little literature exists investigating the correlation between international migration and international knowledge flows using patent citations as a proxy for knowledge flows. Fortunately, the European Patent Office (EPO) operates a database and patent search engine entitled Espacenet, which contains over 70 million patent documents from 1836 to the present. Each patent document on Espacenet contains information on “citing documents”, which include any citing patents. The citing patents contain information on the country of residence of the associated inventor. If a US patent is cited by a foreign inventor, this is considered a forward citation. This paper uses this database to obtain forward citations as a proxy for knowledge flows from the inventor of the originating patent to the inventor of the citing patent. In order to test the importance of immigration as a determinant of knowledge flows, we specify an empirical model as follows: Number of times a US patent is cited by a unique patent with an inventor from country j at time t
 There are undoubtedly many factors that affect the dependent variable, some specific to the country involved and others which are more general. For purposes of this study, I consider seven.Footnote 3 The independent variables considered here are: Gross domestic product in current US dollars in country j at time t
 Imports of US goods plus exports to US in millions of current US dollars in country j at time t
 Sum of total agricultural patents and patent applications in country j at time t
 Percentage of the student aged population enrolled in tertiary education in country j at time t
 Inward foreign direct investment stock in millions of current US dollars from country j at time t in US Outward foreign direct investment stock in millions of current US dollars from US in country j at time t
 And finally, the independent variable reflecting my hypothesis: Sum of total employment-based immigration (in thousands) to US from country j for five years prior to time t
 For variable data sources, see Appendix (Table 3). A positive coefficient for an independent variable suggests that an increase in the value of that variable increases the amount of forward citations, ceteris paribus. The sign of GDP is expected to be positive; prior literature has shown that, holding other variables constant, patents issued are positively correlated with GDP (Florida 2005). A country with a higher GDP issues more patents, cites more patents in general, and most likely cites more US patents as well. A positive correlation between trade (TRADE) and patent citations has been shown empirically by numerous authors, including Sjöholm (1996), Hu and Jaffe (2003) and MacGarvie (2005). The argument of a positive correlation between patent stock and citations is analogous to that of GDP’s correlation with citations; more patent activity leads to more patent citations in general, including citations of US patents. The stock of agricultural patents and patent applications (PATENT STOCK AG) is included in regression because the originating patents in the sample are agricultural patents; a larger stock of patents may lead to increased patent citations. The positive correlation between education (EDUCATION) and patent citations is expected because higher education leads to a more skilled labor force, which would then be more likely to create technological advance via patents. Both measures of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are expected to be positively correlated with foreign citation of US patents, because FDI has been shown to be an avenue through which knowledge flows from source to host country and vice versa (Saggi 2002, Hu and Jaffe 2003, MacGarvie 2005). The hypothesis explored here is that immigration is also expected to have a positive sign for the reasons outlined above, in particular the host-to-source-country back-linkages resulting from immigration. Specifically, the sign on immigration (IMMIGRATION) is expected to be positive. This paper aims to measure the flow of knowledge from the US outward. To begin, a sample of US patents is chosen and all citing patents from foreign inventors are found.Footnote 4 To do so, each US patent must be searched individually on Espacenet. Then, each citing patent must be investigated in order to gather the necessary information needed for the dataset—namely, country of residence of the inventor and date. Because of the time commitment required to gather this information, it is necessary to narrow down the beginning sample of US patents to a manageable number. Patenting activity in the US is immense; in 1998 alone 163,204 patents were granted. Therefore, a class, or subset of patents, needed to be chosen. One might first consider classes of patents where patent activity is most intensive, such as high-tech patents. Another method would be to consider patents in fields where immigration has had a strong impact. Studies have shown that migrants have had a particularly strong impact in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields and occupations (Kerr 2013). The methodology for choosing the class of patents in this paper is as follows: reverse knowledge flows would tend to be most effective in areas where a large portion of economic activity presides. Developing countries rely on the agricultural sector as both an important source of viability and income. As a result, advances in technology related to agriculture would be highly beneficial for developing countries. Though the majority of the foreign countries in this study are developed countries due to data restrictions, evidence of reverse knowledge flows in the agricultural sector will be of particular import for developing countries. Because the out-migration of highly educated people may be most detrimental to developing countries, the results of this paper could have an even greater impact for lesser developed countries suffering from brain drain migration. So, the knowledge flows related to agricultural are of most interest. Thus, a sample was chosen of US patents consisting of 1,284 patents from US Patent Class entitled “Plant Husbandry” granted to US inventors from 1998 to 2002.Footnote 5 These 1,284 patents represent roughly 2.5% of all US patents granted to US investors over this time period. Plant Husbandry is defined by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as “ … the parent class for apparatus and processes employed in treating the earth and its products and includes all inventions relating thereto that have not been especially provided for in other classes.” This classification contains agricultural patents. The dependent variable in the following regression analysis is number of times a US patent is cited by a unique patent with an inventor from a given country in a given year. Of the 1,284 US patents, 473 (or 37%) have forward citations. The share of forward citations by inventor country is listed below (Table 4): The independent variables consist of factors that could affect the frequency with which these citations occur. That is, the independent variables explain how often a US patent is cited by a patent with an inventor from a given sample country in a given year. The above table also includes the share of employment-based migration to the US by inventor country. Graphically, this data is illustrated below (Fig. 1): 
Notes: The above is a scatter plot of information contained in Table 4. Citations reports forward citations of US by country of inventor as a percentage of total forward citations. Immigration reports employment-based immigration from 1990 to 2010 by country as a percentage of total employment-based immigration from all of the sample countries from 1990 to 2010 The simple scatter plot above shows a clear positive correlation between migration and forward citations, as predicted in the hypothesis of this paper. An empirical model is developed in the next section to further investigate this relationship. Because the dependent variable in the regression is a nonnegative count variable with no theoretical upper bound—it takes on integer values greater than or equal to zero—the most appropriate econometric model for the analysis conducted in this paper is the fixed effects (FE) Poisson regression model developed by Hausman, Hall, and Griliches (Hausman et al. 1984). Consider the following linear model for T time periods: where c

i
 is an unobserved, time invariant effect associated with each US patent. In addition, x

That is, \( {\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}}_{FEP} \) will be chosen to solve the following equation: where: This estimation method has the attractive robustness property that, under only the assumption of exogeneity, the fixed effects Poisson (FEP) estimator, \( {\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}}_{FEP} \), is consistent. The following model was used for the regression: Where i = 1, 2, …, 1284 US patents
 and t = 1995, 1996, …, 2010 Years
Footnote 6
 Due to data restrictions, only 13 countries were included in the set; only information from these countries’ patent offices are contained in Espacenet (for simplicity’s sake, these countries will be called member countries). For example, the US is a member country. This means that information from the USPTO is included in the search engine. Thus, Espacenet will have documentation of forward citations for US patents, including inventors worldwide who have sought patent protection in the US, in any of the other member countries, or in any of the international patent application organizations included in the Espacenet database. China is not a country whose patent office’s information is included in Espacenet. Thus, no citing patents from China will be revealed through an Espacenet search. In other words, citing patents from Chinese inventors will only be found on Espacenet if these inventors are applying for patents in one of the member countries or international patent application organizations. It is highly likely that a nontrivial number of Chinese inventors seek patent protection in China. Thus, a large amount of citing patents from Chinese inventors will not be revealed via an Espacenet patent search. So, it would not be wholly representative to include only forward citations from Chinese inventors seeking patent protection in member countries or the aforementioned international patent application organizations. Therefore, only citing patents from inventors residing in sample countries are included. Results of the above regression are discussed in the following section.",2

At the individual level, the positive effect remittances can have by relaxing liquidity constraints and thus enabling educational investments are often cited and widely acknowledged (see Antman 2013). However, at the aggregate level, the outflow of skilled migrants – what has been termed brain drain – has been characterized as detrimental to the sustainable growth of developing countries. Only recently has this perspective been challenged by various authors (e.g., Stark et al. 1997, Beine et al. 2001), who theoretically demonstrate that the option to migrate can increase human capital investments by individuals. Their argument is rooted in a neo-classical framework emphasizing that the incentive to invest is driven by the possible higher returns to education from going abroad. Since not all individuals who invest in education to migrate actually leave the country, a net increase of the human capital stock in the sending countries takes place. This hypothesis has been supported empirically by recent macro studies (e.g., Beine et al. 2007), but only few studies have attempted to empirically test the human capital externalities of migration at the household level. Batista et al. (2012) are a notable exception, presenting evidence for the case of Cape Verde that cannot reject the brain gain hypothesis. This paper empirically studies the effect of migration on children in migrant sending households and suggests a brain gain effect through a different causal channel. It argues that individuals and households do not maximize their utility independent of their environment and social context but that their decisions, to e.g., invest in education, are bound to the goals and aspirations set by their environments. This approach was suggested recently by Ray (2006), who pointed out that aspirations are an important determinant of behavior and could represent a key element of economic development. In line with this perspective, the hypothesis that individuals adapt their aspirations if exposed to new environments is tested. The variation of norms and values that international migrants are exposed to makes it possible to find out if migration has positive or negative human capital externalities, such as through changing the educational aspirations of households. The empirical analysis of household data from Moldova shows a strong relationship between enrollment, schooling expenditures and the educational aspiration caregivers have for their children. This finding supports the importance of aspirations for the analysis of household behavior. More importantly, using a 2SLS approach to address the endogeneity of migration, the empirical analysis shows a positive short-run impact of international migration on educational aspirations. These results provide a new perspective on the ongoing discussion about human capital externalities of migration and a possible brain gain. The paper thereby contributes to the growing literature about the effects of migration on households in the sending countries with an emphasis on human capital accumulation. By focusing on aspirations, the present analysis is also related to the nascent discussion about the transfer of norms and values in the context of international migration. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section reviews the literature on aspirations and human capital investment and describes the role of migration in this context in depth. Section 3 formulates a simple conceptual framework. The data used for the empirical analysis is introduced in section 4, and section 5 describes the econometric strategy used. Descriptive statistics and estimation results are presented in sections 6 and 7, respectively. Section 8 discusses possible limitations of the analysis, and section 9 concludes.",6

Since the seminal paper by Chiswick (1978), the economic literature has dealt with the immigrant–native gap in the labor market. This gap can be explained by differences in human capital, age, language skills, religious and ethnic origin, and time spent in the host country, among other characteristics. However, the actual immigrant–native gap still remains to be explored. Recent studies have used ethnic identification, i.e., the degree of the immigrant's identification with the culture and society of the host country and the country of origin to explain immigrant outcomes in the labor market. Ethnic identity can change after arrival, as opposed to ethnicity which remains a permanent characteristic of the source country. Over the last years, economists have begun to explore cultural and ethnic segregation using psychology and sociology of identity theories. For example, in a seminal work, Akerlof and Kranton (2000) consider how identity, a person's sense of self, affects economic outcomes. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) define identity as a person’s sense of self or self image, and his or her identity is bound to social categories; individuals identify with people in some categories and differentiate themselves from those in others. Ethnic identity is a measurement of the feeling of belonging to a particular ethnic group. Ethnic identity can be measured in different ways. One method of measurement is simply asking a respondent about his or her identity with the majority group and the respondent’s ethnic group. Battu and Zenou (2010) used this method to examine the relationship between ethnic identity and employment in the British labor market.1 Manning and Roy (2010) found that there is a large amount of variation across countries of birth, and Casey and Dustmann (2010) also used this method in order to examine intergenerational transmission of identity. A different method to measure the intensity of the individual's ethnic identity called ethnosizer was developed by Constant et al. (2009a). This measurement uses information on language, culture, social interactions, history of migration, and ethnic self-identification and can range from zero (full commitment to the host country) to one (full commitment to the country of origin).2 Similar to Berry (1980), the two-dimensional version of the ethnosizer classifies immigrants into one of four states: integration, assimilation, separation or marginalization (see Figure 1). Assimilation (A) is a strong identification with the host culture and society coupled with a firm conformity to its norms, values, and codes of conduct, and a weak identification with ancestry. Integration (I) is achieved when an individual combines, incorporates, and exhibits both strong dedication to the country of origin and commitment and conformity to the host society. Marginalization (M) is weak dedication to or strong detachment from either the dominant culture or the culture of origin. Separation (S) is an exclusive commitment to the culture of origin, even years after emigration, paired with weak involvement in the host culture and country realities. The ethnosizer. The optimal investment in migrants' and natives' networks. Information from a large range of countries is accumulating in the literature on the effect of ethnic identity on economic behavior, such as participation in the labor market, income, and household ownership. Battu et al. (2007) presented a theoretical model of the relationship between oppositional identities among ethnic groups and employment in the labor market. They showed that ethnic preferences are predicted to reduce labor market successes, where preferences are gauged in terms of remoteness, or otherwise, to white norms. Battu and Zenou (2010) illustrated this using data from Britain. They found that non-white individuals with extreme preferences experience a 6 to 7% lower probability of being in employment relative to those with less extreme views. Danzer and Ulku (2011), using data on Turks in Berlin, showed that a high degree of integration (which was a combination of political, social, and economic integration) positively and significantly affects the immigrants' income. In contrast, Casey and Dustmann (2010), using German panel data found no correlation between ethnic identity and various labor market outcomes including wages, participation, employment, and unemployment. However, they found strong intergenerational transmission of identity from one generation to the next. There is also a rapidly growing literature on the effect of ethnic identification on economic behavior using the ethnosizer (see for survey, Constant and Zimmermann, 2008, 2013). Constant and Zimmermann (2009), using data from Germany, showed that immigrants (both men and women) who are separated and marginalized are less likely to work than those who are assimilated. Constant et al. (2011) found that separated migrants have a relatively slow reintegration into the labor market. Constant et al. (2006a) found that for immigrant men, preserving their attachment to the country of origin does not affect their probability of working, as long as they have a strong attachment to the host culture and society. Zimmermann (2007) showed that if male and female migrants are fully integrated, their earnings grow dramatically, but the increase in the females' earnings is higher. Full separation and full marginalization led to a decrease in labor earnings for both male and female migrants. Constant and Zimmermann (2009) did not find any significant effects of ethnic identity on immigrant workers' earnings. Constant et al. (2010) showed that reservation wages increase from first to second-generation migrants, but neither the ethnic identification or the ethnosizer does not explain much of this reservation wage gap. Constant et al. (2009b) found that assimilated or integrated households are more likely to own a house than those who are separated or marginalized. Similar to the ethnosizer, Drydakis (2012), using data from Greece, suggested that ethnic identification is a combination of language, cultural habits (food, media, music and reading), self-identification, social interaction, and future citizenship plans. He found that assimilation and integration dramatically increase the immigrant's wage, whereas separation and marginalization decrease it. Gorinas (2014), using a Danish survey, extended the ethnosizer by developing the modernization index to measure openness to majority norms. He showed that immigrants, particularly first-generation immigrant women who share social norms with the majority experience significantly better employment outcomes but that immigrant employment is almost unaffected by ethnic identity. This paper contributes to the rising literature on ethnic identification by offering a simple theoretical model to provide possible explanations for the different empirical results obtained in the literature. We also introduce new results that could be estimated empirically. The remainder of the article has the following structure. In the next section, we present the model. Section 3 presents the empirical illustrations of the model. The final section offers a discussion.",10

These studies realise that neglecting return migration can generate a bias in cohort-based measurements of migrants’ integration and that it may reveal indirect effects of migration1. However, the simple neoclassical static model, predicting that migrants return when wage differentials decline, is unable to explain much of the observed variation in return migration. For example, Dustmann (2003a) shows that a rising wage differential may actually lead to higher return rates. Dynamic models that take the endogeneity of the decision to return into account are better able to explain migrants’ return decisions2. Dustmann (2001) suggests several motives that determine migrants’ choice to return and finds that preference for the home country is an important factor in the choice process. However, in specifying the model, Dustmann follows the rest of the literature and assumes that home country preferences do not change over time. This is a strong assumption, considering that many studies find a positive association between duration abroad and integration, which lends support to the premise that with time migrants integrate into host country society3. Changes in home country preference may be particularly relevant for migrants who initially have weaker social attachments to the home country, such as those who migrate when single and/or meet their spouse in the host country. In this paper, I use panel data covering a 28-year period from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and try to assess how migrants’ home country preferences change over time. This data set provides unique background information of migrants and their spouses and allows me to study three types of outcome related to home country preference: intentions to return, remittances sent and return realisations. The goal of my paper is an empirical assessment of the research question: Is marriage to a German spouse related to any of the three outcomes? My hypothesis is that migrants’ preferences change with intermarriage, i.e., marriage between a migrant and a host country national, and that intermarriage is negatively associated with home country preference4. But to infer an association between intermarriage and migrants’ home country preference, it is empirically important to distinguish whether home country preference changes with intermarriage or whether the relationship is a spurious one and migrants who intermarry have lower preferences for the home country independent of their spouse. On the one hand, marriage to a native may be a factor that potentially influences positive externalities in the host country5. On the other hand, intermarriage may result from lower preferences for the home country, rather than influencing it. The literature does not provide conclusive evidence as to whether intermarriage influences cultural and economic integration or whether more integrated migrants are more likely to intermarry6. My study contributes to this body of literature by analysing the effect of intermarriage on migrants’ home country preference7. The empirical analysis focuses on linear regression and fixed-effects estimation to deal with unobserved heterogeneity in preferences for a spouse. If more integrated migrants are more likely to intermarry, endogeneity of intermarriage should also be taken into account, but as I do not have a suitable instrument to control for the concurrence of choice of spouse and home country preference, I do not control for endogeneity in this paper8. Instead, I control for individual-level confounding factors and selection on observables. My main findings are that preferences for the home country differ between migrants who marry a German spouse, migrants who marry a non-German spouse and singles. However, much of the negative association between intermarriage and intended return observed in the OLS estimates goes away in the fixed effects model and thus seems to be the result of selection. In contrast, the negative association between remittances sent and intermarriage holds even when I control for unobserved variables, suggesting that migrants’ remittance behaviour changes with intermarriage. The paper is structured as follows: In the next section, the empirical models are outlined, followed by a discussion of the data and variables used in the analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 provides some robustness checks, and Section 6 concludes.",4
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,26 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-015-0029-8,"Projections of potential flows to the enlarging EU from Ukraine, Croatia and other Eastern neighbors",December 2015,Michael Fertig,Martin Kahanec,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The 2013 expansion of the European Union (EU) to include Croatia as its 28th Member State marks the latest move in the process of the EU’s eastern enlargement1. EU expansion is part of a broader process of intensified cooperation with the EU’s Eastern neighbors. This includes countries that have already obtained candidate status, such as Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as countries with which the EU initiated a program of intensified cooperation called the Eastern Partnership (EaP) in 20092. The EaP consists of six post-Soviet states, namely Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, as well as the EU, and is meant to provide an institutionalized forum for the discussion of political and economic topics of joint relevance for all partners. It aims at providing the groundwork for an Association Agreement between the EU and the Eastern partners, which should eventually lead to the establishment of a free-trade zone comprising the 27 EU Member States and the six Eastern partners. In the long run, this might also result in the future membership of these countries. The expansion of the European Union and the prospect of extending free mobility to workers from the EU’s Eastern neighborhood pose the question of the expected scale of its effect on east–west mobility. The size of the potential sending populations and the economic discrepancies indicate the existence of nontrivial migration potential. According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook Database (September 2011), Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have a total population of slightly more than 10 million, and the six EaP partner countries exhibited a population of almost 76 million people in 2009 (i.e., around 18 per cent of the EU27 total), of which approximately 46 million live in Ukraine. The average GDP per capita (pc) in purchasing-power-parities (PPP) in these countries amounted to slightly more than 9,260 US-$ in the same year. However, there is quite a large heterogeneity within this country group. At the lower end of the distribution, Moldova displays a GDP pc in PPP of around 2,860 US-$, whereas Croatia forms the upper end with around 17,800 US-$, followed by Belarus with slightly more than 12,700 US-$. For comparison, the average GDP pc in PPP of the EU in 2009 amounts to almost 29,700 US-$, and in the Euro-area, it amounts  to more than 31,800 US-$. However, also within the EU considerable heterogeneity hides behind these averages. In the past, EU enlargements entailed controversial discussions with respect to the potential consequences of extending the free movement of labor regulation to the new Member States. This was especially the case in the context of the enlargements towards Central and Eastern Europe in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Consequently, existing Member States implemented different policies towards workers from the accession countries (for a synoptic overview, see the European Commission (2008), p. 11). Whereas the majority of EU-15-countries fully or partially restricted mobility for a transitional period of some years, Ireland, Sweden and the UK allowed free access for workers from countries of the 2004 enlargement round from the outset. By contrast, only Finland and Sweden fully opened their labor markets for Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. In particular, the enlargement towards the eight Central and Eastern European countries (EU-8) in 2004 induced migratory movements from east to west, which from some observers were characterized as being “spectacular” (Kaczmarczyk and Okolski 2008), with the different transitional arrangements displaying substantial effects on observable flows. Against this background, this paper aims at assessing potential migration flows to the EU from the countries with which the EU is intensifying cooperation – recent entrant Croatia, several candidate countries and members of the EaP program – by utilizing the experiences of the enlargement wave of 2004. In essence, we venture to answer the question of how much (additional) immigration should be expected if EaP countries were allowed to enter the EU and if free movement of workers regulations were extended to them. To this end, we use a well-established model to estimate the determinants of immigration from the accession countries to the EU-15. This model allows for the distinguishing between short- and long-term factors impinging upon observable migration flows. The long-run coefficients are subsequently used to forecast the immigration potential from EaP-countries under different policy scenarios or transitional arrangements. Since this is a double extrapolation exercise – over time and across space – we have to invoke some identification assumptions that must hold to ensure that the forecasts are valid. Whereas the EaP-countries differ from the EU-8 countries in some aspects, the majority of the EU-8 countries share a common history with the EaP-countries in that they are rather young market economies which all underwent a deep economic and political transformation process during the 1990s. Hence, there are reasons to believe that EaP-countries are comparable to EU-8 countries in many social, economic and political aspects. This comparability is of course understood within pre- and post-treatment periods: EU-8 before EU accession compares to EaP in the beginning of 2010s, and EU-8 after EU accession compares to EaP after hypothetical EU accession. Our empirical results suggest that while economic and demographic variables matter, migration flows are mainly driven by policy variables. From the policy perspective, our key results are that the migration potential from the studied sending countries is modest, the liberalization of migrants’ access to receiving labor markets increases migration flows, albeit only temporarily, and Ukraine will remain the main source country, whereas Germany, Italy and Austria are expected to receive most of these migrants in absolute terms. Relative to the sending countries’ population in 2010, Ireland, Denmark, Finland and again Austria are the main receiving countries, The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide some stylized facts and a brief overview of the literature regarding migration within the EU. Section 3 then describes the theoretical model together with its empirical specification and the utilized data before estimation results are presented in section 4. In section 5, we provide different forecasting scenarios, and section 6 concludes.",6
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,19 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-015-0030-2,The effect of sharing a mother tongue with peers: evidence from North Carolina middle schools,December 2015,Thomas Ahn,Christopher Jepsen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Immigration has increased sizably in the United States and worldwide over the last decade. In 2011, 13.0 percent of individuals in the United States were foreign-born, compared with 11.1 percent in 2000 and 7.9 percent in 1990 (Migration Policy Institute, 2013). In addition to moving to traditional immigrant destinations such as California and Texas, recent waves of immigrants are arriving in states that have had only modest immigration for the last 50 years if not more. One potential consequence of this increased immigration is that sizable numbers of Limited English Proficient (LEP) children attend public schools. LEP students speak a language other than English at home1 and have sufficiently low levels of English proficiency to make them eligible for additional services to improve their English skills. Once LEP students have sufficiently learned “academic” English to participate successfully in the classroom, as measured by a standardized test designed to measure the English proficiency of non-native English speakers, they are reclassified as Fully English Proficient (FEP) and are no longer considered LEP (WIDA Consortium, 2013). Many states are seeing dramatic increases in the LEP population, often from a very low base. For example, the percentage of LEP students has increased by at least 200 percent in Indiana, Kentucky, and South Carolina between 1994–1995 and 2009–2010, although current percent LEP is still below five percent in these states (National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition and Language Instruction Educational Programs NCELA 2011). In North Carolina and Virginia, the LEP population has more than doubled and is now above 10 percent of the school population. These states may not have sufficient resources to educate the rapidly increasing population of LEP students. Although data limitations usually force researchers to treat students with a mix of languages, cultures, and geographic origins as a single LEP category, recent immigration patterns show that LEP students are not a mono-linguistic group. In the United States, for example, the 2012 American Community Survey finds that approximately 21 percent of those surveyed speak a language other than English at home2. Of these non-English speakers, roughly 62 percent speak Spanish or Spanish Creole, 18 percent speak another Indo-European language, 16 percent speak an Asian or Pacific Island language, and 4 percent speak an “Other” language. In many European countries, recent immigrants from Eastern Europe, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian sub-continent, and Turkey have introduced more ethnic and linguistic diversity into schools, creating new learning opportunities and challenges. This increased language diversity in the classroom has potential spillover effects, both positive and negative, on student achievement. For example, teachers may need to alter their teaching practices in response to an influx of LEP students, with the response dependent on the language mix of LEP students. Furthermore, the effect of language mix likely differs between LEP students and non-LEP students. In particular, an LEP student may have additional spillover effects – beyond the “baseline” effect of having LEP peers – due to the share of peers who speak the same non-English language. In this paper, we study the effect of LEP peers on student achievement in North Carolina middle schools, which include grades 6 through 8. Our results are likely representative of many states which have seen dramatic growth in percent LEP but still have relatively small percentages of LEP students. Previous studies have focused on primary school and on areas like California or Texas with large immigrant populations from many countries. Work from outside the U.S. has focused on the effect of immigration rather than language proficiency. Figure 1 shows the distribution of standardized reading scores for all NC middle school students in our sample years, divided by LEP status. LEP students clearly score lower compared to their non-LEP peers. We identify the effect of idiosyncratic changes in peers through a detailed panel dataset of students between 2006 and 2012, along with the use of controls for student, school, and grade-by-year fixed effects to account for student-specific and school-specific differences in peers and in student achievement. This paper is the first to study the extent to which the distribution of languages spoken by LEP students affects the achievement of LEP and non-LEP students. In contrast to previous work, we are able to isolate the effects of having LEP peers from the effects of having low-achieving or low-income peers by including additional controls for these peer characteristics. For non-LEP students, an increase of 10 percent in LEP peers, approximately two students per classroom, is associated with a 0.7 to 1.1 percent standard-deviation decrease in mathematics and reading test scores, respectively. The language concentration of LEP students has no discernable effect on the achievement of non-LEP students. For LEP students, percent LEP is unrelated with reading achievement, whereas a 10 percent increase in LEP peers corresponds with a 2.8 percent standard-deviation decrease in mathematics. Having more LEP students speaking the same language is beneficial for reading achievement and harmful for mathematics achievement among LEP students, but the overall language concentration of LEP students is weakly, if at all, related with LEP students’ achievement in reading or mathematics. Our work builds on previous work using North Carolina data. Diette and Oyelere (2012) estimate the effect of LEP peers on native students’ achievement in grades four through eight. Their results are sensitive to model specification. In their preferred model with school-by-year fixed effects, percent LEP has a negative effect similar in magnitude to our results. However, in their student fixed effects model, percent LEP has a positive association with mathematics achievement. The negative effects in their preferred model are concentrated among students in the top 25 percent of the test score distribution. Diette and Oyelere (2014) further study heterogeneity by student race and gender, finding small negative effects for males and Blacks. Santillano (2009) studies the effect of percent LEP peers in fourth and fifth grade in North Carolina. His preferred method is a matching estimator. Again, the results are sensitive to model specification, although the effects are small in magnitude. Using data from one large, urban school district in the Southwestern U.S., Bui (2014) studies the effects of percentage LEP peers on the fifth-grade test scores of LEP students. She does not study the effects on non-LEP students. She finds that percent LEP is positively associated with mathematics achievement and mainstreaming and negatively associated with grade retention of LEP students. Cho (2012) studies the effect of having LEP classmates on kindergarten and first-grade test scores in Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) data. The author uses school fixed effects and student fixed effects to control for potential non-random sorting of LEP students. The data contain at most two observations per student (one for spring of kindergarten and one for spring of first grade). Having LEP classmates is associated with lower reading scores but has essentially no impact on mathematics test scores. Friesen and Krauth (2011) study the impact of immigration on fourth- and seventh-grade student achievement in British Columbia. The authors use multiple cohorts of students and control for school-by-grade fixed effects. They generally find negative effects of Punjabi-speaking peers and positive effects of Chinese-speaker peers, although the results vary by grade level and test subject. Several papers study the effect of immigrant peers in Europe3. The paper most similar to ours is Geay et al. (2013), who study the impact of immigrant peers on sixth-grade test scores in the UK. Using panel data from the National Pupil Database from 2003 to 2009, they look at the percentage of students in the same grade who do not speak English as the first language. In a model using school fixed effects and school-specific time trends, they find essentially no effect of immigrant peers on mathematics and reading tests4. Similarly, Ohinata and van Ours (2013a) find little effect of the percent immigrant on the achievement of Dutch fourth-grade students in their school-fixed effects models. Other studies using European data have much weaker controls for the nonrandom sorting of students across schools. Brunello and Rocco (2013) use the country level as the unit of analysis to avoid concerns about the sorting of students into schools, using country fixed effects to study cross-country differences in the impacts of immigration. Jensen and Rasmussen (2011) use instrumental variables based on the immigrant concentration in the county to study the effect of immigration on secondary-school test scores in Denmark. Entorf and Lauk (2008) and Schnepf (2007) use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models with no controls for non-random student sorting. However, one concern with all of these papers on Europe is that they do not study the effect of language proficiency. Instead, they study the effects of immigration and/or first language spoken at home. Because LEP students usually become proficient in English after 5 to 7 years of schooling (Hakuta et al. 2000), the vast majority of immigrants who arrive before starting school should no longer be LEP by middle school, the age range we study in this paper. Consequently, in our context, immigration, or even a measure of the first language spoken, is a weak proxy for language proficiency, and these studies likely introduce measurement error as a measure of peer language by using measures of immigration rather than language proficiency. Because these papers focus on the relationship between immigrant peers and achievement, they provide limited insight on the research topic of the current paper, the relationship between peer language mix and achievement. In particular, our focus is most relevant to study the impact of recent immigrant students on their peers. Recent immigrant students who are not proficient in the language and unaccustomed to their new homeland may have a much larger impact on native and non-native peers than those who are fully acclimated. In the methods section, we show how peer language skills in the country’s language affect student achievement. The theoretical argument is much weaker, if not nonexistent, for peers speaking another language at home or for immigrant peers. The literature on immigrant and/or LEP peers also looks at long-run outcomes as well as test scores. Gould et al. (2009) exploit the sizable increase in immigration from the former Soviet Union to Israel to study the effects of immigrant peers on completing the high-school matriculation exam and attending college. Similarly, Conger (2012) studies the relationship between percent foreign born and high school achievement in Florida. Hunt (2012) looks at high-school completion, and Neymotin (2009) looks at college-level outcomes. This literature on immigrant peers builds on a large peer effects literature, particularly on the effect of peers as measured by past test scores. Our methods are most similar to Lavy et al. (2012), who use student and school fixed effects to study peer effects in UK secondary schools. Prominent work on peer effects in U.S. schools includes Hanushek et al. (2003), Imberman et al. (2012), and Burke and Sass (2013)5. Our work differs from previous work in North Carolina in many ways. First and foremost, we study the effect of the language mix of LEP students. Second, we focus exclusively on middle school, whereas Diette and Oyelere (2014); Diette and Oyelere (2012) assume that the percent LEP has a constant effect for grades four through eight, and Santillano (2009) studies grades four and five. Third, we use data from 2006 to 2012 compared to previous work using data from 2006 and before. Fourth, we include additional peer controls for mobility and, more importantly, lagged peer test scores. Fifth, we look at achievement for all students, whereas Diette and Oyelere (2014); Diette and Oyelere (2012) look only at native students. More generally, we provide multiple contributions to this literature. Unlike studies from Europe, we focus on the effect of English proficiency rather than the effect of immigration or of speaking a foreign language at home. We are the first paper in this literature to focus exclusively on middle school, whereas most research focuses on primary school. Our detailed panel data from three consecutive grades (six through eight) allow us to identify effects of peers based on year-to-year changes in students’ peers as they progress through middle school rather than relying on sparse differences such as that between fourth and seventh grade or on transitions between primary school and middle school. Furthermore, our results from the entire middle school population of North Carolina are applicable to many areas in the U.S. – particularly in the South, Midwest, and Mountain regions – with recent increases in immigration. In contrast, studies from specific districts in Texas and British Columbia are of areas with a large base of immigrants from a diverse set of countries, and Cho (2012) looked at survey data from the U.S. as a whole, where areas have vastly different LEP populations. Finally, we are the first study to explicitly disaggregate LEP students (from a single group of “non-English speakers”) and analyze the potential academic impact of differing mixes of students within this group. We use an administrative data set for the North Carolina public school system from 2006–2007 to 2011–2012. The focus is on recent years in order to study the recent increase in non-English speaking students in North Carolina6. The data set contains information on all public schools, teachers, and students in North Carolina. Student data are collected annually and can be matched across years, yielding a relatively complete panel data set of all public school students in North Carolina7. In other words, we have a population data set of North Carolina middle school students, aside from a few atypical schools with very small samples, in contrast to most migration studies that rely on surveys or on small geographic areas. We restrict attention to students in grades 6, 7, and 8 in order to use two-year lags of student achievement and to include course membership data available in middle school. Because we have the capacity to follow the same student through middle school, we observe the majority of students three times. Thus, we have data on four cohorts of students – those who start in grade 6 in 2006, 2007, 2008, or 2009. We collect student demographic information such as gender, race, free/reduced-price lunch status, as well as LEP status. We also collect information on their peers, at the level of class (English and mathematics) as well as grade. Teacher demographic information such as gender, race, and whether the teacher is new to the profession is also collected. Schools who have fewer than 10 students in their grade and students who attend schools with fewer than 30 total students are deleted from the data set8. Relevant student outcome measures are standardized exam scores. All students in grades 3 to 8 in North Carolina must take an end-of-grade (EOG) exam in reading and mathematics. The exam scores are used to generate school-level report cards and enter into the final grade calculations for the students. Therefore, the exams are high-stakes not only for the school, but for the students as well. Table 1 summarizes student and teacher observations. North Carolina has a relatively small LEP population in middle school. Approximately five percent of the student population is identified as LEP, and four percent were previously LEP. Most North Carolina public schools do not provide specialized language programs such as bilingual education, as less than 1/5 of LEP students take a designated English-as-a–Second-Language course. Instead, most LEP students are in “regular” classrooms with non-LEP students. Approximately half the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Forty percent of students are nonwhite: 28 percent Black, 10 percent Hispanic, and two percent Asian/Pacific Islander. The rate at which students switch schools is around 32 percentage points, driven by the fact that most North Carolina middle schools contain grades six to eight. The bottom two panels of the table contain teacher characteristics. Because the characteristics of reading and mathematics teachers are quite similar, the table only contains the statistics for reading teachers. Nearly 90 percent of students have female reading teachers and over 15 have Black reading teachers9. Around six percent of students have teachers in their first year of teaching.",5
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,27 February 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-014-0028-1,An alternative model of international migration: endogenous two sided borders and optimal legal systems,December 2015,Inaam Chaabane,Damien Gaumont,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Australia, Canada, the USA and New Zealand have all been founded by migration. However, nowadays, they have in common the implementation of migration programs to determine who is eligible to migrate. In this paper an optimal legal system of migration represents the optimal migration policy based on economic criteria a given country implements. There are various legal systems of migration: those which are explicit and those which are implicit. It is well understood that most countries do not allow every immigrant to enter their country (by explicit selection devices), but is not well understood that many country refrain emigrants from leaving their country (by implicit stay-home incentives), even if borders are legally open. The objective of the paper is to provide a rationale to these optimal legal systems of international migration. Since countries adopt various migration criteria, among which education is an important one for the social planner, this paper proposes a 3-period overlapping generations model in which individuals train when they are young and work when they are adults. Finally, when old, they optimally choose their retirement date. Such a model allows conclusions on both growth and welfare prior to migration (in autarky) and post-migration (when borders are open on their two sides). The motivation for such a framework directly comes from empirical facts. Australia and Canada have organized an explicit optimal legal system of migration based on points to be accumulated by any would-be migrant. If they succeed in overpassing the threshold, would-be migrants are allowed to settle. A key feature of these legal systems of migration is that the threshold figure is not permanent. It is optimally and legally set by governments given the specific economic needs of the country. Many developing countries (especially in Africa) have chosen an implicit legal system of migration. For instance they prefer to invite foreign professors to teach in the country rather than to let students migrate to be educated abroad. Some others have chosen to finance home PhD programs with a very high research allowance for students, or some others charge very low interest rates on education loans. The main reason for such incentives to stay home is to refrain as much as possible student migration. It costs less to pay foreign professors to teach (and students to learn) than to loose human capital in the future. Indeed, if a student is successful on the foreign labor market, he never return-migrates. In this paper, we describe the two-sided border by the fact that individuals must first “leave” their home country before “entering” the destination country. The literature can broadly be classified between empirical and theoretical studies. Withers (1987), for example, empirically shows that the skill level of migrants arriving in Australia has tended to increase in the postwar period at a more rapid rate than that of the resident population as a whole. In other words, the effectiveness of the points system in raising the mean skill level of immigrants depends on the existence of a large demand for visas to enter Australia. A study of the worldwide market for skilled immigrants by Cobb-Clark and Connolly (1997) suggests that the skills of those wanting to enter Australia are influenced by a range of factors, some of which are internal to Australia (e.g., economic conditions), while others are external (e.g., immigration policies of other countries). These factors are likely to have more impact on immigrant quality than the points system. The points system used in a number of the components of the immigration program in Australia offers a mechanism of selecting immigrants who will adjust rapidly to the circumstances of the Australian labor market and who will bring benefits to Australia. Variations in immigrant quality in Australia are likely to be affected more by conditions in the world-wide market for skilled immigrants than by the Australian points system. Understanding the worldwide market for skilled immigrants and determining the net benefits to Australia of different types of immigrants are important issues for consideration. Theoretical literature concentrates on endogenous quotas of migrants through a voting system which allows governments to implement immigration policies. Epstein and Nitzan (2005) analyze the endogenous determination of a migration quota, viewing it as an outcome of a two-stage political struggle between two interest groups: those in favor and those against the proposed migration quota. Theoretical effects of the government policy depend on whether there is lobbying between those natives who agree and those who disagree with the proposal of a quota of migrants. Mayrs (2010) derives a general equilibrium model with overlapping generations where natives require a compensating wage differential for working in one sector rather than in another. Price and wage effects of immigration are analyzed on natives: the young, working in one of two sectors, and the old. The outcome of a majority voting on immigration is determined by a given sector as well as the social optimum. The main findings are: i) the old determine any majority voting outcome of non-zero immigration into both sectors; ii) socially optimal immigration is smaller than or equal to the majority voting outcome; and iii) immigration is not necessarily a substitute for native mobility across sectors. Candau (2011) analyzes how trade liberalization and immigration can potentially affect the welfare of native skilled and unskilled workers and how this expected impact plays on immigration policy. The novelty resides in the attempt to set up endogenous immigration restrictions by integrating swing voters in a model of geographical economics with two kinds of immobile workers (skilled and unskilled). It is shown that trade liberalization can lead the winner candidate to increase the quota on immigration. Mayr (2012) determines occupation-specific immigration quotas in a political economy framework with endogenous prices and compares them to the social optimum. It shows that positive quotas for specific occupations can be the political outcome, even when total welfare effects of immigration are negative. Two of the main findings are that the (unique) voting outcome on immigration quotas is i) positive if workers are immobile across occupations and ii) negative (positive) for occupations where the native labor supply is sufficiently large (small), if workers are mobile across occupations. Contrary to the brain drain literature, which states that high skilled immigrants benefit the destination country since they generate higher earning profiles, this paper suggests that a legal system of migration that refrains permanent migrations in order to educate young individuals in their home country benefits the welfare of the local country. Our model departs from the literature relative to endogenous quotas. Indeed, we propose an alternative way to obtain the optimal flow of migrants a country is willing to accept. Each social planner chooses the number of migrants that maximizes the welfare of his own country. Since some countries adopt implicit legal systems of migration to avoid brain waste, we choose to build a model where only young individuals are allowed to permanently migrate. The reason is that sending countries loose their human capital throughout the migrant’s life-cycle, as mentioned above. Subsection 8.4 discusses the possibility of return migrations. For now, immigrants will obtain a high education degree in the destination country and get the return to education in this country. The post-migration steady-state equilibrium is a function of the flow of migrants, which is an instrument for the domestic migration policy. Since countries differ with respect to their return to education, incentives for migration exist. The way migration ceases is not a pure market mechanism but the result of the social planner’s decision. The social planner chooses the level of migrants that leads his country to the post-migration static welfare optimum. Due to differences in the return to education, social planners choose different migration flows. Closing borders also means preventing market equalization of prices in the long run, contrary toGalor (1986). Most of the time, the two-sided nature of border crossing is not theoretically analyzed, but empirically, legal migration systems take into account this double reality. In that case, even if countries have the same way of selecting migrants, they do not select the same level of migration flow. The emergence of the asymmetry of borders across countries is due to differences in the return to education. When one of the two countries elicits a higher return to education than the other, the flow of migrants optimally chosen by this country is not equal to the one chosen by the other country. In the case where one of the two countries wants to send more migrants than the other one is ready to accept, incentives for illegal migration exist in post-migration equilibrium. Section 2 presents the model, Section 3 the temporary equilibrium of the economy in autarky, and Section 4 the autarkic perfect-foresight intertemporal equilibrium. Section 5 is devoted to international migration. Section 6 makes the link between theory and applications. Section 7 presents the explicit real optimal legal system of Canada and Australia. Possible extensions of the model are presented in Section 8 prior to Section 9, which concludes.",1

As can be observed from Figures 1 and 2, this movement was essentially from the east and north towards the west and south, that is, from the less developed and poorer parts of the country to the more industrialized and richer regions. As a consequence of this massive internal migration, the urbanization rate has increased from about 25 percent in 1950 to 42 percent in 1975, 65 percent in 2000, and 77 percent in 2011. Now 39 percent of Turkish population resides in a province other than the one in which they were born. This figure was 28 percent in 2000, 17 percent in 1975, and only 12 percent in 19501. Six provinces which collectively make up a third of the country’s resident population have more immigrants than people born there. Only 16 percent of residents in Istanbul province, which includes Turkey’s largest metropolis, and only 32 percent of those in Ankara province, which includes country’s capital and its second largest city, were born there. On the other hand, more than half of the people born in thirty-four of the eighty-one provinces were living elsewhere. Less than a fifth of those born in Ardahan and only about a quarter of those born in Çankırı, Tunceli, and Bayburt reside in their birth provinces. 
Immigrant: proportion of provincial population born in another province (2011).
 
Emigrant: proportion of population born in the province that is residing in another province (2011).
 The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of such large population movements on political participation in Turkey. We examine the impact on the voter turnout not only at the destinations of migrants but also at locations they have left. The former is studied extensively in the literature, but political consequences of migration for sending communities are highly neglected. The small number of studies that exist limited their analysis to a few specific cases and to the effects of remittances and brain drain in the context of international migration, not internal. This is one of the gaps in the migration and turnout literatures we hope to fill. To measure the effects of immigration and emigration on turnout properly, naturally we will have to control for and estimate the impacts of other socio-economic, demographic, political and institutional factors as well. Producing this information is another purpose of this study. There are only three studies on voter turnout in Turkey that go beyond an analysis of descriptive statistics or pairwise simple correlations: a micro study by Cesur and Mocan (2013) and macro studies by Başlevent (2013) and Çulhaoğlu (2007). These studies consider socio-economic factors, but none of them take emigration into account. While the first two include immigration in their regressions, they ignore political and institutional factors. The last one, on the other hand, includes political and institutional variables, but none on immigration. By including all types of variables mentioned in our turnout equation, we hope to measure their individual effects more accurately. Our study should be of interest not only for those specializing in Turkey but for those studying the impact of immigration and emigration in other countries as well. Our results may be of value in particular to those investigating determinants of political participation in West Europe and North America. Most of the countries in the latter two regions are experiencing steady declines in voter turnout, which have reached alarming levels2. No such tendency exists in Turkey, where the turnout rate is about twice as high as in many industrialized nations. Capturing some of the factors which make the Turkish rate so high and non-declining can shed light on the situation in Western countries. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, determinants of voter turnout are discussed, and a model is specified for the Turkish 2011 parliamentary election. In section 3, empirical results are presented, interpreted, and compared to those obtained by other studies. Finally in section 4, the conclusions reached are summarized.",16

Just off the coast of Dakar, Gorée Island hosts the House of Slaves, a museum and memorial to the slave trade out of Africa, one of the most significant forced migration experiences in history and the main inspiration for this lecture. While the slave trades and slavery have long been the object of investigation by historians, a recent stream within the economics literature has focused on its potential long-term consequences on socio-economic outcomes. The aim of this paper is to present my own work and thoughts on this topic, and at the same time to collect a survey of the small but growing related literature. More broadly speaking, this contribution follows the tradition of Engerman and Sokoloff (1997), Hall and Jones (1999), and Acemoglu et al. (2001), who have searched the fundamental, rather than proximate, factors that have determined socio-economic outcomes, with special attention for the potential role of institutional factors such as those shaping labor markets. My goal is to demonstrate that the institutions that permitted the slave trades and slavery, long after their abolition, are still exerting a profound influence on a variety of contemporaneous outcomes, across very diverse areas of the world. Partly because empirical investigations on the slave trade require often hard-to-find historical data, partly because research is simply in its infancy, the available literature including my own contributions has not so far been able to cover all the potentially affected geographical regions and all spheres of possible influence in a homogenous fashion. Nevertheless, it is possible to organize a presentation along two main axes. First, it is natural to distinguish between the long-lasting influence of the African slave trade for the “sending” countries on the one hand and the “receiving” ones on the other. Second, for each set of countries, it is useful to highlight a number of specific economic, institutional, demographic, and social implications which have attracted the attention of the literature. For a selection of issues, I will present new data elaborations based on datasets collected for my previous work. Since African slavery has represented one of the largest—albeit coerced—migration experiences in history, the paper will also emphasize the link between research on the slave trade and the literature on migration, even though this link is still relatively undeveloped. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I provide a short history of the African slave trades. In Section 3, I consider their influence on the sending countries in Africa, with attention to its economic, institutional, demographic, and social implications. In Section 4, I evaluate the consequences of the slave trade on the receiving countries, drawing a further distinction between Latin America and the USA. For the latter, I also briefly discuss the subsequent experiences of the Second Middle Passage and of the Great Migration. Section 5 concludes and collects ideas and suggestions for future research.",11

According to the paper on New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) published by Stark and Bloom (1985), migration is a family arrangement, migrants are chosen according to specific characteristics, they are usually younger and more educated (Stark and Taylor 1989), and it is more likely that international migrants would be males (Massey and Zenteno 1999). Also, having a spouse in the home country increases migrants’ likelihood of return (Constant and Massey 2002). Migration is not a random process; people who migrate usually have different individual, household, and community characteristics than those left behind (Ezra and Kiros 2001; Mora and Taylor 2006). Several theories tried to explain the migration phenomenon. Taylor and Martin (2001) stated that classical and neoclassical theories—despite their contribution to explain this phenomenon from a macroeconomic perspective—could not explain the migration selectivity process (i.e., why do some people migrate while others do not?). Moreover, the theory stresses that migrants’ destinations as well as their probabilities of getting work are a function of their individual characteristics. According to the NELM, migration consists of a household’s strategy that aims at mitigating risks and facing market failures (namely credit and labor markets) in developing countries. Thus, migration is a solution. Remittances sent home by migrants help household to diversify and improve their production systems and thus to minimize risks. Accordingly, migrants play the role of insurer. Remittances also depend on a number of specifications such as age, education, sex, poverty status, agro-ecological stability zone, number of household’s members, land, and livestock sizes. Migration, or more specifically emigration, has been of enormous importance for Syria since many decades. Rural out-migration is becoming one of the most important phenomena that shape the rural areas, namely in the less-favored regions where poverty and environmental risks push people to look for new opportunities outside agricultural sector and rural areas. Migration from Syrian rural areas is increasingly gaining more attention from researchers in socio-economic fields, as limited micro-level studies have documented migration flows from rural areas and the main reasons for such mobility. Available studies focused mainly on internal migration in Syria (especially the rural-urban migration) and the consequences of such trends (Central Bureau of Statistics CBS 2000; Khawaja 2002). Other studies were concerned with migration only as a part of livelihood strategies adopted by households in poor areas (Abdelali-Martini et al. 2003; La Rovere et al. 2009, Mazid and Aw-Hassan 2002). In 1987, the State Planning Commission with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) cooperation and the International Labour Organization (ILO) surveyed internal migration in three main governorates: Damascus, Aleppo, and Homs. Findings from the survey were utilized in implementing the National Strategic Plan for Internal Migration in the Syrian Arab Republic. The study found that the main push factors from rural areas are landlessness, land fragmentation, poor productivity, and small income generated from rural activities while the main pull factors towards urban areas were working opportunities as well as the higher returns from non- agricultural activities especially for highly educated people (Abu-Al Shamat 1991). Another survey on internal migration was conducted in 1999; the Syrian Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in collaboration with the University of Damascus and the Institute for Applied International Studies in Norway (Fafo) conducted the Syrian Internal Migration Survey (SIMS). In his study, Khawaja (2002) summarizes the main survey findings, stating that most migrants originate from rural areas and are usually young and more educated. He indicates that women are most likely to migrate internally accompanied with their family members and that 55.9 % of male migrants aged between 15 and 35 years old, while 58.8 % of female migrants, belong to this category (Central Bureau of Statistics CBS 2007). Our study comes to fill a gap on the factors characterizing migration from one of the poorest areas in rural Syria and determines the drivers for the different migration destinations. This research, initiated on the NELM hypotheses, aimed at analyzing the gendered migration in one of the poorest Syrian dry areas through the individual, household, and community characteristics of migrants. More specifically, our objectives are first, to analyze the impact of migrants’ characteristics on migration destination and sector of employment, second, to measure the impact of migrants’ destination and employment on remittances sent to the left-behind households, and third, to analyze the determinants to remit. Findings suggest that the main factors affecting the choice of migration destination and employment are the sending area (origin of migrants), the age, and the sex of migrants as well as the social ties and connections from origin to destination. In addition, the larger the endowments of migrants’ households, the more the remittances sent back home which indicates the important role of migration in preserving households’ assets in marginal dry areas. The paper consists of the following: Section 2 presents a description of the research site and the data used in the analysis, while Section 3 reviews the analytical methods. Section 4 discusses the main results obtained from the econometric analysis, and Section 5 summarizes the main findings.",1
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,28 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-016-0070-2,Immigration and wages: new evidence from the African American Great Migration,December 2016,John Gardner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"During the African American Great Migration, millions of blacks left their places of birth in the Southern USA in favor of cities in the North. By drastically redistributing the black, this large and prolonged internal migration played an important role in shaping the economic and cultural history of the modern USA.1 In particular, Smith and Welch (1989) show that the Great Migration was integral to the wage gains that blacks made relative to whites during much of the twentieth century (also see Donohue and Heckman 1991; Smith and Welch 1978). Despite its wide-reaching cultural and economic significance, the literature on the Great Migration has largely overlooked its implications for receiving cities in the North, focussing instead on the Great Migrants themselves. An exception is Boustan (2009), who finds that the Great Migration put downward pressure on the wages of blacks living in the North, with little effect on whites’ wages there. This paper redoubles the evidence on the effects of the Great Migration on wages in the North. My findings broadly support those in Boustan (2009), though they suggest that the Great Migration may have decreased the wages of Northern blacks more than previously thought. Importantly, I estimate similar effects using both a local labor markets approach that compares wages among areas with different amounts of Southern immigration and a structural, national labor market approach that combines the estimated parameters of the aggregate production function in the North with observed immigration in order to simulate the wage effects of the Great Migration. The robustness of my findings to different methodological approaches adds credibility to the estimates and to our understanding of the consequences of the Great Migration. In addition to shoring up the literature on the effects of the Great Migration on the North, these findings are of some significance to the broader literature on the relationship between migration (both foreign and internal) and wages. Studies of foreign immigration to the USA have not come to a strong consensus on how contemporary immigrant flows have affected natives’ wages. In general, local labor markets studies tend to find smaller effects (see, for example, Altonji and Card 1991; Card 1990, 2001, 2009) while national labor market studies tend to find larger effects (see, for example, Borjas 2003, 2006; Borjas et al. 2010). The literature has identified a number of confounding factors that may explain why studies taking different methodological approaches come to different conclusions. These factors were less common during the Great Migration period, making it a useful backdrop against which to analyze the relationship between immigration and wages. The most prominent of these explanations is the spatial arbitrage hypothesis, which holds that natives respond to immigrant inflows by migrating internally, attenuating between-labor-market supply shocks, and consequently, estimates of the wage effects of immigration that are based on geographic comparisons; empirical tests of this hypothesis have come to conflicting conclusions (cf. Borjas 2006; Card 2001; Card and DiNardo 2000; Peri and Sparber 2011). During the Great Migration period, blacks living in the North were clustered into a small number of metropolitan areas, effectively limiting their ability to move in response to inflows of Southern immigrants.2 While I find evidence of a white outmigration response to Southern immigration, I find no such response among blacks living in the North. Because I also find evidence of considerable separation between the black and white labor markets in the North, this finding implies that internal migration within the North did not arbitrage away Southern-immigration-induced relative local labor supply shocks for blacks.3
 Another potential explanation for the divergence between the results of local and national immigration studies is that inflows of foreign immigrants to the contemporary USA do not alter the skill distribution in a way that affects natives’ wages in the long run. For example, Card (2009) argues that, since the immigrant and native skill distributions are similar for appropriately defined measures of skill, immigration has had little effect on the relative wage structure. Similarly, Ottaviano and Peri (2012) argue that imperfect substitution between US natives and foreign immigrants, which concentrates the wage impacts of immigration on immigrants themselves, can explain why structural national labor market studies that assume perfect substitution find larger wage impacts for natives. Analysis of the Great Migration does not suffer from these limitations. I provide evidence that, while within education-experience-race groups, Southern immigrants were perfectly substitutable for Northern natives during this period, blacks and whites were not. Consequently, the overwhelmingly black inflow of Southern immigrants changed the skill distribution in the North appreciably. Furthermore, over half of the black population in the North was Southern-born by 1950, implying large proportional shocks to the supply of black labor in the North with which to measure the wage effects of immigration (and by virtue of the separation between the black and white labor markets, with the potential to generate relatively large effects). The labor market effects of the Great Migration are, like those of any immigration episode, idiosyncratic to its historical circumstances. The location decision faced by blacks born in the Southern USA, for example, differed from those faced by potential foreign immigrants to the contemporary USA; the imperfect substitution that I estimate, for another, was likely due at least in part to racial discrimination. Conclusions about the effects of the Great Migration may still be informative about those of contemporary immigration. Just as each immigration episode will impact labor markets differently, depending on the characteristics of its migrants, receiving location, macroeconomic environment, etc., the effects identified by each analysis will be specific to the episode under study. However, each new analysis helps complete our picture of the relationship between immigration and wages.",4

It was stressed that the reduced room for absorbing asymmetric shocks via macroeconomic policy tools in a monetary union required a sufficient degree of labour mobility as an alternative adjustment channel. Empirical analysis revealed that, as compared with other monetary unions, notably the USA, EU countries participating in the EMU did not exhibit a comparable degree of mobility and mobility played a minor role in the process of adjustment (Blanchard and Katz 1992; Decressin and Fatás 1995). Several years have passed since the outburst of the financial crisis, and there is growing attention to the potential contribution of labour mobility to counteract the divergence in growth and unemployment among EU countries and particularly within the euro area. The financial crisis and the ensuing current account and debt crises in the euro area acted as persistent macroeconomic shocks with asymmetric effects, radically changing the economic landscape of the euro area. The convergence in income per capita observed during the first decade of EMU was to a large extent reversed. Countries in the euro area periphery witnessed capital flight, a protracted contraction in domestic demand amid deleveraging and a marked deterioration in their public finances. The rebalancing process involving adjustment in relative costs and prices between net debtor and net creditor members of the euro area is necessary for a durable reduction of external macroeconomic imbalances and the narrowing of unemployment divergences. Such a process, however, can be long-lasting and marked by considerable distress in the countries enduring competitive internal devaluation and high and protracted unemployment. Against this background, labour mobility would help ease adjustment: it would permit a more moderate reaction of activity rates, and part of the divergence in unemployment rates would be absorbed by mobility rather than real wages. The paper starts out by assessing main stylised facts and trends of mobility in the EU. Cross-country mobility flows in the EU appear to remain considerably lower as compared with those recorded in other highly integrated areas, most notably the USA, and well below mobility within countries. Moreover, the majority of the population of migrants in most EU Member States is from outside the EU rather than from other EU countries. Nevertheless, cross-EU mobility is on an upward trend and not only due to the enlargement of the EU to Eastern European countries with high outward migration rates. The main part of the analysis focuses on identifying the dynamic response of labour mobility to labour demand shocks that affect some countries only (asymmetric shocks). To that purpose, a vector autoregression (VAR) model in the spirit of Blanchard and Katz (1992) is estimated for a panel of EU countries. The aim is to assess simultaneously the co-movement of unemployment, labour market participation and labour mobility in response to shocks to labour demand. As compared with recent analyses (e.g. Dao et al. 2014; Beyer and Smets 2015), the focus is on mobility across countries rather than across regions. This is for two reasons. First, it keeps the analysis close to the type of adjustment that matters in response to country-specific shocks. Second, it permits to explore the behaviour of real wages in response to asymmetric shocks, as this is a key variable to allow the adjustment of relative unemployment rates. Compared with previous studies taking a cross-country perspective (e.g. L’Angevin 2007a, b), the availability of longer time series makes it possible to examine if the contribution of labour mobility to labour market adjustment for the typical country has changed over time, most notably after the 2008–2009 crisis. Results indicate that labour mobility absorbs about 25 % of asymmetric shocks after 1 year and about 50 % at peak, after about 5 years. It is also shown that the response of mobility, as well as that of real wages, has increased after monetary unification. At peak, the response of mobility for the post-unification period is about twice as large as that for the pre-EMU period. Some caveats are in order in interpreting these results. First, the Blanchard-Katz methodology followed in this paper and elsewhere identifies migration flows as a residual. The changes in employment that are not explained by changes in unemployment and inactivity are due to changes in the working-age population. Changes in the working-age population that occur in response to labour demand shocks are, in turn, attributed to labour mobility. This method has been devised to circumvent situations in which net migration rates are not available or not sufficiently reliable. In the case of the EU, the available data series “Crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment” includes the effects of revisions of population projections by national statistical authorities. Thus, the time series includes a number of revisions and outliers, which makes its time series properties less than ideal (see Additional file 1 on data sources on migration in the EU). Second, the paper focuses on labour mobility within the EU. However, due to data availability, it is in some cases hard to disentangle whether mobility takes place fully within the EU or also involving third countries. In particular, the VAR analysis cannot distinguish between flows within the EU and with third countries. Such a distinction, although relevant from the perspective of the smooth working of the monetary union, is seldom pursued in similar analyses, partly because of the lack of sufficient data, but also because what is relevant from the viewpoint of the adjustment for the single country is the response of labour mobility to shocks, irrespective whether mobility flows take place with another member of the monetary union. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the case for labour mobility as an economic adjustment channel in a monetary union. Section 3 presents a number of stylised facts of mobility in the EU to serve as context for the main analysis, in Section 4, which assesses the dynamic response of labour mobility to country-specific economic shocks. Section 5 concludes.",20

Occupation-education mismatch can affect the economic integration of immigrants in the host country and the returns to education and experience (Chiswick & Miller, 2008). It can also lead to efficiency losses or even lower economic growth (Ramos et al. 2009). The basic idea is that for each occupation, there is a required level of education at which job performance will be optimal, given technology. If workers do not have the required level of education, there is a mismatch in the worker to job assignment. The literature on this topic is commonly referred to as testing the prevalence and impact of overeducation/required education/undereducation (ORU). Immigrant overskilling has been identified using micro level data in Australia, North America and Europe.Footnote 1 The majority of studies on immigrant overskilling use the ‘realised match’ method which compares an individual’s education level to the ‘average’ level of education in their occupation and then see how this varies by characteristics, such as immigrant status (see Groot and Van den Brink 2000, Rubb 2003 and McGuinness 2006 for reviews of the general literature on occupation-education mismatch).Footnote 2 It is typically found that immigrants have higher levels of overskilling than natives and that this declines only slowly with time spent in the host country. Our main contribution is that we show that, in a context where migrants are more educated on average than natives, this finding disappears if one adds in controls for broadly defined differences in educational levels between the two groups. The simple intuition for this finding is that overskilling is by definition relatively more common among workers with higher levels of education, and thus, what appears to be in our context greater overskilling among immigrants is, in fact, driven by the higher levels of educational achievement found among immigrants and by higher overskilling rates among both more educated natives and immigrants, as opposed to any genuine differences in overskilling between migrants and natives conditional on education levels. More specifically, we use data from the 1996, 2001 and 2006 New Zealand censuses to examine differences between each immigrant’s actual years of education and the estimated average years of education in the narrowly defined occupation in which they work. Because of the skill-based migration system used in New Zealand, immigrants are, on average, much more educated than the New Zealand-born (NZ-born). For example, in 2006, 34 % of immigrants have a bachelor’s degree or higher versus 18 % of the NZ-born. On the other hand, only 10 % of immigrants have no qualifications versus 20 % of the NZ-born. Ignoring these large differences in the educational distribution between immigrants and the NZ-born leads us to conclude that male immigrants are generally overqualified for their occupation until they have been in the country for around 8 years. However, once we account for the fact that the migrant and native qualifications distributions differ (with migrants in New Zealand on average more educated than natives) and that average education-occupation mismatch is education-level specific, we find that migrants are in fact on average undereducated. Given that a number of previous studies have also examined countries with skill-based migration systems, our results suggest that the ubiquitous finding of immigrant overskilling might be overstated. We therefore make a second contribution to the literature and extend the standard empirical model estimated in papers using the realised match approach by estimating models of over- and undereducation that are fully stratified by qualifications. Hence, we ask the question: ‘does the average immigrant work in a more or less skilled occupation than the average NZ-born individual with the same characteristics and the same qualifications?’. We believe that this is the question that the literature has always intended to ask, but was not, in fact, asking. Taking this approach, we find that the extent of undereducation of migrants is far greater than that of overeducation and that both overeducated and undereducated migrants become more similar to comparable native-born with increasing years of residence in New Zealand. Notable overeducation is only present among those with a bachelor degree. In the next section, we discuss the various causes of a migrant’s job-skill mismatch, as well as briefly outline the New Zealand immigration system and show why an empirical model of overeducation should control for educational levels. In Section 3, we outline how we constructed our census dataset and provide some descriptive statistics. Section 4 reports on our main regression findings. The final section concludes.",4

Mason,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At the height of the US civil rights movement in the mid-1960s, foreign-born persons were less than 1 % of the African-American population (Kent, 2007). Today, 16 % of America’s African diaspora workforce consists of first- or second-generation immigrants and 4 % is Hispanic. (See Table 1.) The extant literature argues that black immigrant labor market assimilation is governed by positive selection in the immigration process and lateral class mobility of immigrants.Footnote 1 Further, many immigrants arrive in the USA as children and, therefore, are substantively acculturated to the American society prior to full-time entry into the labor market. These factors should support rapid labor market assimilation. This study empirically describes wage assimilation among black immigrants, with a particular focus on age of arrival effects and their impact on racial wage differentials. The dataset does not have a measure of cognitive ability or quality of education, and this study only imprecisely controls for an immigrant’s education in the USA or a source. Nevertheless, the extremely high years of education of some black immigrant groups, the fact that most black immigrants tend to have above average years of education relative to their home country, and the extremely diverse cultural heterogeneity of black immigrants will help shed light on the importance of race in the American labor market. The research provides answers to several questions. One, are the wages of the second-generation black immigrants greater than, less than, or equal to the wages of the third- and higher-generation African-Americans? Two, how does immigrant wage assimilation vary by age of arrival and by skill group? Three, do black immigrants obtain wages equal to native-born non-Hispanic white males? This study finds that intergenerational improvement is an important path of labor market assimilation. Also, unskilled immigrants who arrive in the USA as children and adolescents experience substantial wage assimilation, especially Caribbean-English and African-English immigrants. But both unskilled immigrants arriving as adults and all skilled immigrants fail to catch up to the wage status of either native-born whites or native-born African-Americans. In particular, after living in the USA for 9–15 years, most first-generation black male immigrants will have wage penalties higher than the black-white male differential for native-born workers. Additionally, second-generation black male immigrants have substantial wage penalties, penalties that are often similar to the penalties of  native-born black males relative to native-born white male workers. Positive selection should lead to rapid the labor market assimilation of black immigrants relative to native-born Americans because the immigration process selects in favor of persons with above average levels of observable and unobservable skills (Butcher, 1994; Dodoo and Takyi, 2002; Model, 2008, 1991; Kalmijn 1996; Pierre, 2004; Hamilton, 2014, 2012). Further, lateral mobility may allow immigrants to achieve American socioeconomic status that is similar to the level of socioeconomic status they held or would have held in their country of origin (Darity 1989; Foner, 1979; Pierre, 2004). With both positive selection and lateral mobility, black immigrants of middle or higher socioeconomic status in their country of origin should achieve the same relative status in the USA, and thus, some black immigrants are more likely to obtain higher socioeconomic status than native-born African-Americans, who are disproportionately poor and of lower socioeconomic status. The large body of research on immigrant assimilation provides comparative benchmarks for what we should expect for black immigrants. Chiswick (1978) found that the wages of white male immigrants catch up with and overtake the wages of native-born American white males within 10–15 years. Unlike Chiswick, Borjas (1985) does not include Hispanics among whites. When Borjas estimates the non-Hispanic white convergence rate for 1970, the rate is 5–10 years for white immigrants to overtake native-born whites. Also, white immigrants overtake native-born whites in 10 years in 1980 (Borjas, 1995). Relative to native-born whites, there is no evidence of earnings deterioration among newly arriving white immigrants in 1970 census (1965–1969 immigrants), 1980 census (1975–1979 immigrants), or 1990 census (1985–1989 immigrants). Borjas (1985, 1995, 2015) finds that the white assimilation benchmark does not hold for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s Hispanic and Asian immigrant cohorts. The earnings of these immigrants often fail to overtake the earnings of either their own racial group or whites. Hence, rather than race or nativity, Borjas (2015, 1995, 1985) argues that the non-white immigrants of the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s are less skilled than the native-born white workers, native-born own-group racial minority workers, and previous cohorts of immigrants. Black immigrants are often highly skilled with origins in countries where English is the official language. Hence, in the absence of discrimination, their wage assimilation should be comparable to white immigrants, rather than the assimilation results of Hispanic and Asian immigrants. Within 10–15 years, black male immigrants should have wages equal to native-born non-Hispanic white males. However, the length of time required for black immigrants to catch up to native-born American worker is not a settled empirical issue. For example, Kalmijn (1996) reports that it takes 12, 34, and 21 years, respectively, for first-generation English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and French-speaking black male Caribbean immigrants to overtake native-born African-American men of the same ancestral origin. However, Borjas (1985: 482) suggests that cross-sectional studies of wage assimilation, such as Kalmijn (1996) and others that dominate the black immigrant assimilation literature, do not carefully distinguish between cohort, duration, and period effects; therefore, these studies may not yield valid inferences on the ability of immigrants to assimilate into the US labor market. Black immigrant cohort effects for 1965–1969 and 1970–1974 are positive, statistically significant, and substantively large relative to 1975–1979 immigrants (Borjas, 1985).Footnote 2 Borjas takes this as evidence of lower relative skill among late 1970s black immigrants. But this evidence is also consistent with an increase in differential treatment for the 1975–1979 cohort due to greater immigrant discrimination and greater racial discrimination. For the 1950–1959, 1960–1964, and 1965–1969 black male immigrant cohorts, there is no or negative within-cohort wage growth, that is, no or negative wage assimilation. On the other hand, there is an across-cohort wage growth, indicating either lower quality or declining market treatment for the 1970–1974 immigrants relative to the 1950s and 1960s immigrants.Footnote 3
 The most recent research argues that the first-generation Caribbean-English black male immigrants who arrived in the USA between 1970 and 1989 and during 1995–1999 overtake the income of native-born African-American males within 11–15 years of living in the USA (Hamilton, 2014). The pre-1970, 1990–1994, and 2000–2007 Caribbean-English cohorts will catch up with but not overtake the native-born African-Americans within 11–15 years of arriving in the USA. All of these Caribbean-English cohorts surpass native-born African-American men after more than 20 years in the USA. The 1995–1999 Latin American cohort of black male immigrants catches up to and maintains parity with native-born black males during the 11th and 20th years in the USA; after the 20th year, they have a premium relative to native-born black males. African-English immigrants of the 1985–1989, 1990s, and 2000s cohorts have the most rapid assimilation. Starting with wage penalties that are 25–35 log points below native-born African-Americans (and 10 log points below Caribbean-English immigrants), they obtain parity with native-born black males 11–15 years after being in the USA. (The 1985–1989 cohort requires 16–20 years, but they have the largest penalty on arrival in the USA (0.355 log points).) No other black male immigrant ethnic group catches up with native-born African-American males. Nevertheless, after 20 years of duration in the USA, even the most assimilated first-generation black immigrants will have very large income penalties relative to native-born non-Hispanic white males. For example, among all black male immigrants the 1980–1984 Caribbean-English and 1995–1999 Latin American cohorts have the smallest penalties on arrival in the USA. After 20 or more years of American residence, the Caribbean-English will earn 6.5 % more than the native-born black males but 14.7 % less than the native-born non-Hispanic white males, while the Latin American immigrants will earn 1.8 % more than the native-born black males and 19.4 % less than the native-born non-Hispanic white males. This study is methodologically similar to Hamilton (2014) but differs in important ways. Both studies control for cohort effects, period effects, and duration effects. Hamilton’s sample excludes individuals who arrived in the USA before age 18, excludes individuals born in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, and does not distinguish second-generation immigrants from third- or higher-generation African-Americans. Hamilton’s duration effects do not control for age-on-arrival. Finally, Hamilton controls for national regions, a broad measure of differences in labor markets. This study controls for the citizenship status of immigrants and years of education obtained in the USA. Native-born African-Americans are separately identified by Hispanic status. Also, this study controls for state of residence rather than region, and there are a complete set of interactions of state fixed effects and time trend. Each of these adjustments affects inferences about black immigrant wage assimilation. Blacks born in Puerto Rico are a large component of Hispanic black Americans, who have a lower wage penalty than non-Hispanic black Americans and therefore represent an important additional comparative group for assessing the extent of assimilation of black immigrants. Intergenerational mobility may be an important path of immigrant assimilation; hence, it is important to distinguish second-generation immigrants from third- or higher-generation native-born African-Americans. For example, Sakamoto, Woo, and Kim (2010) show that second-generation immigrants have a smaller wage penalty than third- or higher-generation African-Americans, even as second-generation penalties vary by ancestral group. Separate equations are estimated for persons 16–64 years of age and persons 25–64 years of age. For the latter group, formal schooling is likely to be completed and the individual is more likely to be a full-time market participant. Immigrants who are also citizens are likely to have superior earnings opportunities relative to non-citizens. Immigrants at least partially educated in the USA may have better language skills, speak without an accent, and have greater familiarity with American culture and labor market opportunities. Additionally, as we show below, the effect of duration in the USA on immigrant wage growth varies greatly by age-on-arrival. Specifically, persons who arrive in the USA prior to 26 years of age have dramatically lower wage penalties than older arriving immigrants of the same cohort and ancestral group and are the only black immigrants able to catch up with and overtake native-born non-Hispanic black males workers—but not native-born Hispanic black male workers or same-group second-generation black male immigrants. Finally, inclusion of state-trend interaction terms allows different trends in economic outcomes across state labor markets. This specification controls for factors within state labor markets that may alter immigrant effects if they are not accounted for by the statistical model. This study is organized as follows. Section 1 presents and discusses the statistical model. Section 2 discusses the data, while the results are presented in Section 3. Section 4 summarizes and briefly discusses the conclusions.",1

Integration is also a social process, which indeed suggests that personality traits are relevant. This paper explores whether and to what extent immigrants and their children with stronger beliefs in their ability to control success tend to be more likely to be employed. In personality psychology, the strength of this belief is referred to as the locus of control (LOC). I am particularly interested in this personal trait firstly because immigrants and their children tend to face obstacles when searching for a job such as language difficulties, cultural differences and potentially discrimination. The sense of personal control can be a very useful personal trait to overcome these obstacles, in particular in Germany, where discrimination in particular in terms of formal degrees was found to be comparatively pronounced (see Section 2). Secondly, it was proven to predict several crucial economic outcomes including the employment probability (see for instance Heckman et al. 2006). As Groves (2005) notes, LOC is potentially the most widely used personality variable in economic research. LOC was developed by Rotter (1966) and is a measure of the degree to which an individual believes he or she has control over the happenings in life. It is represented by a scale spreading from “external” to “internal”. A highly external LOC indicates that the individual believes that life is controlled by forces outside of his or her own influence and he or she does not have a high feeling of controlling life. A highly internalLOC however indicates that the individual believes strongly in the ability to control life. LOC is linked to the concept of motivation: A person with a more internal LOC believes that a given level of effort will lead to a higher reward and thus ceteris paribus will work harder. However, LOC is not equal to motivation as motivation will also be affected by the cost of effort, which is not necessarily correlated with LOC. The LOC of an individual develops over time, with foundations being laid in childhood and adolescence. Education, family background, religion and personal immigration history can play a role to determine an immigrant’s LOC. The econometric approach in this paper for testing the link between LOC and employment probability follows a methodology developed in Carneiro et al. (2003) and was developed in Heckman et al. (2006). I extend their model framework by allowing the measure of LOC to depend on a set of observable determining variables. This extension is based on work by Fahrmeir and Raach (2006). The model is estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. To test the model for Germany, I use the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) database. I find that a more internal LOC has a positive effect on the probability of being employed. Further, I find that being an immigrant is significantly and negatively correlated with having a more internal LOC. This means that there is a risk that immigrants and their children face a double disadvantage on the labour market: they are disadvantaged because of their status as an immigrant and they tend to have a more external position on the LOC scale. Mother’s education is a key factor determining the sense of personal control. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses labour market integration of immigrants in Germany and the link between personality traits, in particular the LOC, and labour market outcomes and integration. In Section 3, I introduce the data used to test the model. Section 4 presents the econometric model. In Section 5, I analyse the results and Section 6 concludes.",

Taken all countries together, however, net immigration has been consistently positive since the 1960s. The first decade of the new century witnessed a new surge of inflows: between early 2000 and late 2010, the stock of foreign-born residents in the OECD rose by around 35 % from 75 million to 100 million (OECD 2014, p. 1). In 2011, foreign-born individuals represented less than 10 % in most Eastern European countries, Greece and Portugal; between 10 and 20 % in the rest of the European Union and the USA (14.9 % in Belgium); and more than 20 % in Australia, Canada, Luxembourg and Switzerland (OECD 2014). In this paper, we are concerned with the relationship between the employment of immigrants and wages, a field of intense empirical and theoretical research in labor economics since the 1950s (Becker 1957; Chiswick 1978; Arrow 1998; Altonji and Blank 1999; Arai and Thoursie 2009; Baert and Cockx 2013; Baert and De Pauw 2014; Baert et al. 2014, 2015). The empirical research in this area is marked by the observation that on average foreign workers with comparable productivity-related characteristics than natives receive lower wages (Bevelander and Veenman 2008; Chiswick et al. 2008; Meurs and Pailhe 2010; Barrett et al. 2012; McGuinness and Byrne 2014; Arai et al. 2015). The relevance of this relationship partly stems from its connection to a series of distributional issues and especially concerns about discrimination and retributive justice. It is also related to other policy debates on immigration, for instance whether countries with wage penalties fail to attract skilled foreign labor or whether the labor supply increase due to immigration exerts downward pressure on native wages. Wages of immigrants have been studied at different levels: individual Mincer-type regressions, but also cities, regions and countries have been the most popular levels of analysis (Borjas and Katz 2007; Arai and Nekby 2007; Arai and Thoursie 2009; Meurs and Pailhe 2010; Dustmann et al. 2013; Mitaritonna et al. 2014; Simon et al. 2014; Arai et al. 2015). While studying wage discrimination at these levels is often justified on empirical and theoretical grounds (Ottaviano and Peri 2012), they are unable to capture appropriately the most important explanans in economic wage theory: labor productivity. Arguing that the latter depends to a large extent on the immediate context in which the employee operates—How much capital is at her disposition? How qualified are her co-workers? What type of technology does the firm use? etc.—a small strand of the literature started to explore wage discrimination against immigrants with firm-level data (Hellerstein et al. 1999; Aydemir and Skuterud 2008). Our paper adds to the literature that consists of the few existing studies that measure wage discrimination against immigrants while accounting directly for productivity effects at the firm level. First, we apply a very recent approach to estimating firm-level wage discrimination against immigrants developed by Bartolucci (2014); we are the first to estimate these effects with a large matched employer-employee dataset covering the Belgian labor market, a country that is generally considered as having comparatively strong anti-discrimination legislation. Second, we address various econometric issues neglected in previous studies such as the potential endogeneity of foreign workers and unobserved time-invariant firm characteristics (we present both FE and GMM-IV estimators). Third, we improve on firm-level studies that focus only on male migrants and study the respective wage effects of the employment of male natives, female natives, male immigrants and female immigrants. Fourth, we test additional hypotheses on whether wage discrimination against foreigners is affected by the level of collective bargaining and firm size. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature on wage discrimination against immigrants and discusses three potential sources of productivity differences between natives and immigrants. Section 3 presents our methodological approach for measuring the relationship between foreign employment, on the one hand, and average wages at the firm level on the other hand. Section 4 presents our dataset and descriptive statistics, whereas Section 5 includes the results of our regression analysis that are discussed in the concluding Section 6.",7
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,26 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-016-0062-2,"Mexican immigration, occupational clustering, and the local labor market adjustment of African-American workers",December 2016,Maude Toussaint-Comeau,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Wages and occupation status are important elements of the labor market adjustments and socioeconomic mobility of individuals. Many workers disproportionately among African-Americans and Mexican/Hispanic immigrants have seen diminished wage mobility and occupation advancements, which have reinforced inequality in the country (Von Lockette and Spriggs 2015). This paper explores the types of jobs held by Mexican immigrants and African-Americans and examines their implications on labor market adjustments and wage mobility prospects of the two groups. Since the 1970s and early 1980s, the USA has undergone a profound transformation in its industrial structure, moving from a middle-wage, goods-producing manufacturing economy toward a service-producing economy. These developments have received considerable attention among researchers who have viewed them as leading to a growing polarization of job opportunities—low-wage service jobs and high-wage professional service jobs (Bluestone and Harrison 1982; Harrison and Bluestone 1988; Lawrence 1984; Kosters and Ross 1987; Adams et al. 1991; Morris et al. 1994). Concomitant increasing monetary returns to education led to expanded employment opportunities in white-collar and professional jobs for the educated domestic workforce. Globalization, increased deregulation, and market liberalization have created a stauncher competitive environment and increased the need for firms to adopt cost- and wage-cutting strategies (OECD 2002). These developments have been fueled with increased labor supply arising from international migration of low-skill migrants, which created added pressure on wages for low-skill workers in the USA (Orrenius and Zavodny 2003). During the 1990s, the number of Mexican immigrants living in the USA rose by more than five million. By the 2000 Census, Mexican immigrants made up more than 4 % of the working-age population, close to twice more than the proportion a decade earlier. By 2003, Mexican immigration to the USA accounted for 28.3 % of all foreign-born inhabitants of the country. Mexican immigrants constitute a sizable and growing segment of the US labor force, accounting for over 1 million of 2.5 million new jobs created in 2004 (Kochhar 2005). One of the salient features of Mexican immigrants is the high degree of occupational clustering in low-waged and less-skilled occupations (i.e., in terms of educational requirement). For example, in 2003, recent Mexican immigrants who arrived in the previous 5 years constituted 1 to 5 % of the labor force in their metropolitan receiving areas, yet they made up 29 % of workers in certain occupations (Catanzarite 2003). Over the 1990s and 2000s, Mexican immigrants experienced strong gains in the (low-waged) service sector, including food preparation and serving, cleaning, and personal care, as well as in production, extraction, and farming occupations, while the US-born (native) workers’ participation either declined or remained relatively lower in those occupations (Toussaint-Comeau et al. 2005). The concentration of Mexican immigrants in certain occupations/industries has catalyzed a research and policy debate about whether they substitute natives in production. Does their concentration in certain occupations lead to pressures in wages for other low-skilled workers—particularly African-American workers? Or, does the pervasive pattern of concentration in specific occupational niche indicative of Mexicans filling jobs that are not necessarily chosen by US-born workers, at least during the prosperous 1990s? The size of the Mexican labor force and its potential role in affecting the overall wage structure suggest that it is important to have a better understanding of the nature of the relation between the Mexican immigrant workers and labor market outcomes of US-born counterparts. The increase in Mexican immigrants in the labor force coincides with several specific trends in the labor market experiences of African-Americans, which begs question regarding its impact on this group in particular. Whereas Mexican immigrants had tended to be concentrated in relatively few cities, over the 1990s, they became increasingly dispersed, moving to cities like Atlanta that have had traditionally a large African-American population (Card 2005). In 2000, the employment rate of African-American men (fraction of weeks worked during a year) fell to 67.9 % compared to 74.9 % in 1960 (Borjas et al. 2008). Wages of African-Americans, which have been apparently trended toward converging with that of Whites in the 1960s and the 1970s, stalled beginning in the 1980s (Neal 2005; Amitabh 2000). Can these labor market trends experienced by African-Americans be attributed to Mexican immigration? A number of studies have been concerned with examining the effect of immigration on African-Americans, guided by the notion that inflows of immigrants could presumably affect this group in particular (e.g., Altonji and Card 1991; LaLonde and Topel 1991; Borjas et al. 2008). These studies have found small or negligible effects. By contrast, Borjas et al. (2006) analyzed the effect of immigrants on African-Americans and found that as a disproportionate number of immigrants increase the supply of workers in some skill categories, the wages of black (African-American) workers tend to fall, by up to 4 % for low skilled. Some studies have been concerned with the specific impact of Mexican immigration. Borjas and Katz (2005) find that Mexican immigration lowers wages of native high school dropouts by 4 to 8 %. These previous studies have looked at either the effect of Mexicans on natives in general or the effect of immigration in general on African-Americans. In this paper, we focus on two groups—Mexican immigrants and African-Americans. We examine a much less researched aspect of the wage determination process—the role of occupational clustering or segregation and ethnic language networks in the wage determination process of a US-born minority worker group. Starting with the underlying notion that Mexican immigrants and African-American workers may not be doing the same jobs, we ask whether the tendency to be “specialized” or be segregated in distinct occupations with certain characteristics (manual relative to language communication skills requirements) mitigates the effect of Mexican immigrants on wages of African-American workers. The methodological approach of this paper consists of conducting empirical analyses of the wage determination process in which we compare ordinary least squares (OLS) and occupation fixed-effects OLS estimates, with two-stage instrumental variable (IV) model estimates, in an attempt to correct for endogeneity of occupation composition. We innovate in this paper with the use of instruments which proxy for unobservable factors which relate to manual/
language communication skills network effects, using a two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) method, as well as using an instrument capturing previous labor supply shocks or occupation inflow from “new” Mexican immigrant cohorts, which we believe influence the choice of Mexican immigrants in distinct occupations, independent of compensating wage differences. To further explore how binding Mexican immigrants’ impact really is on African-Americans, we also conduct complementary empirical experiments which explore further the effect of Mexican immigrants on wage adjustments for African-Americans, in the context of local labor markets with occupation segmentation and segregation, using a two-stage least-squares model with location selection. We make use of several combined datasets from the Public Use Micro Statistics (PUMS), 5 % sample from the US Census, which allow us to exploit variations across more than 475 detailed occupations by industry categories across time. We find that consistent with previous researches, there is an inverse relationship between an increase of Mexican immigrants in an occupation/industry and wages of African-Americans, suggestive of a potential for crowding out effect and substitution effect. The relevant relation between wages of African-Americans and Mexican immigrants appears not limited to the unskilled sectors. We find that Mexican immigrants have an impact on wages of workers in occupations in semi-skilled range (in which the average African-American workers have a high school diploma). At very high skill occupation range (those in which the average African-American workers have a college education), the lack of the presence of Mexican immigrants in those occupations corresponds to higher wages, suggestive of more complementarity in the production process among more-educated workers. One of the more puzzling effects is that we find that in spite of the high concentration of Mexican immigrants in occupation ranges in which we find African-Americans that have very low education (less than high school-level education or are high school dropouts), there is no significant effect of Mexican immigrants on wages of African-Americans as a group in this education category. Following a formal model of occupation segmentation, we confirm that there is stronger pressure on wages of African-Americans in the more integrated occupations than there is in occupations with a strong Hispanic/Mexican immigrant niche. In other words, African-Americans compete, to a lesser degree, in “Hispanic/Mexican occupations”, while the more relevant “competition” between African-Americans and Hispanic/Mexican immigrants may be in more integrated, semi-skilled occupations. In addition, we assess the effect on wages of African-Americans being clustered in certain occupations themselves. The result of this exercise shows, all else equal, that there appears to be a tendency for African-Americans to face a greater “wage penalty” or lower returns in predominantly black occupations, even after controlling for a number of characteristics. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section provides a brief review of two strings of literature—a sociology literature that explains the process of immigrant/ethnic clustering in distinct occupations, as driven by ethnic/language networks, and an economic literature that purports to the effect of immigrants on wages of natives, as a backdrop to the empirical strategy taken in this paper. Section 3 describes the estimation procedure for the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the data and the results of the empirical analysis. The penultimate sections discuss the economic significance of the result and additional considerations of local labor markets within states and metropolitan areas. The final section summarizes the paper and notes the implications of the findings.",2
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,12 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-016-0061-3,Dynamics of employment assimilation,December 2016,Alpaslan Akay,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One policy target of highly immigrated Western countries is to assimilate the existing immigrant stock into the labor market as quickly as possible. Thus, the key measure that will inform the policy makers is the labor market performance of immigrants relative to that of the native population. Previous studies on Western countries suggest that not only is the growth of immigrants’ relative outcomes weak, but their outcomes also quickly diverge away from that of natives and the outcomes also differ by region of birth, arrival cohort, and education (e.g., for North America, see Chiswick 1978; Borjas 1985, 1987; LaLonde and Topel 1991, 1992; Baker and Benjamin 1994; Dustmann 1994; and Duleep and Regets 1999; for Europe, see Aguilar and Gustafsson 1991; Gustafsson and Zheng 2006; Bauer et al. 2000; Bell 1997; Hayfron 1998; Longva and Raaum 2002; Barth et al. 2004; Bevelander 1995, 2005; and Hammarstedt 2001, 2003). The labor market success of immigrants in the host country requires a continuous accumulation of host country-specific human capital, skills, and experience (e.g., learning the language, getting information about the channels to find a job, and knowledge about the local culture) after arrival, with which the immigrants can compete with natives (Chiswick 1978; Borjas 1985). Immigrants, however, confront several difficulties in obtaining host country-specific skills and experience since they are vulnerable to disadvantages that may lead to various patterns of interruptions or discontinuities in their employment status and human capital accumulation process compared with natives (e.g., Chiswick et al. 1997; Constant and Massey 2005; Frijters et al. 2005). The aim of the present paper is to incorporate the differential past labor market experience of immigrants and natives into the standard assimilation models to investigate the dynamics of employment assimilation among immigrants in the Swedish labor market. The assimilation of immigrants is typically analyzed using either a cross section of individuals or panel datasets in a static modeling framework (e.g., Chiswick 1978; Borjas 1985, 1995; Aguilar and Gustafsson 1991; Hayfron 1998; Husted et al. 2001; Barth et al. 2004; Bevelander 1995, 2005). The standard static approach (with or without panel dataset) used in the previous literature is limited as it cannot account for effect of past employment or unemployment experiences on current or future employment outcomes. On the one hand, a structural state dependence on employment status might be present due to actual past employment experiences. On the other, a spurious state dependence, which can alter employment propensities independently from actual employment experience, might be present simultaneously due to time-persistent unobserved individual characteristics (e.g., personality characteristics, motivation, or ability). The employment status persistence of immigrants and natives is expected to differ as their unobserved characteristics and the labor market conditions they face differ (Borjas 1985). When the effect of past employment experience on the current employment possibilities differ between immigrants and natives, the static assimilation model might produce biased assimilation predictions. There are several factors that can lead to differing patterns of labor market experience over time for immigrants and natives. First of all, immigrants’ human capital acquired in their home country may not be perfectly transferable (Friedberg 2000). Second, failure to find a job for an immigrant upon arrival may “scar” future job possibilities (Chiswick et al. 1997; Husted et al. 2001; Åslund and Rooth 2007). Third, employers may perceive an unemployment experience in the past as a “signal” of low productivity (Hyslop 1999). They may also judge immigrants and natives differently even if they have the same labor market experience, i.e., labor market discrimination (Constant and Massey 2005). Finally, immigrants typically lack language skills and have less information about the host country labor market, leading to less effective job search methods with a higher cost (Frijters et al. 2005).Footnote 1 Thus, immigrants experience several disadvantages that might lead to more frequent employment status transitions and interruptions in their human capital accumulation process in comparison with natives. To account for the differential past employment experience between immigrants and natives, we estimate the relative employment outcomes of immigrants using a non-linear dynamic panel data assimilation model in which we explicitly control for past employment experiences of immigrants and natives. This paper focuses on the relative employment outcomes of immigrants in the Swedish labor market. The Swedish population has a higher proportion of immigrants (14 %) than most other countries in the world. Several studies have used the static framework to investigate the relative labor market outcomes of immigrants (i.e., both earnings and employment) of immigrants in Sweden. Almost all studies on immigrants in Sweden report a weak assimilation process (e.g., Aguilar and Gustafsson 1991; Ekberg 1994; Scott 1999; Bevelander 1995; 2005; Edin et al. 2000; Hammarstedt 2001, 2003; Duvender 2001; Gustafsson and Zheng 2006; Åslund and Rooth 2007). We are going to estimate the standard static model similar to the one used in the existing studies and compare the results with those of the dynamic assimilation model. One of the other advantages of focusing on the Swedish labor market is that Sweden offers a high-quality national administrative panel dataset with a very low attrition and measurement error: the Longitudinal Individual Dataset—LINDA. The dataset covers the entire Swedish population allowing greater flexibility in selecting representative samples. In order to focus on the research question extensively, we focus mainly on male immigrants. In our empirical analysis, we include half a million observations of immigrant men and an equal number of native Swedish men, who are randomly selected from the national population register. Our main results can be summarized as follows. First of all, there is a strong and positive structural state dependence on the employment status of both native Swede and immigrant men. Second, the dependence of the current employment probability on past experiences largely differs between natives and immigrants. Natives experience a substantially higher employment status persistence than immigrants. Third, the immigrant population is highly heterogeneous with respect to employment status persistence. We split immigrants into seven regions of origin. The immigrants from Western countries and Eastern Europe experience a relatively higher employment status persistence. Finally, the predicted assimilation outcomes differ remarkably between the static and the dynamic model, especially when the magnitude of state dependence of natives and immigrants are largely different. The static assimilation model predicts very high marginal assimilation rates in the initial years after arrival, but in fact, the rates are quickly turned to negative, as employment probabilities of immigrants unrealistically diverge away from those of native Swedes. Controlling for the differential past labor market experience has a substantial effect on assimilation outcomes. It lowers both the unrealistically high speed of assimilation and the depreciation rates of human capital as the number of years-since-migration increases. The dynamic model fits the data well and predicts that there is a slow yet steady accumulation of Swedish labor market-specific human capital, and once acquired, immigrants are able to keep their human capital at the same level for longer periods with lower depreciation rates. In summary, the dynamic model predicts a lower initial employment probability advantage (10–15 percentage points) upon arrival yet longer years of positive marginal assimilation rates (up to 5–15 years), compared with the predictions of the static assimilation model. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the dynamic assimilation model, in which we control for past employment status and unobserved individual effects. Section 3 presents the data, our sample selection, descriptive statistics, and the raw employment transition patterns of natives and immigrants. Section 4 gives the results from the static and dynamic assimilation models split by regions of origin and education levels. Section 5 summarizes the results and draws conclusions.",3

Jimeno,Aitor Lacuesta,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Just before the Great Recession, Spain received massive migration inflows that contributed to an average annual population growth of 1.4 % between 2000 and 2007 and increased the weight of the foreign population from 2 to 12 %. However, the effects of the Great Recession on the Spanish labor market were remarkable: From peak (third quarter of 2007) to trough (first quarter of 2014), employment fell by 18.3 %, while the unemployment rate reached a maximum of 26.9 % (first quarter of 2013). Not surprisingly, migration inflows and outflows changed significantly since 2010. The questions that we address in this paper are twofold. First, we estimate to what extent changes in migration flows of foreigners and nationals responded differently to the worsening in the labor market situation. Second, we discuss whether the changes in migration flows should be expected to persist and, therefore, whether Spain could be in transition from massive immigration of foreigners to vast emigration of Spaniards. To answer these questions, we carefully look at the behavior of migration inflows and outflows of different population groups. Indeed, it is interesting to see that during the crisis, while foreigners experienced emigration rates above 6 %, only 0.1 % of Spaniards born in Spain moved abroad. Either migration flows of Spaniards were less sensitive to unemployment than those of foreigners or the former faced larger emigration costs due for instance to a lack of networks abroad. The underlying motivation is important since each explanation has different long-term consequences on migration flows. If Spaniards migration flows are not very sensitive to changes in unemployment developments, something that was confirmed in the case of internal migration in Spain (Antolín and Bover 1997; Bentolila and Dolado 1991), migration outflows abroad might not acquire the sufficient entity to generate any relevant network effects that could lower migration costs. Hence, under this scenario, large migration outflows would be unlikely. On the contrary, if migration flows abroad were sensitive to changes in unemployment and networks effects started to play some role, these outflows would continue growing, even if some improvement in the labor market situation in Spain took place. There are two reasons why we do not neglect this possibility upfront. One is the rapid creation of networks observed in Spain during the arrival of large inflows in the expansionary period just before the crisis. Another is the Spanish experience of large migration outflows abroad during the period 1950–1970, which reached a maximum of 0.7 % of population (Fig. 1) even at a time when GDP per capita was growing above 5 % per year (Prados de la Escosura 1993). Migration flows to and from Spain as a function of unemployment rate In short, in this paper, we take on three tasks. First, we try to disentangle whether the sensitivity of migration flows with respect to unemployment is different between Spaniards and foreigners residing in Spain. Second, we estimate the importance of past network effects of foreigners and the recent network effects of Spaniards in shaping these migration flows. Finally, we will use these estimations to hypothesize about future migration outflow scenarios. The structure of the paper closely resembles these three goals. First, we describe the data sources used to measure migration inflows and outflows. We then focus on the migration inflows of foreign nationals, and on the outflows of Spaniards born in Spain, to estimate their responses to economic conditions, considering also their sociodemographic composition. Finally, we estimate the emigration costs and conclude with some comments on the implications of these migration flows for future potential growth.",15

(2006) found that those who were chronically or always overqualified accounted for about 50 % of the ever-overqualified population. Most studies measure the matching quality by the amount of surplus or deficit in schooling, relative to some “required” level of schooling (Leuven and Ooesterberg 2011). Robst (2007) was the first major study to investigate the mismatch in terms of the extent to which workers’ field of study and their occupation were related and how the degree of relatedness between the two affects wage earnings in the USA. While studies show that choice of a field of study is directly influenced by the relative pay of graduates in related occupations (Altonji et al. 2012), in a recent study, Boudarbat and Chernoff (2012) reported that 35.1 % of Canadian university graduates are in jobs that are not related to their education 5 years after graduation. The inability of immigrants to practice in their trained occupation has also been blamed for the substantial decline in new immigrants’ earnings in the last decades and the generally slower labor market integration of immigrants since the 1970s, which has been well documented in the literature (Picot and Sweetman 2012; Borjas 2013; Dustmann and Fabbri 2005; Kaushal et al. 2015). As noted by Sweetman et al. (2015), there is a common perception that a deficiency in foreign qualification recognition and the excessive cost of reentry in regulated (or self-regulated) occupations following migration hinders the labor market-integration of new immigrants. This is a particular concern in Canada as it has a point system for selecting skilled immigrants who would be employed in occupations that arguably face long-term labor shortages. In a recent study, Uppal and LaRochelle-Cote (2014) reported that, among internationally educated immigrants who are university graduates, 48 % of women and 37 % of men worked in occupations that usually required a high school education or less in 2006.Footnote 2 The corresponding rates are 15 and 17 % for Canadian-educated native-born university graduates, respectively. The poor matching quality of immigrants is seen as a symptom of slower labor market integration that may result in a substantial underutilization of human capital in the whole economy. For instance, Reitz (2001) estimated the annual cost to be as high as 15 billion dollars. On the other hand, the Conference Board of Canada (2001) has estimated this cost to be much lower, somewhere between 4.1 billion and 5.9 billion dollars. Although the nonrecognition of foreign qualifications is frequently blamed in public policy discussions for declining returns to premigration labor market experience and for the immigrant–native-born gap in the rate of return to education in Canada, the evidence shows that differences in preimmigration educational quality have substantial impacts on the Canadian labor market earnings of immigrants (Li and Sweetman 2014) and individual-level test scores (as a proxy for preimmigration educational quality) explain the entire immigration–native-born gap (Ferrer and Riddell 2008). In addition, studies have also found that low literacy skills and language proficiency of immigrants have a direct effect on postimmigration labor market outcomes (Warman et al. 2015; Ferrer et al. 2006). These findings raise the question of the portability of internationally educated new immigrants’ human capital, an issue that has been investigated in the literature in conjunction with their occupational attainment and mismatch in hosting countries (Green 1999; Imai et al 2011; Warman et al. 2015). If it is the nonportability of their foreign credentials resulting from shifting source-country composition (Warman and Worswick 2015) that penalizes their wage earnings in hosting labor markets, rather than their transitory occupational mismatch, solutions to the poor economic integration of immigrants should lie more in policies targeting source-country human capital characteristics of new immigrants rather than policies designed for postimmigration improvements (Green and Worswick 2012). In this study, given the large sample at our disposal (20 % sample of the 2006 Census), we are able to create a continuous index that reflects the “relatedness” between 1375 fields of study and 520 occupations for native-born Canadian-educated workers. The index is calculated for the highest degree attained by each worker and the major field of study associated with that degree. The degrees are based on Statistics Canada’s 11-level classification, and range from an apprenticeship certificate and a college certificate or diploma, to a degree in medicine. Unlike studies that define the match between pre- and postimmigration (or intended) occupations, this study will use the clustering of native-born workers in each cell of the field of study–occupation matrix as a benchmark reflecting the “common” matching quality in Canadian labor markets that internationally educated immigrant workers can attain in the long run. This approach allows us to approximate the annual cost of underutilizing the human capital of immigrants by estimating the change in immigrant earnings that would occur if they were distributed identically to the native born in terms of relatedness (field of study–occupation match) in Canada. This type of application has some important advantages: first, it eliminates the difficult problem of determining an ideal matching ordering of 520 occupations for each of the 1375 fields of study in labor markets, particularly for unregulated occupations. While some fields of study have strong connections with some specific—perhaps regulated—occupations, many do not.Footnote 3 Most studies on the subject use surveys that contain questions explicitly aimed at extracting information on field of study–occupation matching. Since those surveys are usually limited in size, even producing descriptive analyses in order to understand the incidence of mismatch becomes a real challenge because of the level of aggregation in classifications. Moreover, its effect on labor market outcomes modeled through self-reported binary variables involves some arbitrariness in the classification of workers into two categories—related or not, especially since relatedness is perhaps more a matter of degree, than an all-or-none concept. Second, even if such an ordering could be found, the actual cost of immigrants’ underutilization should be gauged relative to a comparison group, and millions of native-born workers in labor markets would appear to be a natural choice. Although the results show a significant and persistent poor matching quality for foreign-educated immigrant workers, their relative underutilization cost is not as sizeable as envisioned in some policy circles. This finding implies that, if the occupational mismatch of immigrants is rather a symptom of underlying problems, namely poor (or nonequivalence of) foreign education quality, language proficiency, and literacy skills, without substantial progress in these specific human capital characteristics, the isolated effects of relative improvements in occupational match will not be so rewarding for immigrants. In other words, the occupational mismatch of immigrants is much more a “source-country problem” rather than being a “host-country problem” that can be efficiently dealt with by postarrival policies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 summarizes previous research; Section 2 introduces the data and contains a descriptive analysis. Econometric results and a discussion of our findings are given in Section 3; Section 4 presents the cost calculations. We provide concluding remarks in Section 5.",11
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,29 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-016-0056-0,"Income, amenities and negative attitudes",December 2016,Gisela Waisman,Birthe Larsen,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Sweden has gone from being a land of emigration to a land of immigration. Immigration was insignificant until World War II. During the first post-war decades, there was a sharp increase in demand for labour and workers were recruited from other European countries. These early labour immigrants adapted fairly well and gradually became accepted in the cities they settled in.Footnote 1 Since the 1970s, when the need for labour shrank substantially, immigration to Sweden has become increasingly restricted to political refugees and their families. No other affluent nation in recent decades has accepted as many political refugees per capita as Sweden. The share of foreign born reached 16.5 % in 2014, with over half of this fraction from non-developed countries.Footnote 2
 Sweden is well known for its longstanding generosity in providing a safe haven to refugees.Footnote 3 Still, many studies have detected the existence of negative attitudes towards immigrants in the country.Footnote 4 For example, the SOM Institute (University of Gothenburg) has investigated attitudes towards immigration and refugees since 1986, finding growing resistance against receiving refugees until 1992, while thereafter, attitudes have slowly become less resistant. Despite this, by 2005, nearly half the population thought that it was a good suggestion to receive fewer refugees in Sweden (see the evolution of attitudes in the period 1986–2010 in Figure 1 in the Appendix). Attitudes towards immigration are potentially important for immigrants to get integrated in the labour market. Discrimination is an important aspect to focus on regarding where refugees choose where to live. But do attitudes reflect discrimination? Or are they just something that is said but never acted upon? We explore if discrimination is related to negative attitudes towards immigration: if attitudes do not affect immigrants’ utility from labour income and amenities, then they are not indicative of discrimination and may be less of a concern. Studies making a comparison across European countries, for example Card et al. (2005), find that Sweden is one of the countries with the most generous attitudes towards immigrants. Therefore, if we find any effect of negative attitudes, then immigrants’ utility may potentially be even more affected in other countries. The aim of this paper is to exploit regional variation in negative attitudes towards immigration in order to analyse whether the mobility decisions and the labour market outcomes of refugees are affected by such attitudes. We recognize that not every native with negative attitudes may discriminate against immigrants, but we conjecture that negative attitudes are systematically related to discrimination. We choose to analyse income as the labour market outcome variable as it is affected by both wages and employment. We concentrate on a group of refugees for which there is some exogenous source of variation in their first location in Sweden, given by a refugee settlement policy pursued by the government. We interpret the movements away from this first location as indication of better labour market conditions and/or better amenities or quality of life. We account for the fact that the refugees are not a homogeneous group by considering heterogeneity by the level of education and by gender. Identification fails if some other factor, that we are not considering, determines the level of attitudes and the differences in income and amenities in the region. We test this by including a placebo group in our analysis, immigrants from developed countries, that we expect to be very little affected by negative attitudes. The idea is that, if our estimation of the effect of attitudes on income and amenities is the result of some other factor that produces lower income, we should estimate similar effects on this placebo group. We find that attitudes towards immigrants are of importance for the refugees, but they have no effect on the quality of life or income of immigrants from developed countries. The income an individual gets is assumed to be a function of negative attitudes and networks, as well as several individual and municipal characteristics. We start by assuming that the residual of this income function for a refugee living where he or she has been placed is uncorrelated with the income residual the same refugee would have if he or she moved to another municipality. Then, in our preferred specification, we introduce a residual correlation that recognizes that high-ability refugees, who have positive residuals upon placement, are likely to also have positive residuals after moving. Once we recognize that unobservable characteristics of the refugees affect their income in all municipalities, we find that negative attitudes are mainly a problem, in terms of income, for refugees that stayed where they had been placed. The fact that refugees tend to move to municipalities with lower negative attitudes indicates that their quality of life is lower the larger the negative attitudes are. The relationship between negative attitudes and the quality of life of refugees is much stronger than the relationship with their income. The refugees’ choice of where to live also may be affected by the availability of networks. We consider the share of refugees in the municipality as a measure of the potential network. We explore how networks affect the refugees’ income and quality of life as well as the interaction between networks and negative attitudes towards immigration. The relationship between the size of networks and the amenities of refugees is much stronger than the relationship with their income. Larger networks are associated with much larger amenities for all refugees, larger income for the refugees that stayed where they had been placed and slightly smaller income for those who moved. Refugees who stay where they have been placed may have been luckier and placed where they already had a useful network at arrival. Alternatively, they may have been more attractive for the municipalities and therefore may have been placed according to their choice close to their relatives already in the country. Those who moved after placement may have been less attractive for the municipalities and less capable of benefitting from a network even after moving. Instead, they may suffer from competition from other better-connected refugees in the municipality they choose to move to. Movers still move to municipalities with a much larger share of refugees, which indicates that the increase in the quality of life is much larger than the decrease in income. The interaction between negative attitudes towards immigration and the size of networks are of importance as well. The negative relationship between negative attitudes and quality of life becomes larger when networks are larger. The same is true about the negative relationship between negative attitudes and stayers’ income, while the negative relationship between negative attitudes and movers’ income becomes smaller when networks are larger.",4

Evidence from France,December 2016,Anthony Edo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The impact of immigration on the wages of natives has been analyzed in multiple studies. The main presumption behind these investigations is that wages could adjust to immigration. Standard economic theory indeed suggests that an immigration-induced increase in labor supply should reduce the wages of competing workers and increase the wages of complementary workers. The validity of this prediction however depends on the degree of wage rigidity (Grossman 1982). By affecting the responsiveness of wages to economic shocks, the institutional context (such as high minimum wages, generous unemployment benefits, strict employment protection, and powerful labor unions) should mitigate any downward wage adjustment following immigration. The role played by labor market institutions in shaping the labor market effects of immigration should be particularly important in continental European countries since they tend to have rigid wages (Nickell 1997; Babecký et al. 2010, 2012; Messina et al. 2010). In order to quantify the overall impact of immigration on the wages of native workers, a recent wave of European studies thus accounts for the sluggish adjustment of wages (see, e.g., D’Amuri et al. (2010), Felbermayr et al. (2010), and Brücker and Jahn (2011) for Germany; Brücker et al. (2014) for Denmark; and Edo and Toubal (2015) for France). Other studies complement these investigations by examining the impact of immigration on the wages and employment of equally skilled native workers. Glitz (2012) for Germany and Edo (2015) for France find that immigration has no detrimental impact on the wages of competing native workers, whereas it reduces their employment. These findings are consistent with Angrist and Kugler (2003) who show for a panel of European countries that the adverse effects of immigration on native employment are magnified in rigid labor markets. Taken together, these European studies suggest that labor market institutions tend to exert a protective effect on native wages, leaving room for possible employment effects. The present paper goes beyond the existing results by providing direct evidence on the role played by wage rigidities in shaping the impact of immigration on the wages and employment of competing native workers. An important source of downward wage rigidity in European countries is related to the predominance of indefinite-term contracts (Babecký et al. 2010). By definition, these contracts are characterized by an indefinite term and it is moreover very costly for firms to terminate them. As a result, workers under indefinite-term contracts have more leeway in wage negotiations, which in turn lead to greater wage rigidity. As compared to indefinite-term contracts, fixed-term contracts should provide firms with the ability to adjust their labor cost. Since the duration of fixed-term contracts is relatively short and their termination has no cost, firms can use the turnover of workers on fixed-term contracts to adjust their wage bills by hiring new employees at lower wages. The population of native workers under fixed-term contracts should therefore be subject to lower degree of wage rigidity than those under indefinite-term contracts. By impacting the degree of wage rigidity, the type of job contracts (indefinite or fixed term) may therefore affect the responsiveness of wages and employment to immigration. This paper investigates that question by providing an empirical investigation on the effects of immigration on the wages and employment of similarly skilled natives according to whether they are covered by indefinite- or fixed-term contracts. Phrased differently, the present paper mainly studies how the wages and employment of different groups of natives are affected by an increase in the number of competing immigrants (at least in the short run). As a result, this paper only deals with partial effects of immigration and does not account for cross-group complementarities, as well as capital and other economic adjustments induced by immigration which should have a positive wage impact on all native workers.Footnote 1 Also, this paper does not consider the positive effects that high-skilled immigration may have on the labor market through human capital externalities (Borjas 2014, chapter 8). The present paper uses a rich dataset taken from the French labor survey that covers the period from 1990 and 2002.Footnote 2 The French labor market provides an excellent framework for this analysis since it has a rigid wage structure (Card et al. 1999), and around 88 % of workers are covered by indefinite-term contracts.Footnote 3 I use the skill-cell approach by Borjas (2003) and show that immigration has no adverse impact on the wages of competing natives. However, I find that immigration has a negative impact on their employment rates: a 10 % immigrant-induced increase in the number of workers in a particular skill group reduces the employment rate to labor force of natives by 3 to 5 %.Footnote 4
 Moreover, these results are robust to the implementation of an instrumental variable (IV) strategy. In order to account for the bias that may arise from the endogenous distribution of immigrants across skill groups, I use the historical distribution of immigrants across skill groups from the 1982 French census as a predictor for their subsequent flows.Footnote 5 The instrument used in the present paper thus relies on Card (2001) and Peri (2012). It is based on the idea that the stock of previous immigrants has an impact on subsequent flows through network effects, while assuming that past immigrant concentrations are uncorrelated with current unobserved economic shocks. Then, I implement subsample regressions to decompose the labor market effects of immigration according to whether native workers hold indefinite-term contracts or fixed-term contracts. I find that the average impact of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives is entirely driven by the population of native workers covered by indefinite-term contracts. The wage insensitivity to immigration of that population is more striking, and the negative employment effect due to immigration remains: firms cannot adjust the wages of native workers under indefinite-term contracts, and therefore, they use their exits (e.g., workers under indefinite-term contracts can quit their jobs, retire, or be laid-off) to replace them by immigrants. The wage and employment responses of natives under fixed-term contracts to immigration are the opposite. The baseline estimate indicates that a 10 % increase in the size of a skill group due to immigration reduces the monthly wage of natives under fixed-term contracts by around 9 %.Footnote 6 As fixed-term contracts have a short duration and terminate at no cost, firms tend to use them as a tool to achieve labor cost flexibility. Moreover, I show that immigration has a negative impact on their fraction of time worked—i.e., the decline in wages experienced by the native workers under fixed-term contracts encourages them to reduce their hours of work. However, I do not find evidence of a negative impact of immigration on the employment rate of competing native workers under fixed-term contracts. This result suggests that native workers under fixed-term contracts only respond to negative wage variations at the intensive margin. More generally, the asymmetric effects of immigration on the wages and employment of native workers according to their type of job contracts are robust to the implementation of IV estimations. I moreover show that these results are very unlikely to be driven by any selection issue among native workers on who is under each type of contract. The next section discusses the French institutional framework and proposes some theoretical predictions. Section 3 presents the data, the skill-cell methodology, and provides a discussion on the main identification issues. In Section 4, I show the empirical results. The last section concludes.",6
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Development and Migration,29 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-016-0054-2,Parents’ years in Sweden and children’s educational performance,December 2016,Christopher D. Smith,Jonas Helgertz,Kirk Scott,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last half century, the proportion of second-generation immigrants in Sweden has risen from being virtually nonexistent to approximately 10 % (Westin 2003; Bengtsson et al. 2005). While considerable country of origin and gender variation exists, the schooling experiences of second-generation immigrants are generally poorer than among children of native-born Swedes, on teacher-assigned grades as well as on national and international standardized tests (OECD 2010; Jonsson and Rudolphi 2011). This study seeks to understand to what extent immigrant parents’ incorporation experiences, here measured as parents’ years since migration (PYSM), affect the educational performance for their second-generation immigrant children. According to assimilation theory (Alba and Nee 2003), time and generation in a host country will lead to linguistic acculturation, increased institutional familiarity, and increased economic and social capital. These processes could allow immigrant parents to be more comfortable and capable at influencing their children’s educational performance. Though previous studies consider the effect of an immigrant’s time in the country, measured as age at migration, on their own outcomes (Böhlmark 2008; van Ours and Veenman 2006; Goldner and Epstein 2014), fewer have explicitly considered whether time in the host country could be associated with intergenerational effects. Though second-generation children will have resided in the host country for the same number of years as their native peers, their immigrant parents will be characterized by widely differing exposures to the destination country. More specifically, immigrant parents vary in their amount of exposure to the host country language, culture and norms, and, as a result, their level of incorporation. The parents’ accumulated incorporation experiences in a host country could influence their ability and willingness to assist in their children’s schooling and, as a result, impact their children’s school performance. There are several potential pathways as to how parents’ accumulated incorporation experiences might impact their children’s educational performance. The clearest example of this is a direct relationship through parents’ linguistic acculturation and children’s language proficiency (Bleakley and Chin 2008; Casey and Dustmann 2008), which then extends to their school performance and, specifically, their language class performance. Indirect mechanisms of parental incorporation that could influence their children’s educational performance include increased economic and social capital, familiarity with the school system (Kristen 2008; Turney and Kao 2009), and coming to view migration as a permanent rather than temporary move (Dustmann 2008), all of which would lead parents to being more able and willing to involve themselves with their children’s education. This impact could lead to an increase in performance in those subjects that are less host country specific. In Denmark, for example, Nielsen and Rangvid (2012) found evidence that a mother’s time spent in the country helped with their children’s Danish performance, while additional time for the father helped with their math performance, which may suggest that both specific and general mechanisms of incorporation can be transmitted across generations. To study the impact of PYSM on their children’s educational performance, we use the Swedish Interdisciplinary Panel (SIP) database, which contains registry data on the full population born between 1973 and 1995. We analyze second-generation immigrants who graduated from Swedish primary schools between 1989 and 2011, generally occurring at age 16. We consider class grades and test scores in Swedish and math due to the varying degree of Swedish-specific skills required by these two subjects. Typically, estimating the impact of parents’ time spent in the host country on their children’s educational performance using either longitudinal or cross-sectional data represents a considerable challenge. This is the result of selection and omitted variable bias in the relationship between when individuals migrate, when they have children, and their preferences for their children’s educational attainment, putting analyses at risk of getting (upwardly) biased results (Chiswick and Miller 1995). In attempting to avoid this issue, we exploit the linkage in the data of parents to their children, allowing for a family fixed-effects approach. In doing so, the influence of all time invariant observed and unobserved family level characteristics are cancelled out, allowing us to remove the likely source of bias. Using multinomial logistic regression with family fixed-effects and stratifying our analysis by parents’ country of origin over nearly three decades of second-generation cohorts, this is the first study to consider in detail how the effect of parents’ time in Sweden on children’s educational performance varies by parents’ background. Analyses done on students’ course grade and standardized test scores show an impact of PYSM on grades in Swedish, but not math, across nearly all country of origin groups. That the relationship is found for Swedish performance, but not math, points towards the potential effect for intergenerational transmission of parent’s linguistic acculturation. The neutral relationship between PYSM and math performance across all immigrant groups suggests that general effects of parent’s incorporation, such as increased familiarity with the school system and social capital, are less important for children’s performance, at least as measurable between siblings. Parents’ incorporation, then, can be said to have the potential to affect their children’s Swedish, but not math, performance. Though this is true across all immigrant groups, this finding is perhaps most notable among those groups from Africa, the Middle East, and South America, for whom incorporation has been deemed “less successful” and Swedish language and culture are most distinct.",7

Orrenius,Madeline Zavodny,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"US states and localities adopted an unprecedented number of laws regarding immigrants during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Many of these laws were aimed at reducing the unauthorized immigrant population, with state lawmakers claiming they were responding to inaction by the federal government. One of the most commonly adopted laws requires employers to electronically verify new employees’ eligibility to work legally in the USA. These provisions, often called “E-Verify laws” because they require employers to use the federal E-Verify system, may reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants living in a state by making it harder for them to find or switch jobs. Understanding the effect of E-Verify laws on the number and locational choices of unauthorized immigrants is important given this population’s size. About 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the USA in 2014, accounting for 3.5 % of the US population and more than 5 % of the labor force (Passel and Cohn 2015). Slightly more than one quarter of immigrants living in the USA were unauthorized. Despite these sizable numbers, the unauthorized immigrant population has shrunk in recent years. In 2007, before the Great Recession, it totaled about 12.2 million and 30 % of all immigrants living in the USA. The recession likely was the major cause of the decline in the unauthorized immigrant population, which fell by almost one million between 2007 and 2009. The drop appears to have been comprised of both a decline in new arrivals and an increase in departures from the USA (Passel et al. 2012). Stricter enforcement policies, including implementation of E-Verify requirements in several states as well as record numbers of deportations and removals from the country, may also have played a role in the unauthorized immigrant population’s drop and failure to rebound even as the economic recovery gained steam. Previous research generally shows that stricter enforcement policies, including state E-Verify laws, have a negative effect on unauthorized immigrants’ labor market outcomes. The wage penalty incurred by unauthorized immigrant workers from Mexico rose after the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) first made it illegal to hire unauthorized immigrants (Donato and Massey 1993). Employment and earnings fell among unauthorized immigrants as border and interior enforcement ramped up in the USA in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (Orrenius and Zavodny 2009). After Arizona became the first state to require virtually all employers to electronically verify new hires’ eligibility to work in the USA, wage-and-salary employment fell among non-US citizen Hispanics there while self-employment rose (Bohn and Lofstrom 2013). Nationwide, unauthorized immigrants’ employment and earnings tended to fall in states that adopted E-Verify laws, although there is also some evidence of positive effects on earnings and labor force participation (Amuedo-Dorantes and Bansak 2012, 2014; Orrenius and Zavodny 2015). Evidence on the impact of stricter enforcement policies on the number and locational choices of unauthorized immigrants is based largely on Arizona. Arizona’s population of non-naturalized citizens fell dramatically after the state’s E-Verify mandate went into effect in 2007 (Amuedo-Dorantes and Lozano 2015; Bohn et al. 2014). The decrease was concentrated among less-educated and Hispanic immigrants. One study suggests that many of these immigrants left the USA altogether rather than moved to other states, perhaps because they were deported (Amuedo-Dorantes and Lozano 2014). Other research, however, indicates an increase in migration from Arizona to other states (Ellis et al. 2014). It is unclear whether a later anti-unauthorized immigration law (SB 1070) passed in Arizona in 2010 further reduced the state’s population of unauthorized immigrants. A survey of undocumented migrants along the border in Mexico suggests that the flow of undocumented migrants planning to enter Arizona fell by 30 to 70 % after the bill was passed, but undocumented immigrants already living in Arizona did not return to Mexico in large numbers (Hoekstra and Orozco-Aleman 2014). US population data suggest little effect of SB 1070 on the number of unauthorized immigrants in Arizona (Amuedo-Dorantes and Lozano 2015). Evidence beyond Arizona on state omnibus immigration laws, many of which included a universal E-Verify mandate, suggests a sizable drop in the population of unauthorized immigrants in states that adopted such laws (Good 2013).Footnote 1
 This paper examines the effect of state E-Verify mandates on the population of unauthorized immigrants. The next section explains how E-Verify works and where it has been implemented. We then discuss the data and empirical methodology. In addition to examining population size, we look at population dynamics to try to understand whether any observed population changes are due to interstate mobility. Previous research has not examined these questions beyond the case of Arizona, whereas we examine all states that have adopted a universal E-Verify mandate. Our results indicate that requiring employers to use E-Verify has a large negative effect on the number of unauthorized immigrants in a state. The results are not driven by any single state and do not appear to be driven by labor market conditions for less-skilled workers or for Hispanic immigrants in general. E-Verify laws appear to divert some new unauthorized immigrants to other states and to cause some unauthorized immigrants already present in the USA to leave the country entirely.",25

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in measuring subjective well-being in economics; it has also featured prominently in public discourse and debates (e.g. the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report on social progress and well-being, commissioned by Nicholas Sarkozy; the British National Well-Being Project embraced by David Cameron). Recent studies have also increasingly looked at the impact of migration and integration on life satisfaction and have raised concerns that migrants may be less satisfied than the native population and that this could be driven by cultural factors, such as feelings of not belonging. We thus aim to contribute to the literature by examining immigrants’ outcomes from a subjective perspective, looking in particular at whether cultural or economic factors matter more for their life satisfaction. We analyse the immigrant sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel, for the years 1984–2010 (for a detailed discussion of the dataset please see Section 4). We will examine two questions: (1) we will first look at whether (and if so, why) immigrants are less satisfied than natives (as suggested by some recent papers) and (2) we will then analyse the determinants of the subjective well-being of immigrants, in a sense examining ‘who does better and who does worse’ among the group of migrants.Footnote 1 Card et al. (2012) recently highlighted that public attitudes towards immigration policy are more influenced by cultural and social concerns than economic ones. Georgiadis and Manning (2013) note the widespread belief that societies will function better if they manage to establish a common sense of identity among the population and contemporary fears in many countries that this common identity is threatened. We will look at various socio-economic and cultural measures that could be associated with integration, trying to shed light on the question which elements matter for subjective well-being. As Graham (2008) put it: ‘happiness surveys may shed light on how the direction and nature of progress affects well-being’ (p. 85, italics in the original). Such potential policy implications may be interesting in the context of immigration as public discourse often debates the ‘alternatives’ of integration, assimilation or multiculturalism. Research on the subjective well-being of immigrants could thus have broader implications for social cohesion and hence policy. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the empirical literature on the life satisfaction of immigrants, Section 3 discusses our empirical approach and Section 4 introduces the dataset used. Section 5 presents the results including robustness tests and Section 6 concludes.",13

This tremendous growth has led to remittances being an increasingly important part of the Bolivian economy. Personal remittances to Bolivia have totaled as much as the equivalent of 8.04 % of GDP (see Fig. 1). Despite the sizable role remittances are now playing in the Bolivian economy, surprisingly little research has looked at the impacts remittances are having in that country. The few studies that do exist have found evidence that some Bolivian households are effectively using remittances as part of an income diversification strategy to overcome insurance and capital market imperfections (Alcala et al. 2014) and that remittances are helping to reduce poverty in urban areas (Lopez-Videla and Machuca 2014). The present study adds to the small, but important, body of research related to Bolivian remittances by exploring the relationship between remittance receipt and the use of child labor in Bolivia. While the relationship between remittances and child labor has been studied for other countries (see below), this relationship is of particular importance in the Bolivian context, since in July of 2014 lawmakers took the unprecedented step of lowering the legal working age in Bolivia from the minimum age of 14 established by international labor conventions to 12 years old for formal contracted employment and 10 years old for self-employment (Watson 2014). Ostensibly, the government argued that since they were essentially powerless to prevent the need for child labor among impoverished households, the change in the law was necessary in order to afford legal protections to children who would have been working anyway. However, it is possible that the Bolivian government has yet to exhaust all of its available resources. This study explores the relationship between remittances and child labor, and the potential for utilizing remittance income to reduce the prevalence and intensity of child labor. The results presented below suggest that the government may have given up too soon and that remittances might prove to be an effective tool in the fight against child labor in Bolivia.

When education provides specific skills, it helps individuals find more complex and better-paying occupations, which Lemieux (2014) calls “occupation upgrading.” On the other hand, regardless of occupation, more and better education also increases productivity through better cognitive skills in literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving. In other words, while more-educated workers are assigned to more complex jobs, education also increases general productivity in a given job. Green and Riddell (2015) find that about 40 % of the returns to schooling comes from the combined effect of these cognitive skills produced by formal education and can be viewed as the “pure returns” to schooling. The third reason that education affects earnings originates from the assignment of skills obtained by education to jobs that are available in labor markets. Studies in the past have used different measures such as degree of education, ability, and field of study–job relatedness to quantify this matching quality. For instance, Lemieux (2014) estimated the effect of the above three factors on earnings and found that occupation upgrading and occupational matching (provided by the job field of the study match) collectively explain close to half of the conventionally measured return to education for native-born workers. Despite the overwhelming evidence that education has robust, positive, and casual effects on wage earnings, immigrants’ foreign education appears to be greatly discounted in Canada (Li and Sweetman 2014; Ferrer and Riddell 2008).Footnote 1 Furthermore, Uppal and LaRochelle-Cote (2014) report that, among internationally educated university-graduate immigrants, 48 % of women and 37 % of men work in occupations that usually require a high school education or less in 2006. The corresponding rates are 15 and 17 %, respectively, for Canadian-educated native-born university graduates. A most recent study by Aydede and Dar (2016) also points to a persistent and significantly poorer horizontal mismatch for foreign-educated immigrants in Canada: 76 % of immigrants work in jobs that are considered least related by native-born workers in their field of study. In light of this evidence, it is obvious that differential returns to formal schooling by nativity would reflect not only the variable quality of education across source countries but also systematic differences in the occupational matching for those groups in Canada. In other words, one may raise the question of immigrants’ inability to practice in their trained occupation, when the inferior quality of their education is blamed for the lower return to foreign credentials. Yet, it can also be argued that immigrants’ occupational mismatch in the host country could be a result of nonportability of their foreign qualifications due to the nonequivalent quality of their education obtained in the source country. As noted by Sweetman et al. (2015), there is a common perception that a deficiency in foreign qualification recognition and an excessive cost of reentry in regulated (or self-regulated) occupations following migration hinders the labor market integration of new immigrants and results in the well-documented wage penalty at the entry for newcomers (Picot and Sweetman 2012; Borjas 2013). Unlike the USA, nevertheless, this is a particular concern in Canada, which has a point system for selecting skilled (better-educated) immigrants who would be employed in occupations that arguably face long-term labor shortage. Although the nonrecognition of foreign qualifications is frequently blamed in public policy for declining returns to premigration labor market experience and for the immigrant–native-born gap in the rate of return to education in Canada, the evidence suggests that differences in premigration educational quality, usually proxied by source-country test scores (PISA—Programme for International Student Assessment) or a cross-country human-capital index (Hanushek and Kimko 2000), have substantial impacts on the Canadian labor market earnings of immigrants (Sharaf 2013; Li and Sweetman 2014). But the nonequivalent quality of foreign education may also stimulate systematic and persistent differences in occupational attainment, mobility, and matching for immigrants, which in turn would exacerbate the negative impact of the poor-quality education on payoffs to schooling, especially when these differences are combined with the lack of foreign qualification recognition in hosting labor markets. If this is true, the discount in returns to foreign credentials could be overestimated in wage earnings equations. The primary objective of this study is to estimate and compare the return to education for internationally educated immigrants after controlling for their occupational matching in hosting labor markets by using the 20 % sample of the 2006 Canadian Census. The size of the data permits us to create two continuous indices that expose the “common” quality of occupational match experienced by native-born Canadian-educated workers in labor markets. These indices quantify the match in two dimensions by using the clustering of native-born workers in each cell of the field of study–occupation and degree of education–occupation matrices reflecting the relatedness of the 1375 fields of study and 14 major degrees to 520 occupations separately.Footnote 2 Unlike studies that define the match between pre- and postmigration (or intended) occupations, or studies that use a measure of “required education,” as suggested in the ORU (Over-Required-Undereducation) literature, the present study uses the distribution of native-born workers across occupations by the field of study and degree of education as a benchmark that internationally educated immigrant workers can attain in the long run. This approach helps us eliminate the difficult problem of determining an ideal matching ordering of 520 occupations for each of the 1375 fields of study in labor markets, particularly for unregulated occupations. Similarly, it also removes the need for identifying the “required education” in each of 520 occupations, which is usually estimated as the most observed years of schooling or degrees in an occupation and commonly criticized in the literature due to their poor measurement properties. Even if an ideal matching in both dimensions could be found, the actual quality of immigrants’ occupational match should be gaged relative to a comparison group, and millions of native-born workers in labor markets would appear to be a natural choice. This allows us to estimate the wage earnings of immigrants after removing the dissimilarities in their occupational match relative to that of the native-born. Thus, by adjusting the quality of immigrants’ occupational matching, we can isolate the returns to education in estimation such that they reflect the true rewards to foreign credentials. Although our results show a significant and persistent poor matching quality for internationally educated immigrant workers, their relative wage gain from a better matching is not as sizeable as envisioned in some policy circles.Footnote 3 This finding implies that, even if immigrants work in their trained jobs with a required degree, their foreign credentials are subject to a substantial discount in Canadian labor markets. In other words, the lower return to immigrants’ foreign credentials is much more a “source-country problem” rather than being a “host-country problem” that can be efficiently dealt with by postarrival policies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes previous research; Section 3 introduces the data and contains a descriptive analysis. Econometric results and a discussion of our findings are given in Section 4. We provide the concluding remarks in Section 5.",6

The primary difference between the two systems is that the former requires the applicant for immigration be employed or have a job offer in the host country but the latter typically does not. While most countries have some form of an employer-driven system, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have relied primarily on migrant-driven systems and have developed criteria for selecting immigrants based on characteristics related to the human capital of potential immigrants, such as age, education, language ability, and work experience (Bertoli et al. 2016).2
,
3 For countries with migrant-driven systems, a number of recent studies have compared the labor market outcomes of immigrants admitted via programs using different selection criteria.4
 Recent changes in immigration policies in countries with migrant-driven systems indicate a preference for skilled workers with prior experience in the immigrant host country.5 In Canada, this preference is explicit in the eligibility criteria for the recently introduced Canadian Experience Class (CEC) program.6 The CEC represents a move away from the traditional migrant-driven system in which policy-makers used human capital characteristics to predict which candidates will be successful in the Canadian labor market.7 Previous employment in Canada implies that immigrants were preselected by Canadian employers and programs like the CEC use this preselection as an additional predictor of immigrant success. This direction in policy concedes a greater, albeit indirect, role to employers in selecting immigrants best suited for the Canadian labor market. The resulting program is a hybrid, combining elements of an employer-driven system (i.e., preselection) with those of a migrant-driven system. In this paper, we use a unique Canadian administrative dataset to compare the outcomes of immigrants with and without prior experience in Canada and evaluate whether changes in immigration policies that emphasize prior Canadian experience are likely to improve the selection of immigrants to Canada. Our findings will provide insights into whether a move towards a hybrid migrant-driven system, which bases selection on a combination of employer preselection and worker human capital characteristics, will improve the labor market performance of immigrants. The Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB) provides data from the tax returns of all immigrants admitted to Canada since 1980.8 Given that the changes in Canadian immigration policies that prioritize immigrants with prior experience in the country are recent, the data available on the labor market performance of immigrants selected through these programs is not adequate for analysis.9 However, income tax returns filed by immigrants prior to obtaining permanent residence in Canada were recently added to the IMDB. We use this new data to distinguish between immigrants with prior Canadian experience (prefilers) and immigrants without prior experience (non-prefilers). Members of the former group had experience with the Canadian labor market prior to making the decision to immigrate. We use prefiling status as a proxy for this preselection of immigrants by employers and analyze the differences in earnings of the two groups of immigrants to determine whether prior experience in Canada is a predictor of labor market success of immigrants. Given that our focus is on the selection of immigrants, we limit our analysis to immigrants who are selected by Citizenship and Immigration Canada: principal applicants admitted through one of the economic immigration categories.10
 We document the incidence of Canadian experience prior to immigration and find that 17 % of male immigrants and 23 % of female immigrants were prefilers.11 Given that most prefiling happens immediately prior to obtaining permanent resident status and consists of spells of 6 or fewer years, we restrict our analysis to immigrants that arrived in Canada between 1988 and 2009.12 This allows us to ensure comparability of the time of arrival for prefilers and non-prefilers.13
 Previous studies of the performance of Canadian immigrants generally define the arrival year as the year in which an immigrant obtained permanent residence status in Canada (see, for example, Aydemir and Skuterud 2005; Green and Worswick 2012). Given that prefilers arrive in Canada before they obtain permanent residence, measures that treat the year of permanent residence as the arrival year will overstate foreign experience and understate Canadian experience. For a better measure of Canadian and foreign experience of immigrants, we organize the data around the year of arrival. Further, we follow Aydemir and Skuterud (2005) and restrict our analysis to immigrants aged 25 to 54 at the time of arrival. This age restriction implies that most immigrants will have completed their education prior to arriving in Canada. We begin our analysis by comparing the earnings and characteristics of prefilers and non-prefilers. We find that both male and female prefilers tend to be on average 2 years younger than non-prefilers. However, while educational attainment is similar for male prefilers and non-prefilers, female prefilers have lower educational attainment. Further, prefilers are more likely than non-prefilers to be from Europe or the USA and to speak an official language of Canada as either the mother tongue or as a language learned prior to obtaining permanent resident status. For both male and female immigrants, prefilers have significantly higher mean earnings than non-prefilers 1 year after arrival. We estimate a series of earnings models to characterize the earnings difference between prefilers and non-prefilers. To determine the magnitude of the difference, we estimate earnings equations by sex, excluding individual characteristics of immigrants. For males, we find that, relative to non-prefilers, entry earnings of prefilers are 72 % higher. Furthermore, even though prefilers have a flatter earnings profile, earnings of the two groups of immigrants do not converge 20 years after arrival. Female prefilers have a smaller entry earnings advantage, and the earnings of female prefilers and non-prefilers converge in about 5 years. We expand the regression model and include immigrant characteristics to determine whether observable differences between prefilers and non-prefilers can account for the difference in earnings. We find that differences in characteristics explain about a third of the entry earnings advantage of prefilers for males and about a quarter for females. Language and source region of immigrants account for most of this explained difference. 
Aydemir and Skuterud (2005) and Green and Worswick (2010) find that recent cohorts of Canadian receive a negligible (or slightly negative) return to foreign experience.14 Given these findings, we expand our model to allow for differences in the returns to Canadian and foreign experience of prefilers and non-prefilers. We find that for both male and female immigrants, the primary source of the higher entry earnings of prefilers is a higher return to foreign experience in the Canadian labor market. While non-prefilers receive a negligible or small negative return to foreign experience, prefilers receive a positive return. In addition, the earnings dispersion by level of education is higher for prefilers, which suggests that prefilers receive a higher return to education than non-prefilers. We also estimate a specification that allows the return to differ across broad groupings of source regions and find that for both male and female immigrants, the return to foreign experience for prefilers from Western countries is higher than that for prefilers from other countries.15
 Our findings suggest that changes in immigration policies that increase the number of immigrants with prior Canadian experience will improve the average performance of immigrants in the Canadian labor market. In particular, given that the declining return to foreign experience has been highlighted as an important explanation for the decline in earnings of more recent cohorts of immigrants to Canada, our finding of a positive return to foreign experience for prefilers suggests that a policy shift towards retaining more workers on temporary work visas will result in better labor market outcomes for Canadian immigrants.16 This shift in policy will require that, in addition to allowing employers to address short-term labor shortages, temporary visa programs be recognized for their potential in identifying applicants for immigration with the ability to successfully integrate into the host country’s labor market. For policy-makers in countries developing criteria for selecting skilled immigrants (for example, the USA and Europe), our findings support introducing measures to retain temporary migrants who have been preselected by employers and to integrate temporary worker visa programs with the immigration selection process.17 The recent comprehensive immigration reforms proposed in the USA include selection criteria for skilled immigrants that reward prior experience in the USA (Boyd 2014).18 Our findings suggest that these reforms will result in selection of skilled immigrants that will perform well in the US labor market. Our paper is related to two recent studies. Sweetman and Warman (2014) use data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (LSIC) to estimate the differences in earnings between immigrants that were temporary foreign workers and international students before immigrating to Canada. The LSIC data has a number of limitations. It has a small sample size and only includes applicants that applied for immigration from outside Canada and, hence, severely under-represents immigrants with prior Canadian experience. Hou and Bonikowska (2015) use IMDB data to examine the differences in earnings between immigrants with prior Canadian experience and those without. While estimates of the earnings advantage for prefilers in their study are similar to those that we find, they focus on quantifying the differences in earnings across visa categories (i.e., temporary foreign workers and international students) but do not examine how differences in characteristics and returns to human capital account for the difference in earnings between prefilers and non-prefilers.19
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief description of the data and present some summary statistics. In Section 3, we discuss the earnings equation that we estimate and present our findings. Section 4 provides a brief conclusion.",

Important and recent events such as the civil wars in Lybia, Syria, and Iraq have disrupted the geopolitical equilibrium in Northern Africa and the Middle East, provoking thousands of casualties, countless displaced people, and a grave power vacuum; the resulting state of anarchy facilitated a remarkable increase in the immigration rate not only from these regions but also from Sub-Saharan African countries and other countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Since 2014, the European Union (E.U.) has witnessed a dramatic increase in the arrivals of immigrants asking for political asylum. Due to their geographical location, Italy and Greece have been the two E.U. member states which have been receiving the highest number of immigrants. After the agreement signed between the E.U. and Turkey in March 2016, nowadays, almost all of the immigration flows in Europe arrive from Libya and other parts of Northern Africa, so that Italy surpassed Greece as Europe’s major point of entry (The New York Times 2016). In particular, the number of immigrants entering the Italian territory switched from 42,925 in 2013 to 153,842 in 2015 and 181,436 in 2016 (Ministry of Interior 2016; UNHCR 2016). To face this emergency, the European Union has increased funding for border patrol operations in the Mediterranean and elaborated plans to combat the smuggling of immigrants (the “Operation Sophia”). Despite all the countermeasures adopted by the E.U. to cope effectively with immigration, the burden of asylum seekers is not shared in an equal way among member states, with Italy remaining the member country bearing the greatest burden; first of all, a proper reform of the Dublin treaty (which requires the countries in which the first registration of immigrants takes place to host them) has not yet been accomplished (BBC 2016); moreover, the plan of quotas to redistribute asylum seekers between member states approved by the European Commission in 2015 has met scarce implementation, since many E.U. countries (for instance, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia) have strongly opposed the plan and refused to receive their quotas of immigrants (Daily Express 2016). As a result, in the last 2 years, Italy has been accepting and redistributing on its territory almost the entirety of the immigration flows, and this has created financial and logistic issues to the Italian government, due to the limited hosting capacity of the country together with inadequate financial support from the E.U. (The Daily Telegraph 2015). With reference to the provenience of immigrants entering Italy, in 2015, 74% of them was from Sub-Saharan Africa, 7% from Bangladesh, 6% from Pakistan, 1% from Syria, and 12% from other countries. Moreover, 85% of all immigrants were male against 15% of women. All these trends remained virtually unchanged in 2016 (Ministry of Interior 2016). The Italian management system of immigrants is rather articulated. In synthesis, upon arrival, immigrants are sent to the Centri di Prima Accoglienza, which are hubs where they are gathered and subject to a first general control. Those who do not meet the requirements of asylum seekers are expelled, the others are redistributed to the so-called centri SPRAR (Sistema di Protezione per Richiedenti Asilo e Rifugiati), namely municipal hosting facilities directly managed by the municipal authorities or hosting facilities belonging to specific associations under the direct supervision of the municipality. All the immigrants who get relocated to the hosting municipal facilities are subsequently subject to a second control for regularity by the municipal officers of the Ministry of Interior; because of this, a recurrent number of immigrants in every municipality gets repatriated due to the failure in meeting the necessary requirements to be granted the status of refugees (TGcom24 2016). Being previously the redistribution of immigrants to SPRAR facilities on a pure voluntary basis, in December 2016, to cope with an increasing and uninterrupted flow of immigrants, the government has obliged each Italian municipality to host a minimum of three immigrants every 1,000 inhabitants, providing financial subsidies for every immigrant hosted (Il Giornale 2016a). Specifically, the central government provides an average of 35 euros per day for each immigrant; this amount was computed through an evaluation of the operating hosting costs incurred daily by municipalities, amounting on average to 27 euros per immigrant; thus, the resulting average profit for municipalities amounts to 8 euros per day per immigrant hosted (Il Giornale 2014). This program enabled by the central government has been targeted to incentivize municipalities to host additional immigrants, in order to better cope with the immigration emergency. As for the location of municipalities hosting more immigrants, no precise geographic pattern emerges; indeed, among the Italian municipalities which have been hosting the highest number of immigrants in the last 2 years, it is possible to find Rome, Catania, Milano, and Bari, which represent cities located in regions far from each other (Istat 2016). Table 1 provides descriptive statistics at regional level for the number of immigrants hosted, expelled, and who arrived in Italy in the years 2015 and 2016.
 The immigration policy of Italian municipalities has led to different reactions in the public opinion, especially when differentiating between citizens and firms. According to recent opinion polls, the majority of Italian citizens is against the current hosting policy of municipalities; a detailed survey conducted in 2016 by an Italian research institute over a sample of 800 random people belonging to 30 different municipalities contributed to confirm this trend. Specifically, people interviewed were asked for their opinion on the consistent arrivals of immigrants and the action they would like to undertake; 27% of the respondents was in favor of expelling all the immigrants, 50% of accepting only a restricted number of them, and 19% of accepting them all and 4% did not know (Eumetra 2016). Conversely, two different surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Italian Chamber of Commerce for a sample of over 100,000 firms through their respective entrepreneurial bodies, provided a remarkably opposite outcome (Excelsior 2015; Excelsior 2016). Indeed, these surveys highlighted how the growing need for unskilled labor over the past few years has been representing a significant and constant trend in the Italian industrial reality, affecting almost the whole totality of the sectors; because of this, on average, the demand for immigrant workers1 by Italian firms has been registering a positive and constant increase of around 5% since 2013 (further increasing of a few percentage points in the period 2015–2016)2
,
3. As a consequence, in order to better deal with this issue, many Italian enterprises have entered into direct negotiations with their respective municipalities with the aim of obtaining a positive and predetermined rate of immigrant arrivals to offset their growing need of unskilled labor. Nevertheless, the bureaucratic rules that remain in Italy for the regularization process of immigrants and the recruitment procedures involving the latter by firms (see, e.g., the 189/2002 law) remain considerable, especially when compared to other European countries (Finotelli 2011). As a result, the period of stay of immigrants in the municipal hosting facilities and the recruitment procedures by firms get longer.4 In light of this, and of other factors such as the high population density of Italy, the particular urban structure of Italian municipalities, and the limited hosting capacity of many municipal facilities, an increasing number of municipalities is currently experiencing situations of overcongestion (La Repubblica 2016; Il Messaggero 2016); the pressure exercised by firms and the financial subsidies provided by the central government for hosting additional immigrants have additionally contributed to exacerbate this condition, also due to the fact that many Italian municipalities facing financial issues have exploited this opportunity to gain additional revenues (Il Giornale 2016b). At the same time, contrary to the mainstream positive attitude of firms towards immigration, local residents in some municipalities have been protesting actively against the uninterrupted arrivals of immigrants. Conversely, in other places, the same level of protests by local residents has been much more contained, whereas in some other municipalities, the attitude of firms towards immigrants has been less accommodating, resulting hence in different scenarios (TGcom24 2017). Specifically, with reference to the immigration policy implementation, a municipality periodically sets a predetermined number of immigrants to relocate to its hosting facilities5 after having reviewed the opinion of multiple subjects, above all firm representatives and local residents6; therefore, the subsequent chosen quota of immigrants to relocate to the city by the municipal authority also represents the result of a bargaining process between different (and often contrasting) opinions belonging to different actors. The resulting indisposition of the latter towards variations in the number of immigrants to be hosted (which was eventually obtained after the bargaining process) clearly represents a rigidity for the municipal authority when having to update its desired immigration policy. This can also explain why in municipalities where the level of these rigidities is high (i.e., high opposition towards variations in the acceptance rate of immigrants), when having to modify the desired quota of immigrants to host, in order to meet the discordant requests of firms and local residents, the rate of immigrant arrivals has to be updated periodically by the municipal authority; conversely, in those municipalities where the same actors involved do not appear to give particular importance to the immigration phenomenon, the margin of manoeuvre for implementing the desired immigration policy by the municipal authority is considerably higher, with resulting fewer and more stable changes in the rate of immigrant arrivals. Because of this, it was possible to assist to an heterogeneity in immigration policy behavior emerging among different municipalities (Corriere della Sera 2017). The topic of immigration management in Europe (and Italy) is virtually absent in the literature, also due to the novelty of the recent and massive immigration flows towards the European Union. Relying on all the premises expressed above, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature by building a theoretical dynamic model addressing the recurrent issue of overcongestion afflicting the immigration hosting facilities of an increasing number of Italian municipalities. In this framework, a municipal authority faces a trade-off between increasing the number of immigrants into its urban jurisdiction (which generates revenues) and optimal congestion level. Additionally, it is rational to assume that a municipal authority can utilize a share of the revenues to amplify the capacity of its hosting facilities, in this way decreasing the congestion level. As stressed, municipalities, in modifying the rate of change of immigration flows, must further take into account the level of rigidities exercised by both local residents and firms, who hence affect the process of policy implementation. Increasing the rate of immigrant arrivals might please firms and contribute to raise the municipal revenues, but at the same time, it can lead to situations of overcongestion and higher protests by local residents. Conversely, decreasing the same rate alleviates the issue of overcongestion and might please local residents but can be detrimental for firms and lead to a lower revenue receipt. From the model, two important findings emerge; firstly, at the steady-state level, the municipality always experiences a level of overcongestion (with respect to the optimal congestion level). Secondly, the different magnitude of the impact exercised by the level of rigidities can lead to different dynamic paths of convergence towards the steady state, namely monotonic or oscillatory. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces and solves the model. Section 3 concludes.",1

In this paper, we study the impact of the drug war and the related steep rise in homicides since 2006 on the residential choices of the Mexican population. The drug war began after newly elected president Felipe Calderón launched a federal assault on drug trafficking organizations. Annual homicides increased from 10,452 in 2006 to 27,213 in 2011 (Trans-border Institute, 2012), and in total, more than 50,000 deaths are attributed to the conflict.Footnote 1 The death toll also has been geographically concentrated, with only 3% of municipalities accounting for 70% of homicides (Rios and Shirk 2011). Despite this regional concentration, the increased fear of violence has been widespread. Nationally representative victimization surveys show that the proportion of adults who feel their state of residence is unsafe rose 49% in 2004 to 61% in 2009, and this increased feeling of insecurity occurred in states that did not become more violent as well as those that did. Footnote 2
Footnote 3 These distorted beliefs about the true level of violence have been found in other contexts (Becker and Rubinstein, 2011) and may play an important role in determining relocation decisions.Footnote 4
 Hirschman (1970) states that one way for citizens to express their discontent if the advantages of being in an organization (here their residential location), and hence their loyalties, decrease is “exit”, or migration to a more preferred location. Several papers have found that, at least on an aggregate level, people do exit locations when they think there is a threat of violent behavior, from governments or dissidents, to their “personal integrity” (Moore and Shellman 2004; Davenport et al. 2003). For example, in the case of the USA, Cullen and Levitt (1999) analyze the phenomenon of population flight from city centers to surrounding suburbs, and find that an increase in various crimes leads to a significant decline in cities’ population. At an individual level, Dugan (1999) finds that individuals who are victims of property crime are significantly more likely to move, while Xie and McDowall (2008) find that victims of violent crime are also likely to move, and do so more than victims of property crime. They also find that, in addition to their own victimization, people react to a heightened fear of crime and move in response to the victimization of immediate neighbors. Evidence of relocation also is found for Colombia, a country that, similar to Mexico, experienced a protracted conflict between the government, drug trafficking organizations, and rebel groups. Papers find that households with greater exposure to violence in their own or surrounding areas were more likely to move to safer metropolitan areas (Engel and Ibáñez, 2007), while households in major cities with higher kidnapping risks from rebel groups were likely to send members abroad (Rodriguez and Villa, 2012). The literature on Colombia also highlights that contrasted with traditional migration, risk aversion and lack of information may affect violence-induced migration (Engel and Ibáñez, 2007). In contrast to Colombia, however, the increase in drug violence in Mexico was sharp and sudden. Over the 3-year period of 2006 to 2009, total homicides in Mexico rose by 90%. In terms of a migration response, there are several anecdotal reports of people leaving areas that have been severely affected by the violence, with most accounts stating that migrants have moved across the border to the USA (Rice, 2011; Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, 2011; Arceo-Gómez, 2013). On a broad scale, however, almost no study has examined if the violence in Mexico led to widespread migration and subsequent population changes. One exception is Rios (2014), who finds that drug-related homicides are highly correlated with unpredicted population declines at the municipal level. Rios’s identification strategy, however, is limited as it does not control for unobserved area level factors that may jointly determine drug violence and migration decisions.Footnote 5 This omission is important as conflict can be linked with economic prosperity (Abadíe and Gardeazábal 2003), while socioeconomic factors at the area level can be significant determinants of displacement, even after conflict variables are controlled for (Verwimp et al. 2009).Footnote 6
 In this paper we overcome the obstacle of controlling for unobserved area level heterogeneity by using an instrumental variables strategy. We instrument for annual violence using kilometers of federal highways interacted with cocaine seizures in Colombia. We argue that highways capture pre-existing drug distribution networks and that the majority of violence has originated among cartels to gain control of these networks. Highways are a relevant predictor of the changes in local violence, but only after the start of the drug war. In order to account for time variation in the value of drug distribution routes and address concerns about the exclusion restriction—specifically the direct link between highways and migration—we interact highways with drug interdiction efforts from Colombia. Seizures changed during the drug war period and provided an external shock to the volume of drugs being transported across these routes (Castillo et al. 2016). Overall, we find no strong evidence that increased homicides during the drug war period led to increased migration. For domestic migration, which arguably is less costly relocation, instead of the positive correlation between violence and relocation reported in previous papers and media reports, we find a negative relationship. Thus, once we account for unobservable area level or time-varying factors, we find that rising violence did not increase relocation, either across states or municipalities. For international migration we find mixed results depending on the geographic level of aggregation. At the municipal level we find negative coefficients, showing that increased violence decreased the number of households that sent members abroad. At the state level, however, we find positive coefficients, suggesting the opposite. We argue these results may be a result of a heterogeneous response across municipalities in more violent states. In total, however, our results show a muted migration response to large increases in violence and one this is incompatible with a story of large-scale displacement. We propose that the results may be explained by multiple factors, including a low level of mobility among the Mexican population, perceptions of the differences in security in home and possible destination areas within Mexico, increases in the cost of relocation due to the violence itself, and adoption of alternate coping methods in response to violence.",21

Deniz Genç,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey (2016a), more than 4.5 million Turkish people call Western European countries home today. In these societies, Turkish migrants are subjects of discussions on integration, citizenship, acculturation, etc. Moreover, Turkey’s troublesome relationship with the European Union (EU) complicates these discussions as mobility and migration have become important issues in Turkey-EU relations. Irregular migrants, probability of new waves of migrations from Turkey in the event of full membership and EU’s visa requirement for Turkish citizens have been fervently debated in the context of relations. The Syrian refugee crisis, on the other hand, has deepened divisions over these matters. In this context, the Turkish government and the European Commission are working to introduce visa liberalization. Though the liberalization process had been stalled until very recently, the Syrian refugee crisis and refugees’ mass movement to Turkey and to EU via Turkey has led to a change of approach from both parties. EU promised Turkey to introduce visa liberalization in return for fulfilling the necessary requirements set by the Commission. The Turkish government has been working diligently to fulfil the requirements to earn visa liberalization for its citizens. EU public opinion, however, is largely opposed. Public polls have revealed that EU citizens fear new waves of migration from Turkey (Dagdeverenis 2014). In line with these developments and EU citizens’ fears about Turkish migration, this study discusses the determinants of mobility between Turkey and EU via application of an enlarged gravity model. Though gravity models have been widely used for analysing economic issues, data limitations in migration flows have obstructed their use regarding migration. Constitution of bilateral databases enables the use of gravity models to evaluate migration-related issues such as the effects of visa restriction policies on migration flows (Ramos 2016). We employ gravity model to acquire an intuitive framework that enables us to understand and discuss the determinants of migration between Turkey and the EU countries and their significance in making decisions regarding emigration. The gravity model applied in this study employs nine variables: (1) relative differences in GDP per capita between the destination and the origin country; (2) population in the origin and the destination country; (3) geographical distance between capital cities of origin and destination countries; (4) Urbanization Rate; (5) Contiguity; (7) Network; (8) Landlocked and (9) Area. We believe that the integration of these variables, which previously have not been examined with the already existent variables of the model, enhances the discussion of the determinants of Turkish migration to Europe and its future dynamics. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a thorough introduction of Turkish migration to Europe as well as the significance of mobility in Turkey-EU relations. This section is followed by the presentation of the enlarged gravity model, different methods of estimation employed in the analysis, variables and their hypotheses along with the data. Section 4 presents the empirical findings followed by a brief discussion. Lastly, Section 5 provides an analysis of the determinants of Turkish migration to Europe including a humble evaluation concerning the future flows.",9

A rough (and perhaps overlapping) categorization might be as follows: economic mixing (working or doing business with each other); social mixing (belonging to the same common-interest groups, including religious institutions, schools, clubs, and informal friendship affiliations); geographic mixing (through neighborhood proximity and contacts); and demographic mixing (mating and the bearing of children). Our concern in this paper is demographic mixing and, more specifically, the bearing of children with mothers and fathers from different populations. Population mixing for us will be the result of cross-parenting, as we shall call it. (We use cross-parenting in preference to cross-breeding, the term common in biology, as it has a greater connotation of voluntary choice. Note too that the term population mixing in our context differs from its definition in epidemiology where it refers to contacts among people as a result of spatial movement; see Law et al. 2008.) In the analysis that follows, we will define three populations, a non-immigrant population, an immigrant population (original immigrants and their descendants), and a mixed population, and we will employ a simplified or “stylized” demographic projection model to trace the evolution of each population from one generation to the next under alternative assumptions about the propensity to cross-parent. Although implicit rather than explicit in the model, immigrants could have the same characteristics as non-immigrants or they could differ in various ways—ethnicity, language, education, and others—and such differences could have an important bearing on the mixing pattern. While not directly related to immigration (except historically), we note that many studies of population mixing in the USA have focused on racial intermarriage. Fryer (2007), for example, contrasts the “extraordinary convergence” in relation to black-white economic and political empowerment with much less convergence “in the most intimate spheres of life – religion, residential location, marriage, and cohabitation” and observes that marriage across racial lines is a “rare event” (pp. 71, 72). Torch and Rich (2016) report that the proportion of black-white marriages and cohabitations among couples increased fivefold from 1980 to 2010 but still accounted for only 1.5% of the total (p. 1). The integration of immigrants with non-immigrants is a concern for many countries (immigrants account for more than 20% of the population in some of the major recipients), and inter-mating and cross-parenting are important indicators. Adserà and Ferrer (2015) provide a summary of the literature relating to intermarriage of immigrants and non-immigrants. They note that “the capacity to form and maintain exogamous unions (between native and foreign born) can be interpreted as the quintessence of successful integration” (p. 324). Referring to the work of Duncan and Trejo (2007), they observe too that “selectivity into intermarriage influences ethnic identification” and, hence, the measurement of integration for those with “immigrant ancestry” (p. 324). Substituting “cross-parenting” for “intermarriage,” these observations relate directly to our focus in the present paper. The paper, based on a stylized model, is theoretical and exploratory. Our intention is to show how quickly, in generational time, one could expect integration to take place under alternative assumptions about the propensity for immigrants and non-immigrants to mix, where cross-parenting is the mixing instrument. We develop the model, calibrate it using life table data, and carry out a series of experiments starting with a stable population and introducing immigration at different rates. Alternative underlying mixing preferences are assumed in the experiments, and a procedure is developed for adapting the preferences to render them consistent with restrictions imposed by the available populations of childbearing age. The preferences range from no mixing at all (no cross-parenting) to free, unrestricted mixing. The non-immigrant, immigrant, and mixed components of the overall population are projected as a tri-population system. Of special interest is the proportion of mixed in the total as it changes from one generation to the next and approaches a steady-state limit as the number of generations increases without bound.",2

Most of this research has been conducted in English-speaking countries (Rivera-Batiz 1992; Dustmann and Fabbri 2003; Lui 2007; Chiswick and Miller 1999, 2010; Bleakley and Chin 2004; Zhen 2013). More recently, researchers have further focused on non-English-speaking countries, including Germany (Dustmann and van Soest 2002), Israel (Chiswick 1998; Chiswick and Repetto 2001; Berman et al. 2003), and Norway (Hayfron 2001), among others. The common finding is that greater destination language fluency significantly raises immigrants’ earnings. In Spain, most research conducted has focused on Catalonia, and its regional language, Catalan (Rendón 2007; Di Paolo 2011; Di Paolo and Raymond 2012), while efforts to assess the impact of Castilian Spanish language proficiency on immigrant earnings at a country level are much relatively recent (Budría and Swedberg 2014). There is also evidence to suggest that returns to foreign languages are sizable in Spain (Isphording 2013). This paper uses the Spanish National Immigrant Survey (NISS), a large-scale immigration survey released by the Spanish National Statistics Institute, to calculate quantile returns to host language proficiency. Most papers to date have estimated returns only at the average of the (conditional) wage distribution. Averages, however, fail to describe the full distributional impact of the variable under scrutiny unless this variable affects both the central and the tail deciles in the same way. In many cases, interest focuses on the impact of the covariate on points other than the center of the conditional distribution. This seems particularly relevant in the present context, as the effects of host language proficiency among the low-wage immigrants will probably be more relevant for public policy than the effects among the high-earning population. Recent evidence shown for other countries suggests significant differences across the earning distribution, albeit the extent and pattern of fluctuations differs between studies (Boyd and Cao 2009; Wang and Wang 2011; Ginsburgh and Prieto-Rodriguez 2011). To our knowledge, this is the first paper to examine the extent of heterogeneity across segments of the conditional wage distribution for the returns to Spanish language proficiency. The paper relies on Chernozhukov and Hansen’s (2008) instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) approach. The main advantage of this method is that it allows us to account for the potential endogeneity of the language variable. This refinement is crucial in the present context. Simple OLS and quantile estimates are likely to be upward biased if language ability depends on unobservable individual characteristics that are potentially related to unmeasurable earning determinants. At the same time, self-reported measures of language proficiency are subject to measurement error, an issue that has drawn the attention of researchers (Dustmann and van Soest 2002, 2004; Bleakley and Chin 2004). While classical measurement error leads to attenuation bias whereby OLS and QR estimates are below the true returns to Spanish proficiency, the bias under non-systematic errors is more ambiguous and complex. To partially address these issues, we search for instruments that account for exogenous variations in Spanish language proficiency. Instrumental variables can provide consistent estimates under ability-bias and classical measurement error. While exploring the extent of non-classical measurement error is beyond the scope of the present paper and can be still a concern using IV, there is evidence that suggests that classical dominates non-classical measurement error as a source of bias in OLS and IV estimates.Footnote 1 The first instrument used in this paper is based on Bleakley and Chin (2004) and exploits the fact that younger children learn languages more easily than older children. The second instrument exploits the notion that parents’ exposure to communication with their children in the destination country’s language acts as a transmission mechanism. This mechanism is more likely to operate among immigrants who live with children in school, for school enrolment and attendance contribute notably and more rapidly to the children’s host language proficiency. There is some debate in the policy arena on whether language proficiency is associated with unobserved ability. Non-proficient immigrants may be, in some ways, less capable and therefore lack essential abilities and skills that are required to perform a high-paying job. If this was the case, their lower wages are a mere statistical illusion that reflects an omitted variable problem rather than a causal relationship between language ability and earnings. Under IVQR, the estimates at different quantiles represent the impact of a given covariate for individuals that have the same observable characteristics but that due to unobserved earning capacity are located at different points of the earning distribution. By “unobserved earnings capacity,” we are referring to all the unmeasured characteristics that actually affect the worker’s position within the wage distribution, including not only individual-level abilities and skills but also contextual-level characteristics such as workplace conditions. Thus, we show how immigrant workers who are proficient in Spanish within the various segments of the earning distribution are affected relative to their non-proficient counterparts. The major advantage of this approach is that it prevents us from comparing proficient individuals enjoying an advantageous earning capacity with non-proficient individuals subject to an unfavorable earning condition. This approach has proven fruitful in the economics of education literature to ascertain whether certain educational attributes are associated with unobserved earning ability (McGuinness and Bennett 2007; Bárcena et al. 2012). An additional contribution of the paper is that it illustrates the role of host language proficiency in shaping wage inequality. Average estimates assume that the marginal impact of language proficiency on wages is constant over the wage distribution. If true, the effect of having language skills can be represented by a shift (to the right) of the conditional wage distribution. In contrast, the IVQR estimates represent the impact of host language proficiency on wages at different points of the distribution, thus describing changes not only in the location but also in the shape of the distribution. By combining average with quantile estimates, we can assess the impact of Spanish proficiency on wage inequality between and within groups: while average returns measure the average differential between proficient and non-proficient immigrants, differences in quantile returns represent the wage differential between proficient immigrants that are located at different quantiles of the distribution. To provide a more detailed view, the paper conducts separate regressions for immigrants with different educational attainment. There are reasons to believe that language proficiency and schooling are complementary inputs of the earning-generating process. Language skills are more likely to represent a valuable asset in occupations that require higher levels of formal education. Moreover, since poor language skills may hamper life opportunities, social mobility, and job offers, we expect stronger effects from language proficiency among the highly educated. The evidence collected so far is scarce and suggestive of diverging degrees of complementarity between schooling and language skills (Chiswick and Miller 2003; Casale and Posel 2011). This paper documents not only differences among education groups in terms of the return to host language proficiency but also differences within groups. The aim is to examine whether the extent of heterogeneity surrounding the returns to host language proficiency depends on an individual’s education. Such heterogeneous effects may have pronounced implications for the design of effective immigrant integration policies. An immigration policy priority in OECD countries is language training (OECD 2012). This has become extremely relevant as a result of the increasing amount of refugees (i.e., non-economic immigrants) that are migrating to high-income countries in Europe. Unfortunately, the scope attributed to such policies may be more modest than presumed if workers with low qualifications and in the lowest segments of the earning distribution fail to reap relevant returns from language training. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief background of recent immigration to Spain and a review of the literature. Section 3 describes the dataset, the estimating sample, and the Spanish language proficiency question. Section 4 depicts the estimation strategy including the IVQR approach. Section 5 presents and examines the estimates for the impact of Spanish language proficiency on immigrants’ earnings. Section 6 discusses issues of instrument quality and outlines theoretical implications. Section 7 contains the concluding remarks.",9

This paper is concerned with the ability of workers to make transitions from their jobs in response to wage signals. One possible barrier to job transitions may be a lack of other job opportunities due to few employers in the labor market—the situation of monopsony. Other reasons relate to an inability to move from one’s job even when other employment opportunities are available. A worker may have poor information about these opportunities or may not have the time to search them out. Or a worker may know about other jobs but cannot afford to make such a transition, either due to high switching costs or the high risk put on a worker and her family. This paper uses a dynamic monopsony model that formalizes these constraints to job movement into one theoretical framework and describes how the wage elasticity of labor supply captures a worker’s ability to change jobs in response to wage offers (Manning 2003). The monopsony model predicts that labor supply elasticity is positive—that workers are more likely to leave a low-paying than a high-paying job and that firms attract more workers with higher wage offers. The model also predicts a relationship between wage elasticity and earnings differences, illustrated as follows: in a labor market where job-search frictions are prevalent, differences in workers’ job mobility (measured through wage elasticity) can result in earnings differences between them, despite similar education or occupational choices. Should female workers have lower elasticity than male workers, either due to preferences (i.e., the trade-off for stability over wage) or constraints (i.e., poorer information), females would have less ability to move to higher-paying jobs compared to males, resulting in an earnings gap. Better understanding the potential relationship of labor monopsony and gender mobility differences requires information on the firms hiring and paying workers. Such firms may possibly impose pay structures to the disadvantage of groups with lower wage elasticity of labor supply. For this paper, I use an employer-employee-linked dataset for Brazil to estimate the dynamic monopsony model. Setting the analysis in a middle-income economy (MIC) is a major contribution to the study of monopsony, as higher poverty rates, less developed transportation infrastructure, fewer education opportunities, and lower unionization rates may play a role in creating market frictions that hinder job mobility. With the Brazilian Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS) data, I control for both worker and firm variables to estimate elasticity. To test the relationship between job transitions and actual earnings differences, I estimate labor supply elasticities for males and females separately. Two tests of the results follow: first, estimated standard errors allow for significance testing on gender differences in elasticity. Second, actual gaps in mean wages are compared to gaps predicted by male-female differences in elasticity. In addition, I propose a number of improvements and checks to the methods that have been employed in previous monopsony studies. First, I am able to differentiate voluntary from involuntary separations (i.e., quits from layoffs). Worker movements toward better offers drive the dynamics of the monopsony model. The inclusion of layoffs in the data may confuse estimates based on worker movements. Second, I estimate separation elasticities over various specifications of hazard models to check robustness and test for various assumptions of these techniques. Third, I perform statistical tests of gender differences and discuss the effects such testing may have for related studies. Elasticity has a very straightforward, inverse relationship to earnings in monopsony theories. In actual markets, this relationship may be complicated over the diversity of workers and regions in Brazil. To help clarify the association between earnings and elasticity, I extend the model through disaggregation and decomposition. The first extension compares gender differences in elasticity to earnings by region and sector subgroups for Brazil. The second extension more closely analyzes empirical aspects of the job separation regression, which is the fundamental model used in estimating wage elasticity. I use non-linear decomposition methods to analyze the role that wage plays relative to other factors in worker separations and how this differs across gender.",3

Scholarly analysis has also focussed on the transmission and persistence of ethnic identity through parents’ cultural influences and socialization within family and wider social contexts including neighbourhoods and peer groups (Bisin et al. 2006; Chiswick 2009). The emphasis on identity formation and transmission is justified by the role that ethnic identity plays in individual economic performances. In this respect, some economic studies have investigated on how the identification with the culture of home and host countries influences immigrants’ and their children’s labour market outcomes. There is evidence that a strong ethnic identity lowers the probability of being employed for immigrants (Constant et al. 2006; Bisin et al. 2011) and that at the time of arrival, immigrants earn a lower wage as compared to native born (Adsera and Chiswick 2007). Interestingly, ethnic minority identity may work in opposite directions as, on the one hand, it facilitates the access to labour market opportunities for young individuals who participate in ethnic networks (Casey and Dustmann 2010) and, on the other, it often means participation in poor social networks with scarce information on job opportunities (Battu et al. 2007). Yet labour market performance is largely affected by individuals’ schooling, which in turn depends on ethnic identity as well (Akerlof and Kranton 2002). In this respect, a strand of literature has taken into consideration how parents’ ethnic identity influences the scholastic performance of their children. For instance, in Germany, mothers’ identification with the host country and fathers’ identification with the home country positively affects school achievements of second-generation children (Schüller 2015). Strong ethnic identity may lead black adolescents to choose mostly same-race friends rather than also white friends, which undermines their performance in school, though a high level of education of their parents reduces this negative influence (Patacchini and Zenou 2006). Ethnic identity directly determines individual scholastic performance; in this respect, Nekby et al. (2009) demonstrate that men with an integrated identity who are attached both to their home background and to the majority culture have a higher probability of completing tertiary education. Drawing on the literature that considers the influence of ethnic identity on schooling, the contribution of this paper is characterized by three main aspects. First, though the starting point is Akerlof and Kranton’s (2002) model of educational choice, in the theoretical model presented here which follows Autiero (2015), ethnic identity directly determines achievement motivations, which is in line with part of the psychology literature. Second, it is analysed how the interplay between the adaptation to host societies and the influence of home country cultures determines children’s scholastic effort. Finally, attention is given to the locus of control; thereby, it is possible to examine how the external context through ethnic identity and a specific aspect of individual personal traits captured by the locus of control affect effort in school. Perceived discrimination also plays a significant role by influencing both the adjustment to host societies and the locus of control. Therefore, in the following section, we survey the approaches to ethnic identity in line with the cross-cultural psychology literature in order to understand how ethnic identity may shape children’s approach to schooling in the host country. In Section 3, the analysis goes on by considering how ethnic identity and the locus of control may affect children’s motivation to exert effort in school in more detail. Subsequently, in Section 4, it is proposed a simple theoretical model where it is introduced the interaction among the components of ethnic identity and the locus of control embodying also perceived discrimination. How such interaction may lead to different levels of scholastic effort emerges from the results in Section 5. Finally, conclusions from this analysis are drawn.",2

Over the same time period, the share of foreign-born students in public schools increased by approximately 10% from 5.23 to 5.76% (Murray 2016). In the face of these trends, there are concerns that the influx of foreign-born students may adversely impact the educational outcomes of US-born students as well as inducing them to move to private schools where there are fewer immigrant students. Prior studies have reported that foreign-born students “crowd out” natives from colleges and graduate programs (Hoxby 1998; Borjas 2004), while the presence of students with limited English proficiency presents a barrier to other students’ learning in US schools (Chin et al. 2013; Diette and Uwaifo Oyelere 2014). In this paper, I attempt to extend our understanding of how stricter immigration policy such as the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA) may affect college enrollment and public-private school choice of natives. I begin my analysis by examining how LAWA affected the size of foreign-born student population in Arizona. After the adoption of LAWA in 2007, all employers in Arizona are required to verify if a worker is authorized to work in the USA through the federal E-Verify system. Although foreign-born students are not directly targeted by the legislation, there are a few reasons why LAWA could reduce the population of foreign-born students in Arizona. First, some immigrant students have household members (e.g., parents, siblings, spouses) who are undocumented. These students may leave Arizona as a result of LAWA’s impact on a household member. Second, as the adoption of LAWA may signal an anti-immigrant sentiment in the state, foreign-born students may decide to pursue their education in other states where such sentiment is not as prevalent. Indeed, I find that the share of immigrant students across Arizona’s educational system declined significantly by the passage of LAWA. In the absence of LAWA, the share of foreign-born students in elementary and secondary schools in Arizona would be higher by approximately 1.1 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively. Similarly, the share of foreign-born college students in Arizona would be higher by 1.5 percentage points in the absence of LAWA. These results suggest that LAWA can serve as a natural experiment to examine how a stricter immigration policy could affect college enrollment rates and public-private school choices of natives. After establishing that LAWA has reduced the size of foreign-born student population in Arizona, I proceed to examine whether the implementation of LAWA has affected natives’ enrollment rates in higher education. Unfortunately, theory does not provide a clear prediction on how LAWA would impact the college enrollment rate of natives. As noted above, an influx of foreign-born students may crowd natives out from higher education because academic resources/number of admission slots in universities are relatively fixed in the short run (Hoxby 1998; Borjas 2004). At the same time, low-skilled immigration may induce more natives to pursue higher education by allowing them to avoid direct competition with immigrants in the low-skilled labor market (Jackson 2015; Hunt 2017). Therefore, LAWA is expected to have two competing effects influencing natives’ college enrollment rates. The decline of foreign-born student population in colleges may increase the enrollment rate of natives by increasing academic resources/number of admission slots available to them, while less competition with immigrants in the low-skilled labor market would incentivize natives to enter the labor market instead of pursuing higher education. The analysis shows that there is no evidence that LAWA has statistically significantly affected natives’ college enrollment rates in Arizona. Moreover, there is no evidence that LAWA has improved college enrollment rate of black and Hispanic natives, who have been argued to compete for similar academic resources (e.g., grants for needy students) as foreign-born students (Hoxby 1998). To further investigate how LAWA may affect the educational choice of natives, I examine whether the adoption of LAWA affected the share of US-born students enrolled in private school in Arizona. The tendency of native students to move to private schools in response to the influx of foreign-born students was first documented by Betts and Fairlie (2003), noting “native flight” may reduce the quality and support for public education. Since then, similar evidence was found in Denmark (Gerdes 2013) and in Italy (Farre et al. 2018). Although a positive relationship between immigration and US-born students’ tendency to move into private schools has been found in the literature, the mechanism driving this native flight is not entirely clear; however, there are a few potential explanations. Recent works have documented that an influx of foreign-born students with limited English proficiency adversely affects native students’ performance in math and reading test scores (Chin et al. 2013; Diette and Uwaifo Oyelere 2014). Due to this potential effect, native households may respond to the inflow of foreign-born students by enrolling their children in private school. Similarly, the presence of foreign-born students with limited English proficiency may require public schools to allocate more resources toward them, leaving fewer resources for native students. In response to this, native families may move their children to private schools. Considering that LAWA reduces the share of foreign-born students enrolled in public school, the adoption of LAWA can be expected to lower the share of US-born students enrolled in private schools in Arizona as native households may choose not to send their children to private schools as a result of LAWA implementation. The analysis shows that the proportion of US-born white non-Hispanic student in higher education attending private colleges in Arizona declines by approximately 2.7 percentage points. As there are approximately 19% of US-born white non-Hispanic student in college attending private school before LAWA, this decline corresponds to 14% decrease relative to its pre-LAWA average. These results suggest that a stricter immigration policy aimed at improving natives’ college enrollment rates may not necessarily achieve its objective. In Arizona, the adoption of LAWA did result in the decline of immigrant students across its educational system; however, there is no evidence that this decline improves college enrollment rates among natives. It is worth noting that LAWA did reduce the proportion of US-born white non-Hispanic college student attending private schools, in line with previous studies who find evidence of native flight to private schools in response to an influx of immigrant students (Betts and Fairlie 2003; Gerdes 2013; Farre et al. 2018). The findings in this study contribute to the new emerging literature that examines how educational outcomes of students are affected by immigration policies. A few studies on this topic have focused on the impact of the policy on the immigrant students themselves. For example, a study by Cattaneo MA and Wolter SC (2015) found that a policy change in Switzerland that allows free movement of labor for citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) increased the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores of immigrant students, and most of the improvement can be attributed to the changes in the background characteristics of their parents. More recently, the work by Amuedo-Dorantes and Lopez (2017) found that a higher intensity of interior immigration enforcement in the USA increases the probability of Hispanic youth with likely unauthorized parents repeating grades and dropping out of school. I contribute to this literature by focusing on the educational outcomes of native students; in particular, I examine whether natives’ college enrollment rates and public-private school choice are affected by a stricter immigration policy such as LAWA. This paper is constructed as follows. Section 2 describes the background of LAWA. Section 3 describes the methodology used for the analyses. Section 4 documents the main findings, and Section 5 concludes.",1

For example, the USA’s Limited English Proficient (LEP) migrants made up 8% of the total US population as recently as 2013 (Zong and Batalova 2015). The inability to communicate effectively does not have to constrain; however, institutions and organizations in the destination country can provide language interpretation and translation services, also known as language access, to these migrants. For example, the USA has emphasized the importance of accommodating migrants who are not proficient in English: Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” (Pub. L. 88-352, title VI, Sec. 601, July 2, 1964, 78 Stat. 252). Executive Order 13166, issued in 2000, clarified Title VI’s national origins aspect, stating “each Federal agency shall examine the services it provides and develop and implement a system by which LEP persons can meaningfully access those services consistent with, and without unduly burdening, the fundamental mission of the agency” (Executive Order 13166). In theory, these two laws mean that language access should be provided in many cases. Title VI applies broadly, regardless of whether federal funding is direct or indirect and the amount of funds received. According to Youdelman (2009), “in the health care context, this includes virtually all: hospitals; doctor’s offices; nursing homes; managed care organizations; state Medicaid agencies; home health agencies; health insurance providers; and social services organizations” [p.2], but in reality, Perkins and Youdelman (2008) argue that “[d]espite such federal requirements, lack of knowledge and enforcement leave millions of LEP individuals without meaningful access to health care” [p.4]. To combat the limited knowledge and enforcement of Title VI, all states have passed some degree of language access laws in the health care industry. The amount of language access varies greatly across states, however. Some states have enacted comprehensive Title VI-like laws for state agencies, while some states merely require information pamphlets on a variety of diseases be translated. Provisions also include rules on interpreter certification and facility licensure, access plans, and rights at hearings. To see if language access plays a role in the goal of extending health insurance coverage, I take advantage of the heterogeneity in state-level language access laws to analyze whether language access laws requiring translation services at Medicaid agencies increases Medicaid take-up rates for LEP migrants. Due to the similarities between the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and MedicaidFootnote 1, “Medicaid” from now on means non-Medicare, non-military public health insurance. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to look into the effects of language access on access to government services. This is also the first paper to examine individual outcomes from language access/barriers in health care using public use microdata. My main result is that language access improves Medicaid take-up rates among LEP migrants. What is more, there is no evidence of government crowd-out; private health insurance coverage even increases after the passage of language access laws. The effect of the different state laws varies across states, and the main results could be driven by New York and California. Furthermore, even though many of these translation services primarily target Spanish speakers, the results suggest that the laws are not more helpful to Spanish-speaking migrants.",4

We look at how the migration of one person to another (destination) country impacts the labor supply decisions of his relatives who remain in a source country. While all previous studies looked at the effect of remittances on the labor supply decisions of migrant relatives, in this paper, we examine how the outmigration affects the job satisfaction of non-migrating relatives. Studying the effect of migration on the labor supply is not new. The pioneering work on the effect of migration on labor supply of non-migrant family members is by Rodriguez and Tiongson (2001). They find a negative effect of remittances on the labor supply of the migrants’ family members in urban Philippines: an additional US$40 of remittances per migrant family member decreases male and female labor participation by 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Subsequent papers find further evidence of this negative effect of remittances on the labor supply. For example, Acosta (2006) finds that remittances received from international migrants reduce the likelihood of labor supply by children and women in migrants’ families in El Salvador. Kim (2007) also finds the negative effect of remittances on the labor supply at both the individual and geographical cluster levels in Jamaica. Nguyen and Purnamasari (2011) study the Indonesian data and find that migrant family members work 26 h less per week than members of households without migrants; if the migrant is male, his family members work 33 h less than the members of non-migrant households. Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2006) reported that a 100 Peso remittance increase would reduce male formal sector employment by 32 h per month in both urban and rural areas of Mexico, male self-employment by 11 h per month in urban areas, female nonpaid employment by 6 h per month, and female informal sector employment by 12 h per month. Cabegin (2006) studies migration from the Philippines, finding in families with wife migrants that an annual increase in wives’ earnings by 10,000 Pesos decreases the likelihood of having the full-time paid employment of their husbands by 12% more than men in non-migrant families. The same increase also leads to a rise in the likelihood of husbands being unemployed by 6%. In families with husband migrants, the same size increase in husbands’ earnings reduces the likelihood of full employment by their wives by 4% relatively to those in non-migrant households. Why do remittances negatively affect individual labor supply decisions? Since remittances received from the migrant might have the same effect as that of the non-wage income in the individual (or family) utility maximization problem, there are two possible outcomes. Firstly, remittances could result in an interior solution in the labor supply problem, where the marginal rate of substitution between the consumption and leisure is equal to the real wage rate. Under this condition, if leisure is a normal good, then the increase in non-wage income reduces hours of work of migrant family members. Secondly, remittances might result in a corner solution to the labor supply problem when the marginal rate of substitution of consumption and leisure is greater than the wage rate. Since non-wage income raises individual budget constraints, it also increases individual reservation wages. Once individual reservation wages are increased to such level that they are higher than market wages, migrant family members would choose not to work (for detailed discussion of the effect of the non-wage income on the labor supply, see Killingsworth (1983)). However, as Rodriguez and Tiongson (2001) stated, it is not entirely clear “whether migrants’ remittances have a similar effect on labor supply as other nonlabor income” (p. 721). Due to the complexity of migration process, there are different attributes that along with remittances influence labor supply decisions of migrant family members. Several authors discuss these indirect effects of remittances and migration. Acosta (2006) mentions that the absence of the migrant along with the inflow of remittances might create positive externalities for neighbors of migrant families by relaxing the financial constraints they face as the migrant’s family hires neighbors to do some work in their household to compensate migrant’s absence. Kim (2007) hypothesizes that remittances are hurting Jamaica’s competitiveness in international market by increasing domestic wages. Nguyen and Purnamasari (2011) argued that remittances might affect labor supply of migrant family members differently depending on both migrant’s gender and his or her influence on household decisions. Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2006) stated that remittances help men to forego benefits of formal jobs and choose to do informal work. The absence of the husband because of migration would induce women with school-age children in remittance-receiving families to leave the full-time employment (Cabegin 2006). We look at another dimension in studying the effect of migration on the labor supply of migrants’ family members in the source country—their job satisfaction. Migrant’s family members might consider remittances as their lost earning opportunities from not joining their migrant relatives in working abroad. A non-migrating member of a migrant’s family would compare her own current earnings from working in the source country to what she might earn from migration basing on observed remittances from her migrant relatives. Additionally, a current or returning migrant provides information on existing labor market opportunities in the destination country. Using this information, a non-migrating member would create her own expectation on earnings from migration like if she joined the migrant, and compare them to her current wage. Then, the larger the difference between that what she receives now and her expected earnings from migration is, more dissatisfied from her current job she would be. Individual expectations on earnings from migration might be affected by costs of migration, which are uncertain. Members of migrant families, however, have advantages in reducing such costs basing on their migration experience. First of all, the cost of acquiring information on earnings possibilities in the destination country and on the job search would be lower for migrants’ relatives because they learn this information from the migrants’ experience. Migration costs are also lowered once the non-migrating members receive help from their migrant relatives in searching for jobs, housing, and fulfilling all working and staying formalities in the destination country when they decide to migrate. Therefore, since the family is involved in migration, its members know how to reduce migration-related costs, which allow them to get earnings almost close to their expected values. A similar process is observed in our chosen country case, Tajikistan, with respect to its main migration destination country, Russia. Wages in these countries during Soviet period, when the common market existed, were closer to each other. Schroeder (1981) noted that there were no big differences in average wages of state employees among the Soviet Republics in 1960–1978. Wages in these two former Soviet countries started moving away from each other in early 1980s and accelerated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Current developments in restricting the free movement of people such as the introduction of migrant quotas, and then work patents, also contributed to speeding up the wage divergence between these countries. Figure 1 shows the scale of the accelerating divergence of Tajik real wages from Russian real wages after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The gap between the average real wages in Russia and Tajikistan increased from 3335 Rubles in 2002 to 18,600 Rubles by August 2010. In August 2010, the average real wages in Russian Federation were about 8.5 times higher than those in Tajikistan (Statistical Committee of CIS 2011; State Statistical Agency of Tajikistan 2011; Russian State Statistical Committee 2010). Such differences in wages resulted in increasing seasonal labor migration from Tajikistan to Russia, which might be positively related with increasing job quits in Tajikistan. Comparison of real wages between Russia and Tajikistan, Rubles. Data sources: (1) Data on wages and consumer price index in Tajikistan are from the website of the State Statistical Agency of Tajikistan (State Statistical Agency of Tajikistan 2011). (2) Data on wages and consumer price index in Russia are from Russian State Statistical Committee Monthly Reports on Social and Economic Conditions of Russian Federation (Russian State Statistical Committee 2010). (3) Exchange rates used in converting Tajikistan’s wages to Russian Rubbles are from the website of the National Bank of Tajikistan (National Bank of Tajikistan 2011) Our discussion is consistent with the job satisfaction literature, which defines job satisfaction as an increasing function of the deviation of current workers’ wages from the expected wages which they might receive from another employer or occupation. Introduced into the economics literature by Hamermesh (1977), in his economic model, workers compare their wages in their current occupations with those from other job alternatives. If workers’ current wages are higher than those from alternative jobs, they would be more satisfied with current jobs, and vice versa. His equilibrium condition at the time when an individual starts his work at the new occupation implies that there is no differential job satisfaction. Once the working experience with the current employer increases, the worker becomes more certain about her earning abilities that increase her job satisfaction. He finds a positive relationship between job satisfaction and the deviation of actual wages from the expected wages which are derived using information on the mean of the country’s wage distribution conditioned on worker’s individual characteristics such as experience, age, education, and gender. Hamermesh’s findings have been confirmed across consequent studies. Clark and Oswald (1996) used two distinct variables in their regression analysis, logarithms of current and expected earnings, instead of a single variable of wage residuals. They found that while the coefficient on the logarithm of current earnings is positive, the coefficient on the logarithm of expected income from other job alternatives is negative and statistically significantly different from zero. Comparison with alternative specifications allowed them to conclude that individual well-being does not depend on absolute income, but on the income comparison, i.e., on the relationship between what a person gets now and what she probably could get if she changed her job. In his following paper, Hamermesh (2001) finds that current shocks which widen earnings inequality also increase the current job satisfaction of those who are at the top of earning distribution. Diaz-Serrano and Vieira (2005) by analyzing European data found that the low-paid workers are less satisfied with their jobs compared to higher paid workers, except the British as they receive larger compensating non-pecuniary benefits. Card et al. (2010) using a randomized manipulation of access to information among employees of the University of California find that granting access to earnings information of other employees increases job dissatisfaction among workers with wages less than the median in their pay unit and the same occupations. Another group of studies have found a significant negative relationship of job satisfaction with job quits. Freeman (1978) in studying the US panel data finds a negative relationship between job quit and job satisfaction: people who are satisfied with their jobs remain with their current employers. Clark et al. (1998) using ten waves of panel data find the same negative relationship between job satisfaction and job quit. Union membership does not affect workers’ job satisfaction and decisions: members who are dissatisfied from their jobs are likely to quit as non-members (Clark 2001). Kristensen and Westergaard-Nielsen (2006) found that satisfaction with type of work has more significant impact on choice to quit relatively to other components of job satisfaction. Bockerman and Ilmakunnas (2009) noted that the job dissatisfaction firstly induces job search which in its turn leads to actual job switches. Jobs satisfaction is also correlated with the subjective well-being (Tait et al. 1989). This relationship is reciprocal and bidirectional, where job and life experiences of the worker affect each other (Judge and Watanabe 1993). The relationship is positive implying that the satisfied worker from his job is feeling being satisfied from other aspects of his life (Rice et al. 1980; Mishra et al. 2014). The relationship of the subjective well-being to job satisfaction is stronger than the causal relationship from job satisfaction to the subjective well-being (Judge and Watanabe 1993; Bowling et al. 2010). In the next section, we discuss a simple model specification of job satisfaction and incorporate migration into this model. In the third section, we explain the semiparametric ordered response model and discuss how we control for the endogeneity of migration-related variables. The fourth section provides definitions and explanations of the data used in this paper. We used the data from 2007 Living Standard Survey on Tajikistan (State Statistical Agency of Tajikistan 2007), a small Central Asian, former Soviet and transitional country which is highly dependent on migration and remittances. Differences in wages in Tajikistan and its migration destination country, Russia, along with increasing migration, make it a good country case for our study. This section also discusses estimation results of migration on the job satisfaction in Tajikistan. The final, fifth, section concludes.",1

Given that many immigrants experience a decline in occupational status when immigrating, studies such as Green (1999), Chiswick et al. (2005), and Abramitzky et al. (2014) have highlighted the importance for immigrants of (upward) occupational mobility.Footnote 1 In Canada, the first years following immigration have been shown to be particularly important for immigrants in moving to jobs in their preferred occupations (Grenier and Xue 2011). In this study, we note that occupational mobility requires job mobility and investigate native-immigrant differences in job mobility early in the career through moves to new employers and within firms via promotions. We then assess the extent to which differences in within- and between-firm mobility contribute to differences in wage growth and occupational mobility between early-career immigrants and natives. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study of native-immigrant differences in both within- and between-firm mobility.Footnote 2 Furthermore, while an extensive literature documents gender and race differences in promotion outcomes, we provide the first evidence of native-immigrant differences in the rates of and wage returns to promotions. Our focus on the within- and between-firm mobility of early-career immigrants is further motivated by three important facts from the labor literature. First, there is evidence that immigrants in Canada may encounter search frictions that limit their between-firm mobility. Aydemir and Skuterud (2008) find that the native-immigrant pay gap in Canada can be largely explained by differences in employers as natives tend to be employed in higher wage firms. This suggests that immigrants may face barriers to mobility keeping them in jobs with low-paying firms.Footnote 3 Along these lines, Oreopoulos (2011) in a resume field experiment finds that the resumes of skilled immigrants in Canada were less likely to elicit contacts from potential employers than resumes from similar natives, while Bowlus et al. (2016) provide evidence of frictions faced by immigrants to Canada in a structural model of job search. Second, search and matching models imply that all workers (natives and immigrants) benefit on average from early-career moves as they find better matches to their skills (Burdett 1978; Jovanovic 1979)—which is likely even more true for immigrants looking to upgrade their occupations to match their skills. Topel and Ward (1992) found that the average man in the USA has seven jobs in the first 10 years in the labor market and that these movements between jobs account for at least a third of early-career wage growth.Footnote 4 Thus, differences in mobility early in the career may translate into significant differences in earnings over time. Finally, our interest in within-firm mobility via promotions follows from the observation that workers need not change employers to find better job matches, and an important avenue for changing jobs with an employer is through promotions—which also tend to be concentrated early in the career (Javdani and McGee 2017). Furthermore, promotions are important drivers of wage growth. Among many others, Pergamit and Veum (1999), Cobb-Clark (2001), Francesconi (2001), Blau and DeVaro (2007), and Kosteas (2009) find that promotions are associated with, on average, 5 to 12% increases in wage growth, while McCue (1996) finds that promotions account for 9% of total wage growth in the first 10 years of the career for white men. As a consequence, the failure of immigrants to keep pace with natives in climbing the corporate ladder via promotions early in the career may contribute to native-immigrant wage gaps. Using a sample of male workers in Canada from 1999 to 2004 from the Workplace and Employee Survey (WES), we estimate the probabilities that natives and immigrants make different transitions over the course of a year between interviews. From one interview to the next, workers enter unemployment, remain with their initial employers without being promoted, remain with their initial employers having been promoted, or move to new employers. We find that visible minority immigrants are 15 percentage points less likely to have been promoted with their current employers but are just as likely to have moved to new employers as white natives. White immigrants, on the other hand, were just as likely to have been promoted with their initial employers as white natives but were as much as 12 percentage points more likely than white natives to move to new employers—suggesting that white immigrants are more mobile than both white natives and visible minority immigrants. We then examine whether the greater between-firm mobility of white immigrants and lower within-firm mobility of visible minority immigrants translate into differences in wage growth relative to white natives. We note, however, that our analysis of the contributions of mobility to wage growth gaps is necessarily speculative given that the gaps themselves are not precisely estimated. In our sample, the wages of white (visible minority) immigrants grow by 9.5 (6.6) percent on average between interviews compared to 8.3% among white natives. Mobility is clearly related to wage growth in our sample as moves to new employers and promotions are associated with wage growth between interviews of 15 and 2.5%, respectively. Using Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions of the native-immigrant wage growth gaps, we find that—while imprecisely estimated—differences between white immigrants and natives in the rates of moves to new employers and promotions can account for a difference in wage growth equal to the whole wage growth gap—driven by white immigrants’ higher likelihood of moving to new employers. By contrast, visible minority immigrants’ slightly higher inter-firm mobility and the large wage gains to employer changes offset the negative effect on wage growth of their lower promotion rates, which renders the total contribution of mobility to the wage growth gap between white natives and visible minority immigrants close to zero. Finally, we examine the relationship between within- and between-firm mobility and occupational mobility early in the career in light of evidence that immigrants to Canada experience occupational “downgrading” upon arrival.Footnote 5 Here too, the importance of between-firm mobility for white immigrants is evident. Some 91% of white immigrants changing employers switch occupations compared to only 71% of white natives and 81% of visible minority immigrants. As a consequence of their greater likelihood of changing employers and changing occupations conditional on changing employers, 26% of white immigrants in our sample change occupations between interviews compared to only 16% of white natives and 19% of visible minority immigrants. Both moves to new employers and promotions are important channels for changing occupations early in the career in our sample, and white immigrants are particularly good at using the former channel to change—and likely upgrade—occupations. While Aydemir and Skuterud (2008), Oreopoulos (2011), and Bowlus et al. (2016) provide evidence consistent with visible minority immigrants in Canada encountering job search frictions not encountered by white Canadian-born workers, our primary contribution is to provide direct evidence of actual differences between natives and immigrants in mobility. These differences are surprising because the Canadian immigration system imposed few mobility constraints. Newly arrived permanent residents were not for the most part tied to employers or regions. Likewise, immigrants in Canada on “open work permits” could change employers without restriction, while immigrants on employer-specific work permits needed only apply for a new work permit to change employers. Moreover, work permits could be renewed indefinitely as long as the worker remained employed. Our second contribution is to note the marked differences among immigrants in mobility patterns and the potential importance of these differences to the diverging fortunes of different groups of immigrants. Specifically, ours is the first study to highlight the role of between-firm mobility in the relative economic success of white immigrants to Canada. This is particularly important for interpreting the existing evidence on mobility among immigrants to Canada. Notably, Skuterud and Su (2012) provide evidence that immigrants to Canada were less likely than natives to transition into high-wage jobs (and more likely to transition out of these jobs), but equally likely to transition into low-wage jobs. Our findings suggest that these patterns may be driven by visible minority (and not white) immigrants. In terms of interpreting these mobility patterns, we note that the fact that visible minority immigrants were just as likely to move to new employers as white natives should not be taken as evidence against the existence of search frictions. If visible minority immigrants are not promoted at rates commensurate with their skills, presumably they should be pursuing outside options more than white natives. Likewise, immigrants may have stronger incentives to move to new employers in order to upgrade occupations than natives. Both possibilities suggest that visible minority immigrants should be moving to new employers with greater frequency than white natives as we observe among white immigrants. Indeed, Oreopoulos’ findings imply that even if visible minority immigrants were sending out resumes at a rate similar to white immigrants, they would generate fewer contacts with employers and thus lead to a lower rate of transitioning to new employers. We consider three potential explanations for the mobility patterns that we observe: unobserved productivity differences, taste-based discrimination on the part of employers, and information asymmetries and other search frictions. Visible minority immigrants may be less likely to be promoted if they are less productive than natives in ways unobserved by the econometrician. For instance, immigrants may have language difficulties that limit their prospects for promotion. Splitting our sample by age-at-immigration, however, we find that immigrants who arrived in Canada as children actually fare the worse where promotions are concerned. Alternatively, unobserved differences among visible minority immigrants in our sample may have resulted from changes in Canadian immigration policy in the early 1990s that prioritized admitting skilled immigrants as opposed to immigrants with family ties. While we find that visible minority immigrants who arrived before the shift to an immigration policy focusing on admitting skilled immigrants (most of whom arrived as children) fare worse in terms of promotion probabilities than those who arrived after this policy change, the difference in promotion probabilities is not statistically significant. The lower promotion rates among visible minority immigrants could also arise if employers prefer to promote white workers (natives and immigrants) rather than visible minorities. If this were the case, however, then high-ability visible minority immigrants ought to be more likely to move to new employers as competition gives firms incentives to hire away talented visible minorities experiencing discrimination in promotion outcomes. As a consequence, visible minority immigrants ought, on average, to be more likely to change employers than white immigrants and natives. In our sample, however, visible minority immigrants move to new employers at a similar rate as white natives. Nevertheless, the struggles of visible minority natives observed in our sample in terms of wage growth suggest that taste-based discrimination may play a role in the outcomes of visible minorities regardless of whether they are immigrants. Of course, taste-based discrimination could persist without visible minority immigrants being more likely to change employers if search frictions exist that prevent visible minority immigrants from moving to new employers. For instance, visible minorities may lack networks for job search or be less familiar with how job search works in Canada. Alternatively, potential employers may have less information about visible minority immigrants. In the “invisibility hypothesis” of Milgrom and Oster (1987), this information asymmetry between current and prospective employers gives employers incentives to “hide” employees about whom the market has less information by denying them promotions that are assumed to convey positive information about the worker to other employers. We find some evidence consistent with such information asymmetries. Specifically, we find that visible minority immigrants about whom the market likely has more information—those with a bachelor’s degree or higher—enjoy similar mobility between- and within-firms and wage returns to this mobility as white natives. Ultimately, however, establishing whether information asymmetries or other search frictions lead to the mobility differences between visible minority immigrants and white immigrants and natives requires further investigation, an issue we discuss in the conclusion. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data as well as the implications of our sample selection criteria. Section 3 discusses the Canadian immigration policies that affected immigrants in our sample and their implications for mobility. Section 4 presents our main findings. Section 5 concludes and poses the questions for future research.",2

C. Seah,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines whether immigration shocks have a causal effect on native fertility patterns. While there has been a plethora of previous research examining the effects of immigration on the labour market outcomes of destination countries, relatively few studies exist with a focus on exploring how immigration affects the host society in other ways. An area which research has hitherto neglected is the relationship between immigration shocks and native fertility behaviour. Yet, a synthesis of the research conclusions from studies exploring the effects of immigration on local destination markets with those investigating how fertility outcomes respond to economic conditions reveals that it is possible for native fertility outcomes to be altered by such inflows. Immigration shocks may influence the childbearing decisions of natives through at least four channels: Firstly, among labour market participants, if natives view immigrants as competitors competing for scarce employment opportunities in the labour market, then an immigration influx may lead to increased perceptions of job insecurity among these workers. Presupposing that childbearing decisions depend positively on employment and income security (Sobotka et al. 2011), an increase in perceived job and income insecurity may act to reduce fertility (either contemporaneous/tempo or completed fertility, or both) by inducing individuals to delay their childbearing plans or to forgo having a child altogether.Footnote 1 Secondly, an immigration shock may lead, at least in the short run, to an increase in housing prices and rents. To the extent that housing is a precondition for childbearing, an increase in housing rents/prices lowers a household’s real income and exerts a negative income/substitution effect on the demand for children (Yi and Zhang 2010).Footnote 2 By increasing the cost of raising a child, an increase in the price of living space can also impact fertility by increasing the likelihood that individuals postpone childbearing (Ranjan 1999). Thirdly, if incoming immigrants are composed of workers who are very substitutable to native women, and if the earnings of this group of natives are depressed as a result (Blau and Mackie 2017), then this could reduce the opportunity cost of childrearing and consequently increase the incentive to have children. Lastly, immigration can affect native fertility through local price changes. Prior studies that investigate the effects of immigration on prices (Cortes 2008) find that an increase in the share of low-skilled immigrants in a city’s labour force leads to a reduction in the local prices of immigrant-labour-intensive services such as housekeeping and babysitting. Insofar as low-skilled immigration reduces the cost of childbearing and the conflict that native women have over childbearing and work, an increase in low-skilled immigration may work to increase native fertility (Furtado and Hock 2010; Furtado 2016). There are two main research questions which this paper seeks to address: Firstly, do immigration shocks affect native childbearing decisions? Secondly, do childbearing responses to an immigration shock vary by homeownership status? The second question arises because, by changing the price of living space, immigration could potentially change the cost of childbearing differently for homeowners and non-homeowners. This study uses a “natural experiment”, exploiting the 1980 Mariel Boatlift where some 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami over a 5-month period (May to September 1980) in order to generate an exogenous variation in immigration flow so that the fertility consequences of Miami women in the aftermath of the shock can be studied. The fertility impact of the immigration shock is measured in two ways. First, I apply the synthetic control estimator, using aggregate-level data, and assess the significance of the estimates using placebo tests. Second, I apply the traditional difference-in-differences estimator with inference techniques based on individual-level data. Both lead to the same conclusion: The immigration shock led to short-term declines in native childbearing activity in 1983 and in 1986, although these declines were compensated by fertility increases in later years. The short-term declines in native childbearing activity after the immigration influx were possibly due to individuals delaying their childbearing plans.",2

This kind of data allows for the examination of flows between different labor market states rather than simply assessing labor market stocks over time, which is what is usually possible with cross-sectional data. Data about the same individuals over time can either be in the form of panel data, where individuals are visited and interviewed multiple times over the course of several months or years, or retrospective data, where individuals are asked about their past labor market trajectories at one point in time. Although both methods of data collection suffer from different kinds of measurement errors, panel data are often deemed superior because they minimize recall error, which could be substantial in retrospective data (Mathiowetz and Duncan 1988; Magnac and Visser 1999; Artola and Bell 2001; Bound et al. 2001; Pina-Sánchez et al. 2014). Panel data, however, are expensive and difficult to collect and are, therefore, rarely available to researchers in developing countries. If available, they are generally not collected frequently enough to observe complete labor market trajectories and transitions (Blossfeld et al. 2007) and suffer from sample attrition and a variety of measurement errors (Artola and Bell 2001; Feng and Hu 2013). It is therefore useful to examine how well retrospective data perform in assessing labor market dynamics and the extent to which analyses that depend on them conform to results obtained from panel data. Due to potential problems with both retrospective and panel data, it is worthwhile to compare results on basic indicators related to labor market dynamics from retrospective and panel data on the same sample of individuals, in order to determine the conditions under which they provide similar or substantially different results. This paper takes advantage of a unique opportunity to undertake such a comparison, where both panel and retrospective data are available for the same individuals in the 1998, 2006, and 2012 Egypt Labor Market Panel Surveys (ELMPSs). Not only do the reference periods of the retrospective data overlap with the dates of the previous waves of the survey, but also the retrospective periods from different waves of the survey overlap with each other as well. This allows for comparisons of retrospective and panel data at the same point in time, as well as comparisons of recalled events from one wave with the same events recalled in another wave. In this paper, we (i) assess the consistency of reporting of time-invariant characteristics in different waves of the panel, (ii) compare the retrospective and panel data results on reported past labor market statuses and transitions, (iii) assess the consistency of estimates of labor market transition rates across two specific dates by comparing panel and retrospective data, (iv) assess the consistency of estimates of the level and trends of annual labor market transition rates across retrospective data from two different waves of the survey, and (v) assess whether retrospective data can provide accurate trends of labor market aggregates, such as employment-to-population ratios and unemployment rates. For a number of the comparisons, we estimate multivariate models of the determinants of alignment of the different characteristics, states, or labor market dynamics between the two data sources, i.e., retrospective and panel data. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the theory and past evidence on measurement error in contemporaneous and recalled data. Section 3 includes a discussion of our data source and methods of analysis. Section 4 lays out all the findings on the various comparisons we make and Section 5 concludes with recommendations as to what kinds of information can be reliably collected using retrospective questions, how to improve retrospective data collection strategies to obtain more reliable information, and potential methods for correcting measurement errors.",11

One reason is demography. This is the youngest region in the world, with a large youth bulge that will continue to expand rapidly in the future. The median age is 18 now and will climb to just 24 by 2050. The UN estimates that the size of the 15–24-year-old age group will increase by about six million annually over the next decade. This youthful profile offers the potential for a “demographic dividend”, such as the one that benefited East Asia in the late twentieth century (Bloom and Williamson 1998). But this is not the most likely scenario partly because fertility rates are not falling rapidly enough to decrease the region’s dependency rate, which is a key to capturing a demographic dividend. At the same time, young people in sub-Saharan Africa face difficult employment prospects. The majority work in low-productivity jobs, most often in agriculture or in self-employment or household enterprises. They have low earnings, little security, and limited possibilities for upward mobility. A substantial modern wage sector currently exists only in the region’s few upper middle-income countries. Educated young people, particularly in these countries, may have better jobs when they do get them but open unemployment for this group is a serious concern. Some forecasts predict that wage employment will increase significantly in the coming years with expanding manufacturing and service industries (e.g., McKinsey Global Institute 2012). However, it is overly optimistic to expect major changes in the region’s job structure over the next decade, with most young people continuing to work in agriculture and household enterprises (Fox et al. 2013). What actions are being taken to improve employment and livelihoods for young Africans? Our review finds that the dominant intervention has been skills development programs oriented towards wage employment. This focus does respond to the human capital shortcomings in the region where, despite recent improvements in education, the majority of young people still do not go beyond primary school. However, there are concerns about the quality and the relevance of these programs, especially given the region’s employment structure. Nonetheless, upgrading the skills of young people is important both to increase productivity and living standards in agriculture and the household enterprise sector as well as to build a future workforce for the wage sector. However, to address youth employment, more attention needs to be given to interventions that fall outside the conventional limits of training and other labor market programs. Many young Africans seeking better jobs and livelihoods are constrained by factors that are not typically considered in these programs. These include, for example, a lack of access to credit, land, or productivity-enhancing infrastructure, or by political or social instability, which deter investment and entrepreneurship. In our review, then, we have also included a broader set of interventions relevant for young people seeking their livelihood in self-employment or in agriculture. Programs in these areas are not common nor have they been designed to address the particular needs of young people. Evidence-based research can play an important role in identifying the barriers young people in SSA face in finding employment and assessing the likely effectiveness of potential policy actions. While there have been some comprehensive regional studies (e.g., Filmer and Fox, 2014; African Development Bank (AfDB) et al., 2012), more detailed, country-level analysis is lacking, in part because of data shortcomings. There are also gaps in knowledge of existing programs, especially those sponsored and undertaken by the private sector, foundations, and NGOs. Much more program evaluation is needed to identify what works in different contexts in the region. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 examines demographic trends in sub-Saharan Africa and then profiles youth employment in the region. In Section 3, we review the evidence on interventions to support better jobs for young people. Conclusions are presented in Section 4.",9

An individual is typically asked to indicate whether her health status is excellent, good, fair, or poor. Now, any variation in reported health status can come from the following possible sources: variation related to differences in true (latent) health and/or variation in reporting which is driven by the respondent’s personal characteristics. If health perceptions are systematically correlated with socioeconomic characteristics such as income and exposure to health care systems, self-assessed health status can be misleading. One of the ways to examine systematic measurement error in self-reported health is to formalize the problem of heterogeneous reporting behavior and to formulate tests for its occurrence in the context of subjective health information. In order to correct for systematic differences in reporting heterogeneity across population subgroups, a proposed solution is to anchor an individual’s self-assessed response on her rating of a vignette description of a hypothetical situation that is fixed for all respondents (King et al. 2004; Bago d'Uva et al. 2011). The idea is based on the underlying assumption that any variation in rating of a vignette (depicting a fixed level of latent health) would identify systematic reporting bias, which can then be adjusted in the individual’s subjective assessment of her own situation. The validity of this approach however relies on two important assumptions, viz. “vignette equivalence” which requires that all individuals perceive the vignette description as corresponding to a given state of the same underlying construct and “response consistency” which implies that individuals use the same response categories for their subjective assessment as they have used for evaluating the hypothetical scenarios presented to them in vignettes. This assumption will not hold if there are strategic influences on reporting of the individual’s own situation that are absent from evaluation of the vignette (Bago d'Uva et al. 2011). This study is one of the first to test the assumption of response consistency in a developing country setting where measurement error in survey data may be more of a problem. The paper first presents a framework to formally test the existence of systematic measurement error across sociodemographic subgroups. We examine systematic reporting heterogeneity using two ways: first using responses from vignette ratings across different health domains and second using a method that combines data on objective and self-reported health indicators. In this process, we implicitly test the validity of the “response consistency” assumption. The paper adds on to the existing body of literature by explicitly checking the validity of this assumption in a developing country setting. Further, using repeated ratings from the same individual over multiple vignettes, we can control for idiosyncratic heterogeneities in the individual fixed-effects estimation. We precisely examine whether the pattern of reporting behavior matches with that obtained from our first exercise and to what extent it can be explained by socioeconomic characteristics that are usually accounted in a regression framework. The study finds strong presence of systematic reporting heterogeneity in self-assessed health across subgroups and validates the assumption of response consistency. The result is confirmed in our robustness check where we even control for individual fixed effects. Further, it finds that the reporting heterogeneity in SAH can only be partially explained by observable characteristics of individuals and a large part of it remains unexplained. Thus, the study has important implications for research that solely rely on subjective health data.",6

Bucheli,Alok K. Bohara,Matías Fontenla,Male,Male,Male,Male,"International remittances continue to be a major source of income in developing countries. In Ecuador, remittances as a share of GDP neared 7% for 2005–2007, roughly matching the revenue from oil, the country’s number one export. These large financial inflows have the potential to benefit poorer households by increasing income, educational attainment, and promoting health.Footnote 1 However, as Amuedo-Dorantes (2014) has noted, the effects of remittances may be heavily determined by the idiosyncrasies of each country. To address potential heterogeneity in our findings, we first develop a theoretical model that accounts for some of these differences and then test it by partitioning our data into population sub-groups. The effects of remittances on children’s schooling are of particular interest, as human capital accumulation may break the intergenerational transmission of poverty through higher future income, especially in the case of Ecuador where large labor returns to schooling have been found (Bertoli et al. 2011). The majority of the evidence in the literature supports the existence of potentially opposing effects of migration and remittances on education (Amuedo-Dorantes et al. 2010; Bargain and Boutin 2015; Hu 2012; Koska et al. 2013). Some studies find evidence for a higher likelihood of schooling in the presence of migration (Shrestha 2017; Theoharides: Manila to Malaysia, Quezon to Qatar: international migration and its effects on origin-country human capital, forthcoming) and remittances (Alcaraz et al. 2012; Calero et al. 2009; Göbel 2013). They argue that the positive effects may be driven by the additional income, wage premiums for migrants, contribution to household capital accumulation, and higher propensities of migrant families to invest in education. Bouoiyour and Miftah (2016) conclude that with remittances, children in Morocco are less likely to drop out of school and delay their entry into the labor market and that these improvements are especially notorious among girls. With higher income from remittances, Coon (2016) finds that Bolivian children work fewer hours, potentially leading to improvements in human capital. Even in terms of quality, Salas (2014) finds that remittances increase the likelihood of investing in sending children to private schools. On the other hand, while some find that migration might raise parental academic aspirations for their children (Böhme 2015), others find detrimental effects of migration on education (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2010; Bouoiyour and Miftah 2015; McKenzie and Rapoport 2011). These studies argue that the negative effect could be driven by children having to compensate for the missing parent, by joining the labor force, or by taking over domestic responsibilities. This argument is also supported by Cortes (2015), who finds robust evidence that the mothers’ migration, in contrast to fathers’, has a negative effect on the educational outcomes of Filipino children. In terms of the effect of remittances, research continues to find instances in which remittances have no significant effect on schooling (Bargain and Boutin 2015; Nepal 2016; Pilarova and Kandakov 2017), or even where they might hinder child schooling, as households discount the value of education needed to thrive abroad (Davis and Brazil 2016). This paper develops a theoretical model where receiving remittances may relax the household financial constraints, but migration may also change the household members’ labor participation and education decisions. Although remittances may increase the likelihood of schooling among children, the effect of migration on schooling may be negative. We empirically test this relationship via a bivariate probit model that accounts for both endogeneity and non-linearity issues. We exploit the size and coverage of the 2010 Ecuadorian Population and Housing Census, which allows us to look at specific groups that may not be well represented in smaller samples. In this way, we add to the work on Ecuador of Calero et al. (2009) and Göbel (2013), who use a sample of households collected in 2005–2006 to find a positive effect of remittances on education in Ecuador. However, due to data limitations acknowledged by the authors, the in-depth exploration of population sub-groups is not possible. In contrast, in this paper, we are able to partition the data into four key dimensions: gender, wealth, rural vs. urban location, and nuclear family migration status. While using the same data and econometric specifications, our findings vary greatly across these subgroups, and it is this variation that seems to explain the heterogeneity of results in the literature. We find both positive and negative effects of remittances on education, depending on the particular group being studied. First, our findings reveal large gender inequalities, as boys benefit from remittances while the effect for girls is generally negative or insignificant. Second, urban children gain more than their rural counterparts, supporting the existence of regional inequalities. Also, while remittances relax households’ budget constraints, the impact on education varies strongly by income level, where school attendance increases the most for poorer children. In contrast, for wealthier households, the effects of remittances on education are either negative or insignificant. This suggests that the positive income effects of remittances may be offset by the negative effects of a missing parent due to migration, more visible in wealthier families where financial constraints may not be binding. We find further support for this by estimating the effects of remittances conditional on migration status. Our results show positive effects on schooling for non-migrant households that receive remittances and no effects for children living in households where at least one parent has migrated.",5

Jacoby,Basab Dasgupta,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Poverty in India has fallen rapidly in recent years (e.g., Dang and Lanjouw 2015). Evidence now suggests that steeply rising wages of unskilled labor have been a major driver of this trend (Balcazar et al. 2016).Footnote 1 Yet, still unclear is why unskilled wage growth has been particularly strong and, more broadly, what economic forces are shaping India’s labor market transformation. In this paper, we investigate changes in the structure of wages in India over the post-reform era, the roughly two-decade period since 1993, using a decomposition methodology pioneered by Katz and Murphy (1992) and Bound and Johnson (1992) to understand the rising college premium in the USA. The Supply-Demand-Institutions (SDI) framework (see Katz and Autor 1999) divides the entire workforce into imperfectly substitutable demographic groups, e.g., by gender, education, and age. Wage changes for a group can then be decomposed into supply shifts (changing group employment shares), demand shifts (changing industrial composition biased for or against a group), and wage-premia shifts (essentially, movements into or out of structurally low-paying jobs). Supply shifts are driven by such factors as changes in access to education and migration, demand shifts by factors such as skill-biased technical change and product market changes (e.g., due to globalization), and wage-premia shifts by factors such as changes in market or legal institutions.Footnote 2 In the case of India, it is important to recognize that rural and urban labor markets are largely distinct or at least are far from being perfectly integrated (e.g., Munshi and Rosenzweig 2016). Thus, one point of departure from conventional SDI is to cut the data along the rural-urban divide, allowing us to investigate changes in wages of the rural unskilled relative to their urban counterparts. A second point of departure is to apply SDI at a disaggregated level, treating each Indian state (or group of states) as having separate urban and rural labor markets. A state-level approach provides the requisite degrees of freedom for econometric analysis (see Juhn and Kim 1999, for a related study of US states). We are thus able to investigate the key state-level drivers of recent relative wage trends; in other words, which types of supply or demand shifts were particularly influential in explaining the changing wage structure in India over the last decade.Footnote 3 There is a modest literature exploring India’s wage structure using data from National Sample Survey (NSS)’s Employment-Unemployment surveys. (Hnatkovska, V., & Lahiri, A: Structural transformation and the rural-urban divide, unpublished) consider rural-urban wage convergence in India from 1983 to 2009 using a model of long-run structural transformation, but they do not decompose supply and demand factors behind the more recent wage trends. While Chamarbagwala (2006), like us, uses a supply-demand decomposition, it considers the impact of trade liberalization over the earlier 1983–1999 period. Finally, both Kijima (2006) and Azam (2010) study wage inequality in urban India during the 1980s and 1990s. What distinguished our work, therefore, is the focus on changes in labor supply and demand in both urban and rural India over the recent and unprecedented period of rapid poverty reduction. The organization of the paper is as follows. We begin in Section 2 by defining our groups and industries and then documenting how real and relative wages in India have changed over the past two decades. In Section 3, we review the SDI framework and apply it to the national level. Next, we turn to the state-level SDI analysis in Sections 4 and 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6.",2

The evidence clearly demonstrates that over the last four decades, immigrants endure substantial wage disadvantages upon arrival which persist over their entire working career (Aydemir and Skuterud 2005; Baker and Benjamin 1994; Bloom et al. 1994; Campolieti et al. 2013; Grant 1999; Hum and Simpson 2004; Picot and Sweetman 2005; Skuterud and Su 2012). These disadvantages are observed in tandem with high levels of education reflecting a culmination of over four decades of a point system targeting highly skilled immigrants. These unsettling observations have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the immigrant selection system and the labor market suitability and recognition of immigrants’ human capital. In fact, the evidence reveals that foreign human capital, most notably foreign work experience, is discounted in the Canadian labor market (Aydemir and Skuterud 2005; Ferrer and Riddell 2008; Schaafsma and Sweetman 2001; Skuterud and Su 2012). This article examines the degree to which education-job mismatches are responsible for the wage and human capital return disparities between Canadian-born and immigrant workers. The analysis employs an alternative self-reported match measure that captures the “qualitative” aspects of matching that are associated with skills acquired through formal education and those required in employment. In contrast, the mainstay of education-job matching research focuses on estimating the effects of “quantitative” matching which compares a worker’s observed level of schooling to the level required in a particular occupationFootnote 1. Using quantitative matching, Sharaf (2013) shows there is a high incidence of over-education among Canadian immigrants and these mismatches are associated with significant wage penalties. In the USA, Chiswick and Miller (2008; 2009a, b) show that two thirds of the lower returns to immigrants’ schooling is due to different payoffs to under- and over-education. A shortcoming of quantitative matching is that it fails to capture whether education-related skills match those required in employment. A worker could have a similar level of schooling as his/her colleagues but may have acquired very different, possibly irrelevant, occupational skills. Alternatively, qualitative matching considers the amount of education-related skills being utilized by an employer. Through formal education, students acquire a bundle of general and specific skills. General skills are transferable across occupations, while specific skills are important only in particular occupations. Students, who acquire credentials in fields such as business administration, acquire relatively more general skills compared to students who acquire certificates in engineering or in the skilled trades. Similarly, the skill needs of employers can vary greatly; while some employers require more general skills such as those hiring a salesperson, others require more occupation-specific skills such as those of an electrician. A close match is where an employee is utilizing many of their education-related skills in employment, whether they are general or specific. Qualitative mismatches can arise due to the extensive heterogeneity in workers and jobs, mentioned above, coupled with imperfect information and labor market frictions (Sattinger 2012). In a perfectly competitive labor market with complete information on the worker’s skills and employer requirements, optimal sorting would immediately occur and no mismatching would persist. In reality, workers and firms need to engage in costly search efforts to learn about optimal jobs and employees, respectively. A close match is desirable as productivity and wages are higher when workers can effectively implement their education-related skills. As a consequence of the time and cost involved in searching, mismatches are an unavoidable characteristic of the labor market. Mismatches can also occur as a result of changes in the incentives behind acquiring formal education, such as changes in government subsidies, as this can change the distribution of the supply of skills. Furthermore, structural and cyclical changes in economic conditions can also affect the distribution of demand for skills by employers. There are reasons to suspect that mismatches could be more prevalent among immigrant, relative to Canadian-born, workers. In response to many new economic challenges, the Liberal government made dramatic changes to immigration policy in 1995 (Green and Green 1999). Their new objective was to select immigrants based on their potential to contribute to the economy in the long run as opposed to the previous short-term tap-on/tap-off (absorptive capacity) approach that regulated the inflow based on specific occupational needs of the labor market. The immediate skill needs of the labor market were not a significant criterion used to evaluate an immigrant’s potential contribution. As such, the point system assessed a candidate’s education solely on their accumulated years of schooling, treating all credential fields equally. As a result, many immigrants could have been admitted with education-related skills not in high demand, further reducing their already limited employment opportunities upon arrivalFootnote 2. A notable exception to this long-term focus was the increased emphasis in the late 1990s on admitting IT professionals and engineers, but the IT bust in 2001 left many of these workers mismatched (Picot and Hou 2009). Similarly, sizable increases in provincial nominees and temporary foreign workers in the early 2000s affected the flow of immigrants in favor of those that have specific occupational skills (Lu and Hou 2017). In recent years, Canada’s selection system has indeed become more favorable to immigrants with skills in high demand by employersFootnote 3. Nonetheless, past immigration policies, to the extent that an economic penalty exists for unmatched workers, may have contributed in part to the poor immigrant outcomes observed in the literature. The quality and relevancy of foreign-acquired education can vary across source country and can further contribute to immigrant mismatches (Friedberg 2000). Sharaf (2013) finds that the quality of foreign education is linked to the incidence of over-education and can explain a significant portion of immigrant-native wage gaps in Canada. Not only is education quality important, but also a portion of education-related skills could be irrelevant to Canadian employers (e.g., legal professions). Despite the in-equivalency of these credentials, immigrants dedicated many years in acquiring them and would have likely got the impression they were desirable as education is heavily weighted in the point system and a key reason for their admittance. Thus, if immigrants find themselves unable to utilize the very skills deemed important enough for admission, they would certainly consider themselves mismatched. In general, the more similar are the educational institutions, economic development, and labor market characteristics between a source and host country, the higher the likelihood that immigrants will find close matches. Nevertheless, even if foreign education is not devalued by the above noted aspects, immigrant mismatches can arise because of imperfect information on the part of employers. Immigrants face an additional burden of proving the merits of foreign-acquired credentials in contrast to Canadian graduates. Moreover, immigrant professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and nurses cannot legally work in their fields unless their credentials are officially assessed and deemed creditable. A myriad of government agencies are available to assist immigrants in this regard, although their effectiveness is uncertainFootnote 4. These services tend to focus their resources on the disproportionate share of immigrants who intend to work in regulated occupationsFootnote 5. Regardless of whether they are officially recognized or not, the decision to hire is ultimately made by employers who must themselves be convinced of its equivalency. Employer discrimination is also an obstacle as highlighted by Oreopoulos (2009) who found considerable discrimination against applicants with ethnic names and that when employers choose among candidates to interview, foreign education and experience is substantially devalued. A close match is thought to be desirable as productivity and wages are higher when workers can effectively implement their education-related skills (Sattinger 2012). The wage of a worker is jointly influenced by the characteristics of their skills and those of their current job. The larger the discrepancy (i.e., the degree of mismatch), the greater is the potential for the worker to increase their wage by finding a match. Furthermore, collaboration among similarly educated colleagues may lead to a more stimulating work environment and lead to peer effects that can further enhance productivity. These notions are corroborated by the substantial wage effects found in Lemieux (2014) and Yuen (2010) for Canada and Robst (2007) for the USA using a similar self-reported measure as in this article. Furthermore, similar to that found in Lemieux (2014), there is no evidence that these matching premiums are an artifact of unobserved ability bias. No study has examined the role of qualitative matching in the context of earnings differentials between native-born and immigrant workers. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The subsequent section discusses the data and estimation sample. The third section explores the validity of using a self-reported job match measure. The fourth section outlines the empirical methodology. Section 5 contains the estimation results and begins by presenting some descriptive statistics on the wage effects, incidence, and transition of job matches. This section also reports results on the importance of mismatches in the context of economic assimilation and whether matching has an effect on the returns to foreign-acquired human capital. The final section concludes with a general discussion.",

These policies can in turn affect innovation development in the country to which those immigrants move. For example, Kerr and Lincoln (2010) find that higher levels of entry by those holding an H-1B visaFootnote 1 increase employment among immigrants in science and engineering as well as patenting by inventors with surnames that appeared to be Indian and Chinese. Although some researchers have tried to investigate the impact of changes of migration policy on the composition of skills among immigrants, most of them focus on the impact of specific policy changes and immigrant groups (Chen 2005; Kato and Sparber 2013). Empirical evidence on the impact of more general liberalization of migration policies is still scarce. One of the biggest changes in migration policy history in Europe is the liberalization of migration through the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement between the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries in 1994. The agreement, which originally involved 17 countries, has grown in importance with the large expansion of the EU. In short, the EEA allows for the free movement of individuals among its member countries. However, little is known about how the European integration process has affected the skill composition of immigrants in the member countries. One earlier study similar as our study is from Huber and Bock-Schappelwein (2014), who find that the EEA has a positive impact on the education level of permanent migrants to Austria. However, it is far from clear that the results in Austria can be generalized to other EEA countries. In particular, we examine the case of Sweden. The similarities between Sweden and Austria are, at first glance, striking. They have a similar population size and proportion of foreign born as well as generous welfare benefits (OECD 2016a, 2016b).Footnote 2 High welfare ambitions in both Austria and Sweden raise rewards to low-skilled workers for migrating to those countries over other countries. However, Austria and Sweden differ, for example, when it comes to the country of origin for immigrants.Footnote 3 The effect of liberalization of migration has a theoretically ambiguous effect in terms of the selection of immigrants at different skill levels. Theory highlights the distribution of skills and rewards to skills in the receiving and sending countries, as well as migration costs that in turn determine the self-selection behavior of migrating individuals under free migration (Borjas 1987; Grogger and Hanson 2011). Our prediction from a theoretical framework based on Grogger and Hanson (2011) is that the average skill level for immigrants to Sweden decrease under free migration. We examine this issue empirically based on a unique database that links inventors to the general population in Sweden (Jung and Ejermo 2014; Zheng and Ejermo 2015). We examine the effect of the full liberalization of migration on the skill composition of new immigrants in Sweden who originated in the EU-15.Footnote 4 We exclude Denmark and Finland from the treatment group, as they have been part of a free-labor mobility agreement among the Nordic countries since 1954. Sweden’s accession to the EEA means that all EU-15 citizens could move to Sweden freely. We use difference-in-differences (DiD) estimations to evaluate the impact of liberalization on the skill composition of immigrants. This method means that the treatment group (i.e., EU-15 citizens) is compared in terms of skill composition (education, probability of becoming an inventor) both against themselves before treatment and relative to the trend in the control groups. The results of our study indicate that the EEA had short-term negative effects on the selection of immigrants from the EU-15 with respect to their education level. This is manifested as both an increased probability that EU-15 immigrants had a low level of education and a decreased probability that they were highly educated. However, it is also clear that those effects are temporary, as estimated lead and lag models show the effect to be statistically significant only in the first years after the application of liberalization. Moreover, with respect to patenting, we see no systematic effects in our main result of interest after controlling for other variables. Our results are consistent with the theoretical assumption that negative selection driven by reduction in migration costs mainly applies to low-skilled immigrants in the studied case. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes Swedish migration history. Section 3 reviews previous studies examining the impact of migration policy selection of migrants. Section 4 discusses the theoretical background. Section 5 presents the database and descriptive statistics. Section 6 describes the methods used. Section 7 reports the results of the empirical analysis. The final section draws conclusion based on the study.",

Determinants of the duration of migration of Mexican immigrants in the United States,December 2018,Carmen E. Carrión-Flores,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The evolution of Mexican migration to the USA is understood to be the result of several forces that encourage migration. The Mexico-US migration system is the largest and oldest migration system in the world (Massey, Durand, and Pren 2016). Understanding this system has gained new urgency in the current political climate. Mexican immigrants are at the center of one of the largest mass migration in modern history. Mexico is the top source of immigrants and newly arrived immigrants into the USA, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data (Pew Research Center 2015). Empirical studies on Mexican migration suggest a dynamic pattern of cross-border migration in which the economic situation in Mexico and the USA, as well as the presence of relatives in the USA, determines the location and length of stay of Mexican migrants (Massey et al. 1987; Hanson and Spilimbergo 1999; Lindstrom 1996). The relation between duration of migration trips and forces that spur migration (i.e., individual characteristics, location choices, and labor market conditions) is important and interdependent. Analyzing the determinants of this dynamic pattern is crucial in understanding Mexico-US migration and the long-term effects of policies to influence it. Prior to 1986, Mexican migration to the USA was characterized by great circularity, with Mexican migrants coming and going in response to economic conditions on both sides of the border (Massey, Durand, and Pren 2016). Between 1986 and 2008, this pattern changed to a more permanent undocumented Mexican population in the USA because of the sanctions imposed by the USA’s immigration and border policies along with the sustained wage differential between Mexico and the USA. Return migration is still considerable in the Mexico-US border. From 2009 to 2014, 1 million Mexicans and their families (including US-born children) left the USA for Mexico, according to data from the 2014 Mexican National Survey of Demographic Dynamics (ENADID). The decline in the flow of Mexican immigrants to the USA is primarily due to the slow recovery of the US economy after the Great Recession (Passel et al. 2012) and the implementation of stricter migration policies. Thus, the Mexico-US migration system seems to be returning to less permanent migration trips. Measuring migration flows between Mexico and the USA is challenging because there are no official counts of how many Mexican immigrants enter and leave the USA each year. Understanding duration allows one to better predict the stock of illegal immigrants at any point of time as a function of policy. Therefore, a clear understanding of the determinants of trip duration is crucial for evaluating the impact of US migration policies. This paper presents a simple theoretical model of a migrant’s trip duration that incorporates social and economic factors in Mexico and the USA. This paper fills a gap in the migration literature by analyzing the factors that increase or decrease the length of stay of Mexican immigrants in the USA, an issue widely ignored in the migration literature. The literature has mainly focused on describing the individual characteristics of migrants and estimating the number of entering migrants into the USA (Bean et al. 1987; Durand and Massey 1992). A notable exception is Angelucci (2012) who looks at the probability of Mexican immigrants staying in the USA given an increase in border enforcement. She estimates a discrete choice model of the decision to migrate to or from the USA. She finds that while increased border enforcement discourages migrants from crossing into the USA, it may discourage the return of migrants already in the USA to Mexico. Thus, if deterrence increases duration sufficiently, it may increase the level of illegal immigration to the USA. This study differs from Angelucci (2012) by estimating the determinants of the individual duration of migration trips and by using individual-level data on border enforcement; therefore, this study analyzes the effect of expected wages and distance traveled on the duration of migration trips that is not feasible when data is at an aggregate level. By analyzing the determinants of the time individuals spend in the USA, I can describe how the duration of migration varies across individuals and in subsequent migrations. I also examine whether demographic characteristics, economic conditions, or social networks drive the duration of Mexican immigrants in the USA. Moreover, two new variables are introduced in the duration analysis. First, the distance in miles between the individual’s origin state in Mexico and the destination state in the USA. This distance accounts for the transportation costs individuals incur when migrating. Secondly, instead of using the average US real wage to account for migration benefits, I use an expected US wage based on the destination state of each migrant that is a function of both the unemployment rate level and the average US real wage of the state. I also examine whether these durations have changed across migration trips and whether the characteristics that drove the duration of the first migration trip are similar for the last migration trip undertaken by the migrant. The data is drawn from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP)Footnote 1 which is a survey conducted jointly by research centers based in Mexico and the USA since 1982. This survey focuses on the migration experience and social characteristics of Mexican migrants who have migrated to the USA, some of whom have never returned to Mexico. I use a cross section of 2375 individuals aged 15–64, who report the duration of their first trip to the USA. A second sample from the same source is also a cross section of 2658 individuals who report the duration of their last trip to the USA. I use the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the impact of characteristics of the individual, household, destination and origin areas, and the effect of US migration policy on the hazard of returning to Mexico during migration trips to the USA. The estimation of the baseline hazard function in this model bypasses parametric assumptions. I use information on Mexican immigrants who have completed their migration trips and have returned to Mexico, as well as those who migrated to the USA and have not yet returned to Mexico at the time of the survey (8% of migrants in the first migration sample never returned to Mexico, and 25% of migrants in the last migration sample never returned to Mexico). Moreover, I am able to establish from the nonparametric baseline hazard estimates, for example, that the migrants who are proficient in English have a lower hazard of return relative to those who do not speak or understand English.Footnote 2 Finally, the model estimates suggest that the hazard of returning to Mexico falls as the probability of being apprehended increases, while a tighter US migration policy increases the hazard of returning to Mexico. Therefore, I estimate an ambiguous effect of migration policy on the duration of migration trips by Mexican immigrants, a result that is consistent with Angelucci (2012). The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review of the determinants of migration. Section 3 presents a simple theoretical migration model that illustrates the relationship between wage differentials and optimal migration duration. Section 4 presents the empirical model. Section 5 discusses the results and policy implications of the empirical findings. Section 6 concludes.",3

In urban Ghana, self-employed women outnumber self-employed men by a ratio of nearly 3:1. However, gender earning gaps are far larger in self-employment than in the wage sector. For the self-employed, men’s earnings are approximately double those of women at the median, and observable worker characteristics do little to explain this gap. For the wage-employed, however, the earnings differential at the median is around 25%. There are several potential reasons why these patterns might arise. Self-employment may be characterised by more gender-based discrimination than the wage sector, driving a larger wedge between the earnings of women and men. For example, women may face additional credit constraints when trying to start or expand their businesses or they may struggle to sell their goods to prejudiced consumers. At the same time, there may be non-pecuniary benefits—such as flexible working hours or independence—which attract women to self-employment in spite of these drawbacks. Additionally, there may be productivity differences between women and men that generate gender earnings gaps across all sectors of the economy, but which cannot be easily observed, especially for the self-employed. The variables typically included in Mincer regressions are likely to carry less explanatory power in self-employment, where entrepreneurial talent, motivation, and other characteristics that are difficult to measure may matter more. In this paper, we offer an alternative explanation, which assumes no discrimination in the self-employment sector and no productivity differences between women and men. Instead, gender earnings gaps in all sectors of the economy are driven solely by discrimination in the wage sector. Our model adopts a search and matching framework in the spirit of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994)—also known as random matching and bargaining—where unemployed individuals can choose to search for jobs in wage-employment, self-employment, or both, depending on their returns in each sector. Workers are heterogeneous along two dimensions. Firstly, their gender determines whether they will face discrimination in trying to obtain wage sector jobs. However, workers also differ in terms of their self-employment productivity. By allowing for search frictions as well as individual heterogeneity, our model captures both segmentation and sorting in the labour market. The search and matching framework provides an apt arena within which to examine discrimination. Firstly, matching frictions afford firms monopsony power, which they may exploit to satisfy any preferences they have for discrimination. In competitive labour market models, discriminatory outcomes—such as gender earnings gaps—typically cannot persist, because prejudiced firms will be disadvantaged compared to unprejudiced firms when trying to recruit workers (Becker 1957). Secondly, matching models allow us to consider the outcomes of the unemployed, which would not be possible if workers could move freely between wage- and self-employment. Finally, we are able to couch discrimination in terms of the matching function itself, by adding extra friction into the process through which women obtain wage sector jobs compared to men. In order to guide our modelling approach and verify our simulation results, we present evidence from a panel dataset collected in urban Ghana between 2004 and 2013. This builds on a large empirical literature on informality in urban Africa (Hart 1973; Kingdon et al. 2006; Falco et al. 2011; Fields 2011). Ghana provides a useful context within which to investigate gender differences in occupational selection since the labour force participation of women is relatively high.Footnote 1 Our model is able to explain differences in average earnings between men and women in both wage- and self-employment—in line with the Ghanaian data—without assuming any differences between the innate ability distributions of each gender. The frictions inherent in the job matching process prevent workers from selecting occupations entirely on the basis of comparative advantage, which reduces average productivity in all sectors. With discrimination, these frictions are more severe for women than for men, pushing women even further away from the jobs in which they have comparative advantage. The results therefore echo Roy’s (1951) classic model of occupational selection. Additionally, our model mirrors the observation that gender earnings gaps are larger for the self-employed than the wage-employed. This is, in part, because the earnings of the self-employed are determined directly by their productivity, whereas wage sector earnings are governed by bargaining between workers and firms. Our model’s predictions about the sectoral composition of the economy also match what is observed in the Ghanaian data. As anticipated, wage sector discrimination drives women away from wage-employment, which in turn increases the number of unemployed and self-employed women. However, it also emerges that there are spillover effects on men, with their participation in wage-employment rising at the expense of self-employment when discrimination is introduced into the model. Discrimination increases men’s chances of successfully matching with a firm, because they are insulated from competition for jobs from women, and because firms create more vacancies to ensure they can still operate. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyse discrimination in a search and matching model that allows for both wage- and self-employment. We build on two key strands of the theoretical literature. Firstly, we complement a growing body of work, which uses search models to assess the impacts that informal sectors or self-employment sectors have on labour market outcomes in developing countries. Our approach draws most directly on the model of Albrecht et al. (2009) and later adapted by Kerr (2012), to allow for self-employment as well as wage-employment in a random matching and bargaining model. Secondly, the paper also draws upon a wide range of existing studies, which use search models to analyse the effects of discrimination on those participating in the labour market. However, unlike previous models, we do not make any additional assumptions about employers’, employees’, or consumers’ preferences, nor do we explicitly examine the conditions under which firms with a ‘taste for discrimination’ survive. Instead, we treat discrimination as an economy-wide stochastic process that affects the matching function. This is sufficient for testing the effects of wage-sector discrimination across different employment sectors and may be a tenable approach if—as appears to be the case in Ghana—discrimination is prevalent across many firms operating in many industries. This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we orientate this paper within the related literature. In Section 3, we describe the key properties of the urban Ghanaian labour market. We outline our model and then explain how we solve for the equilibrium in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. In Section 6, we present our main simulation results. In Section 7, we consider the comparative statics, linking the model to policy. In Section 8, we conclude.",2

An estimated 740 million people live outside their region of birth (Bell and Muhidin 2009). Differences in regional economic performance induce people to leave poorer areas and move to those where more and better opportunities are located. In Ghana, around 35% of people in the population Census of 2010 had moved from their place of birth to another location within the country (Ghana Statistical Service 2013a). Many people move from poorer to richer regions, some move with the whole household and others send a member of the household (Litchfield and Waddington 2003; Molini et al. 2016). Internal migration plays an important role in poverty reduction and economic development at the individual, household and macroeconomic level. On the one hand, it contributes to structural change in the country when rural workers move into non-agricultural work in urban areas (Harris and Todaro 1970). On the other hand, migration of a household member can insure the sending household against income shocks in the origin. Such insurance can prevent households from falling into poverty. Moreover, the income earned by the migrant member can raise consumption levels at home or even pay for investments in profitable technologies (Stark and Bloom 1985). Additionally, geographic mobility offers young people the possibility to advance in their education and gain new skills if their origins do not provide these opportunities. Because of its size and relevance for economic development, economists study internal migration, but data limitations and methodological issues remain a challenge. One focus of research is the question whether and how internal migration affects households at origin. This paper contributes to this strand of the literature. We investigate the impact of having a new migrant on the welfare of origin households conditional on their prior migration experience. The engagement in migration of some village or community members has been shown to significantly reduce migration costs for later migrants from that same network and to improve the probability of successful job search at destination (McKenzie and Rapoport 2007; Munshi 2003). Households themselves can gain migration experience through the engagement of their members in migration, increasing the household’s participation in future migration (Bryan et al. 2014). Therefore, the focus on new migrants is relevant for a setting in which households have several migrant members who move at different points in time. This is revealed by the data available in this paper. We use primary data from a new two-wave household panel survey conducted in Ghana in 2013 and 2015. The surveys were designed with the goal to collect as much information as possible about migration. The impact of migration on household welfare is often drawn from comparisons between households with and without migrants. The econometric challenge this poses is of unobserved heterogeneity. There are unobservable factors that determine both the fact that a household has a migrant and the outcome of interest, for example household income. Any result from a simple comparison of households with and without migrants would be biased. Our analysis uses a baseline of households that all have prior migration experience and data on new migrants in the intervening period in order to reduce selection bias. We apply entropy balancing weights (Hainmueller 2012), similar to matching methods, and exploit the panel nature of our data to overcome remaining selection and omitted variable bias. The outcome variable of interest capturing household welfare is a housing quality index constructed using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). We use housing quality as our measure of welfare as there is strong body of evidence that suggests that remittances are often invested in the improvement of housing (e.g. Kagochi and Kiambigi 2012, Osili 2004, Durand et al. 1996). Because there is little existing evidence on the consequences of idiosyncratic migration experience of households, we first describe migrants and their households in our data to explore the dynamic patterns of migration. A comparison of the new migrants to those migrants who left the household earlier documents that new migrants are from a younger generation within households, such as children or grandchildren of the head. Their migration costs are lower, possibly due to family networks and the households’ prior engagement in migration. From these observations, we derive hypotheses for the impact assessment. Then, we estimate how the welfare of households with a new migrant changes compared to those without, conditional on the fact that all households have previously had a migrant. We analyse whether there are heterogeneous effects by sex of the migrant, by reason for migration (family or work) and by destination (within or across regional borders). We find no effect of sending a new migrant on the change in the housing quality index of origin households compared to those households who do not engage further in migration in the same period. This result is robust to variations in the construction of the index, the matching method applied and community shocks. Our interpretation is that the returns to migration might not show after the short period of our study. Households in our sample use their savings to finance migration. They hence do not experience a drop in their housing quality index. However, they also do not experience an increase in their housing quality index since the new migrant left. This could be, on the one hand, due to their use of savings to cover migration costs instead of investing into more assets and, on the other hand, because new migrants send only rarely and low remittances. We further suggest that due to prior engagement in migration our sample of households does not experience an initial decline in welfare. This could be caused by the migration costs or the loss in labour due to a member leaving (Taylor and Lopez-Feldman, 2010). We document however that migration costs for new migrants are smaller than for prior migration, which indicates that migration experience at the household level reduces the costs of migration. In addition, prior to their move, new migrants are either in school or doing unpaid work. It is thus less likely that their migration implies a loss in labour income for the household. This study builds on earlier work where we employed propensity score matching at baseline to estimate the welfare effect of migration (Egger and Litchfield 2017). In contrast to the matching approach, entropy balancing weights allow us to further control for time-varying characteristics. In addition, we previously adopted factor analysis to construct the housing quality index, while MCA fits the data better. Extending from that previous work, we provide a more comprehensive discussion of the sensitivity of results and explore possible channels of the results in the data. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we discuss the literature on impacts of migration on households left behind with respect to methodological challenges, knowledge gaps and evidence for our context. This is followed by the analytical framework for this study in Section 3. Then, we present the data used for the analysis (Section 4) followed by a description of the migrants, migrant households and their prior migration experience (Section 5). In Section 6, we explain the methodology to estimate the impact of sending a new migrant on the welfare of origin households. In Section 7, we provide the results and robustness checks. Section 8 concludes.",7
