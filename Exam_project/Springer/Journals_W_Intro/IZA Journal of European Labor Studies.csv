The major economies have seen negative GDP growth rates in 2008 and 2009, just to experience positive rates again in 2010 and 2011. In the European setting, not all member states have been affected in the same way. For example, Germany, the UK, and France are now recovering at a reasonable pace –between 1.5 and 3.5 percent GDP growth rates in 2010 and 2011. The Nordic countries, in turn, yet not as severely hit as in the mid-1990s, seem to have learned from their previous experience and have quickly recovered with GDP growth rates of the order of 3.0 to 5.5 percent in the last two years. On the other hand, much of the discussion now taking place focuses on the less fortunate countries which have come to be known as PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain, with Ireland joining the club right after the crisis). The PIGS share a set of similar traits that make for a separate study, to wit: high unemployment rates, persistent fiscal imbalances, weakening financial sectors and credit rationing, severe after-effects of the housing boom, widespread corruption, and frequent strikes. However, a closer look reveals that not all PIGS are the same. For instance, while Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, and more recently Spain, have received financial help from the European Union, Italy has not. Besides, two of these countries –Spain and Ireland– underwent major increases in unemployment, even when compared to the other PIGS. Moreover, the evolution of the unemployment rate in both countries has followed the same pattern in the last decades, although Spain displays much higher rates since the mid-1990s. Our goal, then, is to study the trajectory of the unemployment rate in Spain and Ireland while highlighting the common drivers for the most part of the past decade and a half. We divide our analysis into two periods, before and after the 2007 crisis, which coincide with the major turning points of the unemployment rate in recent years. We estimate a dynamic labour market model for each country and perform a dynamic accounting exercise to examine how much of the unemployment variation in Spain and Ireland is attributable to the explanatory variables. Our results suggest that the two countries seem to have more similarities than differences –despite the clear contrast in the degree of flexibility of their labour markets. We base our empirical analysis on the Chain Reaction Theory (CRT) of unemployment. The use of this approach is justified for two reasons. First, its wider methodological perspective permits us to consider non-stationary variables as drivers of the unemployment rate. Second, as shown in Figure 1 (Section 2), the actual rate of unemployment in both countries is far from its equilibrium level, implying that the natural rate of unemployment (NRU) cannot account for the large increases in unemployment. 
The actual unemployment rate, the NRU, and frictional growth.
 The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 puts these two economies in context. Section 2 briefly discusses the theoretical framework on which we base our empirical analysis. Section 2 shows the estimated models and the econometric methodology. Section 2 presents the contributions of the exogenous variables to the variation of unemployment, before and after the crisis. And finally, Section 2 concludes.",

Most of these studies find that after an initial adaptation period, immigrants’ earnings and employment choices converge towards those of similar natives. Moreover, the evidence shows that assimilation is directly related with immigrants’ skill level. In contrast, not much is known on how immigrants adjust to an economy with little experience as a host country. Nonetheless understanding immigrants’ assimilation process in such circumstances can be of most policy relevance, especially in the midst of the new immigration flows towards countries other than the most traditional countries receiving immigrants. Indeed Southern European countries have recently experienced a preponderance of migrants in their territory (Reher and Silvestre, 2009). In this paper, we propose to use Spain as a quite unique experience to analyze such issues as the country experienced an unprecedented immigration boom in a short period of time—with immigrants representing from 1% of the population in 1990 to 12% in 2009. Given the impressive inflow of immigrants that Spain has experienced in the last ten years (on average, an annual flow of immigrants of 500,000 per year), the assimilation process of immigrants is an important issue not only for economic, but also for social reasons. Moreover, the experience of Spain ought to be of interest to policymakers of other Southern European countries that share common cultural affinities (such as, the strong family-orientated values associated with a low degree of individualization—Flaquer, 2000); similar socio-economic circumstances (such as, rigid labor and financial markets, important underground economy, low productivity growth, and excessive borrowing —Garicano, 2008; Andrés, 2009; de la Rica, 2009; Estrada et al., 2009; and Cuñat and Garicano, 2009); welfare commonalities (such as, the mix of universalistic health-care and education systems with professional pension schemes, the high degree of institutional fragmentation, and the lack of an explicit family policy as evidenced by a very limited number of family-friendly social provisions—Guillén, 1997; Ferrera, 1996; Rodríguez-Planas, 2012); and a recent preponderance of illegal migration and weak governmental capacity to regulate immigrants’ inflows—Castles and Miller, 2003; Arango, 2004; Solé, 2004; Martin et al., 2006). Unlike the findings from countries with a long tradition of receiving immigrants (summarized in Section 2), Section 3 of this paper presents evidence that skilled immigrants in Spain do not assimilate as well as low-skilled ones. It is important to note that we are not the first to find evidence that in Spain the recent wave of immigrants has suffered from over-education. One of the first studies to explore this question is that of Amuedo-Dorantes and de la Rica, 2007. Using 2001 decennial Population Census data, these authors find evidence of immigrants’ progressive employment and occupational mobility as their residence in Spain increases. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, their analysis focuses on immigrants who arrived during the second half of the 1990s and, therefore, misses most of the massive recent inflow of immigrants2. Using cross-sectional data from the 1996 to 2005 Spanish Labor Force Survey, Fernández and Ortega 2008, find that although the Spanish labor market is able to absorb immigrants within 5 years after arrival, it does so at the expense of allocating them in fixed-term contract jobs for which they are over-qualified. Similarly, Sanromá et al. 2009, find that non-EU15 immigrants in Spain suffer over-education, in both incidence and intensity, and that the process of assimilation is very low. Using panel data from Social Security records, Izquierdo et al., 2009, find that, despite a sizeable and significant wage gap reduction between legal immigrant men working in wage and salary jobs in the formal sector and their native counterparts within the 5 years after arrival to Spain, full assimilation of wages does not take place as a 15 percentage points wage differential remains. The novelty of the current paper is that by doing the analysis by skill level an interesting new insight emerges, namely that having a high-school degree does not give immigrants an advantage in terms occupational or wage assimilation (relative to their native counterparts). After exploring the potential reasons behind this result in Section 4, this paper concludes with a discussion of the policy consequences for the Spanish case.",12
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,31 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-1-7,"Primum vivere . . . industrial change, job destruction and the geographical distribution of unemployment",December 2012,Francesco Pastore,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With the explosion of the Great Depression, the risk is high that the already extraordinary gap in unemployment rates among regions of many European countries and of the European Union (EU) will further increase. Nonetheless, little attention is devoted to the issue of the possible impact of the economic crisis on the geographical pattern of unemployment. This paper aims to provide a frame of mind to think of this problem and, based on it, to survey the most recent literature. The underlying assumption of the paper is that regional unemployment differentials within the EU remain persistent, despite increasing interregional and intra-European migration flows. This suggests, in turn, that there are important factors at a local level that are able to cause regional unemployment differences to generate and persist over time. There may possibly be two lines of reasoning of why this might be the case. First, there might be reasons why geographical labour mobility within a country is reinforcing rather than reducing regional differences in local unemployment rates, as assumed in traditional neoclassical models of regional unemployment (Marston, 1985). A growing body of literature (see, among others, Moretti, 2003, and the related contributions on social externalities of human capital; and, within the New Economic Geography literature, Epifani and Gancia, 2005; Francis, 2009) suggests that economies to scale and positive externalities among complementary production factors might explain this, in turn. In other words, although moving from high to low unemployment regions, labour would be attracted where its return is higher, not because labour is less abundant, but because the returns to capital is higher, which would reinforce the ability of wealthier regions to produce more than average, generating further divergence, rather than convergence. This means, however, that regional unemployment is not only a consequence of state failure, due to the proven inability of regional policy, also at the EU level, to cause convergence, but also a consequence of market failure. Second, there might be reasons why more jobs are continuously destroyed in high unemployment regions, causing the spatial gap to persist over time. Also due to the failure of the adjustment mechanism depicted above, the factors causing a low competitiveness of high unemployment regions might tend to persist. A recent contribution by Munich and Svejnar (2009), based on estimates of matching functions in six Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs since now) from 1991 to 2005, shows that industrial restructuring is still in the mid-2000 a major cause of local (and national) unemployment in several cases, although in other cases low demand and inefficient matching are also important factors. The higher degree of industrial restructuring of high unemployment regions is, in turn, possibly due both to temporary and permanent factors. The temporary factors include a greater openness to international trade by new competitors and the introduction of new technologies that replace the traditional productions. High unemployment regions typically have a more traditional production structure, often constituted of a large number of newly born, small sized firms operating in the traditional manufacturing sectors, which are the most exposed to competition from emerging market economies. The long term factors, which help explaining why some regions exhibit more weaknesses in the event of the same economic recession, and therefore less competitiveness and attractivity to foreign investment, include: a) a lower endowment of both physical and human capital; b) higher than average criminality rates (especially organised crime); c) reduced importance of migration flows as an adjustment mechanism; d) the economic dependence on more developed regions; e) the presence of poverty traps. This paper only marginally discusses geographical labour mobility and rather focuses on the second line of reasoning: in fact, it studies the way industrial restructuring affects local unemployment and does so by looking at the local labour market dynamics. Newly available data with a longitudinal structure allow studying it with a detail that has never been available before. The data come both from sample surveys and administrative sources. This is an important pre-condition to study the impact of industrial restructuring on local unemployment. Related to this has been the flourishing of an increasing body of literature whose results this paper will try to summarise and interpret by proposing a theoretical framework that is often implicit in the empirical literature, but hardly made explicit and discussed in depth. The paper is structured as follows. Section One gives a simple theoretical framework with which to think of the link between structural change, worker reallocation and regional imbalances. Section Two reviews the empirical literature on the hypotheses discussed in the previous section. Section Three discusses the policy implications of the main findings of the surveyed literature. Some summary remarks follow.",1
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,28 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-1-6,Why is there a gender earnings gap in self-employment? A decomposition analysis with German data,December 2012,Daniel SJ Lechmann,Claus Schnabel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is well-known that women earn less than men in paid employment. The public often perceives this difference in wages as discrimination against women, and policy makers give high priority to overcoming this inequality (see e.g. European Commission 2011). Economic and sociological research, however, has shown that the difference in wages can largely be traced back to women having different productive characteristics than men (in particular different human capital endowments), choosing different occupations and working fewer hours (see Altonji and Blank 1999 for a survey and Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer 2005 for a meta-analysis of this strand of literature). Yet even when accounting for these differences, a substantial part of the gender pay gap cannot be explained and is then usually assumed to reflect employer discrimination against women. One possibility to ensure not being discriminated by one’s employer evidently is being one’s own employer, i.e. becoming self-employed. Hence, if employer discrimination played a major role, the gender gap in self-employment earnings could be expected to be significantly lower than the gender wage gap in paid employment (Moore 1983). There is some empirical evidence, however, suggesting that exactly the opposite is the case – both raw and unexplained gender earnings gaps seem to be higher in self-employment than in paid employment (see, e.g., Eastough and Miller 2004, Álvarez et al. 2009). This is somewhat puzzling, in particular as other potential sources of discrimination such as discriminating behavior of customers or capital providers do not seem to play a substantial role for self-employed women. While it is true that women generally start self-employment with less start-up capital than men and that financial constraints seem to contribute to the gender earnings gap to some extent (e.g. Hundley 2001, Walker 2009, Rybczynski 2009), there is no conclusive evidence whether this is due to discrimination by capital lenders (see, inter alia, Asiedu et al. 2012, Orser et al. 2006, Verheul and Thurik 2001, Coleman 2000, Fabowale et al. 1995). Also discrimination by consumers does not seem to explain the self-employment gender earnings gap (see Aronson 1991: 72–73, Moore 1983). Even though there exists a large gender gap in self-employment earnings for which discrimination does not provide a satisfactory explanation, relatively few studies have attempted to explore the causes of this gap (e.g. Hundley 2001 and Walker 2009 for the U.S., Eastough and Miller 2004 for Australia and the U.S., Leung 2006 for Canada, Álvarez et al. 2009 for Spain and Tansel 2000 for Turkey)1. While the analyses by Hundley (2001) and Walker (2009) with U.S. data point to the relevance of working hours and household production as an important factor for explaining gender earnings differences, the effects of these variables are not always robust to selecting men or women as the reference group. Other studies, not considering hours and housework, mostly find the segregation of men and women into different industries or occupations to be among the most important contributions to the gender earnings gap. The percentage of the earnings gap that can be explained by endowment differences between men and women varies widely from practically zero percent (Álvarez et al. 2009, Tansel 2000) up to almost 100 percent (Leung 2006). When it comes to Germany, the empirical evidence is especially scarce. In an early study, Jungbauer-Gans (1999) examines the earnings gap in 1995 using the German Micro Census which, however, only provides earnings data in intervals. For the self-employed, she finds a small earnings gap which becomes larger but insignificant when attempting to correct for selection into (self-)employment, and does not perform a decomposition analysis. A recent survey by Gather et al. (2010) provides some bivariate inspection of the gender earnings gap in Germany. Based on the 2007 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) the authors calculate that fulltime self-employed women earn 34.7 percent less than men in self-employment. Observing that, when analyzed on their own, neither human capital nor segregation into industries nor the existence of children can explain the earnings gap, they conclude that multivariate decomposition analysis is needed to identify the determinants of earnings differences (and the unexplained residual) for the self-employed. Our study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by identifying and decomposing the causes of the self-employment gender earnings gap in Germany, using the gender pay gap in paid employment as a benchmark. Utilizing a rich cross-sectional dataset with continuous information on earnings (rather than earnings intervals), we analyze whether the raw and the unexplained gender earnings gap differ between self-employment and paid employment. Our dataset provides, among others, detailed information on human capital endowments of individuals, on personal characteristics including career aspirations, on job characteristics such as working hours, working time flexibility, professional field and task profile, and on firm size. This enables us to test whether self-employed women earn less than men because they differ in productivity-related attributes or own different types of businesses. We are also able to analyze whether it is different motivations and non-monetary aspects that contribute to the gender earnings gap, i.e. whether self-employed women earn less because they are seeking work-family balance rather than profits. That said, a limitation of this rich data set is that it is only cross-sectional, so that unobserved heterogeneity can hardly be taken into account. Yet we will perform a Heckman (1979) selection correction as a robustness check in order to address the issue of selection on unobservables into self-employment or paid employment. In order to explain the gender earnings gap one has to identify variables that differ between male and female self-employed and at the same time affect earnings in such a way that they may account for the lower female earnings. Accordingly this paper is structured as follows: In section 2, after presenting our data, we describe men’s and women’s distribution of earnings and their differences in endowments, motivations and job characteristics that may be responsible for the gender earnings gap. We then explore the impact of these variables by estimating earnings functions in section 3. Section 4 decomposes the gender earnings gap utilizing an Oaxaca-Blinder-decomposition, and section 5 concludes.",15

1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,18 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-1-4,Reforming an insider-outsider labor market: the Spanish experience,December 2012,Samuel Bentolila,Juan J Dolado,Juan F Jimeno,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the early 1980s, the world economy has been subject to the twin forces of growing globalization and accelerated technological progress. European countries have tried to adapt labor market institutions to this changing environment in different ways. In several cases, the strategy has been to introduce labor market flexibility at the margin, by widening the scope of so-called atypical employment, through temporary and part-time contracts. This, together with the high rates of unionization or coverage of collective bargaining prevailing in these countries, has exacerbated the insider-outsider divide in their labor markets. Notice that the latter term comes originally from the standard insider-outsider model, which explains how persistent unemployment can arise when working conditions, and wages in particular, are determined by taking into account only the interests of employed insiders, thus disregarding the interests of unemployed outsiders (Lindbeck and Snower 1984, 1988;Blanchard and Summers 1986). Yet, in the specific context of dual/segmented labor markets, this conventional interpretation should be slightly modified. In line with the literature on this topic, not all employed workers should be considered as being insiders but only those who hold open-ended or permanent labor contracts subject to high employment protection (Bentolila and Dolado 1994; Saint-Paul 1996). Conversely, employees under very flexible contracts are better thought of as being part of the outsiders because, given that their role is precisely to bear the brunt of employment adjustments, their attachment to the job is fragile. Though in most instances the introduction of flexibility at the margin was perceived as a transitory measure aimed at counteracting the negative employment consequences of recessions during the early 1980s and early 1990s, the incidence of atypical employment has continuously increased: in 1980 the temporary employment rate among employees in Europe was around 7.5%, now it is around 14%, reaching maximum values in Portugal (23%) and Spain (25%). The expansion of 1995-2006 drew attention away from unemployment, but the impact of the financial crisis, the employment consequences of the Great Recession, and the need for supply policies to promote long-term growth in Europe in the context of the European Monetary Union (EMU), have again shifted the focus towards new labor market reforms. While the drawbacks of atypical employment were blurred by the boom, its negative economic and social effects have become more salient with the recession, so that the need for a different type of labor market reform has become increasingly evident (International MonetaryFund 2010, Box 3.1;Boeri 2011). Given past experience, this time the dualism strategy is being challenged and some economists have started to explore new routes, which are geared towards making labor market regulation more efficient, flexible, and simple (Blanchard and Tirole 2003;Cahuc and Kramarz 2004;Boeri and Garibaldi 2008; Bentolila et al.2008, Ichino et al.2009; Andrés et al.2009). Their proposals do, however, face the difficulty of eliminating an insider-outsider divide that, in some countries, has become well-entrenched. Its equilibrium nature stems from its being beneficial to particular groups of workers and employers, mostly represented by unions and employer associations with institutional recognition and political power. In this paper we revisit the Spanish case. Starting from 1984, when the unemployment rate was close to 20%, Spain has become a pioneer in the strategy of reforming the labor market at the margin –i.e., by liberalizing so-called atypical employment contracts–. Since then, after many labor market reforms that have modified the menu of hiring and firing conditions attached to temporary and permanent contracts, the unemployment rate has exhibited a very large volatility, having recently surged from 8% just before the crisis to about 25% nowadays. The experience of the last three decades provides a few interesting insights and very informative evidence on the socioeconomic consequences of and the political economy issues brought forth by dual labor markets. These are worth considering, not only for further labor market reform in Spain, but also for other countries, like France and Italy (See Boeri, 2011), that also followed the same two-tier reform strategy during the 1980s, and now also face the side effects of a dual labor market. Thus, building upon the large body of evidence on labor reforms, we discuss the Spanish labor market performance during the Great Recession (Section 3), highlight the main institutional idiosyncrasies that give rise to an extreme insider-outsider divide in its labor market (Section 3), address some key elements of the political economy of labor market reforms (Section 3), describe and assess (negatively) the first two Spanish labor market reforms undertaken in the midst of the crisis (Section 3), and review a few recent proposals for reform (Section 3). We conclude (Section 3) with some comments on the priority that labor reforms should have in the program of structural reforms that the Spanish economy urgently needs at the current juncture. Since, after writing this paper, another reform has been passed in February 2012, this time by the new conservative Government, we also add at the end of this section a brief discussion of its main features and its pros and cons in the light of the previous proposals.",70

This “German Miracle” occurred due to various reasons. On the one hand, Germany had to – unlike countries such as Ireland and the United States, which both faced a slump in domestic demand combined with a real estate crisis – deal with a world demand shock that mostly affected economically strong firms (Rinne and Zimmermann 2011; Schneider and Gräf 2010). On the other hand, various flexibility instruments at the firm level, combined with discretionary adjustments of the institutional framework by policy makers (i.e. enhancement of the short-time work schemes), enabled firms to adjust their workforce along the internal rather than the external margin (Möller 2010). In addition, far reaching labor market reforms between 2002 and 2005, initiated to fight the high and persistent unemployment that had evolved since the end of the seventies, had significantly altered the core elements of the labor market, including active and passive labor market policies, the organizational structure of labor offices as well as the pension system. The speed and depth of the reforms were quite remarkable when it is considered that the German welfare state had been typically depicted as the prime example of a “frozen welfare state”, highly resistant to change (see, among others, Esping-Andersen 1990; Manow and Seils 2000; Kemmerling and Bruttel 2005; Konle-Seidl et al. 2010). In summary, the actions taken during the reforms led to higher working incentives and better matching between labor demand and supply in the period before the Great Recession, and were therefore considered as one of the main reasons for the mild reaction (Gartner and Klinger 2010). The reforms also had the general goal of increasing the labor force participation of those with young families. However, irrespective of the mild response to the Great Recession, there are a number of substantial future challenges the German labor market will soon have to face. Since Germany will – like many other Western European countries – further experience a massive demographic change over the next 50 years, the development of labor supply of women and older people will become increasingly important in determining the extent to which the working population will decrease (OECD, 2005). Although the employment rates of both groups have in recent years increased, challenges still remain. The current tax and transfer system has so far favored the sole male bread-winner model and therefore causes the absolute working-time hours of economically active women to lie well below that of other Western European countries. Together with the trend of a persistent low fertility rate, the sustainable economic growth of Germany is in jeopardy in the near future due to a decrease of employment potential (OECD 2012). Moreover – although the employment rate of older people lies well above the EU-27 average and has also significantly increased since 2002 – the actual average retirement age continues to lie well below the statutory retirement age. This means there is some maneuverability for potential improvement. However, since older people are often discriminated against in favor of younger people, which often results from a misperception of their working potential, there is not only a need for further social benefit reform, but also for enhancing prospects of lifelong learning (Eichhorst 2011). Labor demand of firms is expected to decrease less than labor supply over the next decades (Sachverständigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung (SVR), 2011), and due to a persistent skill-biased technological change – inducing a decrease of low-skilled jobs in the industry and a considerable growth in occupations requiring higher skills (Spitz-Oener 2006; OECD 2011a) – firms will find it harder to find employees with adequate skills. Employment opportunities for individuals with low education levels will significantly decrease (European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, 2010), emphasizing the need for facilitating access to higher education for a larger share of the population. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, it analyzes past reforms of main institutional settings of the labor market which have influenced labor supply in Section 2. We outline the political and economic situation before 2002 and provide a brief description of the first set of labor market reforms in Section 2.1. This is followed by a discussion of the most relevant income support systems: unemployment benefits and social assistance (see Section 2.2); pensions and early retirement (see Section 2.4); and active labor market policies, since the most recent reforms put an emphasis on increasing labor supply incentives as well (see Section 2.3). Wherever possible, we summarize the effects of these reforms in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the paper outlines why the German labor market reacted in such a mild fashion during the “Great Recession” (Section 3.1), describes current economic trends of the labor market in light of general trends in the European Union, and reveals some of the main challenges associated with these trends in Section 3.2. The challenges for the education system and lifelong learning are discussed in Section 4.1, before an examination of the role of the current tax system in Section 4.2 and a recent initiative to increase labor supply of young families in Section 4.3 are introduced. Based on the status quo of these institutional settings, the paper also provides an overview of strategies to combat the above-mentioned challenges in terms of labor supply and to ensure economic growth in the future.",20

For example, consumption, saving, and labour supply decisions of individuals and households not only depend on their current tastes and opportunities, but also on their expectations of future prices, their future income, etc. (see, for example, Feldstein, 1974). Future expectations often remain unobserved and traditional macro- or micro-economic models typically make assumptions on how they are formed, e.g. assuming rational expectations. The conclusions from these models may be biased if the assumptions on expectations are not satisfied. To solve the problem that expectations are unobserved, many recent empirical studies aim at measuring expectations directly using survey questions. See, for example, Manski (2004) for an assessment of the validity of this approach and a recent special issue of Journal of Applied Econometrics (Bellemare and Manski, 2011). Other examples are Keane and Runkle (1990) on inflation expectations, Dominitz and Manski (2005) on expectations of equity returns, Dominitz and Manski (1997), Das et al. (1999) and Dominitz (2001) on income expectations, Hurd and McGarry (1995) on length of life expectations, Stephens (2004) on job loss expectations, Benítez-Silva and Dwyer (2005) on retirement expectations, Dominitz and Manski (2006) and Chan and Stevens (2008) on pension expectations, and Delavande and Rohwedder (2008) on expectations of old age social security income. Pension expectations have become particularly relevant since in many industrialized countries, the ageing of the population has led to a debate on the need for pension reforms to keep the pension system sustainable (Lindbeck and Persson, 2003; Zaidi, 2010). Particularly since the economic and financial crisis, high retirement replacement rates can no longer be taken for granted. Recent reforms reduce the generosity of guaranteed retirement income and at the same stimulate additional voluntary pension savings, increasing awareness of pension risks and individual responsibility. In this paper, we analyze expectations of the Dutch population aged 25 and older concerning the future generosity of the two main pillars of the Dutch system of income provision to the elderly – first pillar old age social security benefits (AOW) and second pillar occupational pensions (mandatory for almost all employees). As in many other European countries, sustainability of income provision in old age has become an important issue in public policy discussions due to the ageing of the population (Bovenberg and Gradus, 2008). Generous early retirement benefits are gradually being phased out and replaced by actuarially fair flexible retirement systems. The debate has been reinforced by the financial and economic crisis, leading to additional pressure on old age social security due to government budget concerns and due to pressure on occupational pensions caused by the reduced value of the assets of occupational pension funds that invest part of their clients’ pension savings in equity. The idea of working after the normal retirement age of 65 years has gradually become a real option, although impediments currently remain (Van Solinge and Henkens, 2007), and current plans for reforms imply that sooner or later, the state pension eligibility age and the normal retirement age will shift from age 65 to 67; the main disagreement now seems to be on when this will happen, not whether it will happen or not. This makes it particularly interesting to analyze how different socio-economic groups forecast the future of the Dutch pension system and whether and how these forecasts have changed under the influence of the public discussion and the financial and economic crisis. Subjective beliefs are important for economic modelling, since they make it possible to test assumptions on expectation formation like rational expectations, and, if necessary, replace them by an expectation formation model that is supported by the subjective beliefs data. In our sample, at each given point in time, all respondents are asked to predict the same outcome and in principle have access to the same information. The large heterogeneity in reported expectations in our data reveals that in spite of this, they do not have the same subjective distributions. One of the explanations for this could be that some groups lack the proper cognitive skills or are not willing to invest time to form their beliefs. Moreover, it is of interest to analyze to what extent reported beliefs are explained by observable respondent characteristics or contain additional information at the individual level. Misguided expectations may have a negative impact on future well-being of vulnerable groups in society (see, for example, Rohwedder and van Soest, 2006). In particular, overly optimistic beliefs may lead to under-saving. A recent study (De Grip et al., 2012) even suggests that there is also a direct effect of expectations on well-being (implying that the effect of overly optimistic beliefs on life-time well-being is not unambiguously negative.) It is therefore important to see whether different socio-economic groups have realistic views of the future or not. This is not only useful for economists concerned with the mechanisms behind the formation of beliefs but could also offer policy makers new ways of designing effective solutions to prevent saving inadequacy among specific population groups. Since May 2006, monthly survey data were collected on the expectations of Dutch households concerning occupational pensions, old age social security, and the average retirement age ten or twenty years from the time of the interview. A subset of these data was analyzed by Van der Wiel (2008) who focused on the relation between old age social security expectations and savings decisions and Van der Wiel (2009) who investigated the effect of the number of newspaper articles on the volatility of old age social security expectations. We will not only analyze social security but also occupational pension and average retirement age expectations reported from June 2006 until June 2012. We will investigate how they have changed over time, in particular, since the onset of the financial and economic crisis, and how they vary with socio-economic characteristics. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the sample design and the expectations questions. After that we discuss time trends and age patterns in pension expectations, describing how the answers vary over time and how this relates to the public policy debate in the Netherlands. In the Section titled Empirical models of beliefs, we analyze some empirical models relating pension expectations to background characteristics. The final section concludes.",2

Compared to March 2008, this was an increase of more than 4 percentage points. While economic recovery will certainly lead to a reduction in the cyclical component of unemployment, high rates of structural unemployment remain a problem in many European countries, which may also slow down the beneficial labour market effects of the recovery. In equilibrium, unemployment rates crucially depend on the efficiency of the process of how unemployed, job-seeking individuals are matched with open vacancies (e.g. Pissarides 2000; Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001). Usually, this matching process is treated as a black box. However, individuals can influence the efficiency of the process by deciding on how much effort to devote to job search and on which search methods to employ, taking into account associated costs and expected benefits (e.g. Holzer 1988; Blau and Robins 1990). Benefits accrue in the form of job offers, which may vary in their quantity and quality, and thus determine the probability of being employed and the income earned in the next period. Costs may be of pecuniary nature or relate to time and effort aspects. In this paper, we shed some light on the job search process in Europe. In particular, we aim to answer the following four questions. First, what are the determinants of an individual’s overall job search intensity? Second, how are different search methods related to each other, can we detect certain search patterns? Third, what are the determinants of using specific search methods? Fourth, how are the labour market institutions in the EU Member States associated with job search? Regarding the use of specific search methods, we pay particular attention to the use of the public employment services and to job search via personal networks. On the one hand, these two methods can be considered to be polar examples of a very formal and a very informal search channel. On the other hand, the “Employment Guidelines” agreed on by the EU Member States foresee a key role to be played by the national public employment services in implementing the European employment strategy, which envisages, among others, an employment rate of 75 per cent for women and men aged 20 to 64 by 2020 (Council of the European Union 2010). It is therefore of high interest to know to which extent the public employment services actually do play a role in the matching process. In order to answer these questions, we use the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), a representative and internationally comparable survey of individual workers in Europe. Our investigation relates to several other studies on the search behaviour of the unemployed (e.g. Barron and Mellow 1979; Holzer 1988; Osberg 1993; Clark 2001; Addison and Portugal 2002; Weber and Mahringer 2008; Riddell and Song 2011) and contributes to this literature in the following respects. First, we provide detailed cross-country evidence for the European Union, based on a harmonised survey. This can be seen as an update to Clark (2001) who partly used the same data set but focused on the years prior to 1999 when – due to data limitations – comparability of the data across time and countries was more difficult and the EU consisted of 15 countries only. Second, we put special emphasis on the role of household characteristics in determining search behaviour. Detailed household information is rarely available in comparable data sets but should be of major importance assuming that labour supply is, in general, a household decision. From a policy perspective, this appears particularly relevant as it might help identify specific groups of the population who may be in special need of targeted support by the state. Third, we explore whether country differences in job search behaviour can be linked to (institutional) characteristics of the labour market. Our analysis is inherently descriptive in nature and exclusively focuses on the determinants of job search behaviour, that is, the ‘inputs’ to the job search process. Since the EU-LFS data consist of yearly cross-sections, we are not able to follow individuals over time. Hence, we are unable to relate search behaviour to subsequent outcomes and cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of different search strategies. However, assuming that individuals base their search choices on a cost-benefit rationale, we are still able to infer factors determining the relative costs and benefits of search strategies as perceived by job-seeking individuals. A detailed understanding of these factors can help policy makers in designing more targeted policies to increase the efficiency of the matching process. The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the data used for the analysis. Section 3 outlines the empirical methodology. Results are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes.",8

As a member of Italy’s former “technocratic” government, responsible for drafting two major laws–the Pension and Labor Market reforms–I could finally draw a sigh of relief. Brussels’ decision showed that the sacrifices the government had to impose on Italians in order to realize fiscal consolidation were starting to pay off. These as well as other reforms were the result of a sharp decline of the Italian sovereign debt credibility in Summer 2011, which brought the Country to the verge of a financial crisis, with likely devastating consequences also for Europe and the Euro1. Italy had (and still has) to refinance, on average, one billion Euros a day of its huge public debt (over 130 per cent of GDP) and its well-tested system for doing so had come under massive attack. Financial operators had turned their backs on debt auctions and the few who took part were demanding exorbitant interest rates, so that the spread of the interest rate of Italian 10-year bonds over their German counterparts rose to over 550 basis points. It is therefore not rhetorical to say that financial breakdown was round the corner and that the possibility of unhonored sovereign debt was very real; even pensions and civil service salaries were at risk. Central and local administrations were already unable to pay suppliers, whose claims exceeded 70 billion Euros. Many observers were pointing to the risk that Italy might become the “new Greece” (Gammelin and Bachstein 2011 and Brummer 2011), with much worse consequences on both economic and social stability inside the country and in the whole Euro area. The worsening of the financial situation was, however, only one side of the coin. The other was the structural weakness that has been afflicting the country for about twenty years: growth rates have been significantly lower than elsewhere in Europe and productivity has been either stagnant or declining. Industrial decline has slowly reduced Europe’s once most buoyant economy to a shadow of its former self. Italy had cut its R&D expenditure, got out of high productivity sectors like electronics, chemicals and drugs, and concentrated instead on labor intensive fashion-oriented “made in Italy” products, where it has been encountering increasingly stiff competition from developing countries. Politics was at a stalemate. The government first had refused to recognize the gravity of the situation and persisted in making unrealistic promises. In August 2011, however, it yielded to international pressure and pledged to introduce wide-ranging changes (prominent among them pension and labor market reforms), as urged by the ECB in a letter of August 5th. It however could not survive the ensuing confusion among its own parliamentary supporters, who disliked to take responsibility for unpopular restrictive measures. The government resigned on November the 12th in a situation of political chaos and the President of the Republic appointed Professor Mario Monti, a former member of the EU commission, as head of a “technocratic” government, composed of experts drawn from civil society and with no political affiliation. The new government received a vote of confidence (Nov 16th, 2011) by a “strange” Parliamentary majority, composed of the two political parties (centre-left and centre-right) who had been acrimoniously fighting each other for the past twenty years.",16
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,16 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-2-19,Full employment: a distant dream for Europe,December 2013,Indermit Gill,Johannes Koettl,Truman Packard,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In February 2000, the world watched as France instituted the 35-hour workweek, down from the 39 hours expected of French workers, and the over 40 in most developed countries. The reasoning was that because there are only so many hours of work needed, it would be better to share them among more workers. Unemployment in late 1999 was about 10 percent, so cutting the number of hours by about 10 percent might take care of the problem. Economists call this the “lump of labor fallacy”. Another reason was the belief that French workers should be rewarded for their high productivity by allowing them to work less. Researchers found that the output per hour worked was higher in France than in almost every other country. Getting employers to pay overtime wages for work beyond 35 hours would help labor capture more benefits of high productivity. What happened over the next few years? Unemployment did not fall by much, though the new requirements might have encouraged workers to move to smaller firms that were not covered by the law (Estevão and Sá 2008). The 35-hour workweek has since been watered down, but no government has tried to repeal it. Instead, businesses have been given ways around the problem, and the regulations have become more complicated. In the meantime, productivity growth has slowed in Western Europe and sped up in the United States. Between 1990 and 2000, output per hour worked in manufacturing—the sector with the most reliable data—grew at roughly 4 percent a year in both France and the United States. Between 2000 and 2007, it accelerated to 6 percent in the United States, while French productivity growth slowed to 3.3 percent (United States Department of Labor 2011). Although institutions and social norms vary across Europe, the stereotype is that Americans “live to work” and Europeans “work to live”. Few would argue that the two weeks of leave that many workers in the United States get is good for their productivity and growth. Americans who have traveled or lived in Europe often lament the imbalance between work and life in the United States, and attribute the rise in stress and tensions in family life to the importance Americans give to work. One could be forgiven for wondering whether in the years since Europe’s “Golden Age” between 1950 and 1970, Europeans have been drifting to the opposite but equally questionable extreme. In the 1960s, the French worked the longest hours among advanced countries. By the 1980s, they worked about as long as Americans. By 2000, they worked about 300 fewer hours each year—a month and a half less—than Americans. In France, just 1 in 10 people aged 60–65 works; in the United States, the ratio is 1 in 2. It is difficult to see how norms can change so quickly; the reason has to be that policies have changed. If Europeans feel that work has declined too much, then it is obvious that policies have to change. One development makes these decisions urgent. As people reduce the years they work in most of Europe, populations in all European countries are aging. The European Union’s labor force is expected to decline by about 39 million by 2060. If the Balkans, Turkey, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Belarus are included, the decline is about 50 million; the projected increase of 6 million in Turkey’s labor force is more than offset by the decline elsewhere. Only if actual retirement ages were to increase by around 10 years and participation rates—especially among women—were to increase to levels seen in Northern Europe, could Europe offset the decline in the labor force. None of these measures, though, would prevent the aging of the European labor force. Europe is not alone in feeling the force of aging. Japan and other developed parts of Northeast Asia already find themselves under the strains of low fertility and increasing longevity. In the Southern Cone of Latin America, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay are also getting old. Even China faces this challenge, and indeed will from 2015 experience faster aging than any country has experienced previously. But the most “European” features of the work model—unprecedented job security, generous benefits for the unemployed, and easy pension eligibility—make the imperatives created by an aging population most acute in Europe. Europeans have a choice: work more to maintain the European social model, or give up a big part of this model through painful cuts in social benefits. The first imperative is to counter shrinking of the labor force. As in now-wealthy Western Europe, North America, and Japan, industrialization, urbanization, and advances in hygiene and health care extended lifespan and reduced child mortality and the need for large families. Yet with legal retirement age stuck at 60 or 65 in most countries, and many people retiring even younger, the number of people at work has been falling. The labor force in Europe as a whole is expected to shrink 5 percent by 2020 and more than 15 percent by 2060. The second imperative is to increase labor productivity. A shrinking labor force reinforces the need to develop human capital relevant in the labor market. With increasing shortages of qualified labor and rapidly changing industrial structures, any inclusive growth strategy will need to boost labor productivity through investments in human capital. Europe’s adverse demography also means that its human capital has to be better leveraged. Labor market regulations, interventions, and institutions have to become more “pro-work”. To ease the brakes on growth caused by aging, it is necessary to have labor market regulations that encourage more people to work, to work longer, and to work more productively. Changes that make jobs more contestable will increase productivity. And increasing the productivity of the labor force will require that Europeans become more mobile. In short, Europe will have to rid itself of the lump-of-labor fallacy that impedes smarter labor policy1. What has to be done? First, Europe must offset the impending labor force decline by increasing the labor force participation of people of all ages. Second, European countries must improve regulations and interventions so that labor is allocated more efficiently, within and across countries. And third, Europeans will have to change their attitude to labor mobility. We arrive at these conclusions by answering three questions:  Are employment and social protection practices reducing participation? In most parts of Europe, they are. Strict employment protection and weak work incentives undermine labor participation and efficiency in Europe. Some governments have reformed labor laws to make hiring new workers cheaper—though these changes have generally been piecemeal, as in Spain during the early 2000s—while others such as Germany have restructured social assistance schemes to make it more profitable to work rather than collect benefits. Central European countries such as Poland have changed social security systems to encourage participants to work longer, but it is far from clear whether these changes will be sustained.  Are employment and social protection policies inhibiting efficiency? In almost all of Europe, they are. Current policies allow “insiders” to make their jobs incontestable through strict employment protection, while creating considerable work disincentives for “outsiders” through poorly designed social benefits, especially in low-wage segments. Many governments in Europe—especially in the north—have been making the labor market more contestable, and others can learn from them.  Is Europe taking advantage of the potential for greater labor mobility? The short answer is no. Although migration between EU countries is higher than in other world regions, it falls short of the European Union’s aspiration of a fully integrated labor market. In addition, internal labor mobility in most countries is low. The explanations (beside the obvious difference in language and culture between EU countries) involve inefficient housing markets, wage-setting practices that do not signal labor shortages and surpluses, and the absence of a Europe-wide social safety net that makes moving too risky. Many observers would like to blame Europe’s poor employment outcomes on the Euro or on austerity. But these are dangerous distractions from real problems that constitute imperatives for structural reform. What of employment and the Euro? Of the 27 member states of the European Union in March 2013, 17 use the single currency, four peg their own national currencies to the Euro, and six retain freely floating national currencies. Although the five EU countries with the highest unemployment are all Euro members (Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus), four of the five countries with the lowest unemployment rates (Austria, Luxemburg, Germany, and the Netherlands) use the single currency as well (the fifth is Romania). What about employment and austerity? This is a bit of a red herring. Greece’s public spending in 2013 will be what it spent in 2002, Portugal and Italy in 2005, and Spain in 2008. The UK, France and the Netherlands have been spending a lot more. So while the headwinds on growth and demand for employment created by tighter fiscal policy cannot be ignored, nor should they distract policy makers from structural problems. Europe is aging and its labor force shrinking. This is not news. But the speed and size of these developments is shocking, and should motivate policy responses. Labor market regulations, interventions, and institutions are restraining growth, and they must be updated. Education and training systems will need reform to enable workers to take up more productive jobs, with greater ease and to greater profit. Europeans are still less likely to move than people in other parts of the world, and the success of the single market in services depends on their becoming more mobile. To do all this, Europe’s policymakers will have to convince themselves and their constituents that the rewards of hard work can be shared sensibly without treating labor as a fixed lump to be parceled out.",10

Indeed, several kinds of research results have implied that high skilled are less likely to leave full-time employment and less sensitive to labor market fluctuations (Peracchi and Welch 1994, Blau 2005, Maestas and Zissimopoulos 2010, Blau and Goodstein 2010)1. The suggested underlying mechanisms include direct effects in terms of improved matching to market demand of skills, complementarities between formal education and on-the-job-training (Fouarge and Schils 2009), that technological changes favor high skilled workers as they are more likely to receive on-the-job-training (Bartel and Sicherman 1993, Brunello 2003, Arulampalam et al. 2004), and/or that education affects health and thereby explain prolonged labor force participation (Kalwij and Vermeulen 2005). These studies all consider education completed at a young age, providing what may appear as reasonable basis that education for adults postpone the timing of retirement. However, there is no direct empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis, presumably as it requires access to very long time-series of data on earnings, pensions and other indicators of labor force status, as well as data on adult education2. In addition, the theoretical predictions are ambiguous as education may increase individuals’ life time income streams from both earnings and pensions. The effect on the timing of retirement then depends on the individuals’ time preferences and/or the relation between income from work and pension entitlements, with workers postponing retirement as long as the option value of remaining in the work force is positive (Stock and Wise 1990). The theoretical ambiguity gives empirical studies an important role for our understanding of if and/or how educational investments influence the timing of retirement. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first analysis of retirement behavior of adults who invest in formal higher education. The purpose of this paper is to study whether adult education (henceforth AE) at tertiary level starting at age 42 or later delays decisions to retire. The analysis is based on Swedish population register data which include information on registration in higher education since 1977, on annual earnings 1982–2010, and on retirement pension payments 1990–2010. To control for the endogeneity of the decision to enroll AE, we use propensity score matching, exploiting very detailed data which includes annual earnings ten years prior to enrollment, information on family characteristics, sector of employment and transfers related to unemployment, sick-leave, social welfare and early retirement. In robustness checks, we consider potential unobservable confounders such as systematic differences in time horizons and pre-program dynamics in earnings and transfers, but the overall implications of our results remain stable3. Earlier studies of adults aged 40 or above in formal education have generally found positive effects on earnings when enrolling community college in the US (Jacobson et al.2005a, b) or upper secondary education in Sweden (Stenberg and Westerlund 2008, Stenberg et al. 2011). Regarding the timing of retirement, Stenberg et al. (2012) reported no effects of upper secondary schooling completed at age 42 or higher. Neither males nor females who enrolled in Swedish upper secondary education 1986–1989, when aged 42–55, differ in their timing of retirement relative to matched comparisons, observed up and until 2004 when aged 60–73. This result holds across a variety of subgroups. We have found only two other studies addressing whether adult educational investments affect the timing of retirement. Kristensen (2012) considers a hybrid between formal education and on-the-job training and Battistin et al. (2013) examine on-the-job training. Kristensen (2012) analyzes government co-sponsored training in Denmark for individuals born 1936–1944. This type of training was very prevalent during the period 1980–2004, which the data of the study covers, because if training took place during work hours, the government reimbursed the equivalent of the unemployment insurance benefits of the participant. About 40 percent of the individuals were at some point in training, “usually” encompassing less than two weeks of courses. The results indicate no significant effects of post-secondary courses on the timing of retirement, and significant but small effects following basic education or vocational courses. Translated to one year of full time training, this effect corresponds to about a one month extension of working life. Battistin et al. (2013), in contrast, reports a notable delay in retirement following on-the-job-training in Italy. They exploit exogenous variation in both mandatory minimum early retirement age and government regional training subsidies during the 1990s and early 2000s, reporting that an extra month of on-the-job-training reduces the probability of retirement by 5 percent. The authors consider the estimated effect on labor force participation to be substantial. The contribution of the present study is that we examine the effects of formal tertiary/higher education on the timing of retirement. Our results indicate that higher education significantly delays retirement, and thus differ from the zero effect of low skilled in formal schooling found in Stenberg et al. (2012). The difference in findings are possibly explained by the “job polarization” hypothesis (Goos and Manning 2007), suggesting that the demand for medium skilled performing routine tasks has dropped relatively to the demand for labor in the tails of the skill distribution. The premium for medium-skilled upgrading to high-skilled may then be higher compared with that of low-skilled making the transition to mid-skilled4. In the following, we provide a description of the institutional framework for AE in Sweden and a presentation of data. The empirical model and our identification strategy are outlined in Section 3 while Section 4 contains the results. The findings are summarized and discussed in Section 5.",10

As of the end of the year 2012, Greece’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has declined, cumulatively, by more than twenty percent, with unemployment exceeding 27 percent in the summer of 2013. A raft of policy recommendations were identified and debated, all seeking to help the Greek economy find its way out of the crisis. Institutional reforms, in particular the liberalization of closed professions, wage reductions, and the privatization of public industries, are meant to help improve the competitiveness of the Greek economy. However, the economy will not become prosperous only by cutting costs and making institutional reforms, as much as these are needed. The central problem is the lack of an established industry structure and a well-functioning innovation system. If nothing else changes, the country will have a steady, tourism-based economy supplemented by a food manufacturing base. These components will not yield substantial prosperity increases for the Greek society. At the same time we observe a considerable number of scientists who are able to conduct cutting edge research in Greece along with a tiny number of high tech industries. Although embroiled in the current difficulties of administrative provisions, these firms create highly valuable products in Greece. We also observe that the Greek diaspora includes a significantly larger number of scientists working at leading research institutions and high tech companies in the US and across Europe. Moreover, the country disposes of a unique asset when it comes to win the international race for talents: the attractiveness of its quality of life. We argue that Greece is at a crossroads: it can either choose to focus on tourism only, emulating the example of Orlando, Florida, or to be ambitious and follow the example of San José, California, by using the same assets that attract tourists to attract talented individuals with unique skills from over the world. Such commitment by Greek authorities will transform Greece into an innovation-based economy producing technological breakthroughs that create added value in high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries. To achieve this goal, Greece needs to develop an innovation system by implementing a specific set of policy measures encompassing, inter alia, (i) the further development of existing and the establishment of new research institutes, universities and professional education of the highest quality; (ii) the expansion of research clusters based on existing specialization within Greece; (iii) business environment reforms including improved (intellectual) property rights, aimed at nurturing the entry and growth of innovative firms and businesses; (iv) the development of financial tools to support actors in the early stage of innovation; and (v) the development of a Diaspora policy toward Greek researchers, investors and business owners living outside of Greece. For many, the vision of Greece as European ""Silicon Valley"" might appear as a pipe-dream. As we argue in this paper, such a plan is both desirable and achievable when provided with the political will and perseverance to make it a reality. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a short review of the current economic situation in Greece, making clear why austerity measures and institutional reforms are necessary but not sufficient.

However, while there is a substantial consensus on this intergenerational correlation, less is known about the existence of a causal relationship underlying the transmission of education between generations (see, for instance, Björklund and Salvanes 2010; Black et al. 2005; Oreopoulos et al. 2006). On the policy side, to the extent that policymakers are concerned about early school leavers, an analysis of the mechanisms through which education is passed on from parents to children is particularly relevant in light of reforms that extend the length of compulsory schooling. For example, if there is evidence that parental education is responsible for children’s performance in school, then interventions that improve the educational attainment of less educated parents should lead to increased human capital among their children, thus reducing the degree of inequality of opportunity in education. However, the primary concern is that intergenerational educational estimates might not adequately account for the correlation between parental schooling and some unobserved, inherited characteristics that might affect the academic achievement of their offspring. Such correlations would imply that the intergenerational transmission of education could be primarily driven by selection rather than reflecting a causal relationship running from a parent’s to a child’s education. To address this concern regarding endogeneity caused by omitted variables, the empirical literature has recently focused on three identification strategies: twin parents (Behrman and Rosenzweig 2002); adopted children (Björklund et al. 2006; Plug 2004; and instrumental variables (Black et al. 2005; Oreopoulos et al. 2006). In my study, I employ this latter IV approach that obtains identification from compulsory schooling laws that influence the educational distribution of the parents without directly affecting the children. In particular, this study is strictly connected to the seminal paper by Black et al. (2005), which, using the Norwegian schooling reforms during the sixties and early seventies, finds no evidence of a causal impact of parental education on the next generation’s education, with the exception of the weak impact of maternal schooling on educational attainment among sons. Similarly, Holmlund et al. (2011), applying this methodology to Sweden, obtain results in line with Black et al. (2005). However, these findings of limited effects of parental education in Norway and Sweden have not been supported by studies for other countries (see, for example, Oreopoulos et al. 2006; Chevalier 2004; and Maurin and McNally 2008 for France). Perhaps these contradictory results are related to the relatively low levels of inequality with respect to economic and educational outcomes in Scandinavian countries. The contribution of this paper to the literature is twofold. To my knowledge, there are no studies that examine the causal effect of parental schooling on the human capital of their children by exploiting the variation provided by compulsory schooling laws over time and across European countries. Therefore, this paper adds to previous research by using this source of exogenous variation in parental schooling to disentangle the direction of causality. Another contribution of this paper is to shed new light on the different roles played by mothers and fathers in explaining the transmission of education to their sons and daughters. The findings from this multi-country analysis contribute to our understanding of how and why education is transmitted across generations by accounting for the effects of different institutional and cultural environments in Europe. A key element of my identification strategy is that it makes it possible to control for both country fixed effects, which account for time-invariant characteristics across countries, and birth cohort fixed effects for parents, which will capture any systematic difference in schooling outcomes across parental cohorts. To conduct this analysis, I draw data from the first two waves (2004 and 2006) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). This European dataset has three important features: first, it collects data on the current economic, health, and family conditions of over 30,000 individuals aged fifty and above in several European countries; second, it provides information on educational attainment for two family generations; and finally, as it is designed to be cross-nationally comparable, this dataset enables me to properly conduct a multi-country analysis. Furthermore, I use data on reforms of the minimum school leaving age by relying on recent studies (Brunello et al. 2009, 2012; Garrouste 2010). Based on these data, my main results demonstrate that: a) when omitting country-specific trends, there is some evidence of a causal relationship between parents’ and children’s education. The magnitude of the effect is large: an additional year of parental education induced by the reform generates 0.44 years of additional schooling for their children; b) when including country-specific trends, the estimated effects of parental education are no longer statistically significant. I argue that this lack of statistical significance can be explained by the fact that the addition of country-specific trends greatly reduces the first stage power of my instrument; c) the mother’s schooling has a slightly stronger impact than that of her husband on the academic achievement of their offspring with or without country-specific trends. These findings are robust to a number of specification checks. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the relevant literature on the intergenerational transmission of education. Section 3 presents a description of the data and illustrates the main features of European compulsory schooling reforms. Section 4 describes the empirical specification and identification strategy. The main results of the paper are presented in Section 5, and Section 6 provides robustness checks. I discuss the results in Section 7. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 8.",10

In the context of the EU-IMF financing agreement Greek authorities implement the Economic Adjustment Programme (EAP). Progress up till now has been mixed with substantial improvement in the fiscal consolidation effort and labor market reforms and significant delays in the implementation of product market reforms and privatizations (IMF, 2013a)1. Unfortunately, the progress in fiscal adjustment has come at a cost of a dramatic and continuing output contraction, as well as rising unemployment. According to the first EAP2 a recovery was projected as early as 2012. However, according to the latest European Commission forecasts (European Commission 2013a) the path has been quite different so far, i.e., from a mild recession of -0.2 in 2008 Greece went into a much deeper recession in the next years, i.e., -3.1% in 2009, -4.9% in 2010, -7.1% in 2011, -6.4% in 2012. Output is now expected to contract at a slower pace in 2013, i.e., -4.2%; a mild recovery of 0.6% is postponed until 2014. Similarly, the unemployment rate ended up much bigger than initially expected3. It was 17.7% in 2011, 24.3% in 2012 and is now expected to reach 27% in 2013, before declining to 26% in 2014 (European Commission 2013a). According to Elstat (2013) the unemployment rate reached 27.6% in May 2013, compared to 23.8% in May 2012, while youth unemployment has increased from about 25,1% in May 2009 to about 64.9% in May 2013. These unemployment developments challenge social cohesion, putting at risk the public support to the on-going fiscal consolidation effort. According to earlier European Commission and IMF analysis the strong output contraction and the dramatic increase in unemployment has been attributed to reform fatigue and delays in the implementation of structural reforms, which impair the internal adjustment process (see e.g. European Commission 2012; IMF 2012a). However, quite recently the IMF showed that fiscal multipliers might have been underestimated (by a factor of 2–3) in the recent years in a number of countries implying that fiscal consolidation efforts had deeper recessionary effects than anticipated (see IMF, 2012b; Blanchard and Leigh, 2013). Driven by these development, using a quarterly dataset, this paper investigates the growth and unemployment effects of fiscal policy changes in Greece in the period 2000–20124. This analysis is quite topical because policy makers need to have full knowledge of the likely unemployment effects of fiscal consolidation and the social risks that this entails. The he analysis builds on the Blanchard and Perotti (2002) SVAR methodology, as well as on Monacelli et al. (2010) and Pappa (2009) in examining the growth and unemployment effects of exogenous fiscal policy changes. According to our findings, an increase (cut) in government purchases and its subcomponents, i.e., government consumption, the government wage bill and government investment increase (lower) output and reduce (raise) unemployment and the unemployment rate. One year after a negative government purchase shock the unemployment rate increases by about 0.74 p.p. Whereas, two years after the shock the cumulative unemployment rate increase reaches about 0.91 p.p. The unemployment rate effects are double if we assume that the unemployment rate stabilizes around its 2012 level (24.3%). It is primarily government consumption and in particular the wage bill component that drives the output and unemployment responses. Turning to tax variables, increases in the tax burden, and in its subcomponents, such as direct and indirect tax revenues reduce output growth and increase unemployment, but the unemployment response is short lived. Implicit direct and indirect tax rate hikes reduce output growth and increase unemployment rate in a quite pronounced and persistent manner. Both output and unemployment rate responses are more sizeable on impact following government purchases and implicit tax rates shocks compared to the pre-EAP period. In addition, their response profile is more pronounced and persistent compared to the pre-EAP sample (but only in outer years in case of government purchases). The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section reviews the relevant literature on the labor market effects of fiscal policy. Section 3 presents some data information and discusses in more detail the SVAR econometric methodology. In Section 4 we present the main empirical findings. Section 5 includes a brief summary of the results and concluding remarks. An Appendix provides additional information on data issues5.",13

A flexible labor market is considered desirable because of its ability to quickly adapt to fluctuations and changes in society, leading to more efficient labor market outcomes. It allows, for example, workers to move jobs in order to build a career or to find a job that better matches their personal and family circumstances. However, this is only true if there is sufficient information available to workers to identify good jobs. Looking at some particular patterns in labor mobility, one may wonder whether this is the case. Labor mobility patterns across workers exhibit a great deal of variety (see e.g. Kambourov and Manovskii (2008)). Long-term employment relationships are quite common, yet some workers are involved in many job quits within a short time period (Farber (1999)). Given the recent evidence that workers usually gain in job satisfaction and obtain higher wages after a job quit (e.g. Perez and Rebollo (2005); Chi et al. (2008)), the fact that many decide to change jobs again shortly after an initial quit raises the question whether these job changes always contribute to better matching efficiency or whether some changes simply constitute a relocation of labor without any increase (or even a loss) in match quality. In the latter case, policy aimed at stimulating job mobility may not improve labor market outcomes as much as is expected by policy makers. Better information about the nature of job mobility is essential for formulating effective labor policy. From a theoretical point of view, job changes can be explained by the presence (or absence) of ex ante information about job quality. At the one extreme, job quality may be perfectly observable at the time a job offer arrives, and hence workers may decide to quit (again) if they receive an offer which is better than their current job. This can be denoted the stepping-stone mechanism, based on the on-the-job search theory by Burdett (1978). At the other extreme, repeated job quits can be explained by the complete absence of ex ante information about job quality − the so-called learning model pioneered by Jovanovic (1979). In this model, job quality is revealed over the time spent in the job. In case job quality turns out to be lower than expected, workers may decide to leave the job again, although the quality of a new job offer cannot be ascertained in advance. Obviously, these two theories can be considered two ends of a continuum representing the degree to which ex ante job quality information is available. In practice, workers may decide to change jobs in a situation where some information about job quality is known ex ante, and the rest has to be learned while in the job. This paper argues that actual job quit behavior is characterized by a mixture of both. The main aim of the paper is to study the extent to which repeated job quits can be explained by the stepping-stone theory versus the learning model, and hence to determine the relative importance of both models in job quit decisions. This information is crucial for policy makers aiming to improve labor market functioning by stimulating labor mobility. Studying the relationship between job mobility and worker-job match quality is not easy, since match quality is usually not observable. Earlier studies have looked at wages as being an observable outcome of unobserved match quality. Job quits are usually found to be associated with wage gains (Perez and Rebollo (2005), Light (2005)), though not neccesarily (Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Neumark (2002)). In addition, a job quit may improve the job match if a job change facilitates moving from a temporary position to a permanent position (Booth et al. (2002)) or if it leads to an improvement of other non-monetary aspects of the job (Altonji and Paxson (1986)). Munasinghe and Sigman (2004) point to the importance of a fundamental search process in order to explain these positive effects on match quality, since unobservable individual effects alone cannot explain the relationship between mobility and wages. A study by Light and McGarry (1998) used the NLSY data to empirically distinguish between several models explaining the relationship between job mobility and wage outcomes. They find that after taking into account the role of individual fixed effects and the ex ante observability of job quality there is still a significant effect of mobility on wage outcomes, which they interpret as evidence for the learning model. However, these previous studies looked for evidence for one model by eliminating one-by-one the other models. This paper will build on this by investigating the relative importance of each model. Furthermore, the current paper will focus on job satisfaction as a measure for the workers’ perceived match quality, as this not only includes the monetary but also the non-monetary aspects of the job (see section 2.3.1 for a more detailed discussion)1. Earlier studies have shown that people with low job satisfaction are more likely to quit (e.g. Freeman (1978), Akerlof et al. (1988), Clark et al. (1998), Sousa-Poza and Henneberger (2004), Levy-Garboua et al. (2007), Bockermann and Ilmakunnas (2009), Green (2010))2. However, little is known about why sequential job quits might arise. Sequential job search might arise to achieve better occupational matching (e.g. McCall (1990)). For example, Neal (1999) shows that workers always change careers first before they search for their preferred firm to work in. However, sequential job search might also be the result of a poor new job match. We can learn more about this by looking at ex post job quality. Note that there may be other models which can explain job quit behavior. For example, the mover-stayer model which argues that some underlying personality characteristics determine whether someone quits his job often or not. However, the study by Light and McGarry (1998) has shown that the relationship between job mobility and match quality is hardly changed once you control for individual fixed effects. Given the marginal relevance of this model for explaining post-mobility job quality, the current paper will focus only on the two most important models. The role for unobserved individual effects will, however, shortly be addressed when discussing the results. This paper investigates the role of ex ante information imperfections in job quits using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which provides information to distinguish worker-initiated job quits from other job separations. Information about repeated job quits is studied to observe how match quality is affected by subsequent job changes. If match quality always improves following each job quit, then job quit behavior can be considered a stepping stone mechanism, contributing to matching efficiency. Alternatively, in the learning model where job quality is not observable ex ante there is more variation in match quality in the new job. Job quality improves only in expected terms; some workers’ match quality may improve after a job change while for others it may worsen unexpectedly. By using the theoretical predictions from both models, a variance decomposition of job satisfaction in the new job allows me to determine the relative importance of both models. The results illustrate that nearly 70 percent of job characteristics can be observed and exploited to improve job quality by changing jobs (stepping-stone), while there is a 30 percent chance that the new match turns out to be different than expected, either better or worse (learning). The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section presents a simple theoretical model which sets out possible motivations for repeated job quits. Section 3 describes the data and some stylized facts. In Section 4, the results from the empirical analysis are presented; and Section 5 concludes.",12

The flashing of the highest employment rate in the EU, the low level of unemployment and an overall positive macroeconomic performance made Denmark stand out as a best practice for Europe (Madsen, 2006; Bredgaard et al, 20062007). Furthermore Denmark showed some interesting traits, when it came to the country’s combination of the basic building blocks of a Nordic welfare state with some characteristics of more liberal market economies. The Danish development of the welfare state and labour market was thus seen as a successful hybrid between the flexible labour markets in the liberal welfare states characterised by high numerical flexibility (liberal hiring-and-firing rules) and the Scandinavian welfare regimes of generous social security. The hybrid model seemingly managed to reconcile the dynamic forces of the free market economy with the social security of the Scandinavian welfare states (Madsen, 2006). Under the heading of “flexicurity”, the Danish labour market model was therefore cast in terms of a well-functioning relationship between low job protection, a flexible labour market, high levels of unemployment insurance and active labour market policies (Bredgaard et al, 2006). In the wider European discourse of flexicurity, Denmark was rapidly endorsed as inspiration for a European Social Model that should guide the Members States in the development of their employment strategies (European Commission, 2006). Since 2008, Denmark has like most other European countries fallen into a deep recession. This was the combined result of the steep decline in the international economy and the bursting of a national housing bubble that had developed in since the beginning of the decade and accelerated after 2005. From the peak of the business cycle in the spring of 2008 to the bottom of the crisis a year later, Danish GDP fell by 8 percent on a quarterly basis. Reacting more slowly to the downturn, total employment reached its lowest level in the first quarter of 2012, having declined by 7.7 percent. The unemployment rates increased dramatically from 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 to 8.2 percent in the beginning of 2011. From having had one of the lowest levels of unemployment in the EU, Denmark moved close to the middle of the rank. This has stimulated debates about the ability of the Danish model to sustain external chocks and a strand of literature has developed, which discusses the fate of the Danish model of flexicurity in times of crisis sometimes in a comparative perspective (Andersen, 2012; Andersen and Svarer, 2012; Eichhorst et al, 2010; Leschke & Watt, 2010; OECD, 2010). The present article takes up the comparative perspective by applying more recent data and a detailed identification of the national business cycles. Based here on it is discussed, whether the concrete manner in which the crisis has spelled itself out on the Danish labour market is related to the specific balance between flexibility and security that characterises the Danish model. Following the analysis of the Danish labour market performance during the crisis in a comparative perspective, the article furthermore gives an broad overview of the actual Danish policy responses to the crisis both at the macro-level and with respect to labour market policy. It then discusses the degree to which the policies do – or do not – reflect a distinct approach linked to the Danish flexicurity-regime. To which degree do the policy responses support or divert from the main characteristics of the model? This analysis will be based on a mapping of Danish employment policy since 2008. Finally the article assesses the outcomes of the functioning of the Danish flexicurity model during the crisis. Has the Danish model in effect been able to provide security for wage earners in times of severe economic crisis?",8

This paper investigates the role of these factors in students’ choices, with a particular focus on education quality. As measures (or proxies) of quality the Times Higher Education Supplement Ranking (THESR) and the most wide-spread professional business schools accreditations (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, AACSB, and European Quality Improvement System, EQUIS) are used. This analysis investigates whether these measures affect prospective exchange students’ choice of potential destinations. Accredited or well-ranked universities are expected to be preferred by students. This holds true if the student values the quality of education during her stay abroad, and if accreditations and rankings are a proxy for quality. Furthermore, there might be a causal effect: if the information about the potential host institutions available to students is incomplete, rankings and accreditations may work as a signal for quality. Besides quality of education, this paper also investigates whether other characteristics of the host institution affect students’ choices. International student mobility is of great interest to policy-makers, especially in Europe, because it is thought to foster, among other desired outcomes, labour mobility, the creation of a common labour market, cultural integration, and the creation of class of leaders at a European level (Ritzen, 2010; European Commission, 2009). Quality assurance in higher education is considered a crucial aspect to be improved at a European level to foster student mobility (European Commission, 2006). If existing measures of quality are considered reliable by mobile students, they can be used as a tool to foster mobility. Ritzen (2010) argues that Europe-wide accreditation by international professional organisations is a key step to improve quality assurance and reach appropriate levels of student mobility. The fact that quality differentials are a major determinant of international student mobility is well established in the literature on international students mobility (e.g. McMahon, 1992; Kelo, 2006; Thissen and Ederveen, 2006). However, how to adequately signal the quality of the education provided at different institutions remains an unresolved issue for education managers and policy-makers. As accreditations are expensive both in terms of time and monetary costs, it is crucial for education managers to understand whether they are actually considered a valuable signal by their stakeholders. Policy-makers and university managers should know whether students actually take rankings and accreditations into consideration. The data used in this paper has been made available by Maastricht University School of Business and Economics (SBE), a large Dutch business school with more than 3,000 students. From administrative records, it is possible to identify SBE’s partner institutions and the preferences of the prospective exchange undergraduate students over these institutions. The sample covers the period from the academic year 2004/2005 to 2008/2009, 152 universities, and 2,970 exchange applications. SBE’s data is particularly suitable for the purposes of this study, as the faculty prides itself on a strong international orientation, and its students can choose among a diverse set of host institutions. Furthermore, the exchange period is compulsory for SBE students, so that it is possible to analyse the full population of prospective exchange students. On the other hand, generalising the results is difficult, as the data is based on only one institution. In order to link the data to an estimation strategy, a model of whether a university is chosen by a particular student has been developed. Subsequently the appropriate variables to be included in the estimation on the basis of this model were identified. Finally, the model has been estimated using an ordinary probit model with and without university fixed-effects. The results suggest that the THESR rank has a causal effect on the choices of exchange students with high academic achievement. The number of accreditations also appears to have a large impact at the top of students’ distribution, but the estimated coefficient is not significant when university fixed-effects are taken into account. The effect of the THESR and of accreditations is small for the median student, and it is negative for students with lower-than-average academic achievement. Other variables, such as gross national income (GNI) per capita or distance from the equator, appear to affect the preferences of exchange students as well. These results are consistent with the literature on ERASMUS students which used different methodologies (Teichler, 2004; Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al., 2011). This paper is organised as follows. The next section reviews the literature on student choice and international exchange students; Section 3 describes the application process at SBE and the data; Section 4 develops the model and the empirical strategy; Section 5 presents the results; the last section concludes.",9
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,18 June 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-2-4,Labour market and labour market policies during great recession: the case of Estonia,December 2013,Raul Eamets,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In Estonia, liberal market economy, relatively small public sector, and a relatively low tax burden result in scarce resources for policy options. Attempts to achieve annually balanced state budget has a pro-cyclical nature, which means that it works well during economic boom, exaggerating growth through growing public expenditures. The opposite took place during recession when government tried to cut expenditures in order to keep budget deficit under control. As taxes were relatively low, government also missed sufficient automatic stabilisers. In general we can say that government had limited fiscal tools to smooth cyclical fluctuations. Additionally, the currency board system that was the basis for money supply until the introduction of euro (2011) set restrictions for money supply as well as for restraining inflation. There are many papers dealing with monetary policy limitation in currency board arrangement (see for instance Feuerstein and Grimm, 2006;Gilson, 2002;Moheeput, 2008 among the others). It is commonly thought that an open economy can accommodate output shocks through either exchange rate or real sector adjustments. There are also theoretical models showing that in the case of pegged exchange rate, policy reform can be consistent if it renders either exchange rate or labour market flexibility (Castern, et al. 2004). The burden of adjustment to a loss in competitiveness in a currency board country must come from real economy. This adjustment would be facilitated by structural policies designed to increase labour market flexibility (Gilson, 2002). Baltic labour markets are flexible and this has already been reported in the late 1990s (Berengaut, J. et al. 1998, for late period see Eamets, Paas, 2007) Just to illustrate the magnitude of labour market changes: as result of the economic boom between 2004 and 2007, employment reached 70% and unemployment was 4%.; during recession unemployment grew over a period of one and a half year up to almost 20% and employment dropped to 53%. The objective of this paper is to show, using Estonia as an example, that if monetary policy and fiscal policy tools are insufficient and limited, economy will adjust via labour market channels. For quick adjustment labour market should be very flexible. We will observe how labour market and labour market institutions reacted during the recent Economic crisis. The situation in Estonia is rather unique, and very different from those in the old EU member states. Estonia implemented labour market reform in the middle of the deepest economic recession together with strong austerity measures and fiscal consolidation. As widely reported in the economic press, the impression is that austerity policy worked well in Estonia, as it also worked in the other two Baltic economies: Latvia and Lithuania. In 2009, hit with the deepest GDP declines in the world, over the course of the crisis, all three Baltic states adopted austerity measures amounting to 8–9 percent of GDP, with an additional 3–4 percent in 2010 (Kattel, Raudla 2012). The same authors argue that the recent Baltic recovery has unique features that do not relate to domestic austerity policies, nor are they replicable elsewhere. According to Kattel and Raudla the Baltics “outsourced” their recovery. There are three phenomena behind the Baltic recovery, namely: the massive use of European Union (EU) fiscal funds, flexible labour market and integration of export sectors into the key European production networks. Estonian labour market reactions to the crises were first reported by Masso and Krillo (2011). They showed in their comparative study how wages were reduced in all the Baltic countries, how wage inequality increased and they also touched on some other forms of labour market flexibility, like flows between labour market states and job flows. Among other things they concluded that if economic downfall is so deep then it seems to be the case that it is not possible to adjust labour market only through the employment cuts but also wage cuts are inevitable. They also concluded that labour markets in all three Baltic countries are very flexible. This paper tries to summarise findings from literature and provide our own concept on how to measure labour market flexibility. Even if some measures on the macro level show rigidity of the labour market, on the micro level we can observe a lot of mobility, both on jobs' and employees' level. Also we will use more recent data, showing Estonian labour market situation after crisis in 2010. Some research about institutional changes in labour market and their labour market outcomes were launched in recent years, but these reports are only in Estonian. In this paper we will briefly introduce their results to the international audience. The paper is organised as follows: in the first section, the changes in unemployment and the role of labour market institutions are discussed; thereafter, the main features of labour policy, labour market reform and trade union’s situation are presented. The second part of the paper will focus on different aspects of the labour market flexibility and the final section summarises the main findings.",9

In recent years, international mobility of students in higher education has increased substantially and further growth is expected. This raises the question how the international flows of students will affect economic growth in general and in particular in those countries that either receive or send many students. The aim of this paper is to develop an endogenous growth model that incorporates the international mobility of students and to calibrate the model to investigate potential growth effects of internationalisation in higher education. We do this by building a two-country model, in which a fraction of the students in higher education studies abroad, around the human capital accumulation equation from Lucas (1988). We assume that the host country pays the direct costs of the university. Based on the literature we look for plausible values for the parameters in the model and the uncertainty in these estimates. Based on this we simulate potential growth profiles for countries that send or receive students. Our main findings are that total growth of both countries together always increases in steady state. Countries that receive a large group of foreign students who stay after their study will have a larger than average steady state growth rate. At the same time countries that receive a net surplus of students face an immediate negative shock in income when internationalisation increases. Receiving a large share of international students, thus, leads to a lower income at first but will benefit the country in the long run. This payback period is shorter if the fraction of foreign students that stay is larger. An international labour market that easily adopts home-educated foreign students therefore complements access for international students to the universities. The question how internationalisation in higher education affects economic growth has important policy implications in the debate about the European market for higher education. While in countries like Australia, the US and the UK foreign students pay a fee that covers the costs of higher education, this is not true for European students that want to study in another European country. The Bologna agreement has created a common market for higher education in Europe comparable to the common market that already exists in the Anglo-Saxon World. There is, however, one main difference between the two models. Whereas in Anglo-Saxon countries tuition fees differ between locals/nationals and foreigners (in the US they even differ between in-state and out-of-state students and in addition between US and foreign students), this difference does not exist in Europe. Freedom of settlement in Europe implies that all European students must be treated the same and hence pay the same tuition fees as domestic students. For the Netherlands, for example, this implies that all European students pay the Dutch tuition fee of about 1.800 per year. For Germany this means that all European students can study for free at a number of German universities. Governments are therefore confronted with the question whether they should promote the inflow of foreign European students or should make it less attractive for foreign European students to study in their country, and perhaps encourage their own students to study abroad. This paper is related to literature about the returns to education and endogenous growth. Economists have been capturing the effect of education on economic growth into a series of growth models, which go back to the Solow growth model. These models manage to capture a broad range of the features associated with education, such as positive externalities and opportunity costs included in Lucas (1988) or the necessary monetary investment in Mankiw et al. (1992). Research shows that an investment in education is a profitable investment: in his overview of empirical research McMahon (2004) finds that the private rate of return on education is around 10 percent while the social rate of return is around 17 percent for OECD countries. Empirical evidence confirms the positive effect of education on economic growth. The key driver of this relation is the positive relation between education and productivity. The paper also relates to the literature on student mobility. Existing endogenous growth models assume that graduates stay in the country after finishing their studies. But with increasing globalisation and increasing (student) mobility, graduates do not automatically stay in the country in which they have been educated. This does not only hold for European students: in particular the BRIC countries have been very active in changing the brain drain into a brain gain by attracting natives who have been educated abroad, back to their home-country. On the other hand, part of the international student population is expected to stay in the host country. This changes human capital as well as the labour force in a given country and consequently leads to interesting growth effects. What happens when the net flow of students for a country is negative? Do all countries benefit from educational globalisation? These questions can be answered from the analysis of this paper. Similarly, countries subsidising many foreign students query whether the expected benefits exceed the cost of providing the education. With many students able to move to their desired place of study, educational protectionism could soon be a matter of debate. We focus on the relation between educating foreign students and economic growth and take two specifics of international education into account: first the costs that are involved if graduates leave the country after graduation and second the mobility of graduates. The analysis in this paper are based on the assumption that studying abroad may benefit some students. This could be either because the quality of universities in another country is better in general, or because the match between student and university may improve. Internationalization could also enhance economic productivity because of the cultural experience that students obtain in foreign education as argued by Menchtenberg and Strausz (2008): “The development of multi-cultural skills are seen as indispensable in a European Union that strives for full economic integration while preserving the diversity of its cultures” (Mechtenberg and Strausz, p. 110). Alternatively, international education might also increase cultural intelligence. We contribute to this literature by showing the relevance of the added value of international education for economic growth. In addition we take both the sending and the receiving country into account and discuss the relation between internationalisation of education and internationalisation of the labour market via migration. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the model. In section 3 we discuss the parameter values that we use to simulate the model. The results of the simulation are presented in section 3.2. Section 4 concludes.",7
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,04 March 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-2-2,Underreporting of earnings and the minimum wage spike,December 2013,Mirco Tonin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At what level to fix the minimum wage is a recurrent, and very often contentious, labour market policy issue in many countries. More fundamentally, in some countries like Germany there is currently a lively debate on whether or not to have a general statutory minimum wage. The degree of controversy surrounding decisions on minimum wage policy is not surprising, as they hinge on a complex balance between competing arguments. The minimum wage has implications both in terms of efficiency and equity, for the labour market and beyond, as a minimum wage may significantly affect prices and profits and thus consumption and investment patterns1. In this paper I contribute to the debate on minimum wage policy by highlighting one aspect that has been largely overlooked, namely its role in enforcing compliance with fiscal rules in economies where underreporting of earnings is widespread. I start with a very simple observation: consider that in 2006 the minimum wage was 30% of the average wage in Romania and 38% in the UK. In the same year, more than 8% of Romanian full‐time employees earned the minimum wage, while the figure for the UK was a much lower 1.8%.2 Why such a big difference? Does this imply that the shape of the productivity distribution in the two countries is very different? Or that other institutions, like unemployment benefits, compress the wage distribution much more in the UK than in Romania? What I claim in this paper is that the difference in the size of the spike at the minimum wage level between Romania and the UK is actually related to the different incidence of so called “envelope wages”, i.e. cash payments unreported to tax or social security authorities. Indeed, in the same period, 23% of Romanian employees admitted having been paid “cash‐in‐hand” by their employer, while the figure for the UK was just 1%. To corroborate this claim, I will first introduce a labour market model with underreporting of earnings, where a spike at the minimum wage level emerges as a result of the optimal reporting behaviour by firms and workers. In particular, what I show in the model is that for a given level of the minimum wage, a looser enforcement of fiscal regulation is associated with a bigger spike and, quite naturally, with higher underreporting of earnings. Thus, a positive correlation between the spike at the minimum wage level and the extent of underreporting in the economy emerges through their common dependence on enforcement. I will then present a novel empirical observation: controlling for the minimum wage level, there is indeed a positive correlation within European labour markets between the proportion of full‐time employees with earnings on the minimum wage and various measures of informality, like the percentage of employees receiving envelope wages. This has important policy implications that will be discussed in the conclusions. The relevance of this aspect of minimum wage policy is due to the fact that underreporting of earnings is a serious issue in many countries3. In 2007 the European Commission conducted a survey on undeclared work using a representative sample of individuals in the European Union (European Commission 2007). In that survey, 5% of all dependent employees admitted having received all or part of their salary as envelope or cash‐in‐hand wages within the past 12 months. There is a considerable heterogeneity within the EU, with underreporting of earnings being particularly relevant in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania is the country with the highest incidence of envelope wages, with 23% of employees having received them in the last year. Latvia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Lithuania follow, all with a double digit share, while Estonia and Hungary position themselves just below, with cash‐in‐hand paid to 8% of employees. On the other hand, the phenomenon is virtually non existent in Germany, France, Luxembourg, Malta and the United Kingdom, with a marginal share of 1% of dependent employees receiving envelope wages. The phenomenon is of course present also outside the EU. For instance, in Ukraine a survey involving 600 households found that 30% of formal employees interviewed received part of their wage cash‐in‐hand (Williams2007), while in Russia, 8% of employees reported that they received part of their income “under the table” (Petrova2005). Also regarding Russia, Gorodnichenko et al. (2009) study the impact of the flat tax reform of 2001 on tax evasion and find a large response by households. They motivate their methodology based on the consumption‐income gap by the fact that for Russia “tax evasion was widespread, with employees quite likely practising as much tax evasion as the self‐employed.” In Turkey, firms belonging to the formal sector are estimated to underreport 28% of their wage bill (World Bank2006), and in Argentina, “roughly 15 percent of workers receive pay partly on the books and partly off the books” (World Bank2007). In its Eastern Europe and Central Asia Enterprise Survey in 2005, the World Bank asked firms to estimate what percentage of the actual wage bill the typical firm in their area of business reports for tax purposes. Private firms estimated underreporting to be above 15% in Albania, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Russia, and Turkey. More directly linked to the minimum wage, a World Bank study on labour markets in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union (World Bank2005) notices how in several countries in the region “disproportionately high shares of workers cluster on declared wages at or just above the minimum wage (with evidence of additional undeclared incomes above the minimum)” and a report to the European Commission (European Commission2004) underlines how “[c]haracterising the forms of informal economy in the CEE countries, special attention should be paid to the wide‐spread practice of “envelope wages”, where only the minimum wage is officially declared and an additional part is paid as cash in an envelope.” Despite this evidence, the literature on minimum wage and informality has focused mostly on Latin America4. The main issue in Latin America is the existence of a large informal sector where employees generally lack basic social or legal protections or employment benefits and the minimum wage legislation is not implemented. The literature usually looks at the impact of the minimum wage on the informal sector. For instance, Maloney and Nunez (2004) find that the minimum wage has an influence in the informal sector wage distribution in virtually all the countries they examine and, in some countries (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Uruguay), the influence of the minimum wage seems far stronger on the informal sector than the formal. More recently, Lemos (2009) uses Brazilian data and finds a wage compression effect for both the formal and informal sectors, but no evidence of employment effects in either sector. However, Bosch and Manacorda (2010) find no significant effect of the minimum wage on informal workers’ earnings in Mexico. To identify evasion costs associated with non‐wage compensation and minimum wages, McIntyre (2009) develops and estimates on Brazilian data a model where workers can choose between legal or illegal employment, where legality is defined as abiding by the minimum wage and participating in a set of payroll taxes and mandated non‐wage benefits. He shows how enforcement of a minimum wage law creates a clump of illegal workers at the minimum wage. The view of informality that I use here, and that better fits the European experience, is instead one where there is also an “intensive margin” to the compliance decision, where firms and workers operating in the formal economy may decide to partially underreport earnings to avoid paying taxes and social security contributions. From a modelling perspective, it is worth noticing how, in a standard competitive labour market, there should be no spike at the minimum wage level, as “workers whose services are worth less than the minimum wage are discharged” (Stigler1946), and the wage distribution should be truncated. In other models, a spike could appear because, for instance, of adjustments in working conditions (De Fraja1999) or training (Acemoglu and Pischke2003), or because of frictions in the labour market (Manning2003; Flinn2006). This paper provides support for a different mechanism explaining the presence of a spike even in a competitive labour market, based on the role of the minimum wage in the enforcement of fiscal regulation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next section briefly presents the model, while Section 3 shows the relationship between the spike and underreporting within European labour markets. The last section concludes by discussing policy implications.",4

3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,30 December 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-3-24,"Testing the tunnel effect: comparison, age and happiness in UK and German panels",December 2014,Felix R FitzRoy,Michael A Nolan,David Ulph,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Among the most important results in happiness research, which help to explain the Easterlin Paradox of flat or declining average life satisfaction over time in the US and other advanced economies, are the strong negative effects of comparison with peer-group income found in many different contexts, but particularly for life satisfaction in Germany and the US.1 However, as Hirschman and Rothschild (1973) observed, just before the seminal paper on subjective well-being by Easterlin (1974), comparison with a relevant reference group could have two very different effects. First, the role of status based on comparison, which had already been emphasised by classical economists such as Smith and Mill and by Veblen (1899), and more recently by sociologists as ‘relative deprivation’ (Runciman 1966), refers to evaluation of one’s own current situation compared to the relevant reference group. However, Hirschman and Rothschild (1973) argued that in the context of economic development and resulting inequality combined with rapid growth, comparison could also indicate one’s own future prospects. Thus a higher peer-group income in this context might be perceived as only a temporary setback, but also as an indicator of better future prospects for more rapid advancement to catch up with peers, which they denoted ‘the tunnel effect’, with an inherently ambiguous net result on current subjective well-being. While such effects in developing countries are plausible, there is also a natural asymmetry in likely response to relative income across age groups, which has received much less attention. Young individuals everywhere are obviously more mobile and likely to see peer success as an indication of their own future prospects (and perhaps be motivated towards a greater effort to catch up) than less flexible, older people. The careers of the latter group are fully determined at the latest by retirement, so expectations lose relevance and current perceptions of relative status should dominate. This plausible asymmetry suggests it may be wise to estimate the effects of relative income separately for younger and older sub-samples. So here we generalise earlier cross sectional results, which reported the first estimates for different age groups2, and use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to estimate life-satisfaction separately for sub-samples of individuals under and over 45 as well as for the complete samples with all ages. We control for the time spent in the panels and for age with age-group dummies and find a number of new results which differ from the previous literature. In a first step, we estimate a pooled OLS model and find a negative comparison effect for the whole sample in West Germany, which is in line with the previous literature. However, the story changes if we run separate regressions by age groups. For individuals younger than 45, we find a positive significant effect of comparison income, while the effect for the older group is negative. This confirms our previous cross-section results (FitzRoy et al. 2011a, 2011b). Second, we run estimations with individual fixed effects to take into account unobserved heterogeneity (Frijters and Beatton, 2012). Here we do not find any significant effect of comparison income in the full SOEP sample. Most importantly, we again find a positive significant effect of comparison income for those under 45 as well as the usual negative significant effect for the older group in West Germany. Comparison and own income coefficients have similar magnitudes, as in the US (Layard et al., 2010). Thirdly, interacting age intervals with reference income yields a similar declining – from positive to negative – effect on happiness with age. This is in keeping with the findings of Akay and Martinsson (2012), who combine East and West German data (and report similar effects from an experimental survey in Sweden). For East Germany, we find that comparison income effects for the complete sample and the sub-samples are close to zero, and other coefficients also differ. We also obtain similar positive and negative comparison income results for the two age groups in the UK (using the BHPS), which appear to be new. Here the comparison effect is negative for the complete sample, both for pooled OLS and for fixed effects. Comparison income interaction with age intervals generates a similar – albeit less clearly defined – pattern to West Germany. We find comparison effects for both age groups to be several times larger than very small (though highly significant) own-income effects in the UK. Already small, own income effects decline with age in the UK, in contrast to both German regions. Thus fundamental results of happiness research change dramatically after disaggregating by age: the seemingly robust negative effect of reference income turns positive in younger sub-samples in West Germany and the UK (a result which is consistent with Hirschman and Rothschild’s (1973) pioneering analysis, though not directly predicted by them) but remains strongly negative for older individuals. Moreover, comparison income has no effect in the full sample in both parts of Germany (and is actually insignificant in both age groups with fixed effects in East Germany). We have also formalised some ideas about the links between age, comparison income and life satisfaction in a simple 2-period, life-cycle model with uncertainty (see Appendix A3). Depending on parameters, some members of the younger cohort may find that currently higher comparison income can signal either higher or lower expected lifetime relative income and, hence, expected life satisfaction. In the second period, realised relative incomes have the usual effect. This is not a general model of relative income since we do not consider optimizing responses to information and other issues and focus on exogenous shocks to the labour market. Also, it does not predict all our results, but it does capture one novel result of the empirical analysis, namely the possibly positive (signalling) effect of higher comparison income on some members of a young cohort’s expected well-being, an effect which is lost under the usual aggregation of age groups. The plan of the paper is to provide a brief review of other tests of the signalling or tunnel hypothesis in Section 2. In Section 3 we discuss the econometric specification and present empirical results for Germany and the UK. We discuss robustness tests in Section 4. The paper ends with policy conclusions in Section 5. The life-cycle model is in the Appendix.",20
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,12 December 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-3-23,When supply meets demand: wage inequality in Portugal,December 2014,Mário Centeno,Álvaro A Novo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The debate over the level and trends in wage inequality in developed economies has evolved around a continental divide. In the 80s and 90s, inequality was high and increasing in Anglo-Saxon countries (Autor et al. 2008; Card and Lemieux 2001), while it remained stable in Continental Europe. Recently, this view has been challenged, with a reassessment of inequality developments in some European countries, in particular in Germany (Dustmann et al. 2009). The more recent evidence points to a significant increase in inequality in Europe (OECD 2011). We contribute to this debate and stress the key role of supply and demand factors to explain wage inequality in Portugal. Using a supply, demand, and institutions framework, we study the determinants of inequality in the period from 1984 to 2009. Portugal is frequently depicted as a highly regulated labor market in which institutions promote rigid wage and employment adjustments. We challenge this view and show that demand factors – skill-biased technological change and polarization – and supply factors – the large increase in skill supply – have shaped the changes in inequality. We uncover a low elasticity of substitution between high- and low-skill workers that also helps in explaining the large skill wage premium. Demand and supply conditions have changed quite substantially in Portugal, making it an interesting case to trace the sources for wage inequality in labor market forces. In addition, the institutional framework of the Portuguese labor market – collective bargaining, minimum wage, and employment protection – were already in place before 1984. Using data from Quadros de Pessoal – a comprehensive employer-employee matched dataset of private sector employment – we find a continuous increase in overall inequality from 1984 to 2009. Throughout the 80s and until the mid-90s, wage inequality increased steeply at both ends of the wage distribution. The supply of skills remained quite low during the first period, but a large shift occurred during the 90s, with the share of college graduates almost tripling, from 5% to 14%. Wage inequality fell at the lower-tail and slowed down at the upper-tail. A counterfactual analysis suggests that the main contribution to the increase in inequality in the initial period was the result of demand factors, generating positive price effects, while mild composition effects also pushed inequality up. In the second period, there are negative price effects (contributing to a reduction in inequality), offset by positive composition effects (that pushed inequality up). A simple demand and supply model explains about 80% of the wage premium variation (Katz and Murphy 1992). The educational supply shifts were reinforced by an increase in female participation and immigration, which are groups with educational attainment above the average. In addition, the demand for skills was fueled by European Community accession (1986), euro membership (1998) and large FDI flows. The extraordinary increase in the supply of skills generated divergent paths for the college wage gap by experience group. This shift has compressed the college wage premium for less experienced individuals since the early 90s. For more experienced workers (20 or more years of work), the college wage premium increased steadily, and has only flattened out recently. The different trends in college supply by experience group explain 82% of the increase in the gap of the college wage premium between younger and older workers. Wage inequality in Portugal seems to be the result of a race between education and technology. In the first part of the sample, technology wins over education, while more recently education picks up with the pace of the demand for skills. The Portuguese experience resembles the evolution of inequality in the U.S. Both have a low elasticity of substitution between high and low skills, implying a strong reaction of the wage skill premium to relative supply conditions. They also share negative price effects in the more recent period associated with the reduction in lower-tail inequality (minimum wage developments). Previous studies of wage inequality in Portugal include Cardoso (1998), Machado and Mata (2001), Martins and Pereira (2004), Cardoso (2004) and Machado and Mata (2005). These studies cover only the first half of our sample. Machado and Mata (2005) extend the analysis with counterfactual price and composition effects, using a quantile regression decomposition method. For the overlapping period, the wage premium estimates reported in these studies are in line with the ones we obtain. The ability of simple supply and demand models to explain wage inequality in Portugal and the similarities with the results obtained for the U.S. provide relevant lessons for the design of policies – such as the minimum wage and education – to tackle the growing wage inequality in Europe. The scope for general redistributive policies should be evaluated in conjunction with the role played by two important market factors: the supply of education and the demand for skills.",17

3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,10 November 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-3-21,Low-wage employment versus unemployment: Which one provides better prospects for women?,December 2014,Alexander Mosthaf,Thorsten Schank,Claus Schnabel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In many European countries, low-wage employment has become a more and more important characteristic of the labor market and a controversial topic for debate, in particular since a disproportionate share of low-wage earners are women (European Commission 2004). It is an open and highly disputed question how the prominence of low-wage work is to be interpreted and whether low-paid work is beneficial to individuals or society. The answer to this question crucially depends on whether low-wage jobs are mainly transitory and serve as stepping stones to higher paid jobs or whether they tend to become persistent or even result in (repeated) unemployment. More specifically, is it better to take up a low-wage job or remain unemployed and wait for a better job offer? On the one hand, accepting low-quality jobs avoids scarring effects of unemployment, and these jobs may serve as stepping stones into high-quality jobs. In other words: taking up an interim job may be better than having no job at all (McCormick 1990). On the other hand, individuals could be trapped in low-quality jobs or driven into repeated unemployment for various reasons. For instance, employers may interpret bad jobs in an individual’s employment history as indicators of low future productivity (McCormick 1990). Similarly, accumulation of human capital in low-quality jobs is limited (Dickens and Lang 1985) and probably not much higher than during unemployment - in particular when unemployed persons receive training measures. Furthermore, transaction costs complicate job mobility. If costs of search differ between employment states (Burdett 1978), on-the-job-search is likely to be less effective than search during unemployment. Knowing the consequences and future employment prospects of taking up a low-wage job is not only important for (unemployed) individuals but also for government when designing labor market institutions and policies. There are a number of labor market policies that may hinder or force unemployed individuals to accept sub-optimal job offers and low-paid work. While unemployment benefits provide a search subsidy for finding a good job match (Acemoglu 2001; Burdett 1979; Marimon and Zilibotti 1999), sanctions on rejections of job offers may drive unemployed persons into low-quality jobs (Van den Berg and Vikström 2014). Moreover, unemployed individuals are often subsidized by government when taking up a low-wage job, and many individuals in subsidized jobs earn low wages (Stephan 2010). Whether these policies are helpful depends very much on the prospects of low-wage earners (compared to unemployed persons) and on their transitions out of the low-wage sector. In order to answer these questions, the labor market dynamics of low-paid and unemployed individuals must be investigated. Here, it should be taken into account that current labor market outcomes may affect future employment prospects, a phenomenon called (true) state dependence (Heckman 1981a). The experience of a low-wage job may alter prices, preferences or constraints and therefore have a genuine effect on the probability of being high-paid or unemployed in future periods. As explained earlier, this could be due to low human capital accumulation, signalling effects or transaction costs. Furthermore, individual characteristics (as well as labor market conditions) determine the probability of the experience of labor market states. If this individual-specific heterogeneity is correlated over time it may lead to persistence in low-pay (and spurious state dependence). If this is not controlled for in the econometric analysis, the estimated effect of a low-wage job on future labor market prospects will be biased. In recent years, state dependence regarding labor market transitions between low-wage employment, high-wage employment and unemployment has been analyzed by Stewart (2007) for the UK and by Buddelmeyer et al. (2010) for Australia, using panel data models with lagged dependent variables. While Stewart (2007) finds that low-wage earners incur the same unemployment risk as unemployed persons, Buddelmeyer et al. (2010) show that low-wage employment is associated for men with weak, but for women with considerable scarring effects. Clark and Kanellopoulos (2013) find positive, statistically significant state dependence in low pay for male workers in each of the twelve European countries under inverstigation. Uhlendorff (2006) analyzes German SOEP-data and shows that for men low-wage jobs are stepping stones to high-paid jobs. Also using SOEP-data, Knabe and Plum (2013) analyze labor market transitions of women and men and find that taking up a low-paid job is especially appropriate for less-skilled persons and those with longer unemployment durations. The former result has also been found by Mosthaf (2014) with German administrative data for men working full-time. A second strand of the literature has investigated the determinants of labor market transitions using multivariate probit models (without lagged dependent variables). For men in Britain, Capellari and Jenkins (2008) find that the entry into low-wage employment is more probable for singles, young individuals and those with low qualification, whereas the probability of becoming unemployed is higher for singles and individuals with bad health. Capellari (2007) studies transitions of low-wage earners in Italy and concludes that becoming low-paid strongly increases the probability of being in the low-wage sector in the future. The transition into high-wage employment is affected by region, industry and firm size. Schank et al. (2009) find that in Germany upward mobility is lower for women, for older workers and in small establishments. According to the results of Aretz and Gürtzgen (2012), genuine state dependence in low-pay has increased in Germany since the beginning of the nineties. In this paper, we apply a dynamic multinomial logit model to investigate state dependence of low-wage employment, thereby analyzing the unemployment risk and the upward mobility of low-wage earners. We focus on the labor market dynamics of women in western Germany between 1999 and 2009. The probability to get a low-paid job is much higher for women (32.4%) than for men (16.7%) (Rhein 2013). In addition, their chance of moving from a low-paid to a high paid job is significantly lower (Schank et al. 2009). In contrast to men, women are more involved in household production and thus more often inactive on the labor market such that we need to take unemployment and inactivity separately into account. In addition, women are much more likely to work part-time than men. In 2008, almost every second woman in Germany worked part-time, but only one out of ten men (Brenke 2011)1. If working part-time is associated with occupational downgrading (see Connolly and Gregory 2008; Manning and Petrongolo 2008; Prowse 2006), it is entirely possible that state dependence differs between low-wage earners working full-time and those working part-time. For Germany, evidence for segregation of part-timers in occupations with lower human capital accumulation is found by Nelen (2012). Therefore, it seems important to take the heterogenous labor supply of women into account. In contrast to previous studies on wage mobility, we thus distinguish between part-time employment and full-time employment as well as between unemployment and inactivity. In total, we consider six states, namely high-wage employment (part-time and full-time), low-wage employment (part-time and full-time), unemployment and inactivity2. Furthermore, the distinction between both working-time regimes also allows us to contribute to another strand of the literature which investigates whether part-time jobs can be seen as stepping stones out of inactivity into full-time employment. Evidence in favor of this hypothesis is found by Fok et al. (2013) for Australia and Prowse (2012) for the UK3. Haan (2010) estimates state dependence in labor supply using German SOEP data and also finds that state dependence with respect to full-time employment is smaller in part-time employment than in inactivity. None of these studies has distinguished between high-wage and low-wage employment. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and descriptive statistics. Section 3 discusses the empirical specification. Section 4 presents the results and section 5 concludes.",12

The preamble to this budget summarized the state of Dutch economy in rosy words. Sovereign debt was at its lowest point since WW II and was expected to decline further. For many years, the Dutch unemployment rate was among the lowest in Europe, while GDP per capita was among the highest. The prospects for further growth of the economy were good. The Dutch government had little to worry about, so it seemed. As we know now, history has proven otherwise. The demise of Lehman has pushed the world economy in a deep recession, of which it is still trying to recover. The subsequent euro-crisis has reinforced the problems. Many European countries are now struggling to get their economy growing and their deficit under control. However, there are striking differences within Europe. The GIPSI countries with limited access to financial markets face massive losses in GDP. The Netherlands does not have problems to finance its sovereign debt. Nevertheless, its economy lost 6% output relative to Germany between 2008 and 2014. This paper offers an explanation for this phenomenon, which provides broader lessons for the mechanisms at work in economies hit by a financial crisis. Since financing its public debt was not immediately at risk, the Netherlands is an ideal laboratory for these mechanisms. These lessons might then be helpful in avoiding financial stress in the first place and for the proper design of the European framework for budgetary oversight in the second place. The key factor for understanding the underperformance of the Dutch economy is the interaction between fiscal policy and a house price slump. The pressure on house prices had three causes. The first cause is the fall in GDP relative to its pre-crisis trend. Cerra and Saxena (2008) and Teulings and Zubanov (2013) have shown that the fall in output after a financial crisis is largely permanent, in the order of magnitude of 5 to 10% of GDP. Hence, consumers loose life time wealth and therefore have to reduce their consumption of housing services. The second cause is the stress in the banking system due to financial crisis. This reduces their willingness to provide credit for buying houses. However, both causes have affected Germany and The Netherlands alike, and hence they cannot by themselves explain the difference in performance between both countries. A third factor was specific to the Netherlands. The country ran an extremely generous system of tax deductibility of mortgage interest rates, costing about 2 to 3% of GDP in terms of lower tax revenues. This system has been perceived as unsustainable by organisations like IMF, OECD, and EU, but more importantly, also by the Dutch public. When the crisis hit, the system lost its credibility. These factors lead to a fall in house prices, which will be shown to be equivalent to a transfer of wealth from current to future generations. The former lose, since they get a lower price for their property. The latter gain since they have to pay less. This wealth transfer tightens the lifetime budget constraint of the current generation. In response to this, they reduce their consumption to compensate these losses. Only as current generations gradually die, having solved their financial stress by lowering consumption, and are replaced by new generations that have not experienced a loss of wealth, consumption will pick up again. During this transition, reduced consumption has a profound effect on the distribution of employment between industries. In a small open economy, the main option for a country to save is to export to other countries. Hence, employment in the export industry has to grow while the domestic sector and construction have to shrink. Relocation of employment between industries is costly. Workers have specific human capital for a particular industry. Small reallocations of labour between industries can be accommodated by incumbent workers retiring and new cohorts choosing to work in different industries. However, this mechanism is too slow for large shifts in demand. Then, incumbent workers have to change industries. This requires retraining of workers who have already acquired their industry specific human capital. The old human capital has to be written off. The larger is the fall in consumption, the greater is the shift in employment, and hence, the larger the value of human capital to which this applies. There has been a lot of discussion on the role of institutions for the persistence of unemployment. Minimum wages hamper the creation of new vacancies. Employment protection legislation frustrates the reallocation of labour to more productive ventures. Unemployment benefits undermine the incentives for wage adjustment in the previous job, for seeking a new job, and for acquiring new human capital. Wage rigidity forces firms in declining industries to fire workers instead of being able to compete at lower cost. The current model sees no role for the first two factors and some role for the final two, Countries with generous unemployment benefits will find workers accepting lay off more easily and finding a new job more slowly. Countries with lack of wage flexibility will find firms laying off workers more easily. However, we shall show that a proper fiscal policy can avoid a part of the reallocation of labour in the first place. The actual magnitude of the fall in consumption depends on fiscal policy. If fiscal policy is contractionary in the transition period, this will further increase the share of burden of the financial crisis that is put on the shoulders of current generations. They will reduce their consumption even further, requiring an even larger shift of employment to the export industry. Instead, the government can provide intergenerational insurance by adopting an offsetting expansionary fiscal policy, shifting part of the burden of adjustment to future generations. Lack of intergenerational insurance will lead to overshooting in the reallocation of labour between industries and will therefore increase the loss in specific human capital. Dutch fiscal policy was indeed highly contractionary from 2011 onwards. A badly understood feature of policy reforms reducing the tax deductibility of mortgage interest is that these reforms imply a transfer of wealth from current to future generations. Even a balanced budget reform, which ploughs back all extra tax revenues from lower interest deductibility by lower tax rates, still leads to a wealth transfer. Current house prices reflect the net discounted value of the entitlement to future deductibility. For future generations, the system is a wash. They pay higher house prices in exchange for the entitlement to tax deductibility. Likewise, the abolishment of the system is a wash: the net discounted value of lower deductibility cancels against higher house prices. Hence, the current generation bears the full loss of the net discounted value of deductibility. Offsetting this intergenerational transfer of wealth would require the government to increase its debt, by pre-emptively reducing tax rates. If not, the fall in house prices induced by the reform of the system contributes to the fall in current consumption. This reasoning sounds Keynesian in nature. Remarkably, it does not require much wage- or price-stickiness. It is not John Maynard Keynes’ consumption function, but Milton Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis that runs the show. All problems are due to a missing intergenerational insurance markets, or more precisely, the unwillingness of European politicians to provide this insurance. Similar mechanisms have played in other European countries experiencing slumps on the housing market. Some of these countries (like Spain and Ireland) lived above their means, as shown by deficits on their current account. The Netherlands is a special case. The country has a large surplus on its current account but nevertheless faces a house price slump and a budget deficit exceeding EU’s 3% threshold (Denmark was the only country in a comparable situation). Nevertheless, our analysis offers a number of broader lessons. The three main lessons are summarized here. First, a surge in sovereign debt is a natural consequence of a house-price slump. Attempting to stop the rise in sovereign debt actually makes things worse. Secondly, this rise is not a short run phenomenon. The periodicity of intergenerational effects implies that an episode of rising debt may last 10 years or more. Thirdly, the output gap and the structural balance are not useful indicators of the structural situation of public finance, since they insufficiently account for the long run effects. The setup of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides some empirical background for the discussion, both on the situation of the Dutch economy and on some broader issues. Section 3 describes the theoretical framework. It deserves more rigorous numerical testing. For the moment, this remains an exercise for future research. Section 4 discusses the adjustment path of this economy to a shock of the type that hit the Dutch economy. Section 5 discusses some caveats and compares the Dutch experience to other countries. Finally, Section 6 draws conclusions.",3

Since 1975, a series of directives have broadened the principle of equality between men and women to cover working conditions, training and promotion, social security, access to goods and services, maternity protection and parental leave. In 1997, the Amsterdam Treaty enabled the gender dimension to be integrated into all Community policies and established the principle of equal treatment as a fundamental right. Since then, the Member States have introduced different policies and activities fighting gender inequalities1. As a matter of fact, the female participation rate in Europe has increased from around 55% in the early 1990s to more than 66% in 2008. In the same period, female employment rate has moved in the same direction, by increasing from 49% to 61%. This steady improvement in women labour market position has led to a significant decline in the gender employment gap, which has nearly halved since 1990, from more than 25% to almost 14% in 20082. The extent to which reforms and labour market institutions have contributed to such a pattern is at the forefront of the political debate. Although there is a variety of studies looking at this issue from different perspectives, the available evidence is still inconclusive (see Costa, 2000 and Del Boca and Locatelli, 2006 for recent reviews). These patterns could be driven by changes in cultural attitudes towards work especially in countries where participation is traditionally lower3. Changes in the characteristics of the female population such as fertility decisions, elderly care responsibilities4, educational choices5 and demographic changes6 could also have impacted these patterns. Most of the studies looking at the evolution of the employment (or wage) gender gap over time using individual data focus on a single country only, thus failing to capture important differences across European countries characterized by different welfare structures and cultural attitudes towards female labour market participation. Conversely, cross-country comparisons using aggregate data typically fail to distinguish compositional effects (i.e. those arising from changes in the socio- demographic characteristics of men and women over time) and to capture the varying responsiveness of women with different individual characteristics to changes in the institutional setting (Jaumotte 2003; Genre et al. 2010). In this paper we combine the micro and macro approaches into a unified empirical design, by investigating the changes in female participation patterns across 15 EU countries over the last 20 years using individual data from ECHP and EUSILC databases. There are two main contributions of our approach. First, we use individual data for an unusually large set of countries and for a long time period (twenty years). Second, we provide a quantification of the role of labour market institutional factors which is more precise than in previous studies. We begin with an exploratory analysis of the data where individual information is used to compute aggregate trends. Next, we use a regression analysis to understand whether the impact of individual characteristics on labour market participation varies across time and across countries with different welfare regimes. Finally, we further these results by exploiting a multi-level model specification to appreciate how institutional and policy factors affect the choice between unpaid family responsibility (child rearing and elderly care) and paid occupation for women in different age and education groups. Our findings point towards a strict interplay between individual characteristics and the institutional and policy setting, revealing a role of institutional factors that is stronger than what has so far been assessed. According to our results, the attitude to work of young women with children appears to be favoured by policies aimed at supporting family and by the expansion of flexible forms of employment (especially in terms of fixed term contracts) to the extent that such forms of employment are not perceived to be of low quality. Moreover, in line with the flexicurity approach (an integrated strategy to simultaneously enhance flexibility and security in the labour market), we find that labour market flexibility is associated with higher female participation only when it is accompanied by a certain degree of social security. We finally quantify the extent to which changes in the labour market behaviour of women with specific characteristics (e.g. young children) can be associated to changes in policies and institutions. Labour market reforms and changes of social policies predict almost 25% of the actual increase in labour force participation for young women, and more than 30% for highly educated women. However, labour market reforms appear less related to the observed labour market participation of low skilled women. This result is apparently in contrast with the existing empirical evidence which shows that less educated women (with a lower attachment to work) are more responsive to work incentives created by policy/institutional changes (Del Boca et al. 2009). Nevertheless, we argue that in many European countries, labour market reforms are associated with a deterioration of job quality, especially for low educated women, increasing the risk of dropping out from the labour force7. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the relevance of the institutional context in shaping female choices between unpaid family responsibility and paid occupation and define our research questions. Section 3 describes the data and summarizes the large quantity of micro-level information available for different European countries and across time using synthetic indicators of female labour market performance. Section 4 contains the results of a regression analysis of female involvement in the labour market across time and countries, whereas Section 5 analyses more closely the role of the labour market institutional framework and social policies. Section 6 concludes.",50

To ease financial pressures as well as to increase older workers’ labour force participation policy makers have been promoting the expansion of working lives finding measures that make postponed labour market exit attractive. This has been enforced through the elimination of mandatory retirement, the adoption of age discrimination legislation1 and/or increasing legal retirement age. Nonetheless, the effect of these measures on older workers’ labour supply is not straightforward. For instance, Shannon and Grierson (2004) show that making compulsory retirement illegal would have a small impact on the size of the older workforce and, for that reason, such a policy alone would not solve the problems associated with an ageing population and the consequent reduction in the share of the population employed, while Ashenfelter and Card (2002), studying the effect of the elimination of mandatory retirement at age 70 on faculty retirement patterns, conclude that such elimination decreased by approximately two thirds the retirement rates of 70 and 71 year olds. On the other hand, Adams (2004) suggests that age discrimination legislation increases employment among individuals that are in the legally protected age ranges and that there is a decline in retirement among the protected workers. Also, Neumark and Stock (1999) show that age discrimination laws lead to steeper age-earnings profiles in the labour market and that they strengthen the relationship between workers and firms, leading to the adoption of Lazear (1979) contracts. Furthermore, the authors find that age discrimination legislation increases the relative employment of older workers. Focusing on the labour demand implications of a change in the legal retirement age for women in Portugal, Martins et al. (2009) find that older women affected by the new law faced virtually no change in wages and working hours. There seems to be no unique and effective instrument to achieve a longer and higher participation of older individuals in the labour force. Making use of survival analysis techniques this paper brings another variable to the discussion on active ageing policies: it studies the impact of a reduction in hours of work before retirement on the age of exit from the labour force. Indeed, combining a reduction in working hours with increased leisure time at older ages may motivate individuals to work longer while gradually withdrawing from the labour market. As individuals age, their preference for work and leisure experience a change since older workers may get higher satisfaction from additional hours of leisure and less hours of work than younger workers. Also, due to health constraints or care obligations, as workers age they may want to reduce their hours of work. This change in the valuation of time implies a change in reservation wages over the life cycle, which influences the labour force participation decision.2 If workers could freely choose hours of work they would prefer to gradually reduce their time at work as they age (Gustman and Steinmeier 2004). Since the decision does not depend solely on the individual’s will, gradual retirement is not as common as workers would like it to be (Hutchens and Grace-Martin 2006). Although there is evidence for the United States that some workers engage in ‘part-time’ retirement by working fewer hours in the years prior to complete withdrawal from the labour force (Ruhm 1990; Burtless and Moffitt 1985; Gustman and Steinmeier 1984), most people move directly from full-time work to full-time retirement (Hutchens and Grace-Martin 2006). As Gielen (2009) notes, a discrete drop in hours of work is only observed at the time of retirement, not before. Given that most often workers face the choice of working full-time or no time (retirement), the constraint in hours of work may influence the labour force participation decision. In fact, there are broad indications suggesting that reduced hours of work would contribute to raise employment rates of older individuals. In the European Union, older workers are already over-represented in part-time employment and Member States, like Sweden, with higher shares of older workers in part-time employment tend to present higher employment rates for the 55-64 age group. However, part-time employment is not very common in the Portuguese labour market3 and, nevertheless, the economy shows high employment rates for older individuals. Despite the fact that flexibility in hours of work is perceived to be a relevant policy mechanism to increase older individuals’ labour force participation, few studies focused on its effect on labour supply. Among these, Gustman and Steinmeier (2004) show that working hours’ flexibility extends the working lives of older workers, but produces only a small net increase in labour supply. Gielen (2009) finds that, especially for full-time workers, over-employed older women (those reporting that they wish to work fewer hours than the actual hours of work) leave the labour force prematurely due to the absence of gradual retirement opportunities. Nonetheless, a striking finding is that flexibility in hours of work would result in a reduction of older workers’ labour supply since the increase in labour participation of older workers due to the extension of their working careers is cancelled out by a decline in working hours of over-employed older individuals. From a labour demand point of view, the work by Hutchens and Grace-Martin (2006) studies how and why establishments differ in their willingness to permit an older worker to take phased retirement. Phased retirement is perceived to be a way of encouraging older workers to extend their working lives. In this sense, workers reduce their working hours without changing employers (Hutchens and Papps 2005). The former authors conclude that employers are willing to permit phased retirement but primarily as an informal arrangement. Opportunities for phased retirement are greater in establishments that employ part-time workers, allow job sharing and have flexible starting times (this latter result is also obtained by Blau and Shvydko 2007). If flexibility in hours of work, as a means of gradual retirement, can effectively delay the exit from the labour force then workers who actually take advantage of such flexibility are expected to leave the labour market later in their lives. Overall, retirement decisions are influenced by individual characteristics, demographic factors, and financial incentives (Mitchell and Fields 1984; Dugan 1984; Belloni and Rob 2008), health conditions (Burtless and Quinn 2000; Bartel and Sicherman 1993; Hanoch and Honig 1983; Quinn 1977) and labour market constraints (Osberg 1993; Bartel and Sicherman 1993; Friedberg 2003; Dorn and Sousa-Poza 2009). This paper examines the influence of working hours’ reduction before retirement on the retirement decisions of older individuals and intends to provide an answer to the following questions: is the reduction in hours of work associated with retirement at later ages? Can it be used to extend older workers’ labour force participation and delay the complete withdraw from the labour force? We find that a voluntarily reduction of working hours is associated with exit from the labour market at earlier ages. The main contribution of this research is to explore the relevance of working hours’ reduction on the retirement behaviour of older individuals. No such study exists for Portugal and, hence, besides the novelty of this research for the Portuguese labour market it is also a new contribution to the incipient literature on the subject. Additionally, we take advantage of a recent and, to our knowledge, not yet used inquiry called “Transition to Retirement”, conducted simultaneously with the 2006 Portuguese Labour Force Survey. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides an overview of the major legislation changes on retirement benefits eligibility in Portugal. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the model and the empirical strategy. Results are shown in Section 5. A summary and discussion conclude the paper.",4

In particular, successive cohorts of immigrants from former Commonwealth colonies, especially in the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent, started arriving at the end of the 1940s (Hatton and Wheatley Price 2005). Many of these migrant workers took up positions in sectors experiencing labour shortages, such as transport, the National Health Service and other public services, and self-employment was also an important form of activity for some of the migrant groups (Clark and Drinkwater 1998). Over the last decade, however, the UK has also become one of the main destination countries for immigrants from various parts of Europe. For example, data on National Insurance Numbers issued to overseas nationals (NINos) indicate that there was a five-fold increase in the number of “new” immigrant workers arriving in the UK from European countries between 2002 and 2007, rising from around 103,000 to over 500,0001. As a result, the percentage of NINo registrations made by Europeans almost doubled, rising from 33 per cent to 63 per cent over this period2. Much of this increase can be explained by the migration that followed the enlargement of the European Union in May 2004, since the UK was one of only three member states at the time to open their border to migrant workers from the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe3. Although the number of NINo registrations made by Europeans has fallen since the start of the recession, it stood at 342,000 in 2010 and continued to account for over a half of the total NINo registrations made in the UK that year. In addition to the migration flows that have followed enlargement of the European Union, there have also been important changes over the last decade in policy in the UK towards immigrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In particular, the overall thrust of immigration policy in the UK since 2005 has been to restrict entry by non-EEA workers to skilled occupations. The main change was the introduction of the Points Based System (PBS), which began in 2008 to regulate inflows of immigrant workers from outside the EEA. The PBS consolidated in excess of 80 work and study routes into the UK, which included the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme and Work Permits, into five main tiers and replaced the previous system of immigration (Devitt 2012). These five tiers relate to highly skilled migrants, medium and highly skilled migrants with a job offer, quota based low-skilled schemes to fill temporary labour shortages, students and youth mobility and temporary workers. Changes have also occurred to two low-skilled schemes, which lie outside the PBS. These are the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) and the Sector Based Schemes (SBS). From 2008 these were targeted exclusively at Bulgarian and Romanian nationals allowing a quota of around 20,000 each year to enter the UK for up to six months to work in the agricultural sector. From 2014 the SAWS and SBS were closed to all workers. However, prior to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union in 2007, these schemes had been open to migrants from other countries and large numbers of Ukrainians, Belarusians and Moldovans were employed on them in the mid-2000 s4. For example, Salt (2009) reports that Ukrainians accounted for 33 per cent of the 16,127 workers on the SAWS and 38 per cent of the 3,586 workers on the SBS in 2006. In 2004, there were 2,258 workers from Belarus registered on the SAWS and more than 1,000 Moldovans were on the same scheme in each year between 2005 and 2007. Therefore, the changes in immigration policy that have occurred in the UK over the last decade are of particular importance to Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries because potential migrant workers to the UK from these countries are not able to benefit from the freedom of movement enjoyed by individuals from the European Union, including from the member states that joined in 2004 and neither can younger migrants from EaP countries now enter the UK on the SAWS or SBS. In addition to impacting on the size of migration flows from EaP countries, these policy changes are likely to have had an effect on the composition of migrant workers. For example, migration flows from EaP countries are likely to have become less dominated by the youngest age groups and biased more towards women and highly educated individuals. The changes in migration flows and in immigration policy should also be considered with reference to the UK’s economy, which was in a healthy position from 2000 up until 2007. This period produced average growth rates of 2.75 per cent per annum and annual unemployment rates of around 5 per cent. However, since the start of the global financial crisis in late 2007, the economy has deteriorated considerably. The UK was officially in recession in 2008 and 2009, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) falling by around 6 per cent (Gregg and Wadsworth 2010). As a result of the poor state of the economy, unemployment has increased and has hovered around 8 per cent in recent years. Very high levels of youth unemployment are a major concern (Blanchflower and Bell 2010), with the unemployment rate for 16 and 17 year olds at almost 40 per cent, and that for 18-24 year olds at 20 per cent. Given that immigrants are thought to compete with younger native-born workers for jobs and that employment levels amongst immigrants have continued to rise – while falling for the native-born (ONS 2012)–then public attitudes towards immigration in the UK tend to be quite negative. For example, Blinder (2011) reports evidence from cross-national survey data (Transatlantic Trends 2010) to suggest that people from the UK have more negative views towards immigrants than people from other Western countries. In particular, the percentage of respondents reporting that “there are too many immigrants” and “immigration is more a problem than an opportunity” was higher in the UK than it was in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United States. Furthermore, there is now a consistent opposition to immigration across all major political parties in the UK and the coalition government is committed to reducing net migration from hundreds of thousands to “tens of thousands”. In this paper we describe the migration flows and labour market outcomes of migrants from EaP countries and compare them with other groups of migrants and established workers. Both stocks and flows of EaP migrants are small relative to other immigrant groups and flows are found to be responsive to GDP growth, but have been mainly driven by changes in immigration policy. We find that while EaP migrants exhibit some similarities to the EUA8 migrant group, there are some important differences too, particularly in terms of human capital and employment outcomes. We note that EaP countries have high stocks of human capital in STEM-related subjects which are in demand in the UK, however in the absence of significant changes in immigration policy, future flows of EaP workers to the UK are predicted to remain small in magnitude. The paper is organised in the following manner. The next section contains a discussion of recent inflows of migrant workers from EaP countries to the UK, along with some information on the stocks of migrants from these countries. Subsequently the focus is on the demographic characteristics of migrants from EaP countries, mainly using the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The use of this dataset also enables similar information to be provided on comparison groups of migrants in the UK and the paper moves on to examine the labour market characteristics of the same groups that are analysed in the preceding section. Some concluding comments can then be found in the final section, especially in relation to policy implications.",6

The literature has mostly focused in two different but interrelated broad questions. First, how do immigrants perform in the host country? It is commonly observed that immigrants earn less upon arrival than comparable native workers but that this wage disadvantage tends to diminish as experience in the host economy increases (Borjas 1999). However, wage assimilation tends to differ across nationalities and, in some countries, the catching up is never complete. Second, what is the impact of immigration on natives’ wages and employment? In a competitive labour market, an increase in the supply of immigrant workers should result in a lower wage or higher unemployment of natives whose skills are substitute and impact positively the natives with complementary skills. However, empirically there is no consensus and, depending on the data and methodology, some studies found a negative and significant effect in native wages (Borjas 2003) but the majority of studies did not obtain a sizeable effect on employment and wages of natives (Ottaviano and Peri 2012). Assessing the effects of immigration on the labour market of the host country is a complex task. The specificities of immigrant workers in terms of their characteristics and behaviour - lower reservation wages, substitute/complementary skills, higher responsiveness to regional differences in employment opportunities - influence labour market efficiency, equilibrium unemployment and wage setting mechanisms. Focusing on the latter, we aim at contributing to the literature by comparing the extent of downward nominal and real wage rigidity for natives and immigrants in Portugal. With the increasing availability of large employer-employee databases, different approaches have emerged in the literature to estimate aggregate wage rigidities from micro data on individual wages. The International Wage Flexibility Project (IWFP) methodology applied in this paper is one of them. This methodology resulted from the combined effort of a large network studying wage rigidities from individual data of 16 OECD countries, so it has a strong potential of cross-country comparisons. After extensive testing of the different microeconomic approaches existing in the literature, the IWFP methodology was developed to simultaneously estimate the extent of nominal and real wage rigidity and account for measurement error. Evidence of rigidity is obtained by comparing the empirical distribution of wage changes to an estimated notional or counterfactual wage change distribution that would prevail in the absence of rigidity. The estimated measures of nominal and real wage rigidity capture the proportion of workers that received a (nominal or real) wage freeze but would have received a (nominal or real) wage cut under wage flexibility. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to use this microeconomic approach on wage rigidity differentiating workers by nationality. We did not find substantial differences between natives and immigrants in terms of wage rigidity, but the estimated measures tend to be higher for immigrants, in particular for real wage rigidity. This is associated with the impact of institutional-related rigidity given the higher proportion of immigrants earning the minimum wage. The article is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the potential differences between natives and immigrants in terms of wage rigidity. Section 3 presents the longitudinal database used and describes the main characteristics of immigrants relative to those of native workers. The IWFP methodology used in the estimation of wage rigidity is outlined in Section 4. Section 5 presents the empirical results, accounting for the heterogeneity of immigrants by main origins. Finally, Section 6 presents some concluding remarks.",

The success of such policies, however, relies on how responsive individuals are to changes in pension eligibility. In this paper we use longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to study the determinants of retirement decisions among European couples and how responsive each member of the couple is to their own eligibility to retirement pensions, as well as their partner’s eligibility induced retirement choice, after controlling for other factors that may affect their retirement decisions. Numerous studies have shown the importance of Social Security incentives for retirement decisions. The timing of retirement has been found to be in part determined by the incentives imbedded in the rules determining Social Security benefits, as well as employer-provided pension benefits (see Hurd 1990 and Lumsdaine and Mitchell 1999 for reviews). Likewise, other cross-national research published volumes edited by Gruber and Wise (1999, 2004) note that there is a strong negative correlation between labor force participation at older ages and the generosity of early retirement benefits. Finally, Coe and Zamarro (2011) find that official retirement ages in Europe are a strong predictor of retirement for men. However, these studies focused mostly on men and little is known about the determinants of women’s retirement decisions. Finally, this paper also contributes to the increasing literature that considers retirement as a decision concerning the couple, rather than the individual (Ruhm 1996; Gustman and Steinmeier 2000, 2004, 2009; Blau and Gilleskie et al. 2006; Coile 2004a, 2004b; Michaud 2003; Michaud and Vermeulen 2004; Casanova 2010; Stancanelli and van Soest 2012a, 2012b; Stancanelli 2012; Honoré and de Paula 2013), by providing empirical evidence of joint retirement behavior. The phenomenon of joint retirement refers to the coincidence in time of spouses’ retirement and follows the observation that a significant proportion of spouses retire within less than one year of each other, independently of the age difference between them. The left graph of Figure 1 shows the histogram of the age differences between spouses using couples from the waves 1, 2, and 4 of SHARE. The average gap between the husband’s age and the wife’s age is of 2.2 years, being this difference quite stable across SHARE countries (with the only exception of Greece, where the average differential is of 4.4 years). The right graph shows the histogram of the differences between the age the husband stopped working and the age his wife did so. As expected by the joint retirement phenomenon, the peak at zero is large and much bigger than the proportion of couples with no age differences among its members. This hints at the presence of joint retirement behavior among couples in Europe. Age gaps between spouses. Notes: Source: SHARE (waves 1, 2, and 4). Retirement age gap = weighted mean of differences between the age of stop working for the husband and the age of stop working for his wife. In this paper we then focus on the retirement patterns of couples and study the complementarity of spouses’ retirement patterns in continental Europe. This study complements the one of Banks et al. (2010) for England and the US who, focusing on men, found that British men are from 14 to 20 percentage points more likely to retire when their wife reaches state pension age at 60 than their American counterparts. Considering the numerous differences in the labor markets, health insurance and social plans between the UK and US and many European countries, there is no a priori reason to assume that their findings would still hold in Europe. In addition, in contrast with Banks et al. (2010), we are interested in studying both women’s and men’s transitions out of the labor force and how they directly relate to the actual realization of their husbands’ (wives’) transition, using the institutional variation in country-specific early and normal retirement ages to instrument the latter. We find significant evidence of complementarity on spouses’ transitions out of the labor force. The probability of women leaving the labor force increases in around 21 percentage points when their husbands also stop working. The effect for men, however, is insignificant. Controlling for spouse’s working status reduces the impact of own eligibility for retirement pensions on the probability of leaving the labor force. In particular, the effect for women is reduced in about 2 percentage points for full retirement pensions. Therefore, by ignoring joint retirement, governments would be overstating the impact of eligibility rules on retirement decisions. Our empirical strategy allows us to give a causal interpretation to these effects we estimate as we control for the potential endogeneity of spouse’s retirement decisions. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and key variables for the analysis. Section 3 discusses the empirical reduced form model and identification strategy. In section 4 we present econometric results from estimating our empirical model. Finally we conclude in section 5.",21
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,09 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9012-3-11,Do wages reflect labor productivity? The case of Belgian regions,December 2014,Jozef Konings,Luca Marcolin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Classic economic theory applied to the labor market assumes that markets are perfectly informed and able to allocate workers in open vacancies. These workers are paid a salary equal to their marginal product of labor, since labor supply and demand are both satisfied. In the real world, however, this condition might not hold: many market frictions exist which are triggered by imperfect information and institutional factors such as employment protection, unemployment benefits, collective bargaining, minimum wages and taxation. Manning (2011) widely discusses different models in which imperfect competition in the labor market creates a wedge between average productivity and average worker compensation, thus permitting the employer to appropriate part of the surplus of the matching between labor supply and demand. The persistently high unemployment rates plaguing the Western World and Europe in particular in the aftermath of the Great Recession suggest that wage rigidity combined with falling productivity may be an important channel causing increasing unemployment. Belgium is no exception, with 7.6% national unemployment rate in 2012 averaging over the 17.5% unemployment rate of Brussels, the 4.6% rate of Flanders and the 10.2% rate of Wallonia (source: Eurostat). The current study searches for an economic rationale for these persistent differences in unemployment across regions, and it does so by analyzing deviations in the evolution of wages and labor productivity for Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia. We will therefore estimate simultaneously a labor productivity function and a wage equation on Belgian firm level data, where we include indicators for the regional location of the firm as main explanatory variable. In this way, we also analyze the relative competitiveness of Belgian regions. Labor productivity growth is considered a key indicator to assess regional competitiveness, together with the increase in labor utilization and cost. These metrics are fundamental to the determination of the gains in living standards of regions over time, therefore they hold a prominent position on the policy makers’ agenda at the European level. This ambition can be found in the EU2020 agenda, where it is stated that Europe needs “a strategy to turn the EU into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy delivering high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion”. Shortly below it is reported that the EU2020 strategy aims at “empowering people through the acquisition of new skills to enable our current and future workforce to adapt to new conditions and potential career shifts, reduce unemployment and raise labor productivity”. Our results present evidence of stronger deviations between labor productivity and wages in Wallonia and Brussels relative to Flanders. While the average labor costs of firms in Wallonia and Brussels are lower than in Flanders, the gap between average labor costs and labor productivity is even larger. As a consequence, firms in Wallonia or Brussels have a competitive disadvantage compared to Flanders, although the gap seems to be narrowing in the last year for Brussels. The study is organized as follows: the first paragraph shortly describes the labor market in Belgium, while the second provides a literature review on the link between productivity, wages and regional unemployment differentials. A third paragraph follows commenting on the empirical methodology and the literature which proposed it. The fourth paragraph presents the data we exploit, the fifth the results of the econometric analysis. The conclusion follows. Although unemployment in Belgium seems to be on a decreasing pattern down from the 2011 peak, mismatches between vacancies and available workforce have not substantially decreased in 2012 compared to 2007: almost half of the long term unemployed are still low or medium skilled, while 80% of vacancies search skilled workers (Zimmer 2012). This happens despite Belgium being among the highest spenders for labor market policies (LMP) in Europe: (latest available data, source: Eurostat 2010) it invested more than 3.7% of GDP in LMPs, ranking third in Europe after Spain and Denmark. It also ranked fourth from the top for expenditure in labor market services and sixth for out-of-work income maintenance and support. Such malfunctioning of Belgian labor market is also stressed in the OECD (2013) Economic Survey for Belgium, which states that “longstanding structural labor market problems remain, such as high structural unemployment, low employment rates for younger and older workers and for low-skilled and migrants, and large labor market mismatches”. Many have pointed to the role of labor market institutions as fundamental contributing factors: the OECD (2011) Economic Survey for Belgium, for instance, reports that “coordinating policies to secure a smoother transition [from the crisis labor market equilibrium] is difficult, as the communities are responsible for education, the regions for employment and professional training, and the federal government for labor legislation, collective agreements and social security”1. Among these institutions, the OECD (2013) Economic Survey for Belgium points in particular at wage setting practices, where it states that “the highly coordinated wage formation process preserves relative wage differentials, implying that wages do not reflect emerging differences in relative labor demand and thus contribute relatively little to support ongoing reallocation of labor”. Belgium is indeed characterized by a centralized hierarchical system of collective bargaining for wages, which takes place at the national, industry and firm level; negotiations at each lower level cannot yield less favorable outcomes than the higher level. National agreements set minimum wages. Since 1996, a ceiling for yearly wage increases is also established at the national level every two years, on the basis of gross labor compensations in France, Germany and the Netherlands. This so-called “wage margin” wants to limit wage increases which could harm the competitiveness of Belgian products in the international market. A third nation-wide mechanism affecting wage setting is indexation, which ties gross labor compensations to changes in consumer prices, and establishes a de facto floor for wage increases in the year. By far the most important wage negotiations in Belgium happen at the industry level, through the about 150 Joint Committees composed by representatives of employees and employers. They establish wage increases at the industry level, as well as pay scales per employee category. Blue and white collar workers usually negotiate in separate Joint Committees. The agreements reached in the Joint Committees bind all companies in the same sector by Royal Decree, making the coverage rate of the agreements approximately 90% OECD (2004). Finally, 20 to 25% of private sector workers see their salary determined at the firm level as well (Rusinek and Tojerow 2011; Lopez Novella and Sissoko 2013). The degree of decentralization in wage setting, and the coverage of workers by firm level agreements change significantly with the industry affiliation (Rusinek and Tojerow 2011). Lopez Novella and Sissoko (2013), although not explicitly testing for the impact of firm level bargaining on wages for Belgian workers, provide evidence that when industry-level bargaining is taken into account, the impact of other firm- and employee-characteristics on wages is reduced, in particular for blue collar workers. Our analysis investigates the relevance of the mismatch between labor cost and productivity in Belgium, and links it to differences (or lack thereof) in labor market institutions across the regions. Average productivity can of course differ across regions: Konings and Torfs (2011), for instance, show that agglomeration economies can explain important differences in productivity. Since economic activity is more concentrated in Flanders than in Wallonia for instance, it is likely that agglomeration economies (such as input-output linkages, knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling) are more important in Flanders than in Wallonia, resulting in higher productivity in the former. Similarly, Epifani and Gancia (2005) create and simulate a model of regional unemployment with migration and trade, where regional differences in productivity coexist with regional unemployment differentials due to agglomeration forces and congestion effects in utility. In order to match these regional differences in labor productivity, wages should also adjust at a regional level to obtain full employment. This is easily explained with the aid of a standard labor market equilibrium graph, such as Figure 12. 
Labor supply and demand equilibria with rigid wages for Wallonia and Flanders.

, labor supply and demand meet at equilibrium E0. In the presence of agglomeration rents, on the other hand, productivities differ across regions, and so does labor demand. If the marginal product of labor in Wallonia is lower than in Flanders, Wallonia’s labor demand schedule

 for the sector. The labor market in Wallonia reaches the equilibrium E1 with unemployment (n0?−?n1). The graph suggests that fixing a nation- (sector-) wide wage may be an important factor affecting the reported existence of regional unemployment differentials in Belgium. A similar argument on the contribution to unemployment of wage setting institutions is proposed by others in the economic literature. It is the case in Pench, Sestito and Frontini (1999), who propose a model where homogeneous labor market in regions with different productivity creates a lower bound wage which is binding for the poorer region. When the same shock hits both a rich and a poor region, employment adjusts differently in the two regions, thus creating unemployment regional differentials. The authors find important regional components of unemployment for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the UK. A similar argument is proposed by Dell’Aringa and Pagani (2005). Davies and Hallet (2001) also argue that regional unemployment differentials are present in European countries due to the failure of wage setting institutions to take into account the productivity level of the least productive region. The gap between wages and labor productivity is one of the determinants of regional unemployment differentials according to Elhorst (2003) as well. In his survey of both theoretical and empirical literature on the existence of regional unemployment differentials, Elhorst (2003) provides a list of thirteen economic phenomena (from employees’ and market’s characteristics to regional amenities) which have been found relevant for unemployment differentials. Zeilstra and Elhorst (2012) provide evidence that regional unemployment differentials were affected by both regional and national factors in the European Union from 1983 to 1997. Overman and Puga (2002) suggest that regionalization of wage setting should reduce the regional polarization of unemployment in the European Union. More recently, Vamvakidis (2008) exploits a panel of regions from 10 European countries and finds that lower coordination of bargaining at the national level can increase regional wage differentials for regions with high productivity differentiation. A distinction between low and high productivity regions is present in Basile and De Benedictis (2007), who explicitly test the impact of regional productivity on regional unemployment, and find it to be negative for low productivity only. Bande, Fernandez and Montuenga (2008) also argue that the absence of regional wage differentials due to a centralized wage setting can depress labor mobility after a shock, and contribute to the persistence of regional unemployment differentials. On the other hand, however, they provide evidence that regional wage setting may not solve the unemployment differentials: if the most productive region increases salaries due to a positive productivity shock, workers in the poor region may demand comparable wage increases due to fairness considerations, without matching it with a proportional productivity increase. A similar argument for Belgium is proposed by Plasman, Rusinek and Tojerow (2007) and Rusinek and Tojerow (2011): using firm level data they provide evidence that regional wage differentials are already present in the country even when controlling for the composition of firm’s labor force, and that these differentials decrease in magnitude when adding a control for labor productivity. What is more, the wage differentials are found to be more positively correlated to productivity differentials when wage negotiations are more decentralized. They therefore conclude that a regionalization of the wage bargaining mechanism may not make wages more sensitive to local specificities. We contribute to the literature reported above by explicitly investigating the existence of a mismatch between regional premium to wages and productivity in Belgium. We do so by jointly estimating a productivity and a wage equation, similar to Van Biesebroeck (2008). We approach the analysis of the effectiveness of Belgian regional labor markets by estimating a value added per worker function and a wage equation at the firm level; we then assess whether the return to regional localization is different between wages and productivity in each region. The main regressors of interest are dummy variables for the location of the firm in Flanders, Wallonia or the Brussels region. The estimating equations hence read: where the dependent variable of (1) is labor productivity (or value added per employee) of firm “i” in sector “j” in year “t” , while the dependent variable of (2) is average firm wage.

 are the dummies for Brussels and Wallonia identifying where the firm is located (the dummy for Flanders is correctly removed to avoid perfect multicollinearity). Age stands for the period past from the year of firm establishment to the reporting year, while Size is a proxy for firm’s size and will be specified in the estimation as sales; both size and age are important determinants of firms’ performance and costs. Finally, specific sectors and specific years may have an impact on both labor productivity and average wage: to net out our results from such influence, we include industry (φj) and year (θt) fixed effects. εijt and ηijt are idiosyncratic errors. Contrary to the established literature on wage and productivity premia pioneered by Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (1999), we cannot control for the characteristics of firm’s employees in equations (1) and (2) due to data limitations. The regional distribution of these individual features was found to be relevant for the probability of being unemployed in López-Bazo and Motellón (2013). Similarly we could not find region-specific time series for prices, therefore we do not control for regional price differentials. This may be a concern, as regional differences in prices are reflected in wages and value added (hence productivity): if prices in Brussels (respectively, Wallonia) were consistently higher (respectively, lower) than in Flanders, then failing to control for different regional trends would bias the coefficient on the regional dummy upwards (respectively, downwards). On the other hand, indexation of wages to the nation-wide level of prices should reduce the impact of regional prices on salaries. What is more, biases on productivity and wages induced by the omission of prices from the specification should cancel out when taking the ratio of the two measures as an outcome variable, as in Equation 3 here below. We first estimate equations (1) and (2) with OLS and clustered errors to account for firm heterogeneity. This provides us with an intuition of the direction in the discrepancy (if any) between labor productivity and average wage due to the regional location of firms. Since there is no variation over time in the location of firms across regions, estimating equations (1)-(2) with OLS exploits between-firm variation in order to identify productivity and wage premia. Our estimators are unbiased if we assume that the establishment of a firm’s in a specific region is exogenous to the firm’s productivity and average wage; in other words if firms do not self-select into locating in a specific region due to their productivity or average wage. In presence of self-selection, on the contrary, the firm outcomes of interest would determine regional localization (and not the vice versa). Failing to correct for this would bias upwards the coefficient of the dummy for the most productive region in the productivity equation, and bias downwards the coefficient of the dummy for the region with highest labor costs in the wage equation (if one assumes that firms would prefer to locate where the average productivity of their peers is higher and labor costs are lower). We argue that the scope of self-selection in localization is limited in the choice between Flanders and Wallonia or Brussels in light of the existence of the linguistic and cultural barriers. This happens for workers flows, for instance, as empirically proved by Persyn and Torfs (2012), who find regional borders effects on the commuting flows across Belgian regions. The intuition is similar to Lazear (1999), who argues that success in the labor market increases with the capability of speaking the language, which in turn enhances social interaction and information gathering. Including a control for the age of the firm should also limit the bias due to endogeneity. If firms located in the most productive region, the benefits from the location should be especially important in the early life of the company, soon after its establishment. In our main specification, however, we control for firm’s age, which should reduce the bias of the coefficient of the regional dummy. What is more, in a robustness check, we estimate our empirical framework distinguishing between younger and older firms. The upward bias in the coefficients for regional dummies should be lower for older firms, were self-selection a concern. While we do find the elasticities of productivity and wages to location to be greater in magnitude for younger firms than older firms for Brussels in particular, this difference is not statistically significant in the case of the wage-productivity gap for Wallonia. What is more, even when the elasticities are significantly different between specifications, the sign of the coefficient is the same as in the main specification obtained pooling over all firm ages, thus implying that the direction of our baseline results is robust to endogeneity. Simple OLS, however, does not permit to explicitly test whether the coefficient of the regional dummy is equal between equation (1) and (2), as the two equations are estimated on different samples and for different outcome variables. The literature has hence reverted to the joint estimation of productivity and wage equations, either by transforming the data as in the seminal paper by Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (1999), or by using seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR), as in Van Biesebroeck (20082011). This econometric technique helps in estimating systems of two or more equations representing relationships which are linked one with each other, i.e. when the errors are correlated across equations in the system (Zellner 1962 Fiebig 2001). By simultaneously estimating the two (or more) equations, SUR consistently estimates the errors’ covariance matrix, thus permitting cross-equation comparison of coefficients. As a consequence, we also estimate the productivity and wage regressions simultaneously with SUR, which yields a Feasible GLS estimator, and test the hypothesis that no mismatch is present, i.e. α1?=?γ1 and α2?=?γ2. The innovative paper by Van Ours and Stoeldraijer (2011) provided a further method to test the relative magnitude of wage and productivity premium in a statistically significant way. They add a third estimating equation, where the dependent variable is the difference of the dependent variables in equations (1) and (2): We then restrict the sample to the same number of observations across the three estimating equations, so that π1?=?α1?−?γ1 and π2?=?α2?−?γ2. If π1 and π2 resulted significantly equal to zero, the hypothesis of equality of coefficients across value added and wage cost equations would be validated. This methodology for testing the significance of the wage-productivity gap at the firm level was also adopted by Cataldi, Kampelmann and Rycx (2011), Garnero and Rycx (2013), and Vandenberghe (2013)3, although without applying it to a regional context. What is more, equation (3) can yield interesting evidence by itself, as its dependent variable, i.e. the value added produced with one unit of salary, can be interpreted as competitiveness. This measure is also adopted as a proxy for internal competitiveness by the European Commission4. We run the three mentioned estimation techniques (OLS, OLS on the restricted sample, SUR) using different specifications of the outcome variables. In particular, the number of full time equivalent employees (n) in equations (1)-(3) is substituted by the average number of employees working for the firm, and by the number of hours worked by full time equivalent employees. The latter is a common feature in the labor economics literature, where hours worked are considered a more precise account of the labor input contribution to production. A fourth specification includes workers’ benefits and compensations into the wage bill, which can also be considered part of labor costs. We work on firm level data obtained from the Bureau Van Dijk product for Belgium (Belfirst). The dataset covers the population of Belgian firms and the reporting quality is high. We exploit both accounting data (turnover, value added, cost of intermediate inputs) and social balance sheet information (number of full, full time equivalent and part time employees, wage bill and compensations by category, hours worked). We retrieve data from all operating firms in the years 2005-2012. After some cleaning, we are left with 518,758 firm (or 430,544 firms on average per year), 59% of which was located in Flanders, 24% in Wallonia and 17% in Brussels (ref. Table 1). Table 2 contains summary statistics for the sample which will be used to estimate our regressions, by region of firm localization. Labor productivity is defined as value added per full time equivalent employee, while wages are computed by dividing the firm-level total cost of full time equivalent employees by the number of such workers. Labor costs are reported before labor contribution reductions and they do not include benefits and compensations. In a robustness check, we report estimation results inclusive of such benefits, but this does not change the conclusions of our analysis. The ratio of labor productivity and unit wages yields value added per average wage, and it represents our measure of competitiveness. Capital intensity is defined as the sum of tangible and intangible fixed assets, over the number of full time equivalent employees. All quantities, as well as the regional affiliation of companies, are defined at the firm level, due to data limitations which do not permit to distinguish different establishments within the same firm. This may be problematic if our sample contains companies filing single accounting information for multiple plants which are located in different regions, and in particular for productivity, which is more likely to differ between plants of the same firm than wages. Were this the case, our statistics and estimation results would be biased upwards for the region where the headquarter is established, which is likely to be the case especially for the region of Brussels5. The regional dummies are defined according to the NUTS1 classification6. From a first glance to the data it emerges that Flanders has a higher value added per average wage than Wallonia and Brussels7. This is due mainly to the better performance of Flanders in terms of average labor productivity (i.e. value added per worker), which is coherent with previous evidence (Konings and Marcolin 2011)8, despite the high wages (higher than in the other regions). The described sample is reported in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 as well, where each graph displays the trend in average labor productivity, average wage and their ratio, as well as the number of hours worked by full time equivalent employees. Brussels and Wallonia score worse than Flanders in productivity over all the years in the sample, while Brussels average wages are comparable to the Flemish ones. This is reflected in a striking negative performance of Brussels relative to the other regions in the sample (ref. Figure 4). On the other hand, in the latest years the trends in labor productivity seem to suggest a slowing down in the rate of growth for Flanders, thus permitting Wallonia and Brussels to catch up with the region in terms of value added per average wage. The slope of the schedule for the number of hours worked does not seem to differ in an important fashion between regions, but firms in Brussels report a significantly higher number of hours worked than in the other regions, on average over the whole sample. We now turn to the econometric analysis to estimate which of these descriptive facts are confirmed by a more rigorous assessment of the data.

 Table 3 reports the results of the estimated regressions where information on full time equivalent employees has been exploited. Bx and Wa represent the dummies for the location of a firm in the Brussels and Wallonia region, respectively. All results for the regional dummies, as a consequence, need to be interpreted in relative terms to Flanders. Size2-Size4 are dummies for the size of the firm, respectively for small firms (i.e. with more than 10 employees and less than 51), medium (more than 50 and less than 251) and big (more than 250) firms. The excluded category are then micro firms (10 employees or less), hence all results should be interpreted in relative terms to this category9. The dependent variable for each model is specified in the header of the columns. Results are reported for the three estimation techniques presented in the previous paragraph: OLS with clustered errors, OLS with clustered errors where the sample is restricted to have the same number of observations for the three different outcome variables, and seemingly unrelated regressions. All estimations include year and industry fixed effects, so as to net the coefficients of interest from time trends and industry specificities. We therefore implicitly compare firms which have identical features except for their location. The three different econometric specifications yield coherent results10. All coefficients are highly significant across the three specifications. The last two rows of the table report the signs and magnitudes for the elasticities obtained from the regional dummies. EL(Bx) (respectively, EL(Wa)) is the computed elasticity of the outcome variable to being located in Brussels (resp. Wallonia) rather than Flanders. Halvorsen and Palmquist (1980) proved that these elasticities need to be computed from the estimated coefficients according to the following transformation: where (β
X
) is the estimated coefficient for the regional dummy X?=?{Bx; W α}. Our regressions indicate that, everything else held constant, firms located in Brussels and Wallonia rather than Flanders benefit of a discount in average wage cost of approximately 5% and 13.5% respectively. On the other hand, they also suffer from a substantial disadvantage in labor productivity ranging from 16% to 17% for Brussels and Wallonia. As a consequence, the wage-productivity gap of these regions with respect to Flanders is significant and equal to 11% for Brussels and 4.2% for Wallonia for 2005-12, conditional on our other controls. This is equivalent to say that the gap between the wage and productivity premium associated with firm’s location is almost three times as big in Brussels than in Wallonia. Interpreting the relative magnitude of coefficients of regional dummies across different models is possible thanks to the seemingly unrelated regressions (Zellner 1962). We hence tested for the equality of the coefficient of the dummy for Brussels (respectively, Wallonia) across the productivity and wage equations. The null hypothesis is always strongly rejected at 1% value11. Standard errors are bootstrapped to take into account heterogeneity in the errors. Finally, Table 3 highlights that a 1% increase in the age of the firm improves the firm’s ratio of value added to total labor costs by 0.5%. This happens thanks to a productivity premium to age which exceeds the cost burden of being relatively established firms in the market. In other words, the longer a firm has been operating, the higher its average wage bill will be (due, for instance, to the presence of internal labor markets), but also its productivity. The reverse is true for size: being bigger corporations can impose a gap between labor costs and productivity by 24% to 29%, depending on the size category12. A proxy for firm’s capital intensity is omitted, in light of its high correlation with firm’s age and size. If it were included we would expect a positive sign for its coefficient, due to the positive correlation between capital intensity and the outcome variables. The correlation of capital intensity with the regional dummies, on the other hand, is almost zero on average over the sample years, hence the magnitude of the estimated regional fixed effects should be unbiased13,14. We check the validity of our results by estimating the same models as in Eq(1)-(3) but exploiting different information set (Table 4). Columns a1-a3 are estimated using the firm’s average number of employees rather than the full time equivalent number of them, and the average cost of employees. Columns b1-b3 deflates both value added and total wage bill by the number of hours worked by full time equivalent employees rather than the number of employees. Finally, columns c1-c3 are estimated adding workers’ benefits and compensations to the wage bill, but once again using the number of full time equivalent employees to generate average wage and labor productivity. To be synthetic, we present here only results obtained from the complete sample (OLS) and from SUR on the restricted sample15. Results are coherent with the estimation using full time equivalent employees: Brussels and Wallonia enjoy a discount in average wage and hourly labor costs with respect to Flanders of approximately 5% for Brussels and 12 to 13% for Wallonia, conditional on all other firm characteristics we control for. However, the labor productivity disadvantage is lower than the cost advantage for the regions, suggesting that workers in both regions relative to Flanders are overpaid. The wage-productivity gap is hence positive16 and reaches 4 to 7% for Wallonia relative to Flanders, and 11 to 15% for Brussels. Signs are mostly coherent with previous specifications also for the age and size of the firm. An increase in both parameters yields an increase in the average wage cost for the firm; age, however, also raises labor productivity, contrary to size. Consequently, the productivity-wage gap is generally positively affected by an increase in firm’s age (except when we run our estimation using worked hours) and negatively affected by an increase in firm’s size. Table 5 presents a second robustness check, where we investigate the differences in the regional elasticities depending on the age of the firm. We exploited the year of incorporation to construct a dummy variable (“Old”) taking value 1 for all observations where the firm is at least 10 years old at the time of observation. We then interact this dummy with the main regressors of interest (Bx and Wa). A precise comparison with the baseline results in previous tables is impossible, as the control for the logarithm of firm’s age had to be dropped, but Table 5 still provides useful insights. The signs of the elasticities for both young and old firms stay the same as in the pooled sample17. The cost advantage enjoyed by firms in Brussels and in particular in Wallonia relative to firms in Flanders applies to both young and old establishments. The elasticities in the wage equation are significantly higher for young firms than older firms, and in particular for firms located in Brussels. The productivity disadvantage of non-Flemish firms is also higher for younger firms than older ones, coherently with the positive correlation between age and productivity we estimated in the previous specifications. The average old firm in Brussels, on the other hand, performs better than the counterpart in Wallonia (relative to a firm in Flanders), which is not the case for a younger firm. The gap between the wage and productivity premium associated with firm’s location is bigger in Brussels than in Wallonia, but distinguishing this effect between young and old firms is not possible, since the coefficient on the Wallonia regional dummy in the gap equation is not significantly different for older and younger firms. The impact of being located in Brussels on the productivity-wage gap is greater for younger firms. The picture of relative performance of Belgian regions partially changes when taking into considerations the growth rate of labor productivity and average wage. We explore this venue to conform to the current policy debate, which seems to prefer comparisons across administrative units based on the rate of growth more than on the level of competitiveness. Higher productivity growth is indeed generally associated to a higher economy-wide growth rate, coherently with a neoclassical model of endogenous growth (Lucas 1988 Romer 1994). We therefore estimate equation (1)-(3) again, where the dependent variables become the year-on-year change in the logarithm of average wage, labor productivity, and their difference. Table 6 shows the results of the estimations for the complete sample and for the sample where the same number of observations is exploited for the three regressions. In the baseline estimation the wage-productivity gap is reduced by the localization of the firm in Brussels but not Wallonia. This result is driven by the rate of productivity growth, which is higher for the former than the latter, and higher than the coefficient for the cost growth equation. This, in turn, is then reflected in a positive and significant coefficient for the dummy of Brussels but not Wallonia. It remains true, however, that being located in either Wallonia or Brussels increases the rate of growth of wages the firm is asked to pay to its workers more than a firm located in Flanders. The coefficients for age and size of the firm, on the other hand, seem to go in the same direction as reported in the estimation in levels: keeping every other firm’s characteristics constant, an older or bigger firm displayed a lower yearly rate of growth in the ratio of productivity and wages between 2005 and 2012. Our results in the preferred specification therefore suggest that a catching up process may be happening in Belgium in terms of regional productivity. Being located outside Flanders in the sample years guaranteed a higher growth rate of productivity, no matter the cost performance. This translates in a positive coefficient for the productivity-wage gap but only for Brussels, while the coefficient for Wallonia is insignificant due to the important contribution of average wage. The results are rather robust when turning to different measures of the outcome variables. In Table 718, the evidence of the full time equivalent specification is strongly confirmed with respect to Brussels. As far as Wallonia is concerned, on the other hand, the sign of the coefficient for the wage-productivity gap turns from insignificant (for the full time equivalent sample, and here when including workers’ benefits (column c3)) to negative and significant at 1 or 10% (columns a3 and b3). The latter specification, however, reveals that firms located in Wallonia might experience a higher growth of labor costs than in Flanders, which may compensate the higher labor productivity growth, thus cancelling any significant effect on the rate of change in the wage-productivity gap. Evidence of a trend in the reduction of wage-productivity gap for Wallonia relative to Flanders is therefore somewhat mixed, but not for Brussels, where our results portrait a less negative picture of the region’s relative standing than suggested by the estimations in levels.",3

National income fell by more than 10 per cent between 2007 and 2012, as a result of the bursting of a remarkable property bubble, an exceptionally severe banking crisis, and deep fiscal adjustment. The crisis culminated in a bail-out being required from the EU and IMF as the state’s borrowing costs on the financial markets became unsustainable. Ireland’s response to the crisis, as part of an Economic Adjustment Programme agreed at the time of the bail-out, is of particular interest, being widely seen as a ""test case"" for what is often described as the austerity approach. This paper focuses on the income distribution consequences of the crisis and of the state’s response, rather than on its merits or otherwise as a macroeconomic strategy: these consequences will be an important consideration in any overall assessment, and of relevance to other countries undergoing stagnation and fiscal ‘correction’. To analyse these income distribution effects, we make use of the latest available microdata, notably the 2011 round of the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) and the SWITCH tax-benefit model (Callan et al., 2012). The macroeconomic and labour market context in which income inequality trends have occurred, and central features of the fiscal policy response, are summarised in Context and policy measures section. Key elements include a rise in unemployment from about 4 per cent to 14 per cent; sharp rises in taxation; reductions and restrictions on welfare payments; and progressively structured reductions in public sector pay. Income inequality, 2008 to 2011 section sets out the basic results on income distribution over the period 2008 to 2011, during which most of the fall in average incomes occurred. Our exploration of changes in income inequality over this period has three main elements examined in the succeeding sections. In Methodological issues section, we consider some important issues concerning data and methods, which could have a bearing on the results. These include the treatment of lump-sum payments which became more common (especially in the public sector) due to early retirement and redundancy schemes. We also discuss the issue of representativeness of the survey data on income distribution, using the income distribution statistics as reported by the Revenue authorities as an external check. Decomposing income inequality levels and trends section uses decompositions of income inequality by income source and by population sub-group to identify some factors behind the observed changes, and to guide further investigation. The role of taxes, transfers and public sector pay policies section explores how much of the total change in income inequality is due to changes in tax and transfer policy, and how much is due to changes in market incomes–including the loss of income for those becoming unemployed. Finally, Conclusions section sets out key conclusions and priorities for further analysis.",20

The growth rate is impressive. In the 1950s, 65+ people accounted for less than 15% of the working age population, now (2012) they are 27%, and in 2050 they will reach 50% (Eurostat 2013; European Commission 2012). This tendency has worrying repercussions for the sustainability of the relationship between welfare and labour market for all European societies. Yet, Italy is probably the country with the highest risk, as its dependency ratio is already 32% (Eurostat 2013). 2.3 million Italians among the 65+ already need health support (Pasquinelli and Rusmini 2013). An ageing and shrinking population is creating demand for a foreign population not only for temporary foreign migrant workers. However, rising unemployment – 12% in 2012 according to Istat (2013) – and anti-immigration sentiments among Italians (at least 55% of citizens consider migration more a problem than an opportunity, Transatlantic Trends 2011) make it difficult to suggest a more open policy. Public opinion is concerned about: competition in the labour market from migrants; the welfare system being overstretched by migrant use; and criminal behaviour resulting from difficult cultural and social integration. Research1 shows that migrants are not negatively affecting natives’ wage or employment and that, comparatively speaking, they do not benefit from welfare services more than Italians do. Nevertheless, the negative feelings about open migration remain. Temporary migration has been offered up as a possible solution. It provides the workforce that Italy needs, due to its population aging, and because of its welfare system, while it is more flexible than permanent migration and it does not carry the same social costs. Therefore, migrants from relatively richer and geographically closer countries are preferred because it is believed that they are more likely to return. This is why migrants from the Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine – are increasingly an object of interest for Italy. This paper describes profiles of migrants from EaP countries, in particular from Moldova and Ukraine, which are the most visible and quantitatively the most relevant groups in Italy, using data from the Italian Labour Force Survey (LFS), as well as data on residence permits and other secondary sources. It underlines similarities, but it also highlights differences. These have been too often neglected – considering migrants from Eastern Europe as a whole – while on the contrary differences in characteristics reflect differences in Ukrainian and Moldovan integration on the Italian labour market and in their migratory projects. Their profiles will be discussed in relation to Poles and Romanians who make for a telling point of comparison. In the following pages, after a general overview of migratory flows from EaP countries to Italy, we are going to provide a specific analysis of labour market outcomes of Ukrainians and Moldovans. In conclusion, we will show how even if migration from the EaP countries concentrates on the flexible domestic and care and construction sectors, EaP migrants engage in different forms of temporary and permanent migration. Ukrainians are made up of a prevalently female and older migrant population, which does not plan to settle. Moldovans, meanwhile, tend to be younger and more gender balanced and they wish to settle, at least for now. The link between the different migration projects and migration policies is not clear. However, it should be taken into consideration in the articulation of the Mobility Partnership Agreement signed by the EU and the Moldovan Government, which in light of favouring development and also the return of migrants, introduce more temporary migration moves.",4

Given that countries spend significant shares of their budgets on activation measures (see OECD 2013), it is important for policy makers to ascertain if such programs indeed improve the labor market prospects of participants. In order to obtain reliable estimates for the impact of ALMP and understand why and how programs work or not, both appropriate econometric methods and suitable data are required. While the development of econometric methods and computational power has increased dramatically during recent decades, data availability or the information content of existing datasets still represent a bottleneck. To overcome the problem of data limitations within the field of labor economics, IZA has recently implemented a large-scale survey, the IZA Evaluation Dataset Survey (IZA ED Survey). In contrast to population-representative surveys, this survey has the advantage that it captures a large entry sample of unemployed individuals and therefore includes large shares of participants in ALMP programs. In fact, the IZA ED Survey covers a panel of 17,396 individuals who registered as unemployed at the Federal Employment Agency in Germany between June 2007 and May 20081. Based on computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI), the individuals were interviewed up to four times. Starting at their entry into unemployment, the individuals were interviewed at frequent intervals during the first 12 months of unemployment and in the long-run after three years. This data allows the researcher to observe dynamics with respect to individual and labor market characteristics during the early stage of unemployment, as well as tracking long-run outcomes. Within the survey, information on labor market activities, ALMP participation, migration background, search behavior, ethnic and social networks, psychological factors, cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, attitudes and preferences was recorded. Its large sample size of individuals entering unemployment, in combination with its broad set of variables and the measurement of unemployment dynamics (due to several interviews during the first three years after unemployment entry), offers new perspectives for empirical labor market research. Besides the evaluation of ALMP programs, this dataset provides a good empirical base to investigate all aspects of the transition process from unemployment to employment. In particular, the combination of rich information on individual characteristics and longitudinal data allows designing detailed studies concerning the interplay of personal (search) behavior and attitudes, labor market outcomes and labor market policies. The IZA ED Survey is now available as a Scientific Use File. This paper introduces the concept of the Scientific Use File to the scientific community by illustrating the background and motivation for the creation of this dataset in Section 2, before explaining the development, structure and access to the data in Section 3. In Section 4, we provide an overview of applied studies that have used this dataset in the past, and provide some ideas on further possible fields of application and an outlook in Section 5.",7

The benefits of thick labour markets first gained attention with the work of Alfred Marshall (1920). A thick labour market is associated with both a better chance of a job match and better match quality. An extensive literature has studied whether the chances of a job match rise with market size. The empirical evidence is, however, ambiguous (for a survey, see Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001)). Both workers and employers likely raise their match standards when they have more choice. This results in constant returns to scale for the matching chance and increasing returns to scale in match quality (Petrongolo and Pissarides 2006). Empirical work on the quality of matches is scarce, mainly because it is hard to define quality (Rosenthal and Strange 2004). In a first attempt, Petrongolo and Pissarides (2006) proxy the quality of the match using wages. The present paper compares the quality of matches between thick city labour markets and thin ones in the Netherlands. The extent to which the skills of workers suit their job tasks is used to define job match quality. Heterogeneity in both worker skills and job tasks is considered in match quality, in addition to commonly used education level and occupation codes. This paper thus extends the work of Petrongolo and Pissarides (2006) by applying a more detailed measure of match quality. We find that the quality of the match is indeed significantly better in Dutch cities than in the Dutch countryside. The better career prospects induce better workers and more complex jobs to gravitate to cities. To assign skills to tasks across labour markets, we propose a model in the spirit of Burdett and Coles (1997) and Gautier et al. (2010). The model considers heterogeneous workers searching for a job and employers holding heterogeneous jobs for which they are seeking workers. Workers seek the most complex and subsequently best-paying jobs they can obtain. Employers seek the most skilled workers willing to accept the job, since more skilled workers are more productive. The ‘distance’ between worker skills and job complexity determines the quality of the match: the smaller the distance, the better the match. Workers and jobs are divided into quality segments. Hence, the maximum difference between worker skills and job complexity is the difference between the least (most) skilled worker in a segment and the most (least) complex job in the same segment. Workers and employers choose a location to work/operate in before they start their search. The economy has two locations: a scarcely populated countryside and a densely populated city. The density of the city results in a better match quality but also higher rents. Because of these better matching qualities, the expected utility of the matches depends more on the quality of workers and jobs in cities than the more ‘random’ assignments in the countryside. Relatively more skilled workers and more complex jobs sort into the city, since they have higher opportunity costs. The advantages of better matches soon exceed the disadvantage of higher rents in the city. Empirically, we employ the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel of 3,000 Dutch individuals. The panel contains information about the suitability of skills for a person’s job and additional information about personalities, job tasks, and the usual demographic, occupational, and educational variables. In contrast with the commonly used Occupational Information Network (ONET) and Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) datasets of job tasks, the LISS panel contains person-level instead of occupation-level information. As indicated by Autor and Handel (forthcoming), the within occupation differences in task packages are substantial, which makes our dataset relevant. Each respondent indicates the suitability of his or her job skills, the importance of 33 broad job tasks within the job, and statements about personality. The indicated suitability is used as an estimation of the quality of the match between the worker’s skills and job tasks.1 Information about preferences, as in preferring complex problems to simple problems, proxies for the investment a person has made in developing skills, given his or her education. We assume, for instance, that workers who prefer complex over simple problems invest more in their cognitive skills than workers with the same education who prefer simple problems. The importance of certain job tasks, given the occupation, defines the job’s complexity. In line with the work of Heckman et al. (2006), Borghans et al. (2006), and Bacolod et al. (2009), we can decompose skills and tasks into cognitive and social worker skills and job tasks. We define the quality of a match as the inverse gap between cognitive (social) skills and cognitive (social) job tasks. Our results can be summarised as follows. The skills of workers in Dutch cities suit their job tasks better than the average suitability in the Dutch countryside. In addition, spatial variation in match quality exists within occupations. Given the occupation, the match of skills to tasks is 14 percent of a standard deviation better in cities than in the Dutch countryside. The spatial patterns for industrial occupations resemble that of service occupations but are less extensive. Regions outside the Randstad area show stronger spatial variation than those within the Randstad area, which operate more as a single regional labour market. As expected, more skilled workers sort into cities. Additional analyses suggest that work location choice for more skilled workers is mainly based on job opportunities. Learning mechanisms raise the skills of workers in cities only slightly more than in the countryside, but this does not explain the variation in match quality. Lastly, we show that better match quality is associated with higher wages. Thick labour markets in the Netherlands have advantages in terms of more productive matches. Labour demand and supply matching is one of the three microfoundations of urban agglomeration economies, suggested by Duranton and Puga (2004), and a commonly cited source for agglomeration externalities. The frameworks of Helsley and Strange (1990), Kim (1990), and Kim (1991) generate externalities whereby the expected match quality increases with the size of the local market. The model of Duranton and Puga (2004) extends this mechanism by showing that the stronger competition for labour in cities results in additional agglomeration economies. Wheeler (2001) suggests that lower search costs in cities result in better matches, greater output per worker, more wage inequality, and higher expected returns to worker skills. Venables (2011) finds that the better match quality derives from the city’s signalling function and crowding costs. The empirical evidence for these models is scarce. Petrongolo and Pissarides (2006) find positive scale effects in both post-employment and reservations wages. This study contributes to this work by analysing the spatial variation in the match between worker skills and job tasks. In a different field but using the same underlying mechanism, Costa and Kahn (2001) find that the overrepresentation of power couples in cities can be explained by better dual career possibilities with better chances and better match quality. Gautier et al. (2010) show that more attractive singles sort into cities for better matches. di Giovanni et al. (2012) apply the thick-market effect in the field of international trade and argue that countries with larger populations have more firms and products. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 proposes a matching model to guide empirical analyses about spatial variation in match quality. The strategy of these empirical analyses is presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the results of the empirical analyses. Section 5 presents some additional analyses to rule out other mechanisms and calculates some back-of-the-envelope wage returns of match quality. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.",4

It has gone from being one of the most dynamic European economies, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.4 percent, to experiencing a major reverse after the international financial crisis of 2007, which burst the Spanish real-state bubble and soared unemployment rate to 24 per cent – the highest level among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Before the collapse of the Spanish economy, the country received an impressive inflow of immigrants – approximately 500,000 per year between 2002 and 2007 – who were quick to find jobs in the booming economy and to integrate in its society. As Figures 1 and 2 show, the composition of migrants changed over time, with EU-15 migrants being overtaken by South Americans and migrants from the EU enlargement member states. While much is known on how migrants from Africa, Eastern Europe and South America assimilate in Spain, there is no evidence on the experience of migrants from Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries (i.e. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine)1. Nonetheless, the number of EaP migrants has increased considerably over the last decade. There were as few as 4,000 migrants from EaP countries residing in Spain at the turn of the century, and as many as 127,204 in 2011, representing almost 2 per cent of the total immigrant population. This paper’s main objectives are to: (i) evaluate the importance of EaP migrants’ inflows and stocks in Spain; (ii) identify EaP migrants’ socio-demographic characteristics and compare them to those of natives and other immigrants; (iii) evaluate the impact of migration from EaP countries on the Spanish labor market and welfare state; and (iv) identify mechanisms to deal with the skill shortages and present migration policies to deal with migrant labor market matching. It is important to highlight that the bulk of EaP immigrants come from Ukraine (i.e. 66% in 2011). Thus our results and policy implications are largely driven by the behavior of this group. Total number of immigrants by source country (main groups of countries). Source: Spanish Local Population Registry. Percentage of immigrants as a share of total immigrants. Source: Spanish Local Population Registry. Our analysis uncovers three important results. First, we find that in contrast with earlier findings on migrants in Spain, EaP migrants are less likely to work than natives and other migrants upon arrival. This result is particularly puzzling because the high education level of EaP migrants relative to both natives and other migrants. A possible explanation for this is that the strong segmentation of the Spanish labor market makes it difficult for highly educated migrant workers to find jobs that match their skills (Alcobendas and Rodríguez-Planas 2009). Since EaP migrants are largely high-skilled workers, their higher reservation wage at arrival is likely to explain their lower employability. As they are high skilled, they may first search for a high-skilled job. As time goes by and they cannot find such type of job, their need for money makes them adapt their expectations and increases their willingness to take less-qualified jobs. In contrast, migrants from other origins, which tend to be lower skilled, have lower reservation wages and thus are more likely to access low-skilled jobs (for which there was an excess supply prior to the real-estate bubble burst in 2007). An alternative and complementary explanation for the difficult labor market integration of high-skilled EaP immigrants in Spain is that they face difficulties obtaining Spanish recognition and professional accreditation for their college or professional degrees. Our estimates indicate that the employment gap with respect to natives dissipates after 10 years in the country, while employment differences between EaP and immigrants of other origins disappear after 5 years. Second, a common finding in Spain is that immigrants are much more likely to be over-educated than similar natives (Fernández and Ortega 2008; Alcobendas and Rodríguez-Planas 2009). Like these authors, we find that EaP migrants are more over-educated than natives and other immigrants. We also find that EaP migrants work in more vulnerable jobs than natives and other migrants, and that although their employment situation improves over time, convergence is slow. Like other immigrants in Spain, we find that EaP migrants are concentrated in the domestic and construction sector. While EaP women are disproportionately employed in the domestic sector as nannies, nurses and housekeepers (over 50 per cent of them work in this sector), EaP men are mainly employed in the construction sector with about two fifths of EaP men in low-skilled jobs working in this sector. Third, we find that EaP immigrants assimilate into unemployment benefits over time, and that they do so at a slightly faster rate than other immigrants. This result suggests that most EaP immigrants have come to Spain to work, and since they concentrate in the most vulnerable positions – the most likely to be hit by the recession – they make use of unemployment benefits once they have the right to do so. The experience of Spain ought to be of interest to policymakers of other Southern European countries that share: (i) common cultural affinities, such as strong family-orientated values associated with a low degree of individualization (Flaquer 2000); (ii) similar socio-economic circumstances, such as rigid labor and financial markets, an important underground economy, low productivity growth and excessive borrowing (Garicano 2008; Andrés 2009); (iii) welfare commonalities, such as the mix of universalistic health-care and education systems with professional pension schemes, the high degree of institutional fragmentation and the lack of an explicit family policy as evidenced by a very limited number of family-friendly social provisions (Ferrera 1996; Guillén 1997); and (iv) a recent preponderance of illegal migration and weak governmental capacity to regulate immigrants’ inflows (Castles and Miller 2003; Solé2004). The structure of this paper follows. Section 1 evaluates the importance of inflows and stocks of EaP migrants in the Spanish economy. Section 2 identifies EaP migrants’ socio-demographic, labor market and welfare use characteristics, and compares them to those of natives and other migrants. Section 3 discusses EaP migrants’ legal routes of migration and legal framework in Spain. Section 4 contains the methodological model and the main results on how EaP migrants compare to natives and other migrants in terms of employment and welfare use. Section 5 concludes with a discussion.",5

Working time accounts (WTA) are a specific instrument to allow some working time flexibility around a planned working time framework and have existed in German plants since the 1960s. The flexible working hours (Gleitzeit) discussion combined with the decoupling of working hours and company operating hours has promoted the breakthrough of WTA (Groß et al. 2000). In recent years, an increasing number of establishments have implemented WTA. Over the course of the flexibility debate, labor market reforms and the Great Recession, this instrument has become more popular. Both employers and employees can benefit from WTA (Seifert 2004): employers are interested in the ability to adjust employees’ daily or weekly working time if the demand for and availability of personnel vary over time. They are able to adapt the working volume without layoff and (re-)hiring personnel. Thus, employers can avoid layoff and recruitment costs. Employees, and especially women, can better combine paid work with care of children and elderly persons because care cannot be fully pre-planned. Employees are able to reconcile their work-life balance. The positive and negative effects of flexible working time on employees also affect firm’s profits. If employers are able to improve the working conditions of their employees, they can fill vacant positions more quickly and at a lower cost. Establishments have possibilities to weaken negative and strengthen positive effects. Better capacity utilization can be achieved by WTA insofar as capital costs can be saved and storage costs can be reduced. A more efficient utilization of labor is a central objective of WTA (Zapf 2012). Employers are better able to meet demand fluctuations and can better avoid the wage costs associated with workforce under-utilization. Negative effects of WTA are to be expected if employees use this flexible working time instrument at different times than the employer desires. Firms would like for working time hours to be reduced during a recession. If demand for products increases, they want to expand the scope of work. Overtime hours and therefore positive working time credits are desired. However, workers want to adjust their working hours to their preferred timing, namely, according to their preferred leisure and work trade-off. This means, one perspective might be that the flexible use of WTA by employees in times of high demand may affect profits negatively. And an alternative view states that the flexible use of WTA by employers in times of low demand may save costs and affect output positively. As it is noted that WTA can be in the interest of both employees and employers, the best way to analyze the effects of WTA would be to use integrated establishment and individual data. This type of data is available by LIAB – Linked Employer-Employee Data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA). However, information on employees’ behavior with respect to WTA is missing in this data set. Currently, a separate analysis based on establishment and individual data is only possible. Most existing studies concentrate on the latter issue. Therefore, our contribution is focused on the establishments’ perspective. We contribute to the WTA literature by providing a more detailed analysis of working time accounts with respect to firm effects. First, we discuss the impact of WTA on productivity not only during the Great Recession but also over a period of six years, including the recession period. This enables permanent effects to be detected. Second, we supplement the investigation of WTA effects on further important business indicators, especially with respect to the wages per employee, investments and profits. This provides us with insights about the question of whether WTA have positive effects on firm performance. Third, we investigate whether interaction effects of WTA with other influencing factors can be uncovered. Among others, we can indirectly show whether our results are in accordance with the two mentioned hypotheses. Fourth, a subgroup analysis is carried out. We show that the effects differ between establishments with a high share and a low share of skilled workers, between companies with strong and only weak sales fluctuations. Moreover, we present the effects of WTA under different agreements on the compensation period of time credits and debits within WTA regimes. This reveals whether the WTA effects are heterogeneous with respect to specific WTA contracts. Besides graphs and t-tests that reveal the development of the share of WTA and demonstrate in which characteristics WTA and non-WTA firms differ, we apply econometric methods. The least angle regression approach serves as the basis of variable selection. OLS estimates as benchmarks are supplemented by two-stage least squares for panel data. Our major results are as follows: productivity and investments are enhanced by WTA. No influence can be discovered on wages per employee and operating surplus. The latter result is not maintained in establishments under strong sales variation. In this case, significantly positive effects on operating surplus are observed. In general, profits are negatively influenced by WTA. This outcome is less likely for firms with a high share of qualified workers. In times of low demand during the Great Recession, WTA help to reduce profit losses. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the major empirical results in the related literature are presented in a brief overview. Section 3 is focused on the data set and descriptive statistics. In section 4, the applied methods and the econometric results are discussed. Section 5 concludes the paper.",3

The consensus view seems to be that vocational/specific training is a more efficient measure for unemployed individuals than are courses providing general/theoretical skills. In the short run, learning a branch specific skill is presumed to better enhance re-entry into employment. General training, without an obvious connection to a labor market branch, may have less of an impact. However, in the long run, if general skills increase the ability to learn new tasks, this could make workers less sensitive to changes in the demand for skills. Earlier studies of adults in general education have reported average earnings returns which still increase eight to ten years after enrolment (Jacobson et al. 2003, 2005, Stenberg 2011). As program effects vary between individuals and over time, these estimates are not directly comparable with evaluations of vocational training programs, but they raise the question of whether the long-term effects of general training would catch up with or exceed the earnings effects of specific training. Footnote 1 In addition, an expansion of the menu of programs could also potentially enhance efficiency by allowing individuals to act on their comparative advantages. Some economists have suggested that governments should stimulate adults to enroll in formal schooling during economic downturns (e.g., Heckman and Urzua 2008, Pissarides 2011), but there is an almost complete lack of empirical research on this topic. It is therefore unclear whether skill adjustments among the unemployed should involve a larger element of general training.Footnote 2
 The purpose of this article is to evaluate the relative earnings association of general versus specific training for the unemployed. In the spring of 1997, the Swedish government announced the Adult Education Initiative (AEI henceforth) which targeted the same groups of the unemployed as did the traditional vocational/specific training program. AEI enabled unemployed adults aged 25–55 to attend a year of full-time schooling at the upper secondary level, with financial support equal to a maintenance of unemployment benefits. The AEI started in August 1997 and attracted large numbers. We study a sample comprising the unemployed individuals in the spring of 1997. Of these, many individuals enrolled in either the AEI or the largest vocational training program in Sweden (Arbetsmarknadsutbildning), which we will refer to as “Labor Market Training” (LMT). We explore exceptionally rich population register data which includes annual earnings from 1990 until 2010, providing a follow-up period of 13 years. The empirical strategy is based on difference-in-differences propensity score matching, which explicitly takes into account heterogeneous treatment effects and individual time invariant (fixed) unobserved characteristics. It also enables us to consider the possibility that results are affected by individuals acting on their comparative advantages in practical/theoretical skills. We achieve this by altering between defining AEI as treatment and LMT as counterfactual state, or vice versa. The intuition is simply that by defining AEI (LMT) as treatment, propensity score matching estimates will mirror the relative program effects for individuals with a relatively high probability to enroll AEI (LMT). The overall findings convey similar implications across a wide set of specifications. Our preferred estimates are based on more than 100 covariates and are robust, e.g., when we check for potential bias by including measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills (males born 1953 or later) and for “parallel trends” by controlling for dynamic factors (changes) prior to program enrolment. In contrast, the results are sensitive with respect to the length of the follow up period and to the assumed counterfactual state, LMT versus the AEI. Research comparing general and specific training for the unemployed is scant. Stenberg (2007) is a study similar to the present one, reporting individual fixed effects regression results of average post-program earnings up and until 2003 (six years after enrolment). However, the analyses did not address shape of the trajectories or the longer perspective, instead focusing on cumulative post-program earnings. The estimates indicated throughout that LMT was associated with higher relative earnings, thus corroborating the consensus view regarding outcomes as the LMT individuals’ earnings exceeded those of participants in the AEI. The main contribution of this study is the estimation of the long-term relative earnings impact of general versus specific training of the unemployed 13 years post enrolment. The length of the observation period makes it possible to examine the theoretically ambiguous issue of long-term earnings implications. Specifically, we study if the earlier reported short-term earnings advantage of LMT remains over time, whether trends converge or whether the long-term earnings are more in favor of general training. The results provide unique information on whether an expansion of active labor market programs to include general schooling yields scope for efficiency gains. This is of clear policy relevance. A second contribution is that we allow estimates to vary according to individuals’ comparative advantages, as our empirical strategy considers heterogeneous program effects and interchangeably models the counterfactual state as LMT or AEI. Our results first confirm earlier findings from studies referred to on vocational or general education for adults. For the case of LMT in Sweden, these results represent a minor contribution given the length of the evaluation. Turning to relative program estimates, the results indicate that specific training outperforms general training in the short run (5–7 years). In the longer perspective, 7–13 years after program enrolment, the estimates tend to converge toward zero. However, we also find evidence revealing substantial heterogeneity. In particular, we find for females with limited education and for residents in a metropolitan labor market region (Stockholm) that an expansion of labor market programs to include general training of the unemployed might enhance efficiency. Finally, we also find indications that vocational training may be a way to compensate for low levels of non-cognitive skills or, conversely, that non-cognitive skills are an important complement to skills obtained in general training.",12

A spell in prison brings with it a stigma and often leads to the loss of personal networks, with corresponding adverse consequences for finding a job and (predictably less so) for earnings. Detention impels convicts into a social environment that tempts them into further crime and keeps their labor supply low. At the same time, the experience of prison may deter offenders from committing further crimes, lower their reservation wages, and so improve their chances of getting a job. Lengthy incarceration implies a loss of work experience, and therefore lower wages. The reduced wages on offer may–at least temporarily–decrease the exit-to-job rate of ex-inmates, depending on how rapidly they adjust their reservation wages. Work in prison, training, and support services may simultaneously improve convicts’ employability and earning potential. Since the relative strength of these effects varies with the institutional environment, social norms, labor market regulations, and prison practices, the net outcomes may differ substantially across countries and periods, and require empirical investigation. (See Western et al. 2001; Fahey et al. 2006; Geller et al. 2006; Holzer et al. 2003; and Holzer 2007 for comprehensive overviews of the above mentioned effects). However, the effects of prison on subsequent labor market careers are difficult to identify, especially in research based on administrative data. The barriers to identification arise from the influence of unobserved personal and environmental characteristics that simultaneously predict criminal behavior and meager labor market outcomes. Models comparing released prisoners with observationally similar non-convicts can only estimate what Bound and Freeman (1992) label a ‘crime–employment trade-off’, rather than a causal effect. Such models indicate severe disadvantages on the part of ex-prisoners, but this might, at least partly, exist even without incarceration (Bound and Freeman 1992; Freeman 1991; Freeman 1996; and Grogger, 1995). The scope for randomizing the event of incarceration by means of matching methods is limited, even in surveys that provide detailed portraits of the offenders. In research based on official population registers, any attempt to find people with a ‘similar probability of being incarcerated’ would be purely formal.Footnote 1 Finding instruments that affect the incidence or length of a prison term without affecting labor market prospects is also easier said than done.Footnote 2 Therefore, the register-based studies typically stay within the boundaries of the offender population and try to find alternative means of identification. One way to deal with the problem is to collect data from the period preceding incarceration and to control for individual fixed effects in panel regressions that compare labor market outcomes before and after incarceration. While the fixed effects help to account for time-invariant unobserved characteristics, the model has the shortcoming that it treats pre-prison outcomes as the counterfactual for post-prison outcomes–an assumption that may or may not be valid in a changing economic environment and after a number of years spent in custody. Several studies try to overcome this problem by comparing the post-release experience of ex-convicts with the pre-prison experience of observationally similar future convicts, while controlling for calendar time. In this case, the pre-prison experience of the future inmates serves as the counterfactual situation on the assumption that the early and late cohorts are similar in terms of unobserved individual and contextual attributes. Widely cited examples are Grogger (1995), Western (2002), Raphael (2007) and LaLonde and Cho (2008). Our benchmark model follows these studies in comparing the post-prison employment of ex-convicts with the pre-prison careers of offenders incarcerated later. For offenders with a single spell of prison in 2002–08, we find initially negative effects on both wages and employment. While the wage effect is strong and remains negative throughout the observed post-prison period, the employment effect fades rapidly and turns positive after a year out of prison. Fixed-effects models comparing the pre-prison and post-prison experience of inmates yield similar results, as do the model variants that reduce the potential bias from unobserved recidivism. It is important to note, however, that the legitimate employment rate of the ex-convicts remains very low: less than 25% even after 7 years spent continuously out of prison. In interpreting this pair of findings, one should take into account the fact that the estimates inseparably capture negative and positive effects. Statistical discrimination tends to decrease both employment and wages, while giving up criminal activity is conducive to lower wages and higher employment. Therefore, the finding of a weak employment effect combined with a strong negative wage effect comes as no surprise in an environment where other effects (such as the loss of experience and improving marketability thanks to support services) are relatively weak. Indeed, most studies that apply such methods find a negative effect on wages, while the effects on employment are ambiguous and tend to be weak, or even positive in some of the more recent papers (see Needles 1996; Western and Beckett 1999; Tyler and Kling, 2006; Sabol 2007; LaLonde and Cho 2008; Pettit and Lyons 2009, and overviews in Western et al. 2001; Geller et al. 2006; and Holzer 2007). We try to separate the effects of discrimination and withdrawal from crime by looking at recidivists who continue committing crimes between two prison spells. For these periods, when the stigma of a criminal record is present, but the reservation wage effect is absent, we identify a significant negative impact on employment and only a minor decline in earnings. By contrast, the results for the period after the last observed prison spells of repeat offenders are similar to those of non-recidivists. Our reading of the findings is valid on the assumption that amoral economic considerations play an important role in shaping the labor supply of ex-inmates, once they have decided to abandon crime on moral grounds, because of the deterrent effect of prison or for long-run utility considerations. We can assume that, among people imprisoned for economic crime (60% in Hungary, according to CSO 2008: 52), a permanent shift away from delinquency strongly affects labor market behavior. In cases where crime generates income without consuming a significant amount of time, the effect of ‘reform’ is analogous to the impact of a reduction in non-wage income. If crime is time consuming and has diminishing returns, it can be thought of as a kind of ‘household production’, extended to the point where its marginal product equals the market wage. (See Grogger, 1998 for this line of reasoning, with reference to the seminal model of Gronau, 1977.) The implications of ‘reform’ are similar in a standard job-search framework: a fall in non-wage income is conducive to lower reservation wages and a higher probability of accepting a given wage offer. Discrimination furthermore reduces the job offer arrival rate, makes extended job search less attractive, and drags the mean of accepted wage offers downward. Falling reservation wages imply further observable outcomes. If the labor supply of released prisoners increases while firms are reluctant to hire them, we should observe a rise in search intensity among the non-employed ex-inmates. The data on registration at labor offices and on the receipt of public transfers support that ex-inmates tend to invest increased effort in finding a legitimate source of livelihood. The research behind this paper was motivated by Hungary’s growing incarceration rate, which is among the highest in Europe (bar the ex-Soviet states), with 180 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013. The growing rigor of sentencing and the introduction of a ‘Three Strikes Law’ in 2010 leave no doubt that the risk of incarceration will increase further in the foreseeable future.Footnote 3 Despite the growing importance of the problem, we know virtually nothing, in quantitative terms, about the labor market experience of inmates. Only a few interview-based studies (Tóth 2005; Csáki et al. 2007; Csáki and Mészáros 2011) report quantitative results on small samples comprising a few dozen ex-convicts. The findings also add to the thin European literature on the aftermaths of incarceration. The effects of prison service have been extensively studied in the US, which has the largest per capita prison population in the world (over 700 per 100,000 inhabitants), but very infrequently in Europe and elsewhere. Nagin and Waldfogel (1995) on Britain, Skardhamar and Telle (2009) on Norway, and Drago et al. (2009) on Italy are three of the few European exceptions.",4

However, unemployment rates are typically higher for young workers than for older ones. This is understandable since younger workers have the least experience and hence are often the easiest to remove. Moreover, they lose or leave a job more often than older workers because job shopping helps them to find a good match (Gervais et al. 2014). For instance, Topel and Ward (1992) find that two thirds of job changes and wage growth occur in the first ten years of workers’ career. This initial high turnover may involve also short spells in unemployment. Thus, youth unemployment need not be necessarily detrimental to workers’ career if it is part of the process of finding stable employment. Other views predict that the experience of youth unemployment may entail long-term penalties in terms of reduced wages and persistent unemployment. These results are explained by human capital loss (Pissarides 1992), which may arise from the depreciation of existing capital as well as from forgone work experience (Ellwood 1982). Another explanation comes from the signaling model in which past unemployment records are interpreted by employers as signals of low productivity in a context of imperfect information (Lockwood 1991). Therefore, whether the early experience of non-employment entails long-term repercussions on youth’s career should be assessed empirically. Our study addresses this research question for Flanders, the most prosperous of the three Belgian regions. The results of this analysis have important policy implications: namely, if the early experience of non-employment does not generate a scar on later labour market outcomes, there is no need for any policy intervention, since workers are themselves able to eliminate any negative impact on their career. By contrast, if it inflicts serious scarring effects, any policy that prevents unemployment in the first place will be beneficial. Belgium is an interesting case because it has one of the most rigid labour markets among the OECD countries (Kawaguchi and Murao 2014).1 A related literature suggests that young graduates are more exposed to adverse labour market conditions at graduation in a rigid labour market than in a flexible one and that this exposure translates into more persistent penalties (e.g. Genda et al. 2010). Thus, we expect that, in Belgium, the early experience of non-employment inflicts large and long-lasting damages on youth’s career. Based on a very rich database combining survey with administrative data, we focus on a representative sample of low educated school-leavers graduating in Flanders in the 1994–2002 period and evaluate the impact of the early experience of non-employment on a range of later labour market outcomes: hours worked and earnings for salaried public and private sector employment as well as indicators of salaried and self-employment. This gives us a comprehensive view of the long-term consequences of the early experience of non-employment for low skilled workers. The main identification problem is the presence of unobserved individual characteristics that may affect labour market performance as well as the (selective) incidence of early non-employment. This introduces an endogeneity problem in that the relationship between the early experience of non-employment and later labour market outcomes may be driven by individual unobservables rather than causality. We address this problem by means of an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach, where the provincial unemployment rate at graduation is used as instrument for early non-employment. The intuition is that the variation in the local unemployment rate at graduation is exogenous to the individual and therefore generates a variation in the early experience of non-employment that is unrelated to the unobserved factors that may influence both early and adult performances. Thus, the IV strategy relies on the exogenous variation of the provincial unemployment rate at graduation to identify the long-term effects of early non-employment. Since the estimation includes province fixed effects, the identification exploits the time variation of the provincial unemployment rate series in the 1994–2002 period. Note, by including province fixed effects, we account for spacial sorting, that is, the possibility that individuals sort into provinces according to unobservable characteristics. Since the unemployment rate varies across 9 graduation years and 5 Flemish provinces, inference hinges at most on 45 clusters. This raises the possibility of underestimating standard errors due to few clusters. We tackle this problem by applying wild bootstrap methods to the IV approach, following Davidson and MacKinnon (2010). The paper is organised as follows. The next section reviews the existing literature and points out the contribution of this paper. The data are described in Section 3. In Section 4 we explain the estimation strategy: we discuss the IV approach, including the way in which we deal with the problem of inference with few clusters. Section 5 illustrates the results and presents some sensitivity analyses. Section 6 discusses the policy implications and Section 7 concludes.",8

RSA is a modification of the pre-existent minimum income scheme, which had been adapted in 2009 after experimentation and had substituted the Revenu Minimum d’Insertion (RMI) and the Allocation Parent Isolé (API). To this aim we use SYSIFF 2006, a micro–macro simulation model for the French fiscal system based on the 2006 Budget de Familles survey data, a nationally representative household budget data survey collected in France every five years (see Canova et al. 2009 and Magnani et al. 2013 for a technical description of the model). The international crisis, together with the Euro-zone recession, has put substantial pressure on the nature and structure of welfare states, particularly with regards to minimum income schemes. Governments are therefore trying to react in order to design policy instruments more adapt to answering the needs of a modern and inclusive active welfare state, which, at the same time, does not produce negative effects on labor supply with the beneficiaries trapped into a sort of never-ending job instability. All 27 EU countries except Greece and Italy have a national minimum income scheme, providing to recipients a monetary buffer to cope with periods of unemployment for a usually limited period of time. Frazer and Marlier (2009), and subsequently a report of the Parliamentary Budget Office of Hellenic Parliament (2014)1, classify EU minimum income schemes in four different types of measures (see also Spadaro et al. 2014 for an overall description of EU welfare states): 
‘Universalistic measures’ as simple and comprehensive schemes (AT, BE, CY, CZ, DE, DK, FI, NL, PT, RO, SI, SE) open to all potential applicants with insufficient means to support themselves. In some countries (e.g. AT, DE) unemployment benefits and social assistance schemes are separated, whereas in others (e.g. PT, SE) just one tool covers both needs. A ‘basic and discretionary measure’: Some countries (EE, HU, LT, LV, PL, SK) have quite simple and non-categorical schemes, with rather restricted eligibility and coverage of people in need, often due to the low income level at which the means test is set. An ‘integrated network of different categorical measures’: other Member States (ES, FR, IE, MT, UK) have developed a complex network of different, often categorical, non-contributory schemes supporting specific target groups such as lone parents, the ill or disabled, the unemployed, carers, survivors and pensioners and low-paid workers. In some cases these categorical measures are accompanied by a general scheme of last resort. Finally, there are Member States (BG, EL, IT) who have very ‘limited, partial or piecemeal arrangements’, which are in effect restricted to quite narrow categories of people and do not cover many of those in urgent need of income support. With regards to Italy, no widespread minimum income mechanisms have been created at a national level, even though innovative examples of local welfare systems exist through experimentations; however, they are often weakened by a fragmented and inefficient legal framework for social protection together with the targetization to specific characteristics. Greece too has been implementing a pilot scheme established by the Law 4093/2012 in order to ensure a decent minimum standard of living. First, implementation regards 13 municipalities for the cost of €20 million (period 2013–2014). The amount of the minimum income starts from 200 euros for a single person and increases depending on the recipient’s marital status. For married couples it adds 100 euros for each adult member of the family other than the spouse and 50 euros for each child. To make it clear, a couple with two children without any source of income will receive the entire amount, i.e., 400 euro. Availability criteria include residence, income and assets. With an unemployment rate at 11.4% at the European level2 in December 2014, the background of this article is the investigation of how restructuring the welfare state can be necessary in order to guarantee both social protection to workers and an incentive for people to work and therefore contribute to boost the economy. Through the reform of RSA, France has gone towards a minimum income scheme combining flexibility of the measures, therefore, thinking towards efficiency of public expenditure, and security of workers. In a word, RSA constitutes a typical example of the flexicurity3 framework. The research questions we try to answer are: does the introduction of RSA produce significant positive effects in terms of employment, poverty and inequality? Is the cost of the reform sustainable for the French public finances? The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sums up what literature has produced in terms of empirical evaluation of costs of RSA. Section 3 describes the mechanisms to compute the fiscal instruments under investigation. Section 4 presents SYSIFF 2006, the micro–macro simulation model used to perform the reform simulations. Section 5 reports the results and Section 6 concludes.",2

This is especially so in Euro Area countries like Spain, where unemployment has more than tripled since 2008, while wages, at least in the initial phase of the crisis, failed to react to the strong deterioration of the labor market, and a rise in real wages was observed1. However, the empirical literature on wage responsiveness to the economic cycle tends to be inconclusive. Studies based on aggregate data tend to fail in finding a pro-cyclical pattern in real wages for most countries, since changes in the composition of the work force induce a countercyclical bias in the aggregate real wage (Mitchell et al. 1985, Solon et al. 1994, for instance). On the other hand, studies based on micro data show a much clearer procyclical behavior of real wages (Shin 1994 and Devereux 2001, for instance). In addition, when worker’s heterogeneity is taken into account, the procyclical pattern that wages exhibit tends to be more pronounced for newly-hired employees, while wages of incumbent workers are found to be more rigid (Carneiro et al. 2012, for instance). In the case of Spain, mostly due to the absence of individual databases to properly estimate wage elasticity to labor market conditions, the empirical evidence is scarce. A recent exception is De la Roca (2014), who uses Social Security Registers information to estimate wage elasticity to unemployment variation controlling for individual heterogeneity. In his study, De la Roca finds weak procyclicality of real wages in Spain, estimating that a one percentage point decline in the unemployment rate increases real wages by 0.4%. This estimate is considerably lower than the ones estimated for developed countries. In Pissarides (2009), for instance, elasticities are shown to be higher than 1 in most studies covering US and some European labor markets. In this paper, we follow a similar approach to De la Roca (2014), although we focus on how wage cyclicality varies during the different phases of the business cycle. Theoretically, there are multiple reasons to expect an asymmetric response of wages to the prevailing economic conditions, downward adjustments being  much more difficult in the presence of nominal and/or real downward wage rigidities, which are extensively documented in the literature (Dickens et al. 2007). However, empirical evidence of differences along the business cycle is neither abundant nor conclusive. For instance, Cervini et al. (2013), using BHPS data for UK find that wage cyclicality is considerably higher in economic recessions, and Martins (1997) finds similar results for Portugal. On the contrary, Shin and Shin (2008), for the US, finds the opposite result, that is, wage cyclicality is higher during expansionary periods. As far as we are aware, we present the first empirical results regarding the Spanish labor market in this respect. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we provide a brief description of the dataset. Section 3 discusses the methodology implemented. Section 4 presents our estimated results. Final remarks are then presented in Section 5.",15

Occupations in STEM have received special interest in academic and political discussions about occupational choice because these occupations have always been dominated by men. Additionally, the quantity and quality of the labour force in STEM is a key issue for economic growth, and the demand for highly skilled workers increases in technology-related occupations in modern societies from continued technological progress (see, e.g., Tsai et al. (2010)). The increase in the demand for engineers and highly skilled technicians is reinforced by the demographic change, i.e., the labour force in general will decline in all industrialised countries due to the aging of societies and emerging globalised markets. The high level of occupational segregation in STEM is, furthermore, not only an issue in terms of labour market policies, but is also an issue of gender equality. Even though girls outperform boys in educational achievement, women currently continue to earn less than men, face higher risks of living in poverty and are less likely to enter executive positions. One cause of these inequalities between women and men is the enduring occupational segregation. If girls do not choose these fields of study, they cannot take advantage of the promising earnings and career prospects in STEM occupations. Yet even women who pursue scientific or technical studies have a higher probability of not working in STEM occupations compared to men (see OECD (2012)). In contrast to occupational choice, the differences in the employment behaviour of different occupational groups have not been in the focus of academic interest until now. This paper contributes to the understanding of the employment behaviour of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The focus is on the labour supply of women in different political and cultural settings, especially for the member states of the EU. How political and cultural settings influence women in STEM differently compared to women in other occupations is of prime importance because labour market policies should, in part, aim to increase the female percentage of workers in STEM. However, there exists only a small number of empirical findings that explain how different occupational groups react to labour market policies and how their employment behaviour can be influenced. So far, only little research has been devoted to analysing relations between occupation choices and labour market behaviour. The empirical analysis in this paper accounts for unobserved heterogeneity by implementing the estimation methodology described by Blundell et al. (1998), which is applied to data from the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The author finds some crucial differences in the employment behaviour of women in STEM compared to women in other occupations; i.e., women in STEM work significantly more hours, thus reducing the labour supply significantly less if they have young children. The results also show empirical evidence that women in STEM behave significantly differently in countries with high levels of family allowances than women in general. This paper is structured as follows: In section 2, the author provides a short review of the related literature. Section 3 describes the estimation methodology. The data set and the estimation results are presented in sections 4 and 5. Finally, section 6 concludes.",7

In Italy, the youth unemployment rate has been escalating from about 20% in 2007 up to a historical peak of 44.2% in 2014. It is, however, from the last months of 2011 that the crisis translated from the production sector into the labor market, causing most of the recent massive increase in unemployment (Figure 1). The Italian youth unemployment rate is, hence, not far below the rates in Spain and Greece (for a recent assessment of the youth labor market problem and school-to-work transition system (SWTS) in these countries, see Pastore, 2012; Rocha Sanchez 2012; Tubadji, 2012; Cahuc et al., 2013; Dietrich, 2013; Bell and Blanchflower, 2015). The EU as a whole and the individual EU member states feel that they should do something to help young people cope with the crisis. 
Recent evolution of the YUR (15–24 years), AUR (15–64 years) and real GDP growth in Italy. Source: own elaboration of OECD data. Based on a proposal originally formulated by the European Socialist Party, the EU Parliament and the other EU institutions have approved a program called European Youth Guarantee (EYG since now), which implies the (moral, if not legal) “obligation” for each member state to provide young people with a job, training or educational opportunity within four months from the beginning of their unemployment spell. As discussed at more length in Section 1, the Scandinavian model of school-to-work transition clearly inspires the EYG. The program has already been recently implemented in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Poland. This essay aims to discuss the macroeconomic conditions under which the program is implemented and to highlight the necessary institutional conditions to be met in order for the EYG to be successful. To such an end, Section 2 will give a tour d’horizon on the current status of the national debate on youth unemployment. In order to fully understand the context of implementation of the program, the section will discuss the main political positions that emerged in the last elections. This should allow for further understanding of the momentum that the Eurosceptic protest is gaining in Italy and the need to address it not only at a micro-, but also at a macroeconomic level. In turn, this requires also redefining the Maastricht criteria and also involving the European Central Bank in the fight against youth unemployment. In other words, it is vital to discuss the terms of the debate on supply-side versus demand-side programs against youth unemployment and the issue of where (new) jobs could be coming from. The main conclusion is that macroeconomic policy – both fiscal and monetary – is important and should be discussed again. Nonetheless, in addition, the institutions regulating the labor market and the overall school-to-work transition system in particular should also be reformed. Accordingly, Section 3 will deliver an assessment of the micro-economic conditions that should be met in order for the EYG to be successful in Italy. Some discussion of the issues dealt with will be given in the final section together with summary remarks.",19

Demographic change, which has led to a shrinking work force (Fuchs and Söhnlein 2013) and an increasing percentage of the older population, places increasing demands on such pay-as-you-go pension schemes. Most of the suggested policy measures to reform the pension system try to increase the share of private financial savings. Since occupational pensions are an instrument for private pension savings, they have received increasing public and political interest. In a recent comparison concerning the flexibility of pension systems, Mercers (2013) ranked Germany in the mid-field of 20 countries. Countries in the top group of the ranking, such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK, all have particularly emphasized occupational pension schemes characterized by high participation rates. In Germany, the share of employees with occupational pension claims has been rising in the last decade, and in 2011, about 60% of the employees had claims for an occupational pension (Figure 1).

). These facts lead to the major puzzle underlying this article: Why do employers provide occupational pensions at all? Theoretically, providing an occupational pension comes at a cost to the employer. The employer commits himself to pay monthly contributions and additionally, he also has to deal with the administrative costs of managing the contributions to the pension plan. To cover these costs, a rational employer expects something in return (Gustman et al.1994; Schnabel and Wagner2001). Previous literature mostly analyzes whether occupational pensions are an effective tool to reduce turnover rates. While some studies cannot prove a mobility reducing effect (Andrietti2001; Taylor2000), most of the literature finds a negative relationship between pensions and turnover rates (Even and Macpherson1996; Gustman and Steinmeier1993; Henley et al.1994; Hernaes et al.2011; McCormick and Hughes1984; Mealli and Pudney1996). For Germany, Rabe (2007) suggests that the reduced turnover rates result from restricted portability of pensions, i.e., the risk of forfeiture of pension claims. I exploit the non-forfeiture clause for employer provided pensions in Germany (BetrAVG2009), which regulates the retention of pension claims in the case of job loss. Employees with more than five years of contributions retain their pension claims. However, employees receiving contributions for less than five years face the risk of forfeiture. In case of a credible threat of losing the pension benefits, standard efficiency wage theories suggest that wage premiums, such as pensions, can serve as an instrument to reduce incentives for shirking, i.e., they can increase average work effort. For this mechanism to operate, it requires that employers are able to lay-off workers if shirking is detected. Although Germany has strict Employment Protection Legislation by international standards, recent evidence has proven that the German labor market is in fact very un-protective, and therefore shirking theories may apply. Bauer et al. (2007) present precise evidence that the German employment protection legislation does not affect employment decisions. Moreover, studies by Bellmann et al. (2011;2013) show that, such as in the United States, German firms use hiring and firing to adjust employment. In the theoretical considerations, I review standard efficiency wage theories, referring to the agency model by Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984), as well as Lazear’s model of delayed compensations. The theories predict that occupational pensions reduce incentives for shirking if a risk of forfeiture is present. In line with theory, I construct an empirical model in which work effort is the dependent variable in a regression on pensions and an interaction capturing the risk of forfeiture. In this specification, theory predicts a positive impact of the interaction term but is uncertain about the direct effect of pensions on work engagement. The suggested relationship between pensions and effort is prevalent in standard non-classical wage setting theories (Akerlof1982; Lazear1979; Shapiro and Stiglitz1984), but to the best of my knowledge, this is the first application testing this clear theoretical relation. In the empirical analysis, I use the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale to measure employee engagement as a proxy for effort. New German Linked Employer-Employee data allow me to control for establishment heterogeneity using employer specific observable variables or an employer specific fixed effect. The employer specific heterogeneity controls for selectivity in the provision of pensions across workplaces. Several robustness checks, which control for individual personality as well as the perceived work environment, demonstrate that omitted variables, both in the individual and the workplace dimension, are unlikely to affect the estimates. Finally, I use conditional quantile regressions to evaluate the effect of pensions on the entire conditional engagement distribution, which provides a direct test on whether the shirking hypothesis applies—that is, whether it increases effort in the lower tail of the distribution or at all points of the distribution. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I summarize the institutional background of employer-provided pensions in Germany including the non-forfeiture clause and the average quantitative value of contributions. Section 3 summarizes the theoretical predictions from efficiency wages (Shapiro and Stiglitz1984) and the theory of delayed compensations (Lazear1979). Descriptive regressions in Section 5 show to what extent pension claims are selectively distributed across employers, which emphasizes the importance of incorporating this dimension in the regression analysis. In Section 6, I present the core results of this article. I provide several robustness checks to the baseline regressions in Section 7. Section 8 presents quantile regressions on the entire engagement distribution, and Section 9 concludes.",3

In most of the countries that have these tests, the results of the exam are public and can be used by parents to make decisions.1 This closer monitoring by parents and administrators provides an additional motivation for teachers and principals to improve the education results of their students. This potential for improvement has encouraged an increasing number of countries to use external examinations as a tool to increase accountability. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) report (OECD 2010) documents the fact that 22 out of the 34 OECD countries have introduced standards-based external examinations in a majority of their schools. Two more countries, Germany and the US, have this type of tests only in some of their Ländern and states. All in all, two-thirds of the 15-years old OECD students attend schools in which there is an external and standardized test. The existing empirical evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that countries with external exit-exam systems have a better performance in international student achievement tests. The first evidence for this was given by Bishop (1997) for students doing the 1991 IAEP math, science, and geography tests and Bishop (2006) with the PISA 2000 results. Overall, the existing cross-country evidence suggests that the effect of external exit exams on student achievement may well be half or more of a grade-level equivalent, or between 20 and 40 percent of a standard deviation of the respective international tests (OECD 2010 and 2012 and Hanushek and Woessmann 2011). This evidence has been criticized on two grounds. First, these studies use cross-sectional data, which does not allow to account for unobserved heterogeneity that could be correlated with both the introduction of an external test and test outcomes. With panel data or with the synthetic control method that we use, it becomes possible to deal with the fact that adoption of testing by a country may be endogenous, and unobserved heterogeneity could bias the results. Second, the introduction of external tests may lead to “teaching to the test.” However, some studies have found the same positive association between central exams and student achievement within countries where some regions have external exam systems and others do not have them.2 This evidence rules out the possibility that unobserved national-level factors correlated with the existence of tests drive the observed positive correlation between those tests and students’ outcomes. In addition, students in countries with national external exams have been found to achieve better results in other international tests such as PISA, PIRLS or TIMMS. To the extent that those tests are different in nature from national ones, it may rule out whether “teaching to the test” is a main factor driving the better outcomes of students in countries or regions with national external exams. A different critique of earlier studies is that they are not very clear on what are the channels through which exit exams are effective. This is because, for the most part, these exams have academic consequences for the students, thereby providing reasons for improvement both to the professionals and to the students. The present study uses a special feature of the Spanish education system to tease out school and student incentives, while at the same time controlling for biases arising from unobserved national-level heterogeneity and arguably also “teaching to the test.” The special feature to which we refer is that the main Spanish education law (Ley Orgánica de la Educación, LOE 2006) allows regions to conduct education system assessments as long as the results are not used for grading students or ranking schools (article 140). That means Spanish exams are not “Curriculum-Based External Exit Examination (CBEEE)” as defined by Bishop (1997) because such examinations should “offer signals of student accomplishments that have real consequences for the student and define achievement relative to an external standard, not relative to other students in the classroom or the school.” This means that the effects of such exams in Spain, if any, have to come directly only from changes in incentives for schools, although in the end those can, and probably will, have an impact on the students’ efforts. The region of Madrid introduced a standard external test called “prueba de Conocimientos y Destrezas Indispensables” (also known in short as the CDI test), which means “Indispensable Knowledge and Skills exam,” in the academic year 2004/05. The grade achieved by the student in this exam does not have “real academic consequences” for most students, so it cannot be considered a CBEEE.3 So the effects of this initiative will necessarily only go directly through changes in teacher motivation. The region of Madrid is also the only one that publishes and makes available to the public the average results of the external test of each of the schools. Other regions have external standardized exams where all schools are tested, but Madrid is the only one publishing the results. All the regions in Spain operate under the same legal framework regulating the principles, objectives, and organization of the different school levels (pre-primary, primary, compulsory secondary, post-compulsory secondary) as well as up to 65% (55% in historical regions) of the content and subjects studied. Hence, the other main observable difference in education between Spanish regions is the appearance in the period of study of this standardized external exam in Madrid, whose results are published. This feature allows us to conduct a difference-in-difference (diff-in-diff) analysis comparing the PISA results of the treated region (Madrid) before and after the CDI test was introduced with the rest of Spanish regions before and after the treatment. This diff-in-diff approach allows us to control for the unobservable time-invariant factors affecting Madrid. By working with regions of the same country, we also exclude some unobservable effects that appear in cross-country studies with different legislations and cultures. The fact that we are dealing with a single country also allows us to apply the new inferential methods of synthetic control for comparative case studies proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010). We use a combination of other Spanish regions to construct a synthetic control region, which resembles similar education characteristics to Madrid before the introduction of the CDI test. The subsequent educational outcome evolution of this “counterfactual” Madrid without CDI is compared to the actual experience of Madrid. The idea behind the synthetic control approach is that a combination of units often provides a better comparison for the unit exposed to the intervention than any single unit alone. Transparency and safeguards against extrapolation are two attractive features of the synthetic control method relative to traditional regression methods. Our results are also more protected than others from the critique that they are achieved by “teaching to the test.” This is because our measure of outcome, namely, the results in the PISA exam, have somewhat distinct objectives and measure different things than the CDI exam in whose effect we are interested. The Madrid CDI exam questions evaluate knowledge, and they are directly related to material seen in language and mathematics classes during the academic year. In contrast, the PISA exam questions (called stimulus) are more related to cognitive processes (access and retrieve; integrate and interpret; reflect and evaluate) and on how to use knowledge in particular contexts. That is, the PISA evaluation is more related to competencies, whereas the Madrid CDI is more related to knowledge. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes in some detail the institutional setup and the external and standard CDI test. Section 3 discusses the data. Section 4 discusses the econometric methodology, and it contains the main results of the paper. Section 5 shows the results of the synthetic control methods. Section 6 concludes.",4

This has increased attention towards policies aimed at promoting permanent employment, in particular during the ongoing economic crises. Several possible alternatives have been proposed and implemented in different countries, but the debate about their relative merits and problems is still open. One solution would be to reduce the employment protection legislation of open-ended contracts, which should increase the overall job-turnover (Bertola 1990; Boeri and Jimeno 2005; Kugler and Pica 2008) and reduce the use of flexible contracts (Schivardi and Torrini, 2008; Grassi, 2009). This solution is nevertheless likely to be politically unfeasible. Another option would be to decrease the cost of permanent contracts. For instance, Hernanz et al. (2003) evaluate a Spanish reform in 1997 that broadly fit into this category. Although they found a positive effect on flows to permanent jobs, Mendéz (2013) criticizes their results and suggests that there was no effect on conversion rates.1 An alternative could also be to introduce a cost for terminating fixed-term contracts instead of converting them into permanent ones, as happened with a French reform in 2002. Maurin and Michaud (2004) provide evidence of an increase in the proportion of temporary contracts converted into permanent ones, but they also find that the higher costs induced a decrease in the number of new fixed-term hires. A fourth possibility would be to subsidize any hire with a permanent contract, as done, for instance, by an Italian program introduced in 2001 and evaluated by Cipollone and Guelfi (2003, 2006). The main problem is that employers are unlikely to directly sign permanent contracts without strong signals of high productivity from the workers. Hence a substantial part of the incentive is likely to go to hires that would have taken place even in the absence of a subsidy. Indeed, Cipollone and Guelfi (2003, 2006) found no evidence of aggregate effects, but their results suggest positive effects for previously employed individuals and for those with higher education. Less is known about incentives targeted only to the conversion of fixed term contracts.2 This kind of scheme allows employers to freely hire temporary workers, possibly generating the efficiency gains related to greater flexibility, but at the same time reducing the risk that individuals incur in a series of fixed-term contracts. Given the information asymmetry between workers and potential employers, an incentive for a contract conversion might be more effective than one for any direct hires because it exploits the preference of employers to sign permanent contracts with workers that have already been screened. Indeed, the empirical literature on temporary contracts generally agrees that they represent a stepping stone to permanent employment, although the size of the effect may depend on the kind of contract and characteristics of the worker (Booth et al., 2002; Ichino et al. 2005; Picchio 2008; Barbieri and Sestito 2008; Berton et al. 2011; Bruno et al. 2012). Nevertheless, the ability of a program of this type to reach the stated target should not be taken for granted. For instance, Battiloro and Costabella (2011) evaluate a subsidy of around 4,500 euros for conversions, which was introduced in 2007 in the Province of Turin in Italy. By comparing the time series in Turin with those from other unaffected provinces, they find no evidence of an increase in the number of conversions. In this paper we contribute to the literature by analyzing results relative to an Italian scheme, based on a December 5, 2012 decree, that subsidized conversions from fixed-term to open-end contracts. The policy did not apply to all groups of workers as it excluded men over 30. Furthermore, the funds were limited; as a matter of fact, they were exhausted in a couple of weeks. We elaborate on these features of the scheme and evaluate its effects through a diff-in-diffs strategy, which compares eligible workers with their non-eligible counterparts (older males) over very short periods of time. This strategy allows us to estimate the intention to treat effect (ITT) of the policy, which captures how the change in incentives altered the rate of conversion for eligible contracts during the period in which the subsidy was available. Using aggregate time series from the Veneto region, Anastasia et al. (2013) showed that for the eligible groups the total number of conversions approximately doubled over the period of validity of the policy with respect to the previous year, and that there was a significant difference between the totals for men aged 29 and men aged 30. Differently from them, we directly use the microdata built from the administrative archives of the same region, a dataset that allows us to track individual fixed-term contracts over time. We focus on how their probability of conversion changed over different periods within 2012. In particular, we distinguish between periods with different exposure to the effects of the scheme (pre-announcement, announcement, treatment, end of funds). Apart from allowing us to focus on conversion rates rather than the time series of conversions, the use of microdata enables us to provide a deeper investigation of substitution effects and heterogeneity. We conduct an extensive series of robustness checks, and we also analyze whether transformation rates of men aged 30 or more decreased in firms where there were eligible colleagues. Furthermore, we study the effect on the individuals’ probability of being employed with a permanent contract some months after the end of the scheme. Finally, we also discuss the heterogeneity of the effects by educational status and by number of fixed-term employees within the firm. Our estimates suggest that the policy increased the probability of transformation by 83% with respect to the counterfactual rate of conversion, with larger effects for men under 30 and women over 30 and a smaller impact on younger women. There is no evidence that entrepreneurs postponed conversions during the short period between the announcement and the full implementation of the program or that they reduced the conversion rate after the funds were terminated; we also fail to find evidence that the impact is due to substitution between eligible and non-eligible workers. These results are robust to several checks, including a falsification exercise aimed at detecting infra-annual confounding trends. We finally show that the effect seems to have lasted for 7.5 months after the end of the policy, which is the time extension of the last available data at the moment of writing. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the policy. Section 3 presents the data, while Section 4 describes the identification strategy. Section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 compares the scheme with the previous policy introduced in Italy in 2001 to tentatively draw some conclusions for program design. Section 7 concludes.",6
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,28 February 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40174-014-0028-4,Religious diversity and entrepreneurship in transition: lessons for policymakers,December 2015,Elena Nikolova,Dora Simroth,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The success of the transition economies in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe has been tightly linked to entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial activity is an important ingredient of growth, particularly in the early years of transition, since small business owners established businesses in industries that did not exist, or were stagnant, under socialism (Berkowitz and DeJong 2011). Likewise, sales and employment grow faster in entrepreneurial ventures than in state or privatized firms, and new businesses are more efficient (McMillan and Woodruff 2002). Entrepreneurial ventures may also be an effective way of mitigating income shocks by providing households with an alternative source of employment. Yet the determinants of entrepreneurship in transition countries are insufficiently understood. This is not only due to the lack of comparable data on business attempts and start-ups across all transition countries, but also because it is difficult to define an entrepreneur in this context. In the transition region, the most common type of business owner is not the well studied Schumpeterian type prevalent in the West, but rather the Kirznerian type that is less innovative and more dependent on his environment for the generation of opportunities (Estrin et al. 2006). In this paper, we bridge these gaps by studying the link between local religious diversity (measured as religious fractionalization in each respondent’s locality, or primary sampling unit) and individual entrepreneurial behavior, using a new data set: the 2010 Life in Transition Survey (LiTS). This rich data set, which covers 29 transition countries, allows us to focus on individuals who have taken steps towards founding a business but who have not yet become business owners (the trial stage), as well as on those who have managed to complete the process of founding an enterprise (the start-up stage). In particular, our data captures small businesses that may operate in either the formal or the informal sector. We find that religiously diverse localities have more respondents who tried to start a business as well as a higher number of start-ups. While the former correlation survives when we introduce additional individual and local-level controls, the latter disappears once we control for the respondent’s access to borrowing and risk preferences, highlighting the role of financing constraints for business survival. In addition, our results are less likely to be driven by the differential impact of diversity on necessity versus opportunity entrepreneurs, as we control for respondents’ education and family socio-economic characteristics. To understand further what drives the link between religious diversity and entrepreneurship, we also investigate the moderating role of social capital, which may be particularly relevant for businesses when formal institutions are weak or insecure, as is the case in many transition countries. We find that social capital, measured by the extent to which the respondent meets friends, negatively moderates the association between local diversity and entrepreneurial trial and startup. In contrast, religious diversity has a strong positive effect on entrepreneurial trial for those respondents whose social networks expand beyond the family, close friends and work colleagues, or who believe that effort and hard work, or intelligence and skills are the most important factors to succeed in one’s country. Our research design has a number of attractive features. Focusing on a group of countries with similar history, geography and culture helps us to overcome the issue of country heterogeneity present in broader cross-country studies, such as those using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data. All of the countries in our sample underwent almost half a century of Soviet rule, which, in addition to imposing a common set of political and economic institutions, also banned private enterprise, which re-emerged following the collapse of communism across the region in 1989. Second, the richness of our data set allows us to account for a wide variety of characteristics that may affect both religious diversity and entrepreneurship, such as individual and family communist party membership, family background, or risk preferences. One notable innovation of our paper is that we are also able to account for fixed national and sub-national characteristics that may be confounding our results by including country fixed effects, along with primary sampling unit (PSU) geographic characteristics. Moreover, while most of the literature has calculated national diversity measures which may be correlated with a variety of country-level characteristics, our data instead allows us to calculate a new, sub-national measure of religious diversity at the PSU level.1
 Our work integrates several strands of the literature. First, our findings are relevant for the small but growing literature on entrepreneurship in transition countries (Aidis et al. 2008; Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2011; Djankov et al. 2005, 2006). In addition, we speak to an extensive literature which links ethnic, language and religious diversity to aggregate-level outcomes such as economic development, war or the provision of public goods. While one strand of this work claims that diversity can breed poverty and conflict (Alesina et al. 1999; Easterly and Levine 1997; Reynal-Querol 2002), recent work has instead reached more nuanced conclusions. For example, Ashraf and Galor 2013 show that historical differences in genetic diversity within a society have a hump-shaped effect on productivity, while Ager and Brückner 2013 find that cultural fractionalization within the US in the 1870-1920 period actually increased output. Similarly, Alesina et al. 2013 find that an index of birthplace diversity is positively related to economic development.2 Finally, our paper relates to a large management literature on the (mostly undecided) impact of diversity at the firm level, which we review in more detail in the next section. From a policy perspective, our results suggest that programs encouraging entrepreneurial attempts may be particularly successful in more diverse areas. In addition, social capital which fosters the formation of non-familial ties and belief in one’s own abilities, possibly through access to new communication technologies or networking opportunities with more experienced business owners, is likely to enhance these effects. However, religious diversity matters less at the startup stage, where the highest impact could come from facilitating access to finance. As we discuss in the last section of the paper, formal banking may be less effective at easing credit constraints for informal entrepreneurs, and less traditional approaches (such as microcredit schemes, for instance) may have to be adopted. All in all, our results suggest that, under the appropriate circumstances, nurturing Kirznerian entrepreneurs may accelerate the transition to a market economy which has stalled in many countries in the region. Such small-scale businesses may not only provide valuable employment and income opportunities, but may also eventually transform into fully fledged enterprises. The approach and results of this paper are subject to two main caveats. First, LiTS is neither an entrepreneurial survey nor a country census, so one may question the reliability of our measures of diversity and entrepreneurship. This is less likely to be a serious concern, as the country-level correlations between our survey variables and those from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (on the comparable questions on entrepreneurial trial) and the Alesina et al. 2003 data on religious and language fractionalization are between 0.6 and 0.85. Second, while LiTS is representative at the country level, this is not the case for sub-national levels of aggregation. Unfortunately, no other sub-national measures of religious diversity for the entire transition region are available. Analysis at the primary sampling unit (PSU) level using the LiTS data has also been undertaken in other published work, such as Grosjean 2011 and Grosjean and Senik 2011. We also replicate our results using diversity calculated at the level of sub-national administrative regions and obtain similar results. Our empirical results provide strong evidence that local religious diversity is positively correlated with entrepreneurial trial as well as start-up (the latter through its effect on access to finance and risk attitudes). There do, however, remain other possible explanations that may account for the patterns observed in the data. In particular, our identification assumes that local religious fractionalization is not correlated with omitted characteristics at the individual or locality level. Moreover, it is possible that entrepreneurship directly affects diversity. We use three inter-related approaches to address these concerns. First, we control for a wide variety of individual and PSU-level characteristics, ranging from a respondent’s religion to PSU-level corruption and trust. We also include country fixed effects and a battery of PSU-level geographic controls in all regressions. Second, using the approach developed by Altonji et al. 2005, we calculate that the effect of unobservables needs to be at least two times higher than the effect of observables to explain away the diversity effect, which is unlikely. Third, our results survive when we control for whether the respondent has ever moved, as well as when we limit our observations to only years after 2005, suggesting that reverse causality between entrepreneurship and diversity is less likely to be an issue. Admittedly, several of our control variables - such as our measures of social capital, risk attitudes, or PSU-level non-geographic controls - are less likely to be exogenous, which suggests that our results should be regarded primarily as correlations. Nevertheless, our multi-pronged approach makes it less likely that our results capture simply a spurious relationship.",11

It is important to understand the mechanisms through which young adults are affected by their background, especially in more difficult economic times. This article studies the effect of paternal worklessness on different aspects of young adult’s labour market experiences in the UK. Most literature on social mobility focuses on intergenerational mobility in occupations or wages, ignoring unemployment and alternative aspects of job quality (Bowles et al. 2005; Erikson and Goldthorpe 2010; Lee and Solon 2009). A smaller literature shows a positive correlation between unemployment or worklessness of children and their parents (Ekhaugen 2009; Macmillan 2010; O’Neill and Sweetman 1998). These topics have been studied separately up until now, while unemployment and low job quality are dynamically linked (Stewart 2007). Understanding the mechanisms through which experiencing a father’s worklessness can influence their children’s further labour market outcomes is necessary to tackle the continuation of disadvantage over generations. Human capital investment, mental health and wellbeing, attitudes and a sense of stigma towards being out of work are mentioned in the literature as possible mediators, but they have not yet been tested (Ekhaugen 2009; Macmillan 2010). A notable exception is the study by Macmillan (2013). She studies the role of several mediating mechanisms on the transmission of worklessness using the British cohort study. To study the mechanisms of how paternal worklessness affects children further, this study estimates the differences between advantaged and disadvantaged young adults on the probability of working as well as on the quality of the job. By using the “Understanding Society” dataset, a large panel study, more detailed prospective information on employment characteristics is available than in the often used cohort studies. A disadvantaged family background is associated with a lower probability of being employed, as shown in previous work, but is also associated with working fewer hours and being less satisfied with work. The type of contract and wages do not seem to be affected by having experienced paternal worklessness however. By studying these different outcomes together, the mechanisms are clearer, improving upon the literature. Young adults who experienced father’s worklessness are compared to similar young adults whose fathers worked but had, on average, low wages. By using this control group, it is unlikely that the differences are driven by financial capability and different possibilities of investing in children’s human capital. Differences in human capital, as well as lower cognitive and non-cognitive skills would also affect wages and type of contract, making this a less likely story. This paper suggests that young adults whose fathers have been workless while growing up experience worklessness differently and less negatively than those who lack this experience. This might lead to longer unemployment during the search for a good job (Tatsiramos 2006). This suggests further research into the experiences of work and worklessness is required.",9

It has grown rapidly since the onset of the Great Recession. In a European context, its growth has been concentrated in Southern Europe and particularly in Greece and Spain, where more than half of young people in the labour force are unemployed (Table 1). Of interest, though, is the fact that in some countries like the UK and Sweden, the ratio of youth to adult unemployment rates is close to four, whereas in Greece and Spain it is closer to two. High relative and absolute youth unemployment rates are both likely to be a cause for concern. At the time of writing, August 2014, the average youth unemployment rate in the European Union was 23.1% and 23.9% in the Eurozone. In total, there were 5.13 million people under the age of 25 in Europe who were unemployed. Of these, 16% were in Spain, 16% were in the UK, 14% were in Italy and 12% were in France. But, while it is associated often with the very high youth unemployment rates, only 3% (169,000) of Europe’s young unemployed are residents in Greece. Youth unemployment has been the subject of three major NBER studies by Freeman and Wise (1984), Freeman and Holzer (2000) and Blanchflower and Freeman (2004), where major figures in labour economics have given their views on how the youth labour market works and what to do about youth unemployment. The most important finding from these studies is that long spells of unemployment when you are young creates permanent scars rather than temporary blemishes. Bell and Blanchflower (2011a, 2011b) find similar results in the UK in the current recession. Recent work by Kahn (2010) has shown that the wage impacts of a cohort reaching adulthood when there is a recession are substantial and long-lasting. A number of authors in a series of unpublished studies have recently examined youth unemployment in the countries most impacted by high levels of youth unemployment, including Cholezas (2013) and Tubadji (2012) for Greece, Rocha Sanchez (2012) for Spain and Pastore (2012) for Italy. Youth joblessness has been a problem in many countries for several decades. It has been the subject of a wide range of policy interventions. Yet the accumulated wealth of policy experience failed to prevent a rapid rise in youth unemployment during the so-called “Great Recession”. The rise was especially marked in Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece, and as we show below, in the Great Recession, it has reached unprecedented levels. This raises serious questions about the relevance of past policy lessons to the present predicament of the youth labour market. Should we discount these past lessons, and what can we learn about future policy from recent experience? Changes in educational participation influence the size of the youth labour market and, therefore, youth unemployment rates. Thus, voluntary or mandatory increases in educational participation could potentially increase the youth unemployment rate without any increase in the number of young people seeking work. On the other hand, increased educational participation might have no effect on the youth unemployment rate. This is because many students, particularly part-timers, actively participate in the labour market. In addition, the youth unemployment rate does not capture those young people who neither participate in the labour market, nor in education. The so-called NEETs (young people not in education, employment or training) are drawn from both the unemployed and the inactive youth. There are a number of reasons why youth unemployment rates may be higher than adult rates. In the internal labour market, youths will generally have less specific human capital relevant to the particular firm for whom they work and also less general work skills. Even without a formal last-in first-out (LIFO) policy, firms may take the view that the future benefit of further investment in young workers is outweighed by its current costs. Further, liquidity concerns cause firms to seek layoffs among younger workers first, particularly where statutory redundancy payments are seniority weighted, as is the case in most countries. In the external labour market, young workers may be less efficient in job search activities than adults. Younger workers are likely to have fewer contacts and less experience finding work, placing them at a relative disadvantage compared to adults. They may also find themselves in an experience trap, where employers select workers with experience, and as a result, labour market entrants are never hired and cannot increase their own experience. On the supply side, youths are less likely to have significant financial commitments than their elders. And their parents may be willing to support them should they not find work. Such factors may create an incentive to restrict their job search activity, leading to higher rates of unemployment. Whether the cause is on the demand or the supply side, the outcome is that youths experience considerably higher rates of unemployment than adults. We proceed as follows. First, we examine the impact of Labour Market Programmes. Second we compare Greek youth unemployment with the experiences of seven other countries – France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Third, we look at the treatment of students in labour market statistics. Fourth, we look at those Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEETS), some of whom are not picked up in the unemployment count. We then look at the rising trend among young people to continue living in the parental home. The next three sections look at underemployment, long-term unemployment and the well-being of the young. The final section draws some conclusions.",24

Yet, gender differences in the labor market still persist, and their size varies considerably across countries (OECD 2002; 2008). Research looking for an explanation of these cross-country differences has predominantly focused on gender wage gaps: see Altonji and Blank (1999) for a review and subsequent studies such as Blau and Kahn (2003), Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005), or Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2007). There are papers that discuss gender employment gaps (Algan and Cahuc 2007; Bertola et al. 2007);1 however, only one study, Azmat et al. (2006)—hereinafter AGM, has tried to systematically account for the cross-country variation in gender differences in unemployment.2
 The focus of this paper is the variation in gender unemployment gaps across the European Union. While our findings are in line with the general conclusions of AGM that human capital, family, and labor market institutions, as well as prejudice, are important to explain the gender differences in unemployment across countries, this paper offers both a more parsimonious and a more specific account of the substantial cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps in 21 countries of the European Union (including the New-EU member states) a decade later.3 We show that gender unemployment gaps across the EU are primarily driven by female labor force participation after childbirth, namely, the family leave duration and the subsequent attachment of women to the labor force. Further, in countries, where a high share of women permanently withdraw from the labor force after childbirth, the size of gender differences in unemployment strongly correlates with the Eurobarometer measure of perceived overall gender discrimination. How large are gender unemployment gaps? While no major gender differences in unemployment rates have been observed in Anglo-Saxon countries since the 1990s,4 gender differences between female and male unemployment rates exceed two percentage points (p.p.) in more than one third of the countries of the European Union and many of them do not show any sign of convergence a decade later. In 2007, gender unemployment gaps across the EU ranged from a small negative gender unemployment gap (i.e., in favor of women) in Ireland and no gaps in the three Baltic States, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, and the UK, to gender unemployment gaps exceeding 3 p.p. in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. When we look at the average gender unemployment gaps over 2003–2007 to smooth out the business-cycle effects, as plotted in Fig. 1, the cross-country variation and countries’ ranking remain almost the same, with the average gender unemployment gaps ranging from about –1 p.p. to 8 p.p.5
 Gender unemployment gaps in 2003–2007 (5-year average). Note: EU LFS data, sample of prime age individuals (25–54 years old). Standard ILO definition of unemployment. Own calculations. Weighted by sampling weights. Gender unemployment gaps are measured in percentage points as the differences between female and male unemployment rates. Unemployment rate is defined as the share of unemployed in the labor force. Individuals on family leave are universally coded as out of the labor force. The coefficient of variation is 1.3 The Great Recession that followed the 2008 Financial Crisis hit primarily the male-dominated sectors and helped reduce the observed gender unemployment gaps in some of the countries (Hoynes et al. 2012). The size of the impact of the Great Recession, driven primarily by the country’s industrial structure, was unrelated to the long-term gender inequalities in the labor markets. The high unemployment rates among men have declined in the years following the Recession, as the male-dominated sectors started to recover. Various austerity measures induced by the Recession, on the other hand, negatively affected the female-dominated public sectors, resulting in the rise of female unemployment rates. These EU-wide trends led to a gradual increase in gender unemployment gaps towards their pre-Recession levels (ILO 2016). While the differences between female and male unemployment rates were (still) much smaller in the majority of the countries in 2013 relative to 2007, the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps 5 years after the Crisis remained surprisingly similar to that in 2007, as Fig. 2 attests.6 This paper focuses on the long-term variation in the gender unemployment gaps across the EU driven by structural rather than cyclical factors. Using the 5 years (2003–2007) immediately preceding the Great Recession allows us to both smooth the business-cycle effects on gender unemployment gaps over a relatively stable period and, given the persistence in countries’ ranking, be equally informative about the post-Recession cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps in 2013 and onwards.
 Gender unemployment gaps in 2013. Note: EU LFS data, sample of prime age individuals (25–54 years old). Standard ILO definition of unemployment. Own calculations. Weighted by sampling weights. Gender unemployment gaps are measured in percentage points as the differences between female and male unemployment rates. Unemployment rate is defined as the share of unemployed in the labor force. Individuals on family leave are universally coded as out of the labor force The aim of this paper is to explain the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps, as documented in Fig. 1, using 21 national labor force surveys standardized into the European Union Labor Force Survey dataset.7 In line with the previous literature, we use the International Labor Organization (ILO) definition of unemployment and define gender unemployment gap as the difference between female and male ILO unemployment rates. In order to ensure a comparable size of the potential labor force across countries, we avoid cross-country differences at the beginning and end of a labor market career (which might be due to different educational systems and retirement schemes) by limiting our analysis to prime age individuals, i.e., those between 25 and 54 years of age.8
 Using a series of data decompositions, we conclude that the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps is primarily driven by the differences in female labor force participation behavior after childbirth, namely, the family leave duration and the subsequent attachment of women to the labor force. Our conclusion is based on the following findings: A flexible version of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition shows that gender differences in age and education explain only 23% of the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps. The presence of children, on the other hand, is the major determinant of the gender differences in unemployment in the EU countries. While gender unemployment gaps among individuals with children younger than 15 in the family exceed 2.5 p.p. in 16 out of the 21 countries, women and men without children are almost equally likely to be unemployed in 18 of the countries. Gender unemployment gaps are always the highest among individuals with children between 0 and 4, driven by a high unemployment rate among women. We show that the rise in the female unemployment rate after childbirth is to a large extent driven mechanically by the withdrawal of women from employment into family leave and the negative selection of women into the labor force at that period. When women return from their family leave, the gender unemployment gaps in the majority of the countries are still substantial and reflect the true rise in female joblessness relative to that of men. However, in at least two thirds of the countries, gender unemployment gaps diminish as the youngest child becomes older than 10. Based on the labor force participation behavior after childbirth, we distinguish two types of countries: the temporary leave countries, where women take family leaves of various lengths after childbirth and then typically return to the labor force, and the permanent withdrawal countries, where the shape of the participation profiles suggests that the majority of women who leave the labor force after childbirth never return.9 The eight permanent withdrawal countries include Ireland, the Benelux, and the Mediterranean countries except for France; the remaining 13 countries belong to the temporary leave countries. Two facts arise as crucial for the observed cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps: the existence and the duration of career breaks after childbirth (in temporary leave countries) and the overall position of women at the labor market and their attachment to the labor force (in permanent withdrawal countries). In line with these findings, it turns out that the observed behavioral patterns driving the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps can be “explained” to a great degree by a single factor, a different one for the two types of countries: by the statutory duration of paid family leave in the temporary leave countries and by the Eurobarometer measure of perceived prevalence of gender discrimination in the permanent withdrawal countries. We further demonstrate the importance of paid family leave for the variation in gender unemployment gaps across the EU using country-level panel data over 25 years that allow us to exploit institutional changes in the family leave policies. The regression of gender unemployment gaps on the duration of paid family leave, with country and year fixed effects, implies that increasing the duration of paid family leave by 1 year (54 weeks) increases the gender unemployment gap by 0.865 p.p. Our findings suggest that family leave policies and institutions affecting mothers’ transition from leave to work and facilitating the subsequent family-work balance will be more effective to tackle the observed gender unemployment gaps (in favor of men) than any other active labor market policies targeted at women in general. The paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we ask to what extent gender differences in human capital explain the observed gender unemployment gaps. The third section explores gender differences in unemployment and labor force participation behavior across different stages of family life. In the fourth section, we focus on the relationship between female labor force participation and gender unemployment gaps. The fifth section summarizes the main findings from the decompositions, presents the proposed account of the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps, and discusses the underlying institutions and social norms. The sixth section concludes.",8
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,28 December 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40174-016-0071-4,"Wage inequality, skill inequality, and employment: evidence and policy lessons from PIAAC",December 2016,Sonja Jovicic,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The variation in wage inequality across developed countries has puzzled economists for many years, and different theoretical explanations and empirical evidence have been presented on this issue. Some economists argue that these differences can be explained by supply and demand factors, whereas others emphasize the influence of wage-setting institutions on the wage structure. Consistent with the first theory, the variations in wage inequality across different countries can be explained by variations in skill inequalities. Countries that have more compressed (dispersed) wage structures simultaneously have more compressed (dispersed) skill structures as well (Nickell and Bell 1995;Footnote 1 Leuven et al. 2004). According to neoclassical theory, supply and demand factors, skill-biased technical change (SBTC), and globalization are responsible for the increase in wage inequality in the past decades (Katz and Murphy 1992; Juhn et al. 1993; Katz and Autor 1999; Goldin and Katz 2008; Acemoglu and Autor 2012) and market forces play a more significant role in explaining cross-national differences in wage inequality and return to skill than institutional factors (Gottschalk and Joyce 1998). Since the Anglo-Saxon countries had simultaneously higher wage and skill inequalities compared to continental and Nordic Europe, this was taken as proof of the theory. The reasoning behind this theory is that higher wage inequality is a consequence of higher return to skills. A high skill premium goes along with increased motivation to invest in skill formation (Heckman et al. 1998; Welch 1999) and, consequently, greater supply of highly skilled labor. This explanation, however, fails to explain the high educational attainment in Nordic countries, which exhibit among the lowest rates of wage inequality when compared to other developed countries. Alternative explanation for variation in wage dispersion is based on the variation in wage-setting institutions. Economists who are in favor of this hypothesis stress the importance of decreasing real minimum wages and union membership in order to explain the widening wage gap (Freeman 1991; Freeman and Katz 1994; Blau and Kahn 1996; Bach et al. 2007; Machin 2016). A similar conclusion comes from Dew-Becker and Gordon (2005, 2008), who, in addition to these explanations, identify peer-group behavior as responsible for increasing wage dispersion at the top of the distribution in the USA. Card and DiNardo (2002) reach similar conclusions and also criticize the skill-biased technical change argument as being unable to account for gender and racial wage inequalities and differences in return to education. Variation in wage inequality in the bottom half of the wage distribution is also often linked to variation in employment in the low-skill sector. According to neoclassical theory, differences in wage dispersion are often credited as an important explanation for differences in unemployment rates. Whereas dispersed wage structure can contribute to employment creation, wage compression in the bottom half of the wage distribution (usually assumed by labor market institutions) can cause unemployment in the low-skill sector (Siebert 1997; Heckman and Jacobs 2010). Due to the skill-biased technical change, relative demand for low-skilled workers in developed countries exhibited a decline; their relative marginal productivity deteriorated (relative marginal productivity of skilled workers rose). However, wage compression and excessively high wages (higher than marginal productivity) at the low end of the wage distribution cut low-skilled workers out of employment. Consequently, countries should allow for higher wage dispersion in the bottom half of the wage distribution and lower wages for the low skilled (institutional reform) which should push their employment levels up. This is in line with a trade-off between efficiency and equality (Okun 1975), according to which it is impossible to achieve high employment and low inequality at the same time. In order to achieve high employment, countries must accept high wage dispersion. By comparing the distribution of wages and employment in Germany and the USA, Siebert (1997) concludes that the relevant policy recommendation to increase employment in Germany at the low end is to allow for dispersed wage structure (higher wage inequality). High and increasing wage inequality as well as high unemployment in some OECD countries shifted the focus of policymakers to differences in wage dispersion. This paper discusses theoretical and empirical backgrounds of wage compression hypothesis. The wage compression hypothesis is based on the perfect market model and its rigid assumptions. However, many of these assumptions are flawed—as the empirical analysis of this paper shows. Cross-country differences in wage dispersion cannot be explained by cross-country differences in skill dispersion; educational attainment does not seem to be higher in countries where return to schooling is high, and there is wage dispersion within skill levels, which is in stark contrast with marginal productivity theory. These arguments are in contrast with theoretical foundations of the wage compression hypothesis. Finally, unemployment/e-pops/average hours worked are not correlated with compressed wages. Thus, this paper shows that the wage compression hypothesis is not supported by empirical evidence and therefore challenges the theoretical assumptions it is derived from. The results of this study (although descriptive) have some important consequences for policy-making. Recommended policies for eliminating wage compression, and allowing for higher wage dispersion, are the deregulation of labor market institutions (collective bargaining, unemployment benefits, unions, minimum wages, etc.) and a reduction of public welfare policies. However, since wage compression is not correlated with labor market performance in the low-skilled sector (contrary to the theory), these policy recommendations need to be revised. Moreover, higher wage dispersion is related to major social and health problems, as well as the higher share of low-paid jobs. This study shows that countries that have good labor market performance in the low-skill sector have good labor market performance in general and this is likely due to macroeconomic policies. Consequently, the role of expansionary macroeconomic policies in fostering employment needs to be revisited. The analysis presented in this paper extends the existing literature by examining these issues. This paper shares the most similarities with the work of Freeman and Schettkat (2001) and Devroye and Freeman (2001). Freeman and Schettkat (2001) examine the wage compression hypothesis based on differences between the USA and Germany in relation to employment. They find that skill compression can only partly explain wage compression. However, the wage compression hypothesis cannot explain the US-German difference in employment. Devroye and Freeman (2001) study the relationship between the distribution of earnings and the distribution of skills and find that skill inequality explains only 7% of wage inequality. Within-skill-group inequality plays a larger role than inequality between skill groups; this contradicts the theory. In contrast to the first two studies that were based on the international literacy survey in the 1990s (International Adult Literacy Survey—IALS), in this paper, a more recent data set is used, with a larger number of countries and larger sample sizes. It is important to check whether the results based on the IALS survey can be confirmed by using the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the data set and data adjustments are presented in more detail. This section is followed by the empirical analysis in Sections 3 and 4. Firstly, international differences in skill levels, wage inequality, and the relationship between skill inequality and wage inequality are examined. In Section 5, the dispersion of wages within skill levels is investigated. Section 6 analyzes the wage compression hypothesis and its effect on employment. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",2

Using online data to study employers’ preferences in Slovakia,December 2016,Lucia Mýtna Kureková,Zuzana Žilinčíková,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Recent decades have been characterized by a rapid increase of working students (Häkkinen 2006; Moreau and Leathwood 2006; Baffoe-Bonnie and Golden 2007). Several related perspectives regarding the growth of student employment can be identified in the literature (Pollmann-Schult 2005; Eichhorst et al. 2013). The supply perspective suggests that students seek jobs for which they are typically overqualified due to the need to finance their university education (Curtis and Lucas 2001; Moreau and Leathwood 2006; Hall 2010; Beblavý et al. 2013). This is related to the process of the massification of tertiary education, which has made university education accessible to less wealthy individuals and increased competition among students for the most attractive jobs. The demand perspective views the issue of student work in the context of broader structural changes caused by technological change and the rise of the service sector. This has caused changes in labour demand towards general skills and flexible labour. Jobs that are created in the service sector are seen as unsuitable to traditional low-skilled workers, typically older and male, due to the poor job quality and security, low pay and limited opportunities for advancement. Students are seen as particularly suited to supply flexible labour and the soft skills that work in the service sector requires (Curtis and Lucas 2001; Manning 2004; Maselli 2012). In spite of low hard skill requirements, the tasks performed in low-skilled jobs can be rather complex in terms of the ‘soft skills’ demanded, such as communication skills, trainability, flexibility, social skills and appearance, making student workers able to respond to the skill needs of firms (Autor et al. 2003; Maxwell 2006; Brunello and Schlotter 2011; Beblavý et al. 2016). A third perspective suggests that the work-study shifts might have been encouraged by changing expectations of the skill set that university graduates should bring to the labour market. Experience ranks high in employers’ preferences, and this increases the incentives for young people to seek practical experience while still in education (Quintini and Martin 2014; Beblavý et al. 2016). Existing academic literature tends to equate the student labour market with the flexible labour market in the low-skilled segment and offers relatively general evidence about the characteristics of the student labour market. Moreover, the student labour market is often matched with youth labour markets (Quintini and Martin 2006; O’Higgins 2012; Eichhorst et al. 2013). However, a large proportion of university students are above the age of 25 (Fabo and Beblavý 2015). This paper aims to fill some of these gaps and analyses the features of the student labour market from a labour demand perspective. We ask whether the student labour market is identical to the flexible labour market. We compare and contrast the skill requirements for student jobs and for flexible jobs and analyse how employer demand for students has responded to macroeconomic conditions in the crisis and post-crisis periods. We rely on a relatively novel type of data and analyse online job advertisements gathered in Slovakia between 2009 and 2014. Our definition of student jobs is demand-driven and includes those vacancies for which employers marked in the educational requirement field that it is suitable for university or high school students or labelled it as an internship. We define flexible job offers as vacancies that are offered on the basis of flexible types of contracts—temporary or part-time contracts. Slovakia has suffered from high unemployment rates, whereby youth and the low-skilled are particularly disadvantaged, and since the regime change, the country has experienced a rapid expansion of tertiary education. In 2012, around 56% of young people aged 20–24 years were enrolled in tertiary education, but only about 5% of students under 25 years were working in Slovakia compared to 22% on average in the EU27 (Fabo and Beblavý 2015). Most Slovak universities offer distance learning degrees which allow students to combine (full-time) employment and studies (CVTI SR 2016). Between the years 2009 and 2014, distance learning students formed 24 to 33% of all registered university students. These students are typically older than full-time students, adding to the overall body of working students in the country. Flexible employment in Slovakia is also relatively rare. In 2014, only 5% of individuals worked in part-time employment in the total population, although roughly 11% of employed youth (15 to 24 years) had part-time contracts (Eurostat). Our key contribution lies in providing a labour market demand perspective on the student job market using online vacancies. Although online data has its limitations, research using this data for studying labour market issues is expanding (Edelman 2012; Askitas and Zimmermann 2015; Kureková et al. 2015). The question we investigate is important also from a policy perspective, as student employment in different forms has been promoted across Europe as a tool to fight youth unemployment. We need to understand more closely whether the student labour market equals the flexible labour market and how it is affected by macroeconomic conditions. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 explains the methodology and data. Section 4 is the empirical section. We then present a discussion of the results in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes.",3

As argued by Meghir and Phillips (2010), the impact of taxation on work incentives is one of the principal sources of inefficiency that may arise in a tax system. The fundamental issue is to assess how sensitive individuals’ work incentives are to changes in taxes and benefits. An analysis of labour supply behaviour is therefore a key element when evaluating the reforms of tax and transfer systems and the impact of different policies on changes in tax revenues, employment, and wealth redistribution. The way how labour force participation responds to the work incentive/disincentive effects of taxation and welfare programmes has attracted a lot of interest in both labour and public economics, and extensive research has resulted in numerous empirical results. For an overview of the literature that connects labour supply to income taxes and social benefits, see, among others, surveys by Meghir and Phillips (2010), Moffitt (2002), and Blundell and MaCurdy (1999). In this paper, a case study of the recent moving away from the flat-tax system in Slovakia is performed. The idea of introducing a flat-tax regime was widespread among Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, including Slovakia, at the beginning of the 2000s. Effective from 2004, the system of graduated personal income tax rates in Slovakia was simplified to a flat-tax rate of 19%. Only a few EU countries abandoned the flat tax and returned to the more progressive system by reintroducing tax brackets. These countries currently include Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Using the detailed microsimulation model and estimates of participation decisions (labour supply elasticities at the extensive margin), we quantify the effects of the tax system reform valid from 2013 that resulted in a marginal move away from the flat tax and to a positive first-round fiscal effect leading to an increase in revenues by 0.4% of GDP. This reform has been characterized by the re-introduction of two tax brackets and the unification (and increase) of the assessment basis for different social and health insurance contributions. In addition, we perform a simulation of the counterfactual scenario abolishing the flat-tax regime by introducing five tax brackets. In broad terms, this scenario simulates the personal income tax system valid in Slovakia before the flat-tax reform in 2004. By simulating these two scenarios with the same simulated first-round revenue effect, we show that the departure from a flat tax can have a different impact on selected population subgroups. The literature on the microeconometric estimations of labour supply elasticities is vast. A comprehensive overview in relation to the progress in the field of microsimulation models focused on labour supply, and methodological approaches can be found in Aaberge and Colombino (2014), who identify three main methodologies that have been adopted for modelling labour supply. A so-called reduced form approach embodies the hypothesis that labour supply (namely the observed hours of work) is a function of an exogenous net wage and net income. In general, it is not a precise representation of dependence, mainly due to the non-linearities of budget constraint. Moreover, corner solutions are usually ignored. The structural “marginalist” approach works with the conditions for a constrained maximum of the utility function; see, among others, a presentation of the methodology by Hausman (1981). The solution is obvious when convex budget sets and a consumption-leisure setup in the utility function are assumed. However, the method tends to be cumbersome if more complicated non-convex budget constraints are formulated. As a response, a discrete choice framework based on the concept of a “random utility maximization” presents an often-used alternative. This approach, introduced originally by van Soest (1995), has become rather standard in recent years. The utility maximization problem of individuals is reduced to a choice among a discrete set of options (yielding different utilities) such as working full time, working part time, or not working at all. Being inactive thus presents one of the alternatives, and the extensive and intensive margins could be directly estimated so that labour supply decisions could be evaluated even in the presence of non-convexities in budget constraints. Currently, a number of empirical studies conclude that an extensive margin is much more important than an intensive one. Existing studies usually evaluate labour supply elasticities of some special demographic subgroups (e.g. single individuals, married women, and couples). They usually find that wage elasticities are larger for women than for men. Looking at the magnitude of the estimated elasticities, the variation of the results found in the literature is sizeable. As noted by Bargain et al. (2014), differences across studies arise due to the distinct methodologies applied, including the underlying datasets used (administrative versus survey data) as well as the periods of study. An overview of recent estimates of labour supply elasticities in the US economy can be found in Chetty et al. (2013) and in McClelland and Mok (2012). For an overview of recent empirical evidence on labour supply elasticities in Europe and the USA, see Bargain et al. (2014). A brief survey and critique of different methods of the estimation of labour force participation elasticities can also be found in Heim (2008). However, despite the multitude of methodologies and information covered by existing studies, analyses focusing on CEE countries are rather scarce, and the case of Slovakia has been covered only in one paper so far. Chase (1995) compared labour force participation and wage elasticities between the communist and post-communist regimes in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. He showed that women’s participation in the labour market was higher under communism and concluded that the effects of changes in earnings are smaller in Slovakia compared to the Czech Republic. This is probably a result of the slower transformation of the Slovak economy. Looking at countries bordering Slovakia, Benczur et al. (2014) studied the labour supply at the extensive margin in Hungary. They modified an existing structural approach originally proposed by Hausman (1981) by taking the effects of the tax and benefit system directly into account. As regards the participation decision, they showed that wages, taxes, and transfers have a stronger influence on the participation decision of individuals that are older, low-skilled, married women, or women of child-bearing age. Galuscak and Katay (2014) followed the same methodology and provided empirical estimates for the Czech Republic, which are close to those reported for Hungary. Another analysis focused on the Czech Republic was performed by Bicakova et al. (2011), who provided estimates of participation probabilities separately for males and females by using a probit model. Compared to the study by Galuscak and Katay (2014), the estimated wage semi-elasticities of labour supply are substantially smaller, even though they are larger for women compared to men. Our estimates of participation elasticities are based on a model of labour supply where both taxes and social transfers are simultaneously taken into account. We estimate a labour supply model following the methodological approach introduced by Benczur et al. (2014). The behavioural response is based on the rationale of utility maximization, and using the classification provided by Aaberge and Colombino (2014), it can be seen as a “marginalist” approach. The model covers in minute detail the joint effects of tax and benefit systems on individuals’ net income. Using this modelling strategy, individual participation probabilities are determined by comparing incomes in two states: being in the labour force and being out of it. A key component of this approach is to precisely evaluate the disposable income of an individual, including non-labour income and social transfers received by a household in both states. In order to do so, the concept of the gains to work of an individual is introduced and defined as the difference between the net wage and the amount of welfare benefits lost due to taking up a full-time job. Employing this microeconometric method allows us to evaluate how the Slovak tax-benefit system can affect work incentives at the extensive margin. We document that participation probabilities are generally dependent on the level of net income and non-labour income, including social transfers. We find that a 1% increase in gains to work increases the probability of economic activity by 0.08 percentage points for males and 0.12 percentage points for females. Our findings are broadly in line with the results usually reported in the literature that frequently demonstrate that elasticities are large for women and very small for men. Taking into account tax and transfer system details valid from 2010 to 2012, a 1% increase in non-labour income decreases the probability of labour force participation by 0.04 percentage points for both genders. Policy initiatives likely to increase financial incentives to work should result in higher participation rates. Our results also show that, in line with findings for other countries, the low-skilled and females are the groups that are particularly responsive to changes in taxes and transfers. A major advantage of this method is that it allows an ex ante assessment of the counterfactual tax and transfer system reforms and permits an evaluation of specific government interventions and policies. The essential part of this modelling approach is the SIMTASK module, a microsimulation model of the Slovak tax and transfer system described in detail in Siebertova et al. (2016). This tool enables us to simulate individual tax liabilities and benefit entitlements in detail according to valid legislation or hypothetical reform. Labour supply models are extensively used in the literature to assess the effects of proposed tax system reforms. In such studies, the (hypothetical) introduction of a flat income tax and its impact on the supply of labour is frequently analysed, for example, Decoster et al. (2010) studied the introduction of a flat tax in Belgium and found that a flat-tax system could potentially increase labour supply. The introduction of linear taxation in Germany was examined in Beninger et al. (2006) and Fuest et al. (2008). Beninger et al. compared the effects in a computed manner by using a unitary and collective labour supply model. Fuest et al. used a behavioural microsimulation model and concluded that flat-tax reform could potentially increase employment although the magnitude of the increase was very small. Duncan and Sabirianova Peter (2010) analysed the Russian flat-tax reform of 2001 by using the difference-in-difference regression approach. As a reaction to tax changes, they identified an increase in the distribution of hours worked and that the reform increased the probability of finding a job. Compared to the studies mentioned above, we perform a kind of “reverse” analysis where we study the effects of departure from the flat-tax system. In our setup, the baseline is the flat-tax system valid in 2012 in Slovakia and we study the effects of reintroducing the tax brackets. By performing a microsimulation analysis of two scenarios, we show that a different way of moving away from the flat-tax system may have a different impact on labour supply decisions. We find that the recent departure from the flat-tax system in Slovakia effective from 2013 slightly reduced the average probability of being economically active. Although the hypothetical scenario of the abolition of the flat-tax system would have a higher average impact on the probability of being economically active, we show that the impact on participation probabilities in the two scenarios differs for selected population subgroups. In our analysis, we investigate the immediate or “day-after” effects of two reforms. A long-run general equilibrium analysis will be performed in a separate paper, since the discussion and execution of these issues is beyond the scope of the present study. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section provides an overview of the developments in the Slovak labour market and briefly describes the reforms to the tax-benefit system; Section 3 presents the modelling approach that was employed in this article; Section 4 follows with a data description and definition of variables used in the model; Section 5 depicts a short introduction of the Slovak tax and benefit system; Section 6 discusses the main results on estimated labour supply elasticities and provides tax reform simulations; and Section 7 offers a conclusion. In the Appendix, we list the definitions of the main variables and present the detailed results of our estimations.",1

A summary policy paper on four migration corridors between EU and non-EU member states,December 2016,Robert Holzmann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The share of individuals living outside their home country is increasing again after a temporary low in the 1960s, reaching 3.3 % of the world population in 2015 (up from 2.8 % in 2000), or an estimated 244 million people (United Nations—Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2015). In 2013, non-European Union (EU) citizens residing in EU-28 numbered 20.4 million or 4 % of the EU population; the share of the foreign-born population in 2013 was 7 % and is rising (Eurostat 2015). Overall, the world’s population seems to be in a new phase of migration movements, soon to match and exceed the migration peaks in mankind’s history (Manning 2013; Maunu 2014). This rising share of individuals living temporarily or permanently abroad broadly reflects three developments: (a) globalization, which besides the expanding trade in goods and services and the movement of capital also increasingly includes the international mobility of labor; (b) population aging, which in the most advanced countries implies a stagnating or even falling domestic population, creating pull/push effects from countries with an exploding young labor force; and (c) military conflicts, terrorism, and environmental degradation, all of which create waves of migrants in search of protection and better lives. As a result, the migrant stock numbers outlined above—impressive as they may be—underestimate the underlying labor mobility dynamics, that is, the number and increasing share of individuals who have lived or will live at least some part of their working or retired life outside their traditional country of residence. While this development is difficult to quantify due to individuals’ multiple migration spells, sometimes to multiple countries, indications from across the world are strong that time spent abroad is increasing. In the EU, the number of citizens who spend at least some of their adult life living outside their home country (as a student, intern, intra-firm and inter-firm mobile employee, labor migrant, or “snowbird” retiree) is definitely rising and may soon be as high as one out of every five individuals. Labor migration pressure toward Europe and labor market needs within Europe have been prevalent for some time and will intensify with population aging. These phenomena are conjectured to be particularly pronounced for the EU’s neighboring countries across the Mediterranean and build on migration movements that started as early as the 1960s. Based on past cross-border labor flows dating back several decades, an indicator of the magnitude and dynamics of pension benefit portability is the number or amount of pension benefits paid abroad as a share of total benefits. Table 1 offers available but not easily accessible information for the investigated labor-receiving countries: Austria, Germany, Belgium, and France.Footnote 1 For the smaller countries, Austria and Belgium, the share of number of benefits paid abroad is around 10 % and rising but not linearly. For the larger countries, France and Germany, the magnitudes are less but are rising markedly for Germany as measured by the number of beneficiaries abroad and rising slowly for France, as measured in benefit expenditure. The French euro value measure underestimates the magnitude compared to that of Belgium as it relates the flows sent abroad from a subset of pension schemes (that is, without civil servants and so on) to the total expenditures of all schemes (no comparable data accessible). The difference in benefit numbers and euro amounts flowing abroad represents the lower benefits for returning migrants, reflecting their shorter contribution period and often lower wage levels. For internationally mobile workers, two issues are crucial: (a) the access of workers and their families to social security benefits while working abroad and (b) the portability across borders of acquired rights/benefits in disbursement when they move on or retire to a different country of residency. Working foreigners and their families are basically interested in all social benefits and as a starting position of policy analysis, they should face no discrimination in benefit access compared to local workers. This policy perspective may change with regard to temporary migrants, particularly seasonal workers, in as far as their needs’ profile differs from that of long-term migrants (Holzmann and Pouget 2012). For foreign workers moving to another country for work, returning to their home country, or retiring in a third country, what matters is that benefits in disbursement or rights in accumulation are not forfeited (that is, benefits in disbursement are exportable and rights in accumulation are fully portable to the new country of residence). In principle, there should be little objection to benefit exportability and acquired rights portability if they are based on prior contributions and eligibility is established according to the contingency of the (social) insurance contract: they are essentially akin to property rights. Both migrant-sending and migrant-receiving countries should be interested in making benefits easily portable, as this enhances the advantages of an internationally mobile labor force. If factors for benefit eligibility or its termination (for example, number of children, end of unemployment, end of sickness, or end of life) cannot be properly observed abroad, however, then exportability of social benefits may become restricted. Furthermore, acquired rights based on contribution financing have a major savings component that by itself is not easily established; consequently, neither is the correct amount due for transfer. Even if acquired rights are fully aligned with individual contribution efforts, social benefits typically contain often a major redistributive component that is difficult to establish; even more difficult is determining how much to transfer across borders or to be repaid. This policy research paper focuses on the functioning of bilateral social security agreements (BSSAs) based on four migration corridor studies undertaken during 2013/2014 under a World Bank project. The paper thus fills an important institutional knowledge gap in the policy discourse of international labor mobility. While the portability of social security has received increasing attention over the last decade—starting essentially with Holzmann et al. (2005) and including a recent review of literature (Taha et al. 2015)—no attempt has been made to date to explore the functioning of its claimed key institution: BSSAs. Do BSSAs really deliver on what is expected and what are the key areas of concern and improvement? The Austria-Turkey, Germany-Turkey, Belgium-Morocco, and France-Morocco corridors represent well-established migration corridors that reflect both similarities and differences.Footnote 2 These similarities and differences across the selected corridors allow for some first conclusions and offer insights to formulate recommendations for policy reforms and next research steps. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a brief introduction to the basic conceptual issues on portability. The objectives, methodology, and process for the four corridor studies are presented in Section 3. Section 4 highlights the similarities and differences in the BSSAs’ workings across the four migration corridors. Section 5 summarizes the extent to which the BSSAs fulfill the three proposed evaluation criteria. Finally, Section 6 offers conclusions and recommendations.",8

Understanding the role and source of hours dispersion is crucial for the design of policies aimed at reducing inequality. On the one hand, policies that try to increase the hours for those with the lowest skills and wages and reduce them for those at the top of the distribution can be alternatives to ex post redistribution. On the other, the source of the dispersion is important for policy as it could be due to imposed constraints or the result of certain groups, such as women with young children, choosing to spend less time at work. This paper represents a first step in trying to understand those questions. We use data for the USA, the UK, Germany, and France to decompose earnings inequality and assess the roles played by the dispersion of wage and by inequality in hours in explaining cross-country differences and changes over time. By definition, an individual’s earnings are the product of her hourly wage rate and her hours of work. Using as our inequality index the mean log deviation (MLD), an inequality index belonging to the general entropy family, we decompose earnings inequality into the dispersion of hourly wages and a component capturing the contribution of hours. This term has itself two elements, a measure of the inequality of hours of work and a term capturing the correlation between hours and hourly wages. Hours of work can as a result magnify or dampen wage inequality depending on how dispersed hours are and of whether they are positively or negatively correlated with wages. Our sample covers the period 1989 to 2012 and considers both aggregate behavior as well as that of subgroups defined by gender and skill category. When we look at the distribution of hours, we find a surprising pattern. Figure 1 plots the distribution of hours worked by employed individuals in our four sample countries. The left-hand panels depict the USA and France, while the right-hand ones present the distributions in the UK and Germany. In order not to focus on a single, potentially unrepresentative, year, the data cover two 5-year periods, 1995–2000 and 2007–2012. The USA and France exhibit fairly concentrated distributions, with about 30 % of individuals declaring to work around 40 h a week in 1995-2000. For the latter period, this fraction falls slightly in the USA, while France exhibits twin peaks due to the introduction of the 35-h week. In sharp contrast, Germany and the UK present fairly dispersed distributions, with much thicker tails at the bottom and, especially, at the top.
 Distribution of hours worked by country. Source: Authors’ calculations; see Section 3 below These differences in dispersion are reflected in the way in which wages and hours affect the distribution of earnings, as captured by our decomposition of the mean log deviation. Although our results indicate that in all countries the dispersion of working time is an unequalizing factor that increases earnings inequality over and above that implied by wages, differences across countries are substantial. In the USA and France, the overall contribution of hours to earnings inequality is moderate, with wages accounting for at least two thirds of the inequality in earnings. In contrast, hours play a crucial role in the UK and Germany, being responsible for between 28 and 40 % of the dispersion in earnings, respectively. We pay particular attention to the covariance between wages and hours, which exhibits very different patterns across countries and over time. Wages and hours move together in the Anglo-Saxon economies, while they are negatively correlated in France and Germany at the start of the sample period, implying that part of the dispersion in wages was offset by the fact that those with the lowest earning potential spend more hours at work, the effect being particularly strong in France. These countries exhibit, however, an increase in the covariance over time, and by the end of the period, those with higher wages also work longer hours. In the case of Germany, this change has accounted for half of the increases in earnings inequality; in France, it is the major culprit. Although some of the differences are related to the skill and gender composition of employment, between-group inequality in hours is only a small part of the story. Observed changes over time are largely due to the behavior of unskilled men and skilled women. Hours inequality has increased for the two groups, and both exhibit a marked increase in the covariance which has gone from being negative at the start of the period to null or positive. As a result, the equalizing force due to those with lower wages working longer hours seems to have been eroded over time. Our paper contributes to two strands of literature. As mentioned before, there is a substantial literature on cross-country differences in working hours, and we add to this a new dimension by focusing on hours inequality. We also contribute to our understanding of what drives earnings dispersion by focusing on the neglected role of hours. Our paper is closely related to the analysis by Gottschalk and Danzinger (2005) of the relationship between individual wage rate inequality and household income inequality in the USA. They examine the various elements that determine household income inequality and emphasize, among other things, the importance of considering the distribution of hours. As in our results, they find an important role for changes in the hours worked by women. Our analysis has a very different focus as we provide an international comparison rather than the more detailed analysis of a single country that they consider. Our analysis is also related to Bell and Freeman (2001) and Bowles and Park (2005) who argue that greater wage inequality is associated with higher average hours of work, implying that the increase in wage inequality that occurred over the last decades is likely to have spurred an increase in hours worked. We argue that the impact of this mechanism on overall inequality depends on two channels, how unequal the hours response is and on the correlation of hours worked and hourly wages. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our empirical approach and presents the decomposition that we use and is followed by a section describing the data. Section 4 presents our main findings, while we conclude in Section 5.",14

Whether the results of various studies imply that German labour market policy in the last decade can thus be regarded as a role model for other countries seems to depend on policy makers’ expectations for these reforms. In particular, it is debatable whether the reforms were expected to boost the entire German economy and raise its competitiveness. However, it is clear that one of the main objectives of the reforms was explicit in its mandate to improve matching processes on the German labour market (Hartz et al. 2002) because Germany suffered from a high degree of structural unemployment in the early 2000s. In this paper, I present comprehensive details regarding the development of the job-matching function and its performance before and after the reforms took effect. The German labour market reforms were implemented in four stages and spanned the period from 2003 to 2005. The laws that were implemented are referred to as Hartz I to Hartz IV and were named after the head of the expert commission that worked out the substantial propositions for the German labour market reforms (Hartz et al. 2002). In January 2003, the first two reform stages were implemented (Hartz I and II). The third stage, Hartz III, followed in January 2004 and the last stage, Hartz IV, was implemented in January 2005. Additionally and following these reform stages, in 2006, the maximum number of months of unemployment benefits was reduced. Few studies have shed light on the direction and structure of the reform’s effects on job matching productivity. Fahr and Sunde (2009) reported better matching for the aggregated German labour market after the first three reform stages (Hartz I/II and Hartz III) had been implemented. Klinger and Rothe (2012) used newer and richer data, which enabled these authors to analyse the last reform stage (Hartz IV in 2005) and to distinguish between long- and short-term unemployed. Overall, these authors also found that the reforms had positive effects on matching efficiency, particularly after Hartz I/II (2003) and III (2004) were introduced. In addition, they found stronger reform effects for the long-term unemployed. However, the last reform stage (Hartz IV)—consisting of a fundamental change in the tax-financed and means-tested unemployment benefit scheme—did not lead to further positive effects. The same authors explain this finding using statistical effects because the number of unemployed increased sharply in 2005 due to the changes under Hartz IV. Hillmann (2009), who also used newer data, found that Hartz IV had positive effects; her analysis constructed the reform dummy differently for Hartz IV.1 Finally, Klinger and Weber (2014) used data from 1979 to 2009 to analyse the inward shift of the Beveridge curve after the reform years and were able to generally confirm the positive effects of the reforms on matching efficiency, although these authors also found that the positive trend of matching efficiency came to an end in 2009. Clearly, these studies have shed light on the temporal and structural properties of the effects of these reforms. However, until now, it has not been known whether the positive changes in matching efficiency can be observed for all jobs or how the matching efficiencies changed in the relevant partial labour markets and particularly in occupational labour markets. Another relevant question is whether the effects changed temporarily or permanently during (extreme) economic situations, such as the 2008/2009 financial crisis. This paper complements previous research by estimating the parameters of a macroeconomic matching function on the basis of detailed, high-frequency and more recent administrative data for the 2000–2011 period; thus, it includes the span of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. As this study’s first step, I deliver an exact and detailed analysis of the evolution of the matching productivity. Therefore, this study also contributes to the strand of theoretic literature (compare, e.g. with previous studies by Krause and Uhlig, 2012; Krebs and Scheffel, 2013, 2014; Launov and Wälde, 2015) that evaluates further effects of labour market reforms, e.g. on unemployment and others, and refers to the estimated changes in the matching efficiencies (like in Fahr and Sunde 2009; Klinger and Rothe 2012). In the second step, I present an analyses of occupational labour markets because it is known that matching efficiency varies in different occupational labour markets, as shown in Fahr and Sunde (2006); Stops and Mazzoni (2010). To distinguish occupational labour markets, I use the German occupational classification scheme according to Blossfeld (1983). It is possible to identify the temporal evolution of matching productivity by estimating yearly time fixed effects that can be interpreted as year-specific deviations from average matching productivity during the observation period. To identify the temporal evolution of matching productivity in occupational labour markets, I complement the model with interaction dummy variables that combine yearly and occupational labour market effects. My analysis corroborates the previous findings of positive changes in the matching productivity during and after all the reform stages and clarifies that there are also positive changes after Hartz IV. Matching productivity hardly increased during the recession in 2009; in specifications without a control for the business cycle, a significant ‘crisis’ dip is observable. Furthermore, the results reveal positive changes in the matching productivity during and after the reform years in all occupational labour markets. However, the results for the point estimates suggest some differences in more recent changes of matching productivity, but the changes from year to year are not significant. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, I describe some relevant facts regarding the German labour market reforms and their (theoretical) implications for matching productivity. Then, I present the theoretical foundations of the macroeconomic matching function, the interpretation of its parameters, and, finally, information about the occupational labour market structure the analysis will be related to. Section 3 presents details about the data used for the analysis and certain descriptive key statistics. Section 4 explains the empirical strategy and reports and discusses estimation results. Robustness checks that generally confirm these results and that are based on both another theoretical perspective of job matching and higher aggregated data are reported in Section 5. Section 6 contains the main conclusions.",10

Tagkalakis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The high and persistent unemployment rate is one of the most pressing challenges that Greece is currently facing. The unemployment rate increased from about 8 % in 2008 to 27.5 % in 2013; it then declined slightly to 26.5 % in 2014. According to the European Commission (2016), the unemployment rate declined to 25.1 % in 2015 and is projected to decline further, reaching to 24.0 % in 2016. However, it still remains at unsustainably high levels. The unemployment problem is particularly acute among young individuals, who currently face unemployment rates close to 50 %. Moreover, more than two thirds of the currently unemployed are without a job for a period of more than 12 months, so they are classified as long-term unemployed. The unemployment problem can have severe economic and social repercussions, in terms of the marginalization of the people and groups involved in it, and in terms of the human capital erosion, which undermines the future growth prospects of the Greek economy. Moreover, high and persistent unemployment puts additional strains on the social security system and the public finances in Greece. Motivated by the above developments, this paper investigates the determinants of unemployment dynamics in Greece. In particular, it studies the role played by inflows and outflows in shaping recent unemployment developments. Moreover, the paper examines the relationship between unemployment and vacancies (Beveridge curve) in Greece in order to understand whether the rise in unemployment reflects cyclical and/or structural developments. According to Shimer (2005) and Hall (2005), the outflow rate has been found to have the primary role in accounting for unemployment dynamics in the USA. Shimer (2012) has shown that since 1948, the outflow rate from unemployment has accounted for three fourths of the fluctuation in the unemployment rate in the USA and the inflow rate to unemployment for one fourth. Since 1987, the contribution of the outflow rate is estimated to have reached about 90 % of the variability of the US unemployment, while the contribution from the inflow rate is considered to be quantitatively irrelevant. This induces Shimer to conclude that there are substantial fluctuations in the outflow rate over the business cycle, while the inflow rate is acyclic. Fujita and Ramey (2009) and Elsby et al. (2009) using US data and Petrogolo and Pissarides (2008) and Smith (2011) using UK data have challenged the conclusions of Shimer (2005, 2012) by showing that inflows to unemployment are quantitatively relevant for unemployment dynamics. Moreover, according to Smith (2011), at times of rising unemployment, the inflow rate is the most relevant determinant of unemployment dynamics, while at times of declining unemployment, the outflow rate matters the most for unemployment dynamics. Nevertheless, Elsby et al. (2013) have shown that there is a natural partition of OECD economies in two groups, i.e., those that have more and less flexible labor markets. Anglo-Saxon and Nordic economies display high exit rates from unemployment, with monthly hazard rates exceeding 20 %, whereas Continental European economies have exit rates that are less than 10 %. Turning to inflow rates to unemployment, Anglo-Saxon and Nordic economics have monthly inflow rates of about 1.5 %, while the inflow rates decline to 0.5–1 % in Continental Europe. In addition, Elsby et al. (2013) show that the relative contribution of inflow and outflow rates to unemployment fluctuations is about 20:80 in Anglo-Saxon economies a result closer to the earlier US findings. In case of Nordic and Continental European economies, the authors observe a 50:50 inflow/outflow split. Bonthuis et al. (2013) study unemployment and vacancy developments in the euro area at the aggregate and country level in order to identify whether the recent rise in unemployment reflects cyclical or structural factors such as growing mismatches across euro area labor markets. They find a significant outward shift in the euro area Beveridge curve during the Great Recession, but there is considerable heterogeneity at the country level. For example, there is an outward shift in the Beveridge curve for Spain and France and an inward shift for Germany. In case of Greece, there is some evidence of an outward shift in the Beveridge curve during the recent crisis. Following the abovementioned studies, it is very important to identify the determinants of the unemployment movements in recent years in Greece. If the changes in the inflow rate to unemployment are the most important factor behind the unemployment fluctuation, then a pick-up in economic activity will contribute to the stabilization and eventual decline of the unemployment rate. However, if the changes in the outflow rate from the unemployment matter as well, then economic recovery will result in lower unemployment only if it is associated with job creation. In addition, if there is an outward shift in the Beveridge curve, then this would imply growing mismatches in the labor market, possibly reflecting the rise in long-term unemployment. In this case, a jobless recovery would be associated with persistently high unemployment rate. Such a development could lead to the erosion of human capital and the deterioration of the long-term prospects of the Greek economy. We use Labor Force Survey (LFS) data over the period 2001 Q1–2015 Q2 to investigate the determinants of unemployment dynamics in Greece. Building on Smith (2011), we find that the inflow rate to unemployment accounts for the biggest part of unemployment variability over the sample period. However, focusing on the most recent crisis years, we find evidence pointing to the opposite direction, i.e., that the outflow rate from unemployment is a very important determinant of the variance of unemployment. The economic recession alongside labor market reforms raised the inflow rate to and decreased the outflow rate from unemployment in the early crisis years (until mid-2012). Thereafter, the gradual normalization of economic conditions and the adoption of further structural reforms raised the outflow rate and led to drop in the inflow rate to unemployment, contributing to the slight fall in the unemployment rate in 2014–2015. Impulse response functions based on a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) analysis provide evidence for the negative effects of economic recession on the unemployment dynamics, i.e., the inflow rate to unemployment rises and the outflow rate from unemployment drops. In addition, the results of the SVAR analysis indicate that the negative effects of economic recession on the outflow from unemployment are slightly more protracted compared to those on the inflow rate. Cumulative dynamic multiplier functions from a VAR model suggest that structural reforms at times of deepening recession can aggravate the unemployment problem by raising the inflow and lowering the outflow rate, while structural reforms undertaken at times of gradual recovery or decelerating recession can be associated with an increase in the outflow and a decline in the inflow rate. Building on the work of Bonthuis et al. (2013), we study unemployment and vacancy developments in Greece from 2004 Q1 till 2015 Q2. Our results are suggestive of the presence of an inverse relationship between unemployment and vacancies in Greece, which is driven by the post-2008 developments. The decline in, and the sectoral reallocation of, economic activity during the crisis years alongside with the adoption of less stringent employment protection legislation raised the unemployment rate and led to an outward shift in the Beveridge curve. However, the responsiveness of unemployment to vacancy developments has increased on account of structural reforms, which has led to an improvement in the efficiency of the matching process. This should facilitate a more rapid decline in unemployment when economic conditions improve and labor demand increases. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the data information and we construct the inflow rate to and the outflow rate from unemployment. In Section 3, we present the covariance contributions of inflow and outflow rates to unemployment variance. Section 4 discusses the unemployment and job vacancy developments in Greece and presents econometric evidence for the presence of a negatively sloping Beveridge curve. We then discuss in Section 5 the impact of economic recession on unemployment dynamics by means of a SVAR analysis, while in Section 6, we present evidence for the persistence of the unemployment rate following an increase in the inflow rate. The next section presents a first assessment of the impact of structural reforms on the inflow and outflow rates. Section 8 summarizes the main findings and concludes.",

Andersen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Great Recession was a source of large shocks generated outside the labour market but which via steep declines in aggregate demand had substantial employment effects. In no less than 13 countries, GDP dropped by more than 5 % between 2008 and 2009, and unemployment rates increased by about 2.5 percentage points between 2008 and 2010 on average for OECD countries. The crisis has proved long - lived, and employment rates have not yet recovered in most countries. The crisis has severe direct social and economic consequences, but it also raises concerns that unemployment will become persistent as seen in earlier crises, especially in European countries. Since the crisis caused aggregate demand to fall, attention turned to aggregate demand management policies as the remedy to decrease unemployment. This type of policy has not been in vogue since the heydays of Keynesian economics. Dismal experience with demand management policies during the 1970s and 1980s in combination with unemployment becoming persistent turned attention to structural issues, first wage formation and later search incentives. The consensus view on stabilization prior to the Great Recession was that the main tool is monetary policy,Footnote 1 confining fiscal stabilization policies to the automatic stabilizers. Discretionary fiscal policy actions should be employed only as an “escape clause” in particularly dire situations, which under any sensible definition would include the Great Recession. Although monetary policies have been very expansionary in response to the Great Recession, they have not been sufficiently effective,Footnote 2 and this has brought fiscal policy back to the fore. It has been questioned whether fiscal policy reactions have been sufficiently strong—a difficult question to answer generally since the fiscal space for an active fiscal stabilization policy has been severely restricted in a number of countries.Footnote 3 In particular, automatic stabilizers have been praised, and the crisis induced calls to strengthen automatic stabilizers by the OECD, IMF and EU Commission. The popularity of automatic stabilizers arises because they are rule based and do not suffer from information and implementation lags. Moreover, they are by nature symmetric; that is, they do not suffer from a pro-cyclical bias or any of the other problems associated with discretionary policies. The virtues of automatic stabilizers are commonly shared and therefore the calls to strengthen them in the wake of the Great Recession. But what is the source of the automatic stabilizers? The size of automatic stabilizers is not a direct result of macro design but rather a by-product of policy choices in relation to tax, social and labour market policies. The automatic stabilizers are therefore the net outcome of the design of the social safety net and taxation schemes. This points out that it is not possible to make a sharp distinction between, on the one hand, fiscal policies and, on the other hand, welfare/labour/social policies. Calls to strengthen automatic stabilizers also point to a paradox. There has been widespread focus on the (dis)incentive effects of taxes, unemployment benefits and other forms of social transfers. The quest has been to reduce the marginal effective tax rate on work (intensive margin) and make work pay (extensive margin). However, reforms aiming at strengthening the incentive structure may as an unintentional by-product weaken automatic stabilizers. Ultimately, these choices depend on where to situate the economy on the trade-off between incentives and insurance/redistribution. In theory, this is well known and where any discussion of the design of e.g. the unemployment insurance scheme starts (Bailey (1978)). Yet, one may question whether theoretical work and policy discussions have focussed too much on one side of the trade-off. There are numerous studies of the incentive problems arising from taxation and unemployment insurance but only scant research on their effects for insurance. This questions how well the trade-off has actually been researched. It is somewhat paradoxical to note that automatic stabilizers are praised in a macro perspective, but their sources are criticized in discussions on incentive structures. Perhaps this arises from a tendency to separate labour market policies from fiscal stabilization policies due to Musgrave’s famous distinction between the allocative, distributional and stabilization effects of policy. However, modern literature has shown that this is not a meaningful split. Distribution issues cannot be separated from insurance. Schemes which redistribute ex post (i.e. based on employment status, income, etc.) will ex ante perform an insurance function; see e.g. Varian (1980) and Eaton and Rosen (1980). The insurance effects both have direct welfare implications and may be efficiency enhancing in the presence of market imperfections. The insurance effects pertaining at the individual level in the case of idiosyncratic shocks accumulate to macro effects encapsulated in automatic stabilizers released by common or aggregate shocks. This paper discusses both the source and role of automatic stabilizers and therefore how fiscal and labour market policies interact. The part of automatic stabilizers related to employment variations is shown to depend fundamentally on the participation tax. This brings forth the tight interrelation between distribution/insurance, incentives and macroeconomic stability. The policy dilemma is that increasing participation taxes to strengthen automatic stabilizers may worsen incentive problems, which naturally poses the question “are there any ways to mitigate this dilemma?” The paper discusses how to maintain/strengthen automatic stabilizers without jeopardizing incentives via the design of the social safety net (workfare) or by building business cycle conditions into it (business cycle contingencies).Footnote 4 A particular concern is whether short-run stability via automatic stabilizers is achieved at the costs of more sluggish adjustment and thus persistence in employment. Despite the virtues of automatic stabilizers, the fundamental question is what aggregate demand management can accomplish in a labour market context. Most macro analyses implicitly assume labour to be homogeneous, an assumption which is decreasingly accurate.Footnote 5 In particular, in relation to the risks of marginalization (long-term unemployment), aggregate demand management policies are not well targeted and more specific labour market policies may be called for. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 clarifies some key properties of automatic stabilizers, and Section 3 discusses their source and in particular the relation to participation taxes. Section 4 considers ways to strengthen automatic stabilizers without jeopardizing incentives, and Section 5 discusses whether automatic stabilizers can be a source of persistence in the labour market. Section 6 asks to what extent demand management policies are well targeted from a labour market perspective, and Section 7 offers a few concluding remarks.",1

It has remained a topical issue among economic analysts and policy experts in the face of political headwinds, since most macroeconomists agree today that the incomplete nature of the EMU, and the absence of a counter-cyclical fiscal capacity in particular, makes the single currency unsustainable in its current form. However, there can still be a debate about what should be the next step. This paper is not suggesting that establishing unemployment insurance at the EMU level would be the only necessary step to make the single currency sustainable, or that it would be a remedy for all ills in the Eurozone. Focusing on divergence, it explores the economic and social problems associated with the absence of an EMU fiscal capacity, and the existing options in the area of automatic stabilisers. Following an overview of key technical questions of how to build unemployment insurance in the context of the Eurozone, it highlights the multifaceted nature of this policy. It is a possible element of economic and monetary reform, while it forms part of the social dimension as well. When political capital is limited, the availability of an instrument that could make a positive impact on both economic and social sides of the crisis should be appreciated by decision makers.",6

Goldin (2006) refers to the mass incorporation of women into the workforce during the 1970s as the “quiet revolution.” However, in spite of this revolutionary process, gender differences still persist. Family issues play a crucial role in understanding the gender differences observed in the labor market. Women combine employment with home responsibilities to a much larger extent than their male partners.Footnote 2 This is particularly so in some countries, such as those of Southern Europe, because of the lack of access to proper childcare provisions (Del Boca 2002), low levels of participation by men in household tasks (Bettio and Villa 1998; De Laat and Sevilla-Sanz 2011), and/or low levels of social assistance (Adserà 2004). This gender asymmetry in reconciling family life and work affects women’s decisions with respect to labor supply, human capital accumulation, and hence their labor market performance (see Ahn and Mira 2001; Bertola et al. 2007; Adserà 2005; De la Rica and Iza 2005, among others). The increase in the working-age population and the high-educationFootnote 3 level achieved by women in the past few decades make it essential to consider women as a fundamental part of the workforce. Governments and institutions can play an important role in creating the legal framework for improving women’s choices and their participation in the economy, as well as in helping societies to break away from the more traditional gender role attitudes that affect women’s behavior in many countries. Indeed, in the past few decades many governments have adopted policies aimed at promoting gender equality and equity in the workplace. This paper seeks to evaluate one such policy implemented in Spain in 1999. The policy under analysis, called Law 39/99, was particularly aimed at giving parents with children under 6 years of age the right to reduce their work schedule with an equivalent wage reduction.Footnote 4 The spirit of this law is to make it more affordable for parents to stay in the labor market and take care of their children by reducing their work schedules.Footnote 5 Furthermore, as explained below, workers who avail themselves of this policy enjoy more protection against dismissals than the rest. This may undoubtedly entail some undesirable effects that the policy makers did not expect. Those effects are also addressed in the paper. The aim of the paper is twofold: First, we evaluate the immediate impact of the law, in particular its direct and indirect effects. By direct effects we mean the extent to which the law has led to an increase in part-time working among parents with children aged under 6. With respect to the indirect effects, we explore whether employers behave strategically towards potential users of the law in the following sense: If the family policy is costly for firms and in addition its users are more protected against dismissals than other workers, some reaction from employers might be expected. In particular, they might tend to reduce the indefinite hiring of potential users of the law and instead offer fixed-term contracts—whose potential costs are much smaller.Footnote 6 Hence, the question to be answered with regard to this indirect effect is whether the law increased the probability of being hired under a fixed-term (rather than an indefinite) contract for potential future law users. To answer these two questions, we focus on salaried employees using the Spanish Current Population Survey (SCPS), the most representative cross-sectional sample of the labor force in Spain. We use individual information on working hours and compare the use of reduced hours among workers affected by the law (treatment group) with those not affected by it (comparison group) just before and after the passing of the law (diff-in-diff strategy). The second aim of the study is to characterize the users who have resorted to the family-friendly policy since its approval (1999) and measure the extent to which the Great Recession has led to a change in the number of policy users and in their personal and job profiles. In principle, it might be expected that in a recession framework uncertainty about the possibility of being laid off might lead to an increase in the use of work time reduction as a measure for providing higher job protection against dismissal. But work time reduction entails a proportional reduction in wages, and this negative effect on income is likely to be more important in a recession context. In addition, fear of reprisals at work during a period of economic instability for the firm might also discourage workers from requesting work reductions for childcare issues. To detect individuals who make use of the law, i.e., who change their time schedule for childcare issues, we need to follow workers over time. We use a rich longitudinal dataset obtained from Spanish Social Security records (Continuous Sample of Work Histories (CSWH)) that covers workers’ employment histories and census registration data including family characteristics. The dataset contains information on personal and job characteristics before and after workers have children and thus detects actual users of the law and their profiles. Our results indicate, in the first place, that the law increased the likelihood of working part-time for eligible mothers—i.e., mothers with children under 6—by 18 % compared to the similar non-target comparison group. Furthermore, the law applied only to mothers with indefinite contracts. In addition, we find negative indirect effects for potential users of the law: When comparing hiring practices as regards potential users of the law (target group), i.e., non-mothers of childbearing age, with a similar non-target comparison group (non-fathers of fertile age), we find that the law increased the probability of the target group being hired under fixed-term contracts by almost 18 %. Third, the 2008–2013 recession reduced the probability of the law being resorted to by about 13 %. The related literature on the evaluation of the Family-Friendly Law 33/99 is scarce. Fernández-Kranz and Rodriguez-Planas (2014) are closer to the first part of our study, although they use the 2010 CSWH to evaluate the wage and employment effects of such law. As we describe below in the data section, we consider this dataset inappropriate to evaluate the impact of a law which took place in 1999, as administrative data of 2010 is not representative of Social Security records of more than 10 years before.Footnote 7 They find that the law implied the substitution of fertile-age women away from good jobs and a decrease of their relative wages. In a different but related study, Fernández-Kranz and Rodriguez-Planas (2011a, b) examine the implications of reducing time schedule for women’s subsequent earning trajectories, distinguishing by their type of contract. Using the CSWH and focusing on prime-aged women strongly attached to the Spanish labor market, they find that the PT/FT hourly wage differential is larger and more persistent among fixed-term contract female workers. However, this study does not explicitly address the use of part-time for childcare issues, and hence, it is not related to the use of the Law. Regarding related literature on the impact of the Great Recession on family-friendly policies, our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to address the use of reduced-work schedule for childcare issues, although the crisis and subsequent austerity policies have reawakened debate on the gender impact of the economic cycle (see Rake 2009; Swaffield 2011). Rubery and Rafferty (2013) explore the trends in women’s employment position during the recession, providing the support that gender segregation across sectors is the prime factor shaping outcomes. The recession and its aftermaths are having differential but still damaging effects on different groups of women. Other studies, such as Aparicio and González (2014), focus on the impact of the crisis on the health of newborn babies. They find evidence that mothers-to-be engage in healthier behaviors when unemployment is high, which might explain the observed improvement in their babies’ health during the recession. In addition, De la Rica and Rebollo-Sanz (2015) analyze the different transitions from and to unemployment during different phases of the business cycle in the segmented Spanish labor market, using the CSWH. They find very significant gender differences in these transitions because males are found to respond more intensively to the business cycle than women. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Spanish Law 39/1999. Section 3 presents the databases (SCPS and CSWH). Section 4 analyzes the effects of the family-friendly policy on employment outcomes for the eligible population and the unintended effects of the law after its implementation on the non-eligible population of the policy. Section 5 presents profiles of users and outlines the impact of 2008 in Spain on the use of the law. Section 6 sums up and concludes.",4
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of European Labor Studies,29 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40174-016-0058-1,Foreign ownership and its effects on employment and wages: the case of Sweden,December 2016,Runar Brännlund,Jonas Nordström,Dick Svedin,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The purpose of this paper is to examine how foreign ownership of companies acting in Sweden has affected the employment and wage setup. Although Sweden has a tradition of labour market agreements such as collective bargaining between unions and employers, the assumption in the present paper is that foreign-owned firms are not as committed to this “social contract” as domestically owned firms are, which makes the threat of foreign-owned business activities moving out of Sweden credible. This line of reasoning reflects public debate on this issue. According to our hypothesis, then, foreign ownership will exert a downward pressure on wages in a unionised labour market. Sweden, with its traditionally strong unions, provides an interesting case study for this hypothesis. Due to globalisation as well as the deregulation of capital markets, capital movements have increased steadily in recent years. As a result, the number of people employed in foreign-owned firms has also increased rapidly: in Sweden, for example, the share of individuals employed in firms controlled by foreign owners (defined in this paper as a firm where a foreign owner holds more than half of the voting rights of the enterprise in question, either directly or through a parent company) more than quadrupled between 1980 and 2005 (see Fig. 1). At the end of 2005, over 20 % of all employees in Sweden were working for foreign-owned firms; for the manufacturing sector studied here, the share was substantially higher. Share and number of foreign companies in Sweden and their share of employed individuals, 1980–2010. Source: Swedish Agency for Growth Policy Analysis
 Such an increase of foreign control may well have affected labour market conditions. In a number of countries, fear that foreign ownership could lead to worsened labour market conditions has been an important component of the domestic policy debate, and this concern has been reflected in the literature as well. Authors such as Bughin and Vannini (1995) and Radulescu and Robson (2008), for example, take it as given that foreign-owned firms have the option of ignoring local unions. Cowling and Sugden (1987), Huizinga (1990), and Ramsay (1995), similarly, take for granted that increased importance of international investment flows will reduce the bargaining power of national unions. The implicit hypothesis is that a switch from domestic to foreign ownership has a detrimental effect on a trade union’s bargaining power, as foreign owners can make more credible threats than domestic owners of moving the activity abroad, and that this may then affect both employment and wages. To accomplish our objectives, we will specify a model that is essentially based on the assumption that the Swedish labour market can be described as one where trade unions and employers bargain over both employment and wages (Alogoskoufis and Manning 1991). The intuition is that bargaining power, which affects both equilibrium wage and equilibrium employment levels, may be modelled as a function of various industry and labour market characteristics, including type of ownership. To test our hypothesis, we used a panel data set of 242 firms operating during the period 1980–2005. One reason that we chose to conduct the analysis with a bargaining model of this kind is that Sweden has a long history of high trade union density among workers in manufacturing industries; apart from a few years in the 1980s when Denmark’s trade union density was slightly higher, Sweden’s trade union density has been the highest among the industrialised countries throughout the period studied in this paper. This also means that to the extent that unions’ bargaining power is affected by increased foreign ownership, this effect should be more pronounced in Sweden—where unions’ bargaining power was clearly very high to begin with—than in countries where unions were never particularly strong in the first place. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents previous literature in the field, while Section 3 outlines the theoretical model underlying our empirical model. Here, we do not explicitly take foreign ownership into consideration but instead focus on how employment and wages may be determined in a unionised economy and how the respective bargaining power of the union and the employer may affect wage and employment outcomes. In Section 4, we present the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 5 sets up our econometric model, which takes foreign ownership into account. The results from the econometric model are presented in Section 6, after which Section 7 offers some concluding comments.",5

Unemployment increased, in some cases dramatically, and even those countries that avoided widespread lay-offs through short-time working or partial unemployment schemes now face greater labour market segmentation. Non-standard employment has become more important, with temporary jobs sometimes the first to go when the crisis hit but more common among those then created, and with part-time employment growing throughout the crisis (Leschke 2012). Net job destruction coincided with an increase in precarious employment, especially involuntary part-time work (European Commission (2013a, 2014)). However, to date, concern about these developments has focused primarily on the implications for the individual in the labour market, both in terms of current pay penalty and chances of progressing in the future. The impact on poverty affecting their households has received little attention, even though part-time workers are known to be more likely than full-timers to be poor, especially when involuntarily part-time (Horemans and Marx 2013). This neglect is perhaps linked to the fact that in-work poverty as a whole has not generally risen during the crisis (Marx and Nolan 2014). That is the gap this paper seeks to fill, by reviewing what happened to the extent of part-time work, and particularly involuntary part-time, across EU member states and investigating its impact on poverty for those affected and on the extent of in-work poverty more broadly. The paper is organized as follows: we first consider the complex nature of in-work poverty and examine why part-time workers are more likely to be poor.

(2013) have dubbed the ‘Great Recession’, with a particular focus on the period when austerity started to take hold. This article follows up on Marchal et al. (2014a), in which we assessed how MIP schemes weathered the onset and initial phase of the crisis. That article started from the observation that just prior to the crisis social safety nets were not in the best of shape in Europe. Minimum income provisions had by and large deteriorated during the two decades preceding the crisis, as social policy in many EU countries had come to rest on the idea that work offered the best way out of poverty. Suddenly confronted with unemployment levels not seen in a generation, the relevance of adequate protection arrangements acquired a new level of significance. We did find evidence of efforts to raise the social floor right after the onset of the crisis, a finding also confirmed for other fields of the welfare state (see, e.g. Marchal et al. 2014a; Clasen et al. 2012; Gauthier 2010; International Labour Organization, World Bank 2012; Isik-Dikmelik 2012; Vis et al. 2011). Yet the size of these increases did not point towards a sea change in MIP policies. All in all, these first supportive measures seemed relatively short-lived, as additional efforts became rarer from the end of 2009 onwards. Meanwhile, soaring national debts had harsh impacts on countries’ finances and their position on financial markets. A hesitant recovery proved short-lived, a double-dip recession ensued and EU countries were confronted with prolonged low, or in some cases negative growth rates. Countries that had to apply for financial support had to follow stringent austerity trajectories. Also elsewhere, European governments were concerned with reducing debts and deficits while EU budgetary control strengthened, through the Excessive Deficit and Macro-Economic Imbalances Procedures. In this paper, we focus on what happened to MIP in the later stage of the crisis, as the austerity tide washed over Europe. In Marchal et al. (2014a), we hypothesized that the changes for the better would be short-lived, as budget austerity was already looming on the horizon. Here, we test that conjecture. This research question is relevant in its own right as social indicators show a continuing need for income replacement and protection benefits (Eurostat 2015). MIP schemes, in the shape of means-tested social assistance benefits, play a key role in preventing severe financial hardship when markets fail and when social security rights are not available, inadequate or depleted. In addition, we know little about changes to MIP schemes and—more generally—social floors. Whereas some authors consider these schemes to be more prone to retrenchment due to their vulnerable target group (Korpi and Palme 1998; Nelson 2007), others hold that given their small budgetary impact and enormous social relevance, social floors will be relatively untouched (Pierson 1994, 1996). Interestingly, this latter position seems to be confirmed by some of the major players within austerity-ridden Europe: the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund (European Commission 2008; International Monetary Fund 2012). The extended time frame of this paper (until 2012, 5 years into the crisis) as well as the relatively large number of countries included (23 EU countries) allow us to assess how MIP fared after the initial crisis shock wore off. We focus explicitly on minimum income schemes, an area that arguably offers a clear indication of the changes at the floor of the welfare state. Moreover, the declined generosity of unemployment insurance arrangements (Clasen and Clegg 2011) and the surge in nonstandard work may have increased the potential significance of minimum income schemes (Immervoll 2012). We build on purpose-collected policy data, capturing in a systematic way and in significant detail policy changes in the area of MIP as these affect generosity, accessibility and obligations. In the next section, we provide a brief overview of the existing literature on crisis measures and social policy change, particularly in the area of MIP. The third section presents the data on which this paper is based and the analytical framework used. We proceed by presenting the measures taken in the countries of our sample and assessing these measures in a cross-temporal and cross-sectional light. Next, we discuss the overall pattern of crisis responses and assess whether some countries distinguish themselves by the type of measures they have enacted. Finally, we conclude.",9

Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal,Jose Alberto Molina,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, we analyse the important relationship between health inequality and the time devoted to different activities by workers in six European countries. Despite that the prior literature has focused on the relationship between health status and labour market outcomes (Currie and Madrian; 1999; Au et al., 2005; Disney et al., 2006; Barnay, 2010; Jones et al., 2010), little is known about the relationship between health and non-labour market outcomes, which include time devoted to household production and leisure. The analysis of other uses of time is important for several reasons. Time is a crucial factor in well-being (Kahneman et al., 2004; Kahneman and Krueger, 2006; Krueger, 2007; Stiglitz et al., 2009), and its scarcity may lead to problems in reconciling work and family spheres (Hochschild, 1990; Schor, 1991, Gimenez-Nadal and Sevilla, 2011). Furthermore, a great amount of time is allocated within the household in the form of household production (Becker, 1965), which has substitutes in the market, such as outsourcing activities, that contribute to the Gross Domestic Product of the country. Considering Grossman’s seminal work on the concept of health capital and the demand for health (Grossman, 1972a, 1972b), health can be considered a component of the stock of individual human capital that enters as durable stock capital. Under this framework, investments in health increase the amount of time available to produce money earnings in the future. But time is also required to produce/maintain health and to obtain medical care. Thus, an analysis of the non-market work time of workers, and its relationship with health inequalities, is important for policy issues. To the best of our knowledge, only three studies have directly analysed the relationship between health and time allocation decisions other than market work time. Podor and Halliday (2012) analyse the relationship between health and time allocation in the USA and find that better health is associated with large positive effects on home production, and similarly large positive effects on market production, but with lower consumption of leisure. Gimenez-Nadal and Ortega (2013) analyse the relationship between health status and the time devoted to both market and non-market work in Spain and find that better health is associated with an increase in the hours of market work and a decrease in the time devoted to non-market work. Gimenez-Nadal and Molina (2015) analyse the relationship between health status and the time devoted to different uses for a sample of working and non-working individuals in six European countries and find that a better perception of own health is associated with less time devoted to sleep, personal care, and non-market work, for both men and women, and with less time in leisure for men, while it is associated with more time in market work for both men and women. However, none of these prior studies have focused on the relationship between health status and time allocation decisions for the specific case of workers. We contribute to the literature by analysing the relationship between the self-reported health inequalities of workers and the time devoted to sleep, personal care, market work, non-market work, and leisure for a variety of countries, revealing several consistent patterns but also some inconsistencies. We acknowledge that our approach is mainly descriptive, and we can only talk about associations and not about causality, as in Podor and Halliday (2012) and Gimenez-Nadal and Molina (2015). First, the use of self-reported health measures may introduce a source of endogeneity (reverse causality) that can affect the estimated relationship between health and time allocation decisions (Stern, 1989; Kerkhofs and Lindeboom, 1995; Dwyer and Mitchell, 1999; Kreider, 1999: Crossley and Kennedy, 2002; Benitez-Silva et al., 2004; Lindeboom and Van Doorslaer, 2004; Cai and Kalb, 2006; Lindeboom and Kerkhofs, 2009). Second, there may be unmeasured factors (unobserved heterogeneity) related to both the responses to the self-assessed health measures and to the different uses of time, which can introduce bias in the estimated relationships. We examine time diary data for the following European countries: France (1998), Germany (2001), Italy (2002), the Netherlands (2000 and 2005), Spain (2002), and the UK (2000 and 2005). We offer descriptive evidence on the relationship between health and the time devoted to a range of activities while controlling for demographic and household observable characteristics. We find that a better perception of own health is associated with more time in market work activities during working days, while it is associated with less time in sleep and household production in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain for both men and women. For the rest of the uses of time, we find no clear cross-country evidence. These results are consistent with the results obtained by Podor and Halliday (2012) for market work in the USA, but not for non-market work and leisure. The results here are consistent with Gimenez-Nadal and Molina (2015) for market work, non-market work, and sleep, but not for leisure. By examining data from several countries, our work crucially adds to the study of the relationship between health inequality and time allocation decisions, including the most recent work by Podor and Halliday (2012), Gimenez-Nadal and Ortega (2013), and Gimenez-Nadal and Molina (2015). Specifically, we are able to improve our understanding of how better self-reported health status relates to market and non-market work activities, leisure, and personal care for workers in European countries. In contrast to the reported relationship between health and time allocation decisions in the USA, we fail to find such relationships for home production and leisure in our six countries. Whereas prior research (Garcia-Gómez 2011) has shown that differences in healthcare systems have a significant effect on a range of factors, our findings indicate that differences in healthcare systems do not condition the relationship between the use of time of workers and health status, and we argue that more focus should be placed on analysing differences in tax systems and cultural factors. Our paper also expands the prior evidence on the relationship between health inequality and the time workers spend in the labour market (Currie and Madrian; 1999; Au et al., 2005; Disney et al., 2006; Barnay, 2010; Jones et al., 2010). If results are similar across different countries, it is difficult to say that neither cultural nor institutional factors are shaping this relationship, shedding light on the possible channels through which health and labour market outcomes are related. Finally, we contribute to the field of health inequalities (Batana 2010; Halliday, 2011 European Commission 2013), a topic that has been largely ignored in the literature. The analysis of how differences in health status are related to the daily lives of individuals proves to be important for policy issues. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the variables and presents some descriptive evidence. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy, and  Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 presents a discussion of the main results and some policy implications, while Section 6 sets out our main conclusions.",1

To which extent can the effectiveness of activation policies go hand in hand with offering adequate levels of minimum income protection (MIP, hereafter) and social assistance (SA, hereafter)? On the one hand, do minimum income schemes have to be integrated in the overall activation framework and hence reduced in magnitude in order not to distort work incentives? On the other hand, how to achieve that balance whilst ensuring that minimum income schemes do not end up creating poverty traps? These broad questions lie behind the empirical analysis of the current paper, which aims at testing two opposite working hypotheses on the issue. It has to be pointed out that, instead of taking a normative stand on the balance between activation and out-of-work benefits, the current study aims at showing what has been the actual practice in European welfare states from 1990 to 2013. Immervoll (2012) has analyzed the policy design and effectiveness of minimum income benefits in OECD countries. Nelson (2013) has explored the question of to which extent social assistance in European welfare states provides protection against low income. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of the literature on activation strategies implemented in labor markets of OECD countries has been provided by Card et al. (2010). The interaction between activation and income support has been investigated by Immervoll and Scarpetta (2012), advocating for an effective policy mix based on the right balance between activation, income support, and work incentives. In the economic literature, Besley and Coate (1992) have analyzed this issue by exploring the incentive case for workfare. Their conclusion is that, for there to be a deterrent argument for workfare (i.e., for the benefits for a reduced number of poor exceeding the induced total costs of workfare), the government will have to impose significantly more than a small work requirement. Molander and Torsvik (2015) investigate and analyze from a normative point of view the main arguments justifying implementation of mandatory activation for benefit recipients. The four arguments highlighted and comparatively evaluated are efficiency, sustainability, paternalism, and justice. All these important contributions in the economic and social policy literature provided the ground for the development of the research question of this paper, which is introduced as follows. A conceptual framework is outlined in the next section in order to frame the two working hypotheses which are subsequently tested in the empirical analysis. The framework is constituted by the “disincentive” view prescribing low out-of-work benefits parallel to a high expenditure on active labor market policies (ALMPs, hereafter) and by the “generosity” view, which would instead complement the high expenditure on ALMPs with higher benefit levels. Hence, the main research question arises as such: which of these two “views” or working hypotheses are supported by the data on minimum income schemes and expenditure on activation for European welfare states? The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. Firstly, by employing the dataset on benefit levels of SA and minimum income protection (MIP) in 22 European countries in the period 1990–2013, the descriptive empirical analysis indicates a marked reduction as regards the adequacy of income support for inactive low-income individuals in European welfare states since 1994. This stylized fact, seemingly providing initial support for the “disincentive” view, constitutes the ground for the proceeding of the analysis on the interaction of provision of out-of-work benefits with activation. Second, the paper tests empirically the null hypothesis of the presence of a trade-off between the adequacy of benefit levels and the aggregate expenditure on ALMPs. The empirical analysis posits different specifications of the fixed effects model, in order to guarantee robustness of the results. The results indicate that the trade-off does not appear to be significant, in any of the tested specifications. Whenever significant, the sign of the coefficient indicating a covariation between out-of-work benefits and expenditure on activation is slightly positive. In other words, the “generosity” view seems to receive support from the data, indicating that it is the overall expenditure and degree of generosity of the welfare states that matters. A generous welfare state will provide both high out-of-work benefits and high expenditure on activation, whilst a less generous one will cut on the benefits without investing in activation. These results are proven robust to the introduction of a set of conventional controls related to the labor market. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, the conceptual framework is outlined. The data and the stylized facts are presented in Section 3, whilst Section 4 describes the empirical analysis. Section 5 presents the results, whilst Section 6 discusses them in light of the conceptual framework. Section 7 concludes.",3
