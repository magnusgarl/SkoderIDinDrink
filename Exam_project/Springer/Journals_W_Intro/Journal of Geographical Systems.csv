Walker,Jieping Li,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The Oxford English Dictionary defines lifestyle as “of or relating to a particular way of living”; it credits the term to the Austrian Psychologist Alfred Adler who first used it in 1929 to denote a person’s basic character. Since then, the term has entered our common vocabulary and has been used in numerous fields including psychology, sociology, anthropology, health, politics, and, our topic, transportation and geography. The term is amorphous as the description varies based on context. In this paper we take a spatial- and transport-centric focus. One of the earlier definitions of lifestyle in this area was introduced by Salomon and Ben-Akiva (1983): “A pattern of behavior which conforms to the individual’s orientation toward the three major roles of: household member, a worker, and a consumer of leisure, and which conforms to the constrained resources available”. Aeroe (2001) in an investigation of household preferences described lifestyle as the “deep-rooted and embedded, prevalent attitudes towards different types of residential areas.” In this context of residential location choices, such deep-rooted lifestyle differences lead to differences in considerations, criterion, and preferences for location. We exploit this fact and employ the framework of latent class choice models to infer both lifestyle groups (the latent variable) and how lifestyle preferences impact residential location decisions (the choice model). The latent class choice model allows us to estimate both phenomena simultaneously from observed household location decisions. Latent class choice models have been applied in various literatures. The method is particularly popular in the marketing research arena (see, for example, Grover and Srinivasan 1987; Kamakura and Russell 1989; Dillon et al. 1993; Swait 1994; Louviere et al. 2000, Chap. 10; Swait and Sweeney 2000) and has now permeated other fields including economics, transport, and geography (see, for example, Gopinath 1995; Boxall and Adamowicz 2002; Greene and Hensher 2003; Scarpa and Thiene 2005; Milon and Scrogin 2006). As far as we are aware, this is the first application using latent class choice modeling for residential location. It is also the first of which we are aware that explicitly determines the lifestyle groups and resulting behavior simultaneously rather than in a two stage process. A note on terminology and contribution: In this work, we focus on lifestyle as reflected by preferences in the built environment. In the literature this is sometimes referred to as ‘attitudes’ (for example towards residential settings) where ‘lifestyle’ reflects a broader view of life orientation. For example, Bagley and Mokhtarian (1999) defined eleven ‘lifestyle’ dimensions (culture-lover, altruist, nest-builder, relaxer, traveler, adventurer, fun-seeker, homebody, outdoor enthusiast, athlete, and hobbyist); or Hojrup (2003) defined ‘life-modes’ of self-employed, wage earner, and career life. Such broad lifestyles are certainly relevant to our analysis, because housing and residential choices are one mechanism through which one attempts to realize lifestyle preferences (Aeroe 2001). Our objective is not to model lifestyle per se, but to segment households such that those with similar lifestyles as reflected by preferences in residential location choices are grouped together. Furthermore, the contribution of our paper is empirical (namely, using a model structure that has not been used before in this area), and we do not aim to contribute to behavioral theory. We use our proposed model structure to infer the best lifestyle measure that we can from the data that we have. With appropriate data, the method can be expanded to incorporate the other definitions of lifestyle and attitudes. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background, including motivation and literature review. Section 3 provides an introduction to latent class choice models. Section 4 presents empirical results of a latent class residential location choice model estimated from stated preference data. Section 5 presents conclusions and further directions.",184

Murray,Timothy C. Matisziw,Tony H. Grubesic,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As a response to the growing threat of terrorism in the late 1990s, the U.S. federal government established the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) (E.O. 13010). In this executive order (E.O.) (1995), “infrastructure” was defined as: The framework of interdependent networks and systems comprising identifiable industries, institutions (including people and procedures), and distribution capabilities that provide a reliable flow of products and services essential to the defense and economic security of the United States, the smooth functioning of government at all levels, and society as a whole (E.O. 13010). More importantly, E.O. 13010 (1996) suggested that “... certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States.” The concept of “vital” or “critical” infrastructure is clearly an important one for establishing national security benchmarks. Basic inventories of critical infrastructure are often subdivided into sectors, and include (E.O. 13010, 1996; White House 2003): telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas and oil storage and transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems, emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue), and continuity of government. Given the vast array of infrastructure in these sectors, it is not surprising that fiscal constraints can limit the scope of protective measures applied to the nation’s critical infrastructure.Footnote 1 Moreover, the heightened concerns for security threats and the need to safeguard these sectors suggest that optimization-based approaches for identifying risk in networks of all sorts, ranging from gas and oil pipelines to transportation routes to telecommunication systems, are extremely important for prioritizing and evaluating fortification strategies to maintain the continuity of their functions (see White House 2003). A common theme in the analysis and evaluation of network-based critical infrastructure is interdiction, where network elements (nodes or arcs) are disabled, intentionally or otherwise, disrupting the flow of valuable goods or services through the network. There has been much interest in examining vulnerabilities and risk in critical network infrastructure (Carlier et al. 1997; Soni and Pirkul 2000; Palmer et al. 2001; Carreras et al. 2002; Crucitti et al. 2004; Latora and Marchiori 2005; Chassin and Posse 2005; Grubesic and Murray 2006) and interdiction has been implicit, if not explicit, in most cases. Baran (1964) recognized that some network topologies provide a higher probability of survivability (or connectivity, more specifically) after an attack. In particular, distributed networks with higher levels of redundancy and diversity are good for ensuring connectivity, should interdiction take place. The topological properties of networks are further explored in examining “scale-free” networks (Albert et al. 2000; 2004; Barabasi et al. 2000, 2001). Results suggest that although scale-free networks like the Internet are very tolerant of random failures, a series of targeted attacks on the most highly connected nodes or “hubs” can be crippling. Nevertheless, performance of a network, viewed in terms of either vulnerability or survivability, ultimately centers on connectivity and whether flow can move between origins and destinations (see Bell 2000; Doyle et al. 2005). If interdiction to network-based critical infrastructure is to be guarded against or managed once it occurs, methods are needed for identifying and examining possible interdiction scenarios, a sentiment shared by Houck et al. (2004) and Salmeron et al. (2004). The above discussion has highlighted that networks serve to deliver flow through a system of interconnected nodes and arcs and that planning for interdiction of this service is essential. With this in mind, this paper develops an integer programming model to evaluate the upper and lower bounds on flow disruption as a result of facility interdiction in a network. The next section provides a background review of previous modeling work in this area. An integer model formulation is then presented and discussed. An application analyzing potential interdiction of network components for the Abilene Internet2 backbone is given, highlighting the utility of the developed modeling approach. Finally, discussion and conclusions are provided.",102

One approach to deriving need indices involves what may be termed ecological outcome regression, whereby geographic contrasts in area health outcomes (such as health care usage or mortality) are explained by regression on a collection of socioeconomic indicators (e.g. Smith et al. 1996; Glover et al. 1998). The need index is based on regression coefficients obtained for significant indicators. However, this method has drawbacks. First, spatial patterning (i.e. spatial correlation) in population morbidity is typically neglected. Second, there is no obvious way in which multidimensional constructs are derivable under this approach. Third, the socioeconomic indicators used as predictors may be highly correlated, and multicollinearity may result in unexpected signs for effects and imprecise parameter estimates (Croudace et al. 2000, p. 179; Kidwell and Brown 1982). It is possible to select indicators with a significant effect, but the choice of significant variables and discarding of others as irrelevant to explaining outcome variation may run counter to epidemiological evidence. A related methodology, though with different outcomes (e.g. health expenditures) and more sophisticated regression techniques (e.g. seemingly unrelated regression) has recently developed in the health economics and mental health economics literature (e.g. Moscone et al. 2007). Some econometric work (e.g. by Moscone and Knapp 2005) does recognize spatial interdependencies in a geographic analysis of mental health expenditures, though they note that prior to their work “mental health economics appears to have been largely immune to these [methodological] developments [taking account of spatial correlation]”. A somewhat contrasting approach for obtaining health need indices, termed here composite socioeconomic scoring, focuses on obtaining single indices of area deprivation to summarise socioeconomic hardship, or single needs measures to summarise morbidity, and does not analyse health outcomes that reflect such morbidity and hardship. Deprivation or health need has been measured in different ways (i.e. using different combinations of indices) in such studies. A recent UK example is the health deprivation and disability domain of the official 2007 Indices of Deprivation (Noble et al. 2004). Also widely used in health need applications are the Townsend index and the Carstairs index (Townsend et al. 1987; Carstairs and Morris 1991). These studies, like ecological outcome regression, have not included spatial correlation. An alternative strategy, motivated both by high correlations between observed social indicators or health outcomes, and the fact that a spatial setting is involved, is to use latent variable methods that both explicitly model latent morbidity constructs and allow for correlation in such constructs over space. Early work on spatially configured factor models includes Wang and Wall (2003), Knorr-Held and Best (2001) and Congdon (2002a). In line with conventional factor and structural equation techniques, spatial factor models include both directly observed variables and latent variables or constructs that are postulated to exist but are not directly observable. The latent variables can, however, be proxied or “measured” by collections of observed area indicators. As to the form of factor model, there is often considerable existing evidence on how latent need constructs are related to observed indicators, and this can be expressed in a confirmatory model with certain loadings assumed to be zero. Conventional structural equation and factor models have taken units of analysis to be independent. However, it is now recognised in several spatial health and econometric applications that unobservable area constructs are likely to be spatially correlated, so extending on foundational work by Anselin (1988) and others that focuses on spatial correlation in observed outcomes or in regression residuals. In health geography, the patterning of scores on latent factors, such as area deprivation, is likely to show spatial correlation, and this should be recognised in the derivation of the index (Hogan and Tchernis 2004). Thus Minozzo and Fruttini (2004) mention that “many diseases show similar patterns of geographical variation which may suggest the existence of common underlying risk factors”, while Moscone et al. (2007, p. 845) similarly note that local authority mental health expenditure choices are spatially correlated reflecting “either observable or unobservable common risk factors”. The analysis here recognizes these developments in structural equation and factor analytic models for areas, but is distinctive in several ways from existing studies. First, the model developed below uses both outcomes and socioeconomic indicators to define need, relying on neither one source of information or another (in contrast to ecological outcome regression and composite socioeconomic scoring). In the terminology of factor models, there are two types of measurement model, one based on social indicators (Sect. 3), the other on health outcomes of various kinds (Sect. 4). Existing spatial factor models either just use health outcomes to measure need (e.g. Wang and Wall 2003), or use just socioeconomic indices (e.g. Hogan and Tchernis 2004). A second distinctive feature of the model developed below is that it recognises that latent need may be multidimensional, and so avoids conflating distinct dimensions of population morbidity; further, the latent constructs are allowed to be correlated within areas. Third, while allowing the latent morbidity construct to be spatially correlated, it also allows for some pure (white noise) random variation in the constructs, as determined by the data. This avoids a strong prior assumption that variation in latent constructs is solely spatially configured. A fully Bayesian approach is adopted in the model specification, and in parameter estimation in the case study. A Bayesian strategy is advantageous for estimating models with several sets of random effects, including random effects which are spatially clustered (Tutz and Kauermann 2003). This involves specifying prior densities (or “priors” for short) for the parameters involved in defining the model, and updating of these densities (to provide “posterior” inferences) via the likelihoods of the observed health outcome and the social indicator data. Model estimation is based on iterative Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques (Gelfand and Smith 1990), as implemented in the WINBUGS program (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003).",5

Rey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper considers the intersection of two communities, the first consists of the field of academic spatial analysis (Okabe 2006; Goodchild et al. 2000), while the second is the wider world of open source software (Himanen 2001; Feller et al. 2005b). The primary concern is the engagement of the former with the latter, and the paper’s goals are twofold. First, it examines the parallel resurgence in spatial analysis and the rise of the open source movement. In doing so it identifies the key opportunities and challenges that this juncture presents to the academic spatial analysis community. These issues transcend the development of software tools for spatial analysis and have important implications for the future growth of the discipline. A key theme of the paper is that each community has a well developed sense of its traditions and conventions yet the interaction between these worlds has not been as strong as perhaps it could be. Although analogies are often drawn between the logics of the two communities, the analogies are sometimes based on misunderstandings about key aspects of the other community. These misperceptions lead to a number of important challenges that require addressing before the powerful, but latent, synergies between the two communities can be realized. Therefore, the second goal of the paper is to provide a primer on the culture and operation of open source communities. It presents an overview of the way open source communities emerge, evolve and function. It also attempts to provide the same for open source communities. That is, it provides insights as to the functioning of the community of scholars contributing to advances in the science of spatial analysis. In doing so I will highlight the specific synergies that may be tapped into by the intersection of the two communities. The paper draws on the author’s experience as a member of the community of academic spatial analysis researchers as well as a participant in the world of open source software development. With regard to the former, insights from experiences in the scientific projects Space Time Analysis of Regional Systems (STARS; Rey and Janikas 2006) and A Python Library for Spatial Analytical Methods (PySAL; Rey and Anselin 2007) are discussed.
Footnote 1 The paper also draws from the author’s participation in the Linux and Python communities. By revisiting the relationships between these two communities, the paper identifies a number of ways in which the academic spatial analysis community can reinvent itself to enhance its currency with wider technological and community dynamics fueled by the open source movement.

Kelley Pace,James P. LeSage,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Likelihood-based methods for modeling multivariate Gaussian spatial data have desirable statistical characteristics (Cressie 1993; Stein 1999). However, a number of authors question the practicality of these methods for large numbers of observations such as those representing massive georeferenced data sets (e.g., Caragea and Smith 200).
Footnote 1 Technological advances such as point-of-sale data collection and geocoding will continue to increase the size of these data sets. The computational disadvantages of likelihood based techniques relate to the n by n matrices required for solving equations and calculating determinants that appear in the likelihood of these models, where n is the number of observations. Since commonly used algorithms involve O(n
3) steps, Caragea and Smith (2007, p. 1418) state that: “Many modern data sets contain thousands of observations, for which such computation is prohibitively time consuming.” A substantial body of literature addresses the computational exigencies of large data sets through the introduction of new techniques. Such techniques often invoke various asymptotic assumptions which could prove difficult to verify with data having pervasive spatial dependence. In addition, practitioners of statistical models may prefer well-known methods, since use of novel techniques can create problems in some situations. For example, novel techniques used in legal settings may be prone to “Daubert” challenges (Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1993). Other alternatives that could avoid computational efficiency issues include use of standard estimation techniques with subsets of the data (Cressie and Aldworth 1997). The logistical complexity of analyzing and reporting on a large number of sub-sample models, especially when spatial sub-models and data are not likely to be independent is a drawback to this approach. Random samples of the data could also be used in conjunction with sufficient spacing to eliminate spatial dependence. However, this can change model interpretation since the regression parameters may have different values when incorporating spatial effects versus ignoring these effects.
Footnote 2 In cases where the focus of spatial modeling is the magnitude of spatial spillover impacts arising from events such as pollution or land use changes, eliminating spatial dependence would rule out inference regarding these impacts. In contrast to these alternatives, we extend standard techniques to allow computation of likelihood-based estimates for very large data sets. Many determinant computations take the matrix of interest, such as a variance-covariance matrix, and reduce it to the product of triangular matrices. The diagonal entries of such triangular matrices are termed “pivots,” and the log-determinant of the product of the two matrices is the sum of the log of all the pivots. Rather than computing all the pivots, we propose sampling these. We show that the method can produce an estimate for the log-determinant in a problem involving nearly 4 million observations in around 2 min.
Footnote 3 The proposed method involves computations that are independent, which would facilitate out-of-core computation as well as coarse-grained parallel or distributed processing. A number of other approaches have been taken to approximating the log-determinant term that arises in spatial maximum likelihood problems. For example, Griffith (1995, 2000) proposed log-determinant approximations based on extreme eigenvalues, and Smirnov and Anselin (2001) suggest an approach based on a characteristic polynomial. Although these techniques provide a point estimate that approximates the log-determinant, they do not provide confidence intervals for the estimated log-determinant value. In contrast, Barry and Pace (1999) describe a Monte Carlo estimator of the log-determinant based on estimates for the traces of matrices that comprise the n by n variance-covariance matrix that yields confidence intervals associated with the log-determinant point estimate. As currently stated, the Barry and Pace (1999) approach can be used to estimate the log-determinant for both symmetric and non-symmetric spatial weight matrices. However, the confidence intervals produced rely on the assumption of symmetric spatial weight matrices. Pace and LeSage (2004a) introduced a Chebyshev approximation to the log-determinant with bounds for symmetric matrices. The proposed technique based on samples of log-pivots yields an estimated log-determinant as well as an associated confidence interval, and it can easily handle non-symmetric matrices with complex eigenvalues. Such matrices can naturally arise from using nearest neighbors to specify dependence. The approximate linearity of Fig. 1 provides the inspiration for the proposed approach. Figure 1 shows a sequence of log-determinants (scaled by 3,107) calculated for variance-covariance matrices based on varying numbers of observations using centroid locations from 3,107 counties in the continental US. The sequence of log-determinants ranges from 1 to 3,107 counties, which were progressively sampled by adding counties extending from North to South. Scaled log-determinant versus number of counties Given a slope estimate of the curve shown in the figure, one could extrapolate an estimate of the log-determinant based on sub-sample information. Measurements for the slope taken at widely separated locations give rise to independent estimates of the log-determinant, that can be used to form point and interval estimates of the full-sample log-determinant. We show that use of these log determinant estimates in the log-likelihood produces estimated coefficients and inferences that are quite similar to those based on the exact log-likelihood. In addition, the proposed sampling approach to the log-determinant calculation involves computations that are independent, making this also amenable to out-of-core computation as well as coarse-grained parallel or distributed processing. This suggests that sampling estimates of the log-determinant can be used to reduce computational costs without affecting the desirable statistical characteristics of likelihood-based estimation. Our approach uses all the observations for the statistical portion of the estimation procedure in conjunction with the numerical sampling procedure for the log-determinant calculation. To develop this idea in Sect. 2 we review spatial models and the associated log-likelihood with a focus on the role played by the log-determinant. Section 3 presents the sampling approach to estimating log-determinants, and Sect. 4 provides an example involving 3,954,400 observations.",47

While spatial analytical approaches have become more widespread and accessible over the past decade to researchers and practitioners in a wide variety of disciplines (Páez et al. 2009), it is interesting to note that some early examples of the potential of both spatial econometric and geostatistical techniques include the analysis of property values reported in papers by Can (1992) and Dubin (1992). These early papers are notable because they demonstrated the use of different analytical approaches—spatially autoregressive models in the case of Can, and kriging in the case of Dubin. At the same time, they also identified a series of issues that stand at the cornerstone of spatial hedonic analysis. Of these issues, the identification of spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity is a key, and these two effects have since been consistently found in other studies and with such frequency that it is no longer reasonable to dismiss them as statistical flukes or nuisances. On the contrary, while a strong economic theory of spatial externalities and segmentation in real estate markets has yet to be produced, a current consensus regarding the interpretation of spatial effects has already emerged. Thus, neighborhood effects are a commonly accepted interpretation of patterns of similarities observed in property prices above and beyond what can be explained by differences in structural and locational attributes (e.g. Baumont 2009; Chica-Olmo 1995; Pace et al. 1998; Tse 2002). Heterogeneity, on the other hand, is believed to be indicative of geographical segmentation of markets or buyers preferences (e.g. Bitter et al. 2007; Bourassa et al. 2003; Goodman and Thibodeau 2003; Páez et al. 2008b). The literature on spatial real estate hedonic analysis has so far demonstrated the importance of spatially explicit modeling to improve model quality and prediction accuracy. Substantive interpretation lends credence to the use of these methods. And the policy implications of spatial spillovers are increasingly recognized as a sufficient justification for the application of specialized approaches. Research continues to thrive as new substantive problems are identified, and methods are adopted, adapted, or newly developed to address emerging research needs. The papers collected for this thematic issue of Journal of Geographical Systems are a sample of research in an area that continues to attract attention for its methodological potential and practical importance. The first paper in the issue is by Leonard and Murdoch, and is concerned with the neighborhood effects of foreclosure. As is well known, residential real estate markets were a central element in the financial and economic crisis of 2008. As the housing bubble in these markets came to an end and market prices started to sharply adjust, many homeowners found themselves holding so-called underwater mortgages (mortgages with high Loan-to-Value ratios), and in a situation where the money owed in a mortgage exceeded the market value of the property. With many homeowners also having obtained in the preceding years exotic mortgages that created the illusion of cheap credit early on, unsustainable financial conditions after the burst of the bubble pushed many towards default—since at that point it would have been more expensive to hold on to a property than to walk away from it. There have been multiple media accounts of the geographical concentrations of foreclosure, and doubtless these concentrations can to a large extent be explained by common factors, such as low neighborhood income. Formal statistical research has also been devoted to the question of the neighborhood effects of foreclosure, in order to determine whether the effects of foreclosure tend to spillover and negatively affect nearby properties. The question is of primary interest, because negative effects could spread, pushing otherwise healthy properties into default. At the same time, it is possible that some of the worse effects of widespread foreclosures could be contained by taking a geographically targeted approach for policy interventions. A challenge when attempting to estimate the neighborhood effects of foreclosure is explained by Harding et al. (2009) in the following way: “If the empirical model does not control for the overall price level, a large number of nearby foreclosures may proxy for an overall decline in home prices and thus a negative coefficient on the measure of foreclosures could actually be an estimate of the local decline in prices and not a true contagion effect.” Given abundant previous evidence that property prices tend to be spatially autocorrelated, it can be argued that the empirical model needs to take into account not only the “overall” price level, but also the locally adjusted price level. A spatial approach provides precisely the tools to achieve this, by introducing a local moving average that is a function of the price of neighboring properties. Two possibilities emerge that must be considered: first, that the negative coefficient for foreclosures confounds overall and local price levels with other sources of market distress, and thus provides an inflated estimate of the effect of foreclosures per se; and secondly, that parameter estimates are further biased in complex ways if autocorrelation effects are indeed present but are ignored (see Páez et al. 2008a). Leonard and Murdoch demonstrate that the effect of foreclosures follows a distance decay pattern, with the impacts becoming increasingly small with increasing distance. Furthermore, their results show that the coefficient for number of foreclosures is negative and significant, but smaller than would be indicated if neighborhood price effects are not addressed. The effect of foreclosures turns out to be fairly complex, as it consists of a negative direct effect (attached to the presence of foreclosed properties), as well as an indirect propagation effect that makes the prices of properties to covary as a cluster. Thus, in the final analysis, Leonard and Murdoch estimate that the total direct and indirect (neighborhood) hedonic price effect of one additional foreclosed property within 250 feet is −$1,666. A model that ignores neighborhood effects, in contrast, produces an inflated estimated effect of −$2,400 per one additional foreclosure. Along with recent research by Clauretie and Daneshvary (2009), this paper gives the clearest evidence available so far of the importance of considering the contagion effects of foreclosure in property markets. The second paper in the issue, by Smith and Wu, is motivated by the need to assess the impact of community development projects such as implemented in the Philadelphia region. The aim of these projects is to revitalize local neighborhoods, and housing prices are used as a summary measure to evaluate the success of an intervention. Most work to date in the spatial analysis of real estate data has been completed from the perspective of cross-sections. Usually, price data are collected over a period of time (one or more quarters or a year), and then analyzed as a co-temporal spatial series. While this practice greatly simplifies the need to work with potential dependencies along the temporal dimension, it imposes the limitation that time shifts cannot be meaningfully analyzed (for example, trying to identify higher resolution temporal effects before and after a project). Moreover, dependencies along the temporal dimension are all given the same weight, when it is reasonable to anticipate that any effects would tend to fade over time. Since transactions, and therefore sale prices are recorded on a daily basis, and at irregular intervals of time, Smith and Wu propose a new modeling approach that is capable of accommodating both spatial and temporal dependencies. The application of the model to a revitalization project in Philadelphia (the People’s Emergency Center) is illustrative, and reveals significant if weak levels of temporal autocorrelation. It is important to note that the model is derived for the case of data points that do not coincide in time, which explains why the spatial lag can be estimated by ordinary least squares (see Stetzer 1982). In small sample situations, this may reasonably be expected to hold if the time period is relatively long. In many practical situations that involve larger samples, it is not uncommon to find that several transactions are recorded for a single day. While analytically the situation becomes more complex, Smith and Wu sketch a possible solution to the problem and indicate that research is ongoing on this matter. A quick survey of the literature suggests that applications of spatial econometric approaches appear to be more numerous in the literature compared to geostatistical approaches involving the use of kriging methodology. The reasons for this are not completely clear, although it is possible that they reflect a basic predisposition given the relative familiarity of real estate researchers with regression and time series methods, which provide a natural platform to understand spatial econometrics models. Regardless, in recent years there has been renewed interest in the application of geostatistical approaches, which recent research suggests can substantially improve the predictive accuracy of models (e.g. Case et al. 2004; Páez et al. 2008b). The third paper in the issue, by Tsutsumi and Seya, examines the applicability of spatial regression (lag and error autocorrelation models) and kriging for project evaluation purposes. One interesting aspect of this study is the discussion about the implications of the way spatial relationships are implemented in the various approaches. Use of spatial contiguity matrices in spatial lag and error autocorrelation models implicitly assumes that the spatial system is completely observed, whereas in kriging, the covariance matrix is modeled assuming that sites have been sampled. Past research on missing observations in zonal spatial systems includes the work of Griffith (1988) and more recently of LeSage and Pace (2004). Excluding the case of a purely autocorrelated model as implemented in Griffith (1988), other approaches necessitate explanatory variables at non-sampled sites, which requires that conditions at these sites be at least partially documented. Furthermore, these approaches require all sites that will be evaluated using the model to be identified a priori: new sites cannot simply be incorporated a posteriori, since their introduction would imply a different contiguity matrix than that used for estimation. The results of an empirical example that examines the impact of a new railway line connecting the cities of Tokyo and Tsukuba in Japan indicates that the estimated benefits are very different depending on the modeling approach adopted. It is currently unclear whether the ranking of benefits (higher for an ordinary least squares approach, lower for kriging) is somehow associated to the properties of each modeling approach or is a case specific finding. As Leonard and Murdoch illustrate, parameters can be biased if spatial effects are ignored, which supports the idea that the ordinary non-spatial model is an outlier. However, between spatial models, a more definitive answer to this question would necessitate an examination of the performance of the parameters in a simulation environment. Two more papers in the issue are concerned with geostatistical applications in property assessment. Whereas the paper by Smith and Wu was concerned with data measurement in terms of the temporal intervals of observations, the second to last paper, by Yoo and Kiriakidis, is concerned with measurement of spatial information, which could be disaggregated for individual properties, or alternatively aggregated as area averages. A model, area-to-point kriging with external drift, or A2PKED, is proposed to deal with the situation where point and area measurements are available. This model is an extension of area-to-point kriging, and different from it in that A2PKED can accommodate additional covariates in the analysis. The model is demonstrated using a case study of Seoul, Korea, and a dataset partitioned into a training (or estimation) sample, and a validation sample. The results illustrate some desirable properties of A2PKED. Not only is this approach capable of using a potentially more common source of information (area averages), it also produces more accurate estimates of price compared to kriging and other non-spatial approaches. In addition, estimation in this approach is less affected by extreme observations, as the areal datum essentially functions as a check and balance for the influence of these observations. With respect to accuracy of predictions, a recent paper by Páez et al. (2008b) reports some important gains in performance when using moving windows approaches which are attributed to the segmentation of the market. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to use area variables, in particular if the areal support is large relative to the geographic market segments. In addition, moving window approaches require fairly large amounts of data, in order for local regressions to have a sufficient number of observations for estimation. On the other hand, A2PKED seems to perform well with smaller datasets, and naturally accommodates areal data. In fact, areal data appears to play the role of a proxy for local market conditions. These intriguing similarities suggest that a comparison of moving window approaches and A2PKED would be an interesting exercise to consider as a topic for future research. The final paper in the theme issue, by Montero, Larraz, and Páez, also relates to the use of more common information to enhance assessment. This paper applies a different geostatistical approach, cokriging, to the study of commercial property prices using housing prices as ancillary variables. Housing prices are relatively easy to collect, and are frequently available for property assessment purposes. Data on commercial property prices, on the other hand, tend to be less common, partly because properties of this type are less numerous, but also because transactions in this market are less frequent, and so the market value of properties is characterized by more sparse observations. In order to improve the assessment of commercial property values, cokriging is proposed as an alternative to kriging. Cokriging operates on the same fundamental principles of kriging, making use of the additional information carried by spatial dependencies to refine predictions of values. This principle is the basis for spatial interpolation in both kriging and cokriging. Cokriging, in addition, is capable of using the spatial dependencies between two variables to improve the prediction of one of them. This approach is particularly appropriate when the ancillary variable is more common than the variable of direct interest, and when the two variables tend to covary. An application to the city of Toledo in Spain shows that cokriging, using an ancillary variable, can substantially improve predictive accuracy, thus offering an alternative to the usual problem of sparse data in the assessment of commercial property values. Together, the five papers appearing in this issue are representative of the type of research currently being conducted in spatial hedonic analysis, as new problems and technical approaches come to the forefront of the research agenda. At the same time, the papers identify future research needs and point in the direction of some intriguing research possibilities, which already signify that spatial hedonic analysis will in all likelihood remain a vibrant and active arena for years to come.",23

Also in the fields of regional science and spatial economics, the scope of issues that could be addressed by means of properly identified structural VARs appears to be wide and includes: the analysis of the regional propagation of demand shocks via trade linkages; the assessment of long-run spatial spillover effects from local public expenditure to private sector performance; and the study of dynamic knowledge externalities linking patenting activity in the business sector to academic research in nearby areas. However, despite the fact that the VAR approach provides a potentially useful analytical tool allowing for the joint modeling of dynamic interdependencies within a group of connected areas, until lately it has received little attention in the applied spatial economics literature. This is mainly due to the over-parameterization problem encountered when a direct transposition of the standard VAR approach is attempted by simply setting up a system that involves an equation for each endogenous variable and each region in the sample. At the same time, the identification of structural impulse responses appears to pose specific difficulties, requiring the introduction of correct hypotheses if the bilateral nature of most economic linkages in space is to be properly accounted for. In this paper, in line with the approach set forth in a number of previous contributions, the inherent over-parameterization problem denoting the multi-area VAR model is addressed by imposing a priori restrictions on parameter values, stemming from hypotheses on the spatial decay of interactions across economic agents derived from the spatial econometrics literature. The main methodological insight lies in the approach to structural parameters identification, where a block triangular scheme is introduced and motivated as a plausible extension to a space-time context of the recursive scheme widely adopted in the empirical time series VAR literature. Apart from structural parameter identification, some new results are also derived in the fields of parameter estimation and of impulse response analysis. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Model specification and identification issues are then discussed in Sect. 3. Parameter estimation is dealt with in Sect. 4. Under the assumptions that the number of locations considered is fixed and a sufficient number of observations is collected over time, estimation is based on the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) method, a standard choice in structural VAR analysis. The topic of impulse response analysis is dealt with in Sect. 5, where a synthetic space-time impulse response (STIR) function is introduced as a convenient tool to summarize the information conveyed by individual regional dynamic multipliers. Asymptotic confidence bands for the STIR estimates are also derived from bootstrap estimates of the respective standard errors. To provide a basic illustration of the methodology and an initial test of the model’s empirical performance, the application of a simple bivariate fiscal model estimated on the set of Italian NUTS 2 regions is carried out in Sect. 6. Lastly, Sect. 7 summarizes and concludes the paper.",212

Kelejian,Ingmar R. Prucha,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Missing data problems often arise in the analysis of spatial models containing spatial lags.
Footnote 1 In some cases, these data problems arise because of a lack of data on some variables for units that are defined to be neighbors of other units for which data are available.
Footnote 2 In some, but not all of these cases, the missing data relate to “edge units”—see e.g., Anselin (1988, pp. 172–173). In other cases, data shortcomings may arise because of either the unavailability of data on certain variables or the reluctance of the researcher to use data on certain variables because of “quality of data” concerns. One example of this would be models that, among other things, require data on the GDPs of the sampled countries, and GDP data are either not available for some countries or are of “dubious” quality and so not used—see e.g., Kelejian et al. (2008). There are various ways researchers have confronted this problem. One approach is to ignore it if the missing data relate to units that are involved as part of a spatial lag. In this approach, the missing observations are implicitly replaced by zeroes and so, e.g., the spatial lag would be constructed entirely in terms of the available data. Another approach is to complete the sample using available data by estimating in various ways, the observations that are missing. Still another approach is to rely on maximum likelihood estimation.
Footnote 3 Of course, there are still other approaches, but formal results concerning the distribution of the regression parameter estimators based on incomplete data sets are not available in the framework of a non-stationary spatial model that contains spatial lags in both the dependent and independent variables, as well as a non-parametrically specified disturbance process.
Footnote 4
 The purpose of this study is to fill this gap. For such non-stationary spatial models, we discuss various scenarios relating to the missing data and the manner in which the sample increases. We suggest regression parameter estimators that are based on a complete subset of the sample, as well as on a larger but incomplete subset of the sample. We give formal large sample results for our suggested estimators in both of these cases. In the context of our model, we give conditions under which the effects of missing observations in the estimation procedure are asymptotically negligible, as well as when they are not! Our asymptotic results account for both of these cases. Finally, we give user friendly suggestions concerning small sample inferences for our suggested estimators. We specify the model in Sect. 2. That section also contains a discussion of various scenarios as to how the sample may increase. Our suggested estimators are given in Sect. 3, along with theorems that describe their large sample distribution. These theorems relate to the various scenarios concerning the manner in which the sample increases. Conclusions are given in Sect. 4. Technical details are relegated to the “Appendix”.",32

Wong,Shih-Lung Shaw,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Research in segregation has been focusing heavily on population distribution in the residential space. Using spatially aggregated census data to compute summary measures of segregation for a region or city has been a standard approach. Two general but related characteristics in segregation studies can be identified. First, while the importance of residential pattern in studying racial–ethnic relationships is well established in the literature, studies leaving out other socio-geographical spaces may offer only a partial or even biased assessment of the segregation situation. Second, census data aggregated to various census geography levels are the main sources of data for assessing residential segregation. Results from such ecological analysis should not be used to infer individual experiences. From a spatial perspective, most studies use global measures summarizing the segregation condition of the entire region or study area, failing to recognize the spatial variability of segregation across neighborhoods or individuals. So far, a few studies have shown how segregation level varies by neighborhoods using local measures (e.g., Feitosa et al. 2007; Wong 2002) and have demonstrated how local segregation may have impacts on health outcomes (Grady 2006; Grady and McLafferty 2007). Because the computations of these local measures are based upon aggregated data which reflect the neighborhood situations, these local measures do not capture an individual’s experience effectively. The literature has shown clearly that racial–ethnic relations vary across socio-geographical spaces (e.g., Blumen and Zamir 2001; Ellis et al. 2004). Significant segregation in the residential space is well recognized, but relatively desegregated work or employment space is quite common (Estlund 2003). While quite a few studies have analyzed the differences in racial–ethnic relationship across socio-geographical spaces or spheres, measuring the level of segregation individuals may experience across relevant socio-geographical spaces has not been addressed explicitly. In this article, we propose an approach to evaluate the level of segregation that an individual may experience. The spatial domain of the concerned individual is delineated according to the concept of activity space. The proposed segregation measure is an extension of an exposure measure suggested by Lieberson (1981). An individual’s segregation experience is a function of his or her exposure to other groups within his/her activity space. Activity spaces of individuals of the same group resided within a neighborhood are aggregated to represent the activity space of the entire group. Using the aggregated activity space, exposure of individuals in the group is evaluated to reflect the neighborhood condition.",190

Hospital admissions are of prime concern because of their costs and social implications. Although hospital admissions only account for 19% of all contacts, they account for 58% of the NHS expenditure (Talbot-Smith and Pollock 2006). Patients with long-term or chronic diseases have the greatest needs: they represent only 5–10% of patients, but account for up to 55% of hospital bed days (Department of Health 2004b). Concerns about hospital admission rates have led to intense research into their upstream causes, and, especially, information regarding individual-level risk factors associated with long-term diseases is used for opportunistic ‘healthy lifestyle’ advice within the health care system as well as forming the basis for public health campaigns. Public health campaigns are increasingly guided by the principles of social marketing, viz. balancing ‘product, place, price and promotion’ (Kotler and Zaltman 1971; Kotler et al. 2002). This paper focuses upon the use of geodemographics as a social marketing tool in order to create information about ‘place’ and to target local population with new public health campaigns. The basic principles underpinning geodemographics, the analysis of people by where they live, have been comprehensively covered in recent publications (Sleight 2004; Harris et al. 2005), and this paper focuses on evaluating the utility of geodemographics in order to plan targeted public health campaigns within the jurisdiction of a local health authority, Southwark Primary Care Trust, London (UK). Geodemographics offers the prospects of integrating, modelling and mapping health care needs and other health indicators that are useful for the geographic targeting of such campaigns. Yet, the technology itself is not new, and sporadic reports about its potential remain just as boosterist in the recent past (Department of Health 2004a) as they were in 1985 (Speller and Hale 1985). One of the major obstacles has presumably been the lack of validation beyond the observation that it works sufficiently to be of interest for commercially driven, direct marketing (Vickers and Birkin 2007). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has built publicly available geodemographic systems from Census data since the mid-1990s, but again reports of health applications have been sporadic (Openshaw 1995). The latest Census classification, the 2001 Census Output Area Classification (OAC), has been promoted in a more sustained manner, not least by appending it to the UK’s geographical look-up table, National Statistics Postcode Directory, as well as several national surveys. The ‘open source’ approach of the OAC system also offers opportunities for evaluating the system or modifying it for new purposes (Singleton and Longley 2008). In what follows, geo-coded hospital admission data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are used to map and evaluate the potential of geodemographics as means of targeting in the setting of the inner city London Borough of Southwark. The paper uses in the first instance the official Census Output Area Classification (OAC) and compares it with a commercial geodemographic system, Mosaic UK, to illustrate strengths and limitations associated with the current geodemographic systems for public health applications. The paper then goes onto present a new open source geodemographic system for London based on Census data to compare seven competing geodemographic systems for targeting guided by hospital data and, finally, to explore the potential for age- and sex standardisation in a geodemographic analysis of hospital demand.",34

Finley,Sudipto Banerjee,Alan E. Gelfand,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The scientific community is moving into an era where data-rich environments provide extraordinary opportunities to understand the complexity of spatially and temporally dynamic systems. Unprecedented access to data is a result of investments to collect information for regulatory, monitoring, and resource management objectives, as well as technological advances in spatially enabled sensor networks, and geospatial information storage, analysis, and distribution systems. Across scientific fields, researchers face the challenge of coupling these data with imperfect models to better understand variability in their system of interest. The inference garnered through these analyses often supports decisions with important economic and ecological implications, and it is therefore critical to accurately assess inferential uncertainty. The obstacle for researchers is increasingly often not access to the right data, but rather to implement appropriate statistical methods and software. However, developing modeling frameworks capable of accounting for various sources of uncertainty is not a trivial task—massive datasets, missing observations, and complex dependence structures only serve to exacerbate these challenges. There is a considerable literature in spatio-temporal modeling. The approach adopted here applies to the setting where space is viewed as continuous, but time is taken to be discrete. Put another way, we view the data as a time series of spatial process realizations and work in the setting of dynamic models, achieving a class of dynamic models for such data. Building upon previous work in the setting of dynamic models by West and Harrison (1997), several authors, including Tonellato (1997), Stroud et al. (2001) and Gelfand et al. (2005), proposed dynamic frameworks to model residual spatial and temporal dependence. These proposed frameworks are flexible and easily extended to accommodate nonstationary and multivariate outcomes. However, full inference and accurate assessment of uncertainty of the resulting model involve computation of order O(n
3) for each time point, where n is the number of locations. This renders the models computationally infeasible for datasets beyond perhaps a few hundred locations and a few time steps. For example, Gelfand et al. (2005) analyzed a space-time dataset of observations from only 50 spatial locations monitored over 12 months. In this paper, we detail a modeling approach which allows a class of dynamic space-time models proposed by Gelfand et al. (2005) to be applied to large spatio-temporal datasets without sacrificing model flexibility and with minimal loss of information. We focus on the common setting where space is considered continuous but time is taken to be discrete. Some examples of data that fit this description include: US Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality System which reports pollutants’ mean, minimum, and maximum at 8 and 24 h intervals; climate model outputs of weather variables generated on hourly or daily intervals; and remotely sensed landuse/landcover change recorded at annual or decadal time steps. Modeling large spatial datasets has received much attention in the statistical literature. Vecchia (1988) proposed approximating the likelihood with a product of appropriate conditional distributions to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. Stein et al. (2004) adapt this to restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Another possibility is to approximate the likelihood using spectral representations of the spatial process (Fuentes 2007). These likelihood approximations yield a joint distribution, but not a process that facilitates spatial interpolation. Yet another approach considers compactly supported correlation functions (Furrer et al. 2006; Kaufman et al. 2008; Du et al. 2009) that yield sparse correlation matrices which, given sparse solvers, are used for computationally efficient kriging and variance estimation. This approach, however, does sacrifice some information and may limit modeling flexibility as full likelihood-based inference still requires determinant computations that may be problematic. Also recognizing this challenge, Pace and LeSage (2009) detail a sampling-based approach to estimating the determinant of massive spatial covariance matrices. Rather than approximations, one could build models especially geared toward handling of large spatial datasets. These are representations of the spatial process in a lower-dimensional subspace and are often referred to as low-rank or reduced-rank spatial models (Higdon 2002; Kamman and Wand 2003; Stein 2007, 2008; Cressie and Johannesson 2008; Banerjee et al. 2008; Crainiceaniu et al. 2008). The idea here is to consider a smaller set of points, often referred to as “knots,” where the number of knots is fixed to be much smaller than the number of observed locations, and to express the spatial process in terms of its realizations over the smaller set of knots. It is reasonable to assume there will be insignificant loss of spatial information in the underlying process from using a smaller set of locations that determines a subspace to project the data onto. Subsequently, we consider a special class of low-rank processes called the predictive process (Banerjee et al. 2008). This arises from a conditional expectation of the original process (referred to as the parent process) given its realization over the knots. As such, the predictive process model achieves certain optimality properties (Banerjee et al. 2008) and, also, is a dimension reduction technique that requires no additional tuning parameters in the modeling. As in Gelfand et al. (2005), we adopt a Bayesian framework to fit the proposed hierarchical models. Here, inference about model parameters and subsequent prediction at new locations and times is based on samples from posterior distributions. These samples are collected using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The statistical literature acknowledges that spatial and temporal associations are captured most effectively using models that build dependencies in different stages (Banerjee et al. 2004). Hierarchical models are especially advantageous with datasets having several lurking sources of uncertainty and dependence, where they enable much richer models with less stringent assumptions than traditional modeling paradigms (see e.g., Carlin and Louis 2000; Gelman et al. 2004). The remainder of the paper evolves as follows. Section 2 defines the proposed predictive process for spatio-temporal modeling and an efficient MCMC sampling and prediction algorithm. Here too, we offer a criterion to assess model fit. In Sect. 3, we explore the proposed model using an analysis of weather station data collected over the northeastern United States between 2000 and 2005. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the paper with a brief summary and description of future work.",39

Generally, data originating from the digital terrain model (DTM) provide a basis for spatial organization in such systems (Carlisle 2002; Li et al. 2005). Source data forming the DTM are most frequently obtained from direct measurements or indirectly from the digitalization of analog materials (Maune 2001; Wechsler 2003; Weng 2002). Contemporary measurement systems, such as aerial laser scanning or multiple beam sonic sounders, can obtain large volumes of information within a relatively short time (Aerts et al. 2003; Aruga et al. 2005; Cobby et al. 2001; Wack and Wimmer 2002). With a large volume of measurement data available, it is possible to generate a very accurate terrain model. The direct use of such sets, however, is difficult because of the volume and non-standardized nature of information recording (Heo 2003; Takefusa 2001; Wechsler 2003). Due to the high pace of development and the particular role played by information, the quality and reliability of data and dynamic data processing are equally important considerations. It is also desirable to conduct comprehensive comparative analyses for the same elements during different measurement periods. As a consequence, attempts are underway to organize the spatial structure and limit the number of points generating the digital terrain model while maintaining the required accuracy. The presentation of information describing the surface in the form of a regular GRID-type node structure (a regular grid of nodes—the points forming the DTM are located in the corners of squares with a specified side length) is one of the methods applied to organize the above information (Hutchinson and Gallant 2000; Raaflaub and Collins 2006; Zhou and Liu 2004). It enables a reduction in the amount of data, limits redundancy and significantly accelerates information processing. During the processing of data originating from different sources, particular attention should be paid to its distribution in the measurement spectrum, which is determined by the acquisition method. The quality and accuracy of data depends on the acquisition method. Irrespective of data type, in each case of GRID interpolation, we should aim at achieving the maximum accuracy of the DTM and reducing the number of points forming the model. Appropriate selection of interpolation algorithm parameters is an important consideration in the process of generating the grid squares (Maune 2001; Schabenberger and Gotway 2005). These algorithms support the interpolation of the values at individual nodes based on measurement points (Scherzinger et al. 2001; Shi et al. 2004; Wilson and Gallant 2000). Proper selection of measurement points used in the calculations is of key importance for precise determination of the values at the nodes. The subject matter covered by the article presents the methodology and the process of analysis conducted on selected surface models and selected interpolation algorithms. Altogether, 18 different cases of surface have been analyzed. Based on each surface, the accuracy of 11 different interpolation algorithms has been examined in seven different configurations of search sectors, for 4 different values of measurement points density. The study was conducted for two cases, where entire surfaces were taken into account (together with the edge nodal points) and selected subareas on the surfaces (without edge nodes). Altogether, 11,088 calculated values were obtained, which were subsequently analyzed. Due to the limited size of this article, it is not possible to present all of the analyzed cases. For this reason, presentation of the study results was limited to 6 surfaces, 8 algorithms of interpolation, 7 sector systems and 4 densities for the 2 mentioned cases. Since the rule of procedure and analysis is the same for all cases, a detailed description of methodology has been presented for one selected surface with a different configuration of the measurement points. From among all analyses, examples representative of the majority of the analyzed cases were selected. These examples illustrate the procedure of determining the accuracy of interpolation algorithms and estimating the effect of the location of measurement points on the calculation results. The results of the study provide an example of an analytical procedure and a presentation of the possibility of analyses performed in order to improve the quality of DTMs.",58

Longley,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Geodemographic indicators are composite measures describing the socio-spatial structure of small geographic areas (Harris et al. 2005). They are typically used: to describe and hypothesise about processes of residential differentiation (e.g. Reibel 2011); to explore over- or under-represented behaviours exhibited between neighbourhood types (e.g. Singleton 2010); or to establish a basis to marketing activity or resource allocation in the private or public sectors, respectively (e.g. Singleton and Spielman 2014). Although geodemographic classification have received criticism (e.g. Goss 1995), they have developed and sustained a reputedly robust pedigree (Birkin et al. 2002) in both the public and private sectors (Longley 2005), with numerous successful areas of application including health (Petersen et al. 2011), retail (Thompson et al. 2012), education (Singleton et al. 2012), planning (Batey and Brown 2007) and policing (Ashby and Longley 2005). Like their historical antecedents of social area analysis and factorial ecology (Timms 1971; Rees 1972), many modern geodemographic classifications are created entirely from cross-sectional census data. Although research has illustrated how such classifications could be updated and created in “real time” (Adnan et al. 2010), these methods have yet to enter mainstream use, potentially because of the computational complexity associated with their implementation (particularly when repeated iterations on large data sets are required in order to ensure a stable cluster solution), and the extent to which end-users are willing to engage in the process of classification creation. The USA and the UK have particularly well-developed geodemographic markets, and here the majority of classifications are supplied by the commercial sector (Singleton and Spielman 2014), usually without comprehensive metadata and documentation of the techniques used. In addition, high licensing fees for the classifications (or composite data) can preclude their use by many potential end-users (Singleton and Longley 2009), and classifications may not pass the scientific requirement that they are reproducible by other researchers. In response to such issues, an alternate model of “open geodemographics” has been developed within some jurisdictions, where both the data and methods are all within the public domain. For example, in the UK, the 2001 output area classification (OAC) (Vickers and Rees 2007) became the most widely used open-source geodemographic classification and has now been updated using 2011 UK census data collected by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).Footnote 1 The variables making up this classification are selected to cover a series of domains and subdomains designed to provide a balanced general-purpose picture of the social, economic, built and population structure of the UK, with the final selection of variables also guided by the desire not to include variables that were strongly correlated with one another. Both the 2001 and 2011 OACs were created using the widely used k-means clustering procedure (Everitt et al. 2011), which is applied by iteratively assigning each UK census output area to one of a pre-specified number of clusters, so as to minimise the overall squared Euclidean distance of every area’s attributes to their nearest cluster mean. An important distinction between the 2001 and 2011 OACs and commercial geodemographic classifications is that the latter typically, although not universally, incorporate non-census data that may be collected more frequently, thus unshackling classification building in the UK from the ten yearly census cycle. The 2001 and 2011 OAC methodologies contained no mechanism through which accumulated uncertainty in the potential reliability of its cluster assignments could be assessed over time, and the remit for the 2001 and 2011 OAC projects did not allow for the classification to be reviewed and possibly updated. The overarching aim of the analysis presented here is to explore how changes in the values of the census variables for given locations result in reassignment of geodemographic class over time, with particular focus upon the variables that are used in the open 2001 and 2011 OAC classifications. By examining the nature and patterning of change, we can provide an assessment of the degradation of accuracy in a census-based classification over an intercensal period and an assessment of the extent to which this is acceptable for typical applications. Thus, for this analysis we pool 2001 and 2011 census data using a common geography and set of attributes to create a classification that spans both census periods. The basic classification methodology broadly follows that of the 2011 OAC, which itself was an adaption of the classification of 2001 census data devised by Vickers and Rees (2007). Through our unified 2001–2011 temporal OAC, we examine the stability of the clusters obtained from the pooled data over time. We then discuss, in general terms, the nature of the changes that have occurred to the geodemographic structure of the UK over the period 2001–2011. Finally, as part of our discussion of the results, we also investigate how other secondary data sources might be used to accommodate measures of change during the intercensal period. Any summary representation of the social similarities that characterise scattered neighbourhood areas is, however, necessarily incomplete, and the mix of variables that are included in general-purpose classifications are the outcome of choice, convention and chance. Voas and Williamson’s (2001) prescient discussion of the importance of place in geodemographics focuses on the diversity of social attributes that occurs within neighbourhood clusters, but their conclusion that “while taxonomy has its uses, it is of little use in producing complete descriptions of particular areas” (p. 64) is unhelpful to the wide range of organisations in business, government and research who nevertheless continue to find them useful in characterising and comparing areas (Singleton and Spielman 2014). In what follows, we thus take as given that the socio-economic indicators that underpin geodemographic classifications remain sufficiently stable over an intercensal period to allow pooling of data from different time periods, and that the established procedures of cluster analysis provide a valid way of identifying the social similarities that characterise different neighbourhoods.",23

We need to ensure that the objects adjacent in reality are connected and that the discrepancies have been eliminated. These discrepancies are present because different equipments were used to collect the data, because the data are represented at different scales, because different coordinates reference systems are used and the conversion to a unified one introduces errors, or because the border is a natural feature such as a river (Ruiz et al. 2011). This issue is often referred to as horizontal conflation since the datasets to be integrated do not overlap spatially (or only slightly, at their boundaries) (Yuan and Tao 1999; Davis 2003). The other type of conflation is vertical: Datasets covering the same area are combined, usually to create a new dataset whose accuracy is improved (Lynch and Saalfeld 1985). Two datasets: part of France (blue) and of Germany (green). Both datasets are formed of polygons representing the first administrative subdivisions. a Original datasets (from different sources). b After horizontal conflation has been applied (colour figure online) We focus in this paper on one aspect of horizontal conflation (see Fig. 1): given two or more datasets composed of polygons (e.g., representing provinces, municipalities or cadastral parcels), 
we want to modify the boundaries of (some of) the polygons and “align” them so that gaps and overlapping areas are eliminated. As further explained in Sect. 2, this problem has been almost exclusively tackled by first isolating the boundaries of the datasets from the polygons they are incident to, and second using line-based algorithms to eliminate the discrepancies: corresponding real-world entities are matched using a threshold (a maximum searching distance), and then the alignment is performed by moving the lines to the same location (often referred to as “snapping”). We see several problems with this approach (we elaborate on these in Sect. 2). First, in our experience, finding a matching threshold that will resolve all discrepancies in a dataset is often impossible—a too small value prevents some lines to be matched, and a too large value creates invalid geometries somewhere else. Second, this problem is amplified if we consider that the edges are not in isolation but are the boundaries of polygons: the risk of collapsing parts of polygons to lines is high since it is tempting to use a large threshold to solve problems. Third, there are no reliable mechanisms to verify if the snapping was successful and what were the consequences of it on the geometries. We present in Sect. 3 a novel algorithm to align the boundaries of adjacent datasets. Our algorithm differs significantly from other ones since it considers the polygon as its primitive (and does not isolate lines or focus solely on them), does not use a threshold to match features, and the alignment is performed without moving/snapping geometries. Instead, the discrepancies are identified and eliminated by using a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) as a supporting structure. This allows us to guarantee that the datasets have been properly conflated and that the polygons are geometrically valid. We can furthermore indicate to the user what changes were made to the polygons. The algorithm we present in this paper is an extension of our previous work for automatically repairing planar partitions: We filled small gaps and overlaps (often not visible to the user) by using a triangulation-based method (Arroyo Ohori et al. 2012). Our extensions are threefold: (1) gaps and overlaps are eliminated in a manner this is consistent with how practitioners conflate datasets, i.e., by modifying first geometries with the lowest accuracy; (2) large problem areas (such as those in Fig. 1a) are partitioned and each part is repaired independently, which ensures that the polygons involved to fix the area are not modify too much (the errors are distributed) and that the connection between features are preserved; (3) we propose a modification that allows us to perform what we call spatial extent alignment, e.g., to ensure that a set of polygons representing municipalities (or other administrative entities) fit exactly in a larger polygon representing their province. The latter improvements has the added benefits of allowing us to potentially align the boundaries of very large datasets, since we align them at different levels—from the neighbourhoods in a city to provinces in a country—and we can thus subdivide datasets into parts that fit in memory. We report in Sect. 4 on our implementation of the algorithm (it is based on the stable and fast triangulator in CGALFootnote 1) and on the experiments we have made with different real-world datasets in Europe. We also demonstrate how boundary lines, often used in practice, can be incorporated in our approach. Finally, we discuss in Sect. 5 the shortcomings of our method and future work.",2

The context and rationale for this binary response predictor or classifier derive from two areas of interest or concern in regression modelling in geography: (a) non-stationarity in data relationships and (b) collinearity and model selection in the predictor variable data set. For issue (a), this can be dealt with using an explicitly local framework such as the geographically weighed (GW) modelling approach proposed by Fotheringham et al. (2002), where issue (b) is now similarly localized commonly requiring some penalized regression adaptation. In applications of regression to spatial data, two effects are often of most concern: (1) spatial autocorrelation in the error term and (2) spatial heterogeneity of the regressions coefficients. The former contradicts the underlying assumptions of independence and identically distributed errors, whilst the latter contradicts the assumption of fixed data relationships, when applying a standard regression. The former commonly requires the incorporation of a stationary autocorrelation parameter in the regression model, whilst the latter allows the regression coefficients to vary across space—i.e. they are non-stationary. In either case, the objective is the same, that is to provide more accurate or realistic coefficients together with associated measures of uncertainty. Often it is difficult to identify or separate one effect from the other, as both effects tend to be strongly inter-linked (e.g. Anselin 1990) and some models aim to capture both effects (e.g. Brunsdon et al. 1998). The focus of this paper lies with effect (1) in accounting for spatial heterogeneity between response and predictor data relationships. In this respect, a GW modelling approach is followed, where localized versions of a generalized linear model (GLM) with a logit link function (Fotheringham et al. 2002) are applied (i.e. a GW logistic regression, GW-LR, as the response is binary) and developed (i.e. via the new geographically weighted elastic net logistic regression (GW-ENLR) model), which are themselves extensions of the classic GW regression (GWR) (Brunsdon et al. 1996) for a Gaussian response. Model selection is an important component of any regression model construction. It involves identifying which predictor variables to include and/or techniques for transforming and reducing the predictor subset. In the context of this study, model selection is directly linked to the reduction in unwanted collinearity effects among the predictors. Failure to correctly specify a model when collinearity is present can result in a loss of precision and power in the coefficient estimates—leading to poor inferences. This risk commonly increases as more predictors are introduced. Collinearity occurs when pairs of predictor variables have a strong positive or negative relationship with each other and is typically considered a potential problem when these data pairs have correlations of less than − 0.8 or greater than + 0.8, say. Approaches for addressing collinearity include transformations of the predictors such as that found in principal components analysis (PCA) regression, so that the transform negates collinearity altogether, or a related approach, such as that provided by partial least squares regression (e.g. Frank and Friedman 1993). In this study, a penalized approach is taken via the elastic net, a hybrid of ridge regression and the lasso (i.e. the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) (Zou and Hastie 2005). Only the lasso and the elastic net additionally provide a model selection function. Issues of collinearity can be compounded under GW regression models, which use subsets of the data to construct a series of localized regressions. This is because predictor variables in the local subset may be collinear even when collinearity is not observed globally (Wheeler and Tiefelsdorf 2005; Wheeler 2013). For these reasons, a number of extensions have been proposed to address local collinearity including ridge GWR (Wheeler 2007; Brunsdon et al. 2012; Bárcena et al. 2014; Gollini et al. 2015) and the ‘adjusted/enriched data subset’ GWR models of Brunsdon et al. (2012) and Bárcena et al. (2014). For addressing collinearity and model selection, the GW lasso model has been a natural development (Wheeler 2009; Wang and Li 2017) and more recently, the GW elastic net (Li and Nam 2018), where local collinearity and local model selection are addressed. All such models are for Gaussian response variables only. For other response types, via a GW GLM framework, only a GW logistic lasso exists (Yoneoka et al. 2016). This paper now extends this suite of GW GLM approaches further by proposing an elastic net adaptation to GW-LR (GW-ENLR).Footnote 1 It applies this new model to two geographical case studies, one using election data and the another using environmental data, with the aim of improving prediction/classification accuracy and improving understanding of the processes being modelled through the local selection of key predictors that best explain the process, locally. Furthermore, and unlike the studies of Yoneoka et al. (2016) and Li and Nam (2018) with their respective GW logistic lasso and Gaussian-response GW elastic net models, this study evaluates the new GW-ENLR model through a simulation experiment, as similarly advocated in the Gaussian-response GW lasso study of Wheeler (2009).",6

With the aim of tackling such issues, how to make a city ‘smart’ has become a significant strategy in many developed and developing regions of the world. Although there is no standard definition of the smart city, common characteristics can be summarised as an integrated system connecting digital technologies, critical infrastructures and citizens, to plan, govern and manage a city in order to improve its sustainability, optimise processes and maximise the provision of collective public and private services (Harrison et al. 2010; Washburn et al. 2010; Batty 2017). Integral to the operationalisation of a smart city, it is often of relevance to obtain timely insights into the dynamics of urban population at a temporal granularity finer than that of traditional surveys, which can be enhanced by or provided through digital technologies. It is within this context that the present paper engages with the concept of urban areas of interest (UAOI), which refers to parts of the urban built environment that can be delineated in their extent through the clustering of human activity. Such areas may contain business zones, tourist attractions, iconic landmarks, recreational zones or other attractors (Hu et al. 2015). The notion of a UAOI is, therefore, a combination of morphological features including buildings and streets, and ‘points of interest’, as defined by the relevance the population concedes specific parts of cities. As such, a UAOI can be viewed as a perceptual space, which is captured by the social morphology of the city, albeit rooted in physical space (Crooks et al. 2016). Accordingly, a UAOI should emerge from the activities of a large collective of different people to avoid very individual conceptions. Furthermore, such definitions are complex, as unlike well-defined geographic divisions or administrative districts, the delineation of a UAOI may vary between people in different contexts, ages and cultures. Identifying and understanding UAOIs has applications in multiple fields. For spatial planning, they may assist in identifying areas with greater public priority in the context of limited resource availability (Gandy 2006). For retailing, they can help identify areas where people cluster, and how these have evolved over time, which might aid in store location or for targeting advertisements more effectively. For transport planning, they may help prioritise traffic flows or the provision of public transport; for statistical agencies, they may provide useful reference distributions in comparison with official geographical divisions. The challenge of defining UAOIs over time resides in the need for granular spatiotemporal data recorded within cities. Although traditional data sources used in urban studies, such as remotely sensed data, have a lengthy history of application and can be used to characterise urban morphology, they do not capture human dynamics beyond expansion or contraction of the built form. Alternatively, survey or census data might be utilised to inform the discovery of UAOIs, but these are usually costly to administer and may be of limited temporal granularity (Shi et al. 2014; Tasse and Hong 2014). A third alternative has emerged in the last few years. Several new forms of digital data derived from urban activity through passive or active forms of data collection capture urban form and/or social functional geography (Arribas-Bel 2014; Crooks et al. 2016). Such data are referred to as volunteered geographic information (VGI; Goodchild 2007), which includes the use of digital devices by communities or individuals to create, accumulate, upload and communicate geographic information, typically through contemporary web technology. Commonly designated as VGI is a variety of content from social media networks, which often support geolocation of assets and include networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and Instagram. Data derived from these networks have been used in a variety of contexts to explore spatial, temporal and even semantic information about human activities (Jiang et al. 2015; Lansley and Longley 2016; Lloyd and Cheshire 2017; Gao et al. 2017). In this paper, we examine the potential of data derived from the online photograph management and sharing website Flickr to extract and understand urban areas of interest. Although there are inherent biases associated with geotagged Flickr data, a number of studies have utilised these data effectively to explore various issues within urban contexts (Hollenstein and Purves 2010; Lee et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2015; Gao et al. 2017). Flickr offers an attractive proposition as a data source for a number of reasons. The scale of the Flickr network is extensive and, as of 2016, Flickr had 122 million users with more than 10 billion images shared, demonstrating a large degree of penetration (Smith 2016). Secondly, the metadata of each Flickr photograph is available through its public application programming interface, which can be retrieved back to 2004, making it possible to consider the temporal dimension of imagery. These features are in contrast to other sources of VGI from social networks, which have rather limited data retrieval limits (e.g. Foursquare only allows 1 month; Foursquare for Developer 2017). Finally, studies have suggested that Flickr photographs, in most cases, are taken in the urban built environment, and as such, enhance their suitability as a source to identify UAOIs (Crandall et al. 2009; Hollenstein and Purves 2010). Our goal is, therefore, to present a new method of extracting UAOIs and to provide new insights about their fine-grained spatiotemporal evolution and characteristics. We used geotagged Flickr data from three recent years (2013–2015) and have focused particularly on the seasonal variability of the UAOIs. A recent hierarchical algorithm was used to extract clusters, reducing many of the drawbacks of traditional, previously used and density-based methods. An ‘α-shape’ algorithm was then utilised to construct boundaries identifying the UAOI extents. Once built, we conduct further analysis on the spatial and temporal patterns associated with the identified UAOIs and propose an approach to build a spatiotemporal profile for each UAOI. The structure of this paper is organised as follows. The next section discusses related work about points of interest and areas of interest, as well as techniques for analysis of geotagged photograph data. Section 3 describes the data collection, data bias and pre-processing stages. Section 4, the core of the paper, proposes a methodological framework to extract and understand UAOIs, including an approach to validate the number of Flickr users in the extracted UAOIs. This is followed by a discussion of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the identified UAOIs. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper and suggests future extensions to this research.",25

Simultaneous dependence parameters arise when dependent variable observations exhibit dependence on other observations. This type of dependence is specified through a row-normalized spatial weight matrix. Most applied spatial econometrics relies on row-normalized weight matrices, and the methods described here are not valid for non-normalized weight matrices. Concrete illustrations of these specifications are shown in (1), (2) and (3).Footnote 1 The model in (1) is a dynamic space–time panel data model involving N regions and T time periods, e.g., (Parent and LeSage 2011). The \(N \times T\) vector of dependent variable observations y exhibits spatial dependence captured by the vector \((I_{T} \otimes W) y\) and associated scalar parameter \(\rho\), time dependence reflected by the vector \((L \otimes I_n) y\) and scalar parameter \(\phi\), where L is the matrix lag operator, e.g., \(L y_t = y_{t-1}\), and a space–time covariance vector \((L \otimes W) y\), with associated scalar parameter \(\theta\). Of course \(Z \delta\) are explanatory variables in the model and \(\varepsilon\) an \(N \times T\) disturbance vector. The matrix W is an \(N \times N\) weight matrix with zeros on the diagonal and row-sums of unity. The model in (2) is a spatial dependence variant of the gravity model for origin–destination flows introduced in LeSage and Pace (2008). The \(N^2 \times 1\) dependent variable vector of origin–destination flows \(y_{ij}\) from \(j=1,\ldots ,N\) origins to \(i=1,\ldots ,N\) destinations. Flows exhibit spatial dependence on neighbors to the origin observations captured by the \(N^2 \times 1\) vector \((W \otimes I_N) y\) and associated scalar parameter \(\rho _o\), spatial dependence on neighbors to the destination observations reflected by the \(N^2 \times 1\) vector \((I_N \otimes W) y\) and associated scalar parameter \(\rho _d\), as well as dependence that LeSage and Pace (2008) label origin–destination dependence captured by the vector \((W \otimes W) y\) and associated scalar parameter \(\rho _w\). Here again, the matrix W is an \(N \times N\) weight matrix with zeros on the diagonal and row-sums of unity. 
Debarsy and LeSage (2018) introduced the model in (3), which models cross-sectional dependence using a convex combination of m weight matrices, \(W_c = \gamma _1 W_1 + \gamma _2 W_2 + \cdots \gamma _m W_m\), where the scalar parameters \(\sum _{i=1}^m \gamma _i = 1\) and the scalar parameter \(\rho _c\) measures the strength of dependence. This model also relies on an \(N \times N\) weight matrix W that has zeros on the diagonal and row-sums of unity. For the case of the dynamic space–time panel data model, one would typically want to address the presence of region-specific or time-specific fixed effects. This is also true for the gravity model for origin–destination flows, where origin- and destination-specific fixed effects are typically introduced. The presence of fixed effects could be addressed by inclusion of fixed-effect parameters, but this would entail adding a large number of additional parameters to the model which would impact the computational speed of the methods proposed here. One alternative approach to dealing with fixed effects would be to use a transformation of the sample data y, X prior to estimation, which would not add any parameters to the model (e.g., Lee and Yu 2010a, b). Another approach would be that of Mundlak (1978), which would require adding an additional k parameters to the model associated with means of the explanatory variables taken over time periods. This should have little impact on the computational speed. We assume that the sample data have been transformed to address the presence of fixed effects in the remainder of the paper. For notational simplicity, we will work with a single model shown in (4) that can be used as the basis for discussion of the common features of the three models in (1), (2) and (3). The generic expression in (4) would involve different definitions for the matrices \(W_1, W_2, W_3\) , and the dependent variable vector could be of varying dimensions including NT space–time panel observations or \(N^2\) origin–destination flow magnitudes, or simply a cross section of N observations. A similar comment pertains to the specific nature of the model parameters \(\rho _1, \rho _2, \rho _3, \delta , \sigma ^2\). One thing in common for all models is the presence of multiple dependence parameters (\(\rho _1, \rho _2, \rho _3\)) which need to be estimated. This involves maximizing the (log) likelihood function over a multivariate optimization routine to find estimates for the multiple dependence parameters. A second common aspect of the models is that the dependence parameters are (well) defined over a limited interval that guarantees the existence of the matrix inverse: \(R^{-1} = (I - \rho _1 W_1 - \rho _2 W_2 - \rho _3 W_3)^{-1}\). Specifically, this interval is \(1/\mu _{\min },1/\mu _{\max }\), where \(\mu _{\min }, \mu _{\max }\) are the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the matrix R. The minimum eigenvalue will be negative, and the maximum eigenvalue will be one, provided the weight matrices are row-normalized. A lower bound of -1 is often used in applied practice to avoid the need to calculate the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the large matrix R. However, modern computing allows rapid calculation of the smallest eigenvalue for a sparse weight matrix. MATLAB takes 0.16 s to compute the smallest eigenvalue for an \(N=10,000\) weight matrix with six nearest neighbors and 1.07 s for an \(N=100,000\) weight matrix based on six nearest neighbors. This means that stability restrictions must be imposed on the dependence parameters during estimation, which would require use of a multivariate constrained optimization algorithm. Specifics of the stability restrictions vary depending on the specific model specification, but for our purposes, we need only to consider that these restrictions must be imposed during estimation. Another challenge to maximum likelihood estimation of this family of models is the log-determinant term that arises in the (log) likelihood function, specifically (log): \(|I - \rho _1 W_1 - \rho _2 W_2 \rho _3 W_3|\) for the generic model expression in (4), where we leave the dimension of the identity matrix I undefined as this would vary for specific models. In the case of conventional spatial regression models involving a single weight matrix, there is a great deal of literature on approaches to efficiently calculating or approximating the log-determinant term that appears in the (log) likelihood (\(|I_N - \rho W|\)), (see LeSage and Pace (2008, Chapter 4)). These approaches are not directly applicable to the family of models considered here, complicating maximum likelihood, since the log-determinant expression needs to be evaluated for multiple dependence parameter values during optimization. In the case of Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation, the log-determinant term appears in the conditional distribution for the dependence parameters requiring multiple evaluations during sampling. Another aspect of these models regards proper interpretation of the partial derivative impacts on the dependent variable vector arising from changes in the explanatory variables, e.g., \(\partial E(y) / \partial X^r\) for the \(r\hbox {th}\) explanatory variable. For the case of the generic model in (4), we have: \(\partial E(y) / \partial X^r = [I - \hat{\rho }_1 W_1 - \hat{\rho }_2 W_2 - \hat{\rho }_3 W_3)]^{-1} \hat{\delta }^r\), where \(\hat{\delta }^r\) is the coefficient on the \(r\hbox {th}\) explanatory variable. See Debarsy et al. (2012) for specifics regarding the dynamic space–time panel model from (1), LeSage and Thomas-Agnan (2015) for the case of the origin–destination flow model in (2) and Debarsy and LeSage (2018) for the convex combination model in (3). Calculating the matrix inverse \([I - \hat{\rho }_1 W_1 - \hat{\rho }_2 W_2 - \hat{\rho }_3 W_3)]^{-1}\) only once to determine point estimates of the partial derivative effects is not particularly challenging as these matrices are sparse when the weight matrices are sparse. However, conventional practice in maximum likelihood estimation produces empirical estimates for measures of dispersion associated with the partial derivative effect estimates based on simulating the dependence parameter values as well as \(\hat{\delta }\) from the (estimated) variance–covariance matrix involving either the analytical or numerical Hessian. A number of such simulated parameters (say \(d=1000\)) are then evaluated in the partial derivative expressions to produce a sequence of d effect estimates that represent as an empirical measure of the posterior distribution of the partial derivative effects. A naive approach to this would require d matrix inversions, which makes calculation of the partial derivative effect estimates on which inference is based on a computationally challenging problem. Because of the issues outlined above, estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is described here, with flat prior distributions assigned to the parameters \(\rho _1, \rho _2, \rho _3, \delta , \sigma ^2\). Parameter restrictions are imposed on the dependence parameters during MCMC sampling using methods described later. Since emphasis is on modeling situations involving large samples of observations, prior information would not play a role in determining posterior estimates of the parameters, so MCMC is used as a computational device to produce estimates that should be identical to those from maximum likelihood estimation. MCMC estimation involves sequentially sampling each parameter (or set of parameters) from their conditional distributions (or joint conditional distribution in the case of a set of parameters). Expressions for the conditional distributions are frequently easier to calculate than those required to evaluate the (log) likelihood, which is true for the models considered here. Section 2 of the paper sets forth an MCMC estimation procedure, which involves an approximation to the log-determinant expression that arises in the models and approximations used to evaluate the matrix inverses that arise in the expressions for the partial derivatives needed to interpret the model. The estimation method is capable of producing a Monte Carlo (integration) estimate of the log-marginal likelihood, which is valuable for model comparison. Timing results for problems of varying sizes are shown in Sect. 3, and Monte Carlo results that validate the MCMC estimation method are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 provides an application of the method to illustrate the use of the log-marginal likelihood for model comparison purposes.",4

There is an obvious parallel between Italexit and the impending exit of the UK, the so-called Brexit, but of course Italy’s exit would be somewhat different from the UK’s, because Italy is also part of the Eurozone, whereas the UK retains sterling. The possibility of Italy’s exit is a real possibility given that powerful political parties involved in the coalition government (left-populist Five Star Movement and right populist League) are indeed advocating Italexit as a solution to Italy’s economic and social travails, particularly related to immigration. In this paper some ramifications for regional employment are explored, as measured by the percentage job-shortfall that would occur as a result of diminished trade between Italy and the EU regions. The manifestation of Italexit would be complex, for not only would trade barriers between the remaining EU regions and Italian regions increase, for example, involving tariff and non-tariff barriers that currently do not exist, but also there would be exchange rate differences between Italy and the EU if there was also withdrawal from the Eurozone. Indeed, devaluation of a reinstigated lira could possibly increase trade with the EU despite increased barriers, and also stimulate trade with other non-EU countries. However, the euro itself could be weakened or even destroyed by Italy’s exit, with heavy repercussions on the world financial system. A devalued currency could lead to a flight of assets from the country, inflationary pressures and high interest rates. An insightful account of the financial implications of Italexit is provided by Codogno and Galli (2017), who among other things argue that ‘redenomination, and a likely default on debt obligations, would not be a solution to the problem of a high public debt and would produce significant financial and economic instability’. Given the complexity involved, it is of course very difficult to predict how Italexit might affect employment both within Italy and across the EU regions. Accordingly, I attempt to simulate the impact of reduced trade on employment as robustly as possible given the inherent uncertainties attached to Italexit. To do this, I consider a so-called job-shortfall, that is the gross number of jobs likely to be lost due to trade reduction alone. This is not a prediction of the actual, or net, change in employment, because of course the other factors such as increased trade due to the stimulus of a possible devaluation could more than offset the job-shortfall, or indeed there could be a catastrophic job loss due to ensuing global economic chaos. The job-shortfall considered in this paper is an estimate of the jobs that would need to be replaced given a negative Italexit trade shock. With a focus on the loss of trade between Italian and other EU regions, the question arises, by how much will trade flows diminish? In reality we would expect trade reductions to differ according to sector and according to regions. So a pair of regions, one Italian and one in the remaining EU, could have a diminution of trade that is different from a different regional pair. Of course, the percentage loss of trade that would occur is unknown. In an attempt to make the predictions robust, I assume that the percentage loss in trade is the same for every pair of regions. In that way, the geography of impact is constant across different assumptions about the trade loss. That is, the relative impact between regions remains constant regardless of what is assumed for the loss of trade and the ensuing job-shortfall. There are similarities and contrasts with Brexit. In a companion paper to this one (Fingleton 2019) which uses precisely the same methodology, predictions of job-shortfall are also made as a consequence of the UK’s exit from the EU. As with my Brexit predictions, I emphasize that the Italexit predictions are treated with caution, to repeat my earlier warning, ‘the numbers SHOULD NOT be taken too seriously. They are naturally dependent on the assumptions underpinning the model. Different assumptions regarding model structure, relevant data and estimation techniques can all potentially affect the predictions’. In both cases we see that the impact of exit on the job-shortfall is bilateral, regions within the UK and Italy and the rest of the EU are expected to see a job-shortfall. The details of the geography differ somewhat however, as will be explored subsequently. In order to estimate the Italexit effect, I estimate employment levels across \(N=255\) EU regionsFootnote 1 both with and without Italexit. The explicit drivers of employment are output and capital, which are approximated by gross value added (GVA) and a function of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), respectively. Estimation of a model with employment related to output and capital is based on a viable data series over the period 2001 to 2010.Footnote 2 Different assumptions are made about post-2011 paths for GVA and GFCF, given that accessible data with the same geography are not available, although these different assumptions have relatively little effect on outcomes.",5

Well-known examples of such a phenomenon are Silicon Valley and Route 128 (Saxenian 1994), the carpet manufacturing industry in Dalton (Krugman 1991), and the Italian industrial districts (Brusco 1982; Becattini 1990; Cainelli and Zoboli 2004).
 The most recent literature on spatial agglomeration has focused on two main research topics. The first one refers to the empirical determinants of the geographic concentration of production activities, and tries to identify the reasons why some geographic areas are more agglomerated than others. According to the Marshallian tradition (Marshall 1920), these factors are generally identified in knowledge spillovers, input sharing, and labor market pooling (Strange and Rosenthal 2001). The second literature stream refers to the effects of spatial agglomeration, and, precisely, of different types of local externalities, on firms’ economic performance. Thus, it aims at understanding whether location within an agglomerated area generates positive returns on the economic performance of firms (Henderson 2003; Martin et al. 2011), and, consequently, on the economic dynamism and growth of territories as a whole (Glaeser et al. 1992; Henderson et al. 1995; Combes 2000). A commonality characterizing most of these studies is that spatial agglomeration is treated as a static—i.e., time-invariant—phenomenon. To the best of our knowledge, only few contributions have investigated empirically the temporal dynamics of spatial agglomeration processes, that is whether and how the spatial agglomeration of firms changes over time (e.g., Arbia et al. 2010; Kang 2010; Arbia et al. 2014), and how these changes influence its firm-level economic returns (e.g., Martin et al. 2011; Cainelli et al. 2016). Indeed, the temporal dynamics is a key dimension of spatial agglomeration (Ellison and Glaeser 1997), which is a complex process changing over both space and time. In fact, some industries experience processes of geographic clustering/concentration, while others spread over space. Moreover, geographic concentration/dispersion processes can accelerate during some years (time clustering), while they can reduce during others (time dispersion). Spatial agglomeration may accelerate over time during the initial stages of the product life-cycle of a local industry/cluster, when a rapid increase in the number of new firms is generally observed (Klepper and Graddy 1990; Klepper 1996; Kang 2010); in years of ‘sudden changes’ associated with historical accidents, technological revolutions or discoveries, structural transformations (e.g., industrialization), external shocks (e.g., natural disasters, economic or financial crises); and, finally, during some specific periods of the business cycle (Arbia et al. 2010; Kang 2010; Henderson et al. 2018). On the contrary, spatial agglomeration may decelerate in years characterized by mature stages of the product life-cycle of a local industry/cluster, or during periods without significant technological advances or structural changes. In all these cases, the underlying mechanism is the same, i.e., the entry (exit) of firms into (from) the local industry/cluster that may change the agglomeration structure over both space and time. In other words, both the rate at which firms’ birth and death take place and their spatial location can have effects not only on the geographic concentration of economic activities, but also on the intensity of clustering processes (Devereux et al. 2004). This implies that spatial agglomeration cannot be investigated as a static phenomenon, given its intrinsic dynamic nature, such that the temporal dimension of agglomeration—the so-called time clustering—cannot be ignored. Moreover, it should be investigated at the sectoral level, since manufacturing sectors, which may be characterized by different levels of spatial agglomeration, do not behave homogeneously over both space and time. The aim of this paper is to investigate the agglomeration dynamics that has characterized the Italian manufacturing industry during the period of the Great Recession. We employ a large sample of geo-referenced, single-plant manufacturing firms observed over the period 2007–2012, and located in the Italian continental territory, to analyze the spatial and temporal dimensions of agglomeration processes at the two-digit sector level, as well as their potential interactions. The choice of focusing on the period 2007–2012 is justified by the fact that the effects of the Great Recession have been particularly relevant for the Italian economy during these years. Indeed, during this time period, firm demography—birth and death rates—changed significantly in many sectors, thus affecting their agglomeration structures. We investigate agglomeration over time using three different statistical approaches. First, we compute the Ellison and Glaeser’s (1997) index of industrial geographic concentration for the years 2007 and 2012 at the two-digit sector level by adopting three different spatial units of analysis: the region, corresponding to the level 2 of the Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques (NUTS) adopted by the European Union (EU); the province, corresponding to the NUTS-3 level; and the Local Labor Market (LLM), corresponding to a functional area defined according to economic—i.e., commuting patterns of workers—rather than administrative criteria. As it is well-known, the Ellison and Glaeser’s (1997) index suffers from the so-called Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) that refers to the discretionary choice of the spatial unit used to analyze geographic-based phenomena (Arbia 1989; Amrhein 1995; Wong and Amrhein 1996). In fact, the use of pre-defined geographic units can introduce statistical biases in this kind of analysis. As suggested by the literature, a possible solution to the MAUP consists in relying on micro-geographic data, and adopting statistical methods that treat the space as a continuum (Arbia 2001). Based on these insights, the second approach we adopt to study agglomeration over time consists in estimating Ripley’s (1976) spatial K-function that exploits geographic information on the location (latitude and longitude coordinates) of firms. The spatial K-function is a statistical tool employed in the context of spatial points pattern analysis, and, precisely, it is a distance-based method that estimates the expected number of point events realizing within a certain distance from any randomly sampled point event. In our particular context, point events are represented by firms, and the spatial K-function allows us to evaluate whether sector-specific concentration/dispersion patterns took place—with respect to the benchmark case of complete spatial randomness (CSR) in the location choice of firms—in a given year. Therefore, this approach allows us to evaluate the geographic scale at which a sector shows a clustering/dispersion pattern, if any, in a ‘single moment of time,’ but without imposing a priori spatial boundaries to the area under investigation (Marcon and Puech 2003; Duranton and Overman 2005; Arbia et al. 2008; Marcon and Puech 2010; Kosfeld et al. 2011; Albert et al. 2012; Scholl and Brenner 2016). Given the ‘static’ nature of the spatial K-function, the temporal dynamics of agglomeration processes can be analyzed in this context simply by comparing the values of the estimated K-functions in different years. In other words, these univariate functions are used in a dynamic fashion by analyzing them separately, i.e., year by year, and then by assessing both whether sector-specific clustering/dispersion patterns took place in the pre-crisis year 2007 and in the last observational year 2012, and how they potentially changed in the year 2012 with respect to the year 2007. This method, however, does not allow us to describe the dynamics of agglomeration patterns taking place over time, namely the agglomeration processes occurring between the years 2007 and 2012. This can be a problem, since ‘different space–time processes can lead to resulting spatial patterns which look the same’ (Arbia et al. 2010, p. 312). The third approach is aimed precisely at overcoming this limitation, and consists in estimating the space–time K-function (Diggle et al. 1995) that can be used to analyze simultaneously the spatial and temporal dimensions of agglomeration processes, as well as the potential existence of space–time interactions. Thus, the space–time K-function represents an extension of the purely spatial K-function with respect to the analysis of the temporal dimension of spatial points patterns. Specifically, it estimates the expected number of point events per unitary area in the region under investigation and per unit of time that fall at a spatial distance and at a time interval equal to or lower than a certain radius and a certain time interval, respectively, from a reference point (French et al. 2005). Thus, the space–time K-function allows us to identify not only the existence of concentration/dispersion processes in different years, but also the spatial and temporal threshold values at which these concentration/dispersion processes occur over both space and time—for example, a rapid acceleration over time in the process of spatial clustering of a sector. Therefore, this third statistical approach provides us with a more comprehensive tool to analyze the dynamics of agglomeration processes, as it allows us to evaluate whether and how sector-specific agglomerative structures have exhibited different degrees of clustering/dispersion at different spatial scales along the temporal dimension. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second Section describes the dataset used in the empirical analysis. The third Section presents the statistical approaches employed. The fourth Section presents and discusses the empirical evidence on the agglomeration dynamics. The fifth Section concludes the work.",2

Harris,Ranjodh B. Singh,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Demographers and policy-makers are often faced with the challenge of projecting sparse populations in order to plan for the provision of infrastructure and basic services. This is especially the case in remote regions within a country. Without accurate spatial information regarding current and future population levels, it is almost impossible to appropriately plan the provision of utilities and services such as water, housing, health and education. In this paper, we propose a new empirical approach to modelling sparse populations, illustrated through its application to projecting Indigenous populations of communities in regional and remote Australia. By way of context, substantial disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations exist across virtually all indicators of social and economic well-being (Steering Committee for the Review of Government Service Provision 2016). The role of remoteness in narratives surrounding Indigenous disadvantage is both pivotal and controversial. Relative to other Australians, a far higher proportion of the Indigenous population—consisting of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples—is found in remote areas of the continent. While large population centres offer greater access to services, infrastructure and labour market opportunity, for many Indigenous Australians those centres cannot offer the connections to homelands, culture and kinship networks intrinsic to their well-being. Australia’s current policy discourse includes reservations over the sustainability of remote Indigenous communities. Implicitly, and in some cases explicitly, it seems governments would prefer a rationalisation of these communities, with migration out of the smaller and more remote communities, and their eventual disappearance (see, for example, NT-Government 2009; Regional-Services-Reform-Unit 2016). Clearly the effectiveness of policy and funding allocations for remote communities relies upon a degree of consistency between assumed and actual population trends. That is, there is a paramount need for separate projections for the Indigenous population as a result of their vastly differing demography, service requirements and migration patterns relative to the mainstream population (Taylor et al. 2006; Wilson 2009; Raymer et al. 2017). Projections of the age structure of individual communities are important in determining the likely mix of services required, such as the number of school places and aged care facilities. As set out in the following section, such forecasting exercises are inherently difficult for sparse populations, with added complications in the context of Australia’s Indigenous population. No projections currently exist at the community level to guide policy and planning.",1

These can be broadly divided into those following (1) Taylor’s (2001) interlocking world city network model (IWCNM) based on office location data of advanced producer services (APS) firms, (2) ownership linkages among parent companies and subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (Alderson and Beckfield 2004) and (3) inter-organisational projects (Pažitka et al. 2019). We refer to them shortly as the (1) office networks, (2) ownership ties and (3) inter-organisational project approach (IOPA). The broad division of the existing approaches described here stems primarily from either explicit or implicit choices of the respective researchers regarding the network boundary specification underlying their research design. Network boundary specification in this context refers to the choices researchers make regarding what is and what is not part of the network under study. This problem can be divided into two parts—(1) network ties (edges) and (2) actors (vertices). As a matter of empirical feasibility, researchers generally impose restrictions on the inclusion of both the network ties and actors. Unlike in studies of statistically independent observations, network data by definition includes dependencies among observations and for this reason the network boundary specification problem is of fundamental importance to the validity, robustness and scientific value of studies that focus on network structural properties (Laumann et al. 1989). The established practice in studies of urban networks is to derive the centrality of cities in urban networks by aggregating the network connections of individual organisations located in these cities. Consequently, the implications of the network boundary specification problem are just as relevant to this literature and its conclusions. In all the empirical studies of urban networks that we consulted, the network boundaries are clearly defined both in terms of the specification of network ties considered as well as actors included (Alderson and Beckfield 2004; Pažitka et al. 2019; Taylor and Derudder 2016). Specification of network ties is generally dictated by the nature of the phenomenon under consideration and availability of data for its empirical observation. Actor inclusion is typically restricted by actors’ importance or geographical area of interest. Interestingly, none of the studies of urban networks that we surveyed explicitly discuss the network boundary specification problem and its consequences or reference methodological studies from social network analysis that consider this problem. The primary research objective of this paper therefore is to investigate the reliability of city network centralities obtained from sampled networks. We are specifically interested in the following research question—What sampling percentages are required to obtain city network centralities consistent with those from a whole network analysis? To allow for a comparable analysis across the three approaches for modelling urban networks outlined earlier, we identify all the securities firms involved in any of the syndicated deals available in Dealogic Equity Capital Market (ECM) and Debt Capital Market (DCM) databases for 2015, representing collectively 2192 legal entities. We then collect data on their involvement in syndicated deals (Pažitka et al. 2019), office locations (Taylor 2001) and parent-subsidiary ownership ties (Alderson and Beckfield 2004), allowing us to construct three different types of networks for the same set of underlying actors. We then sample from these three distinctive whole networks and compare results across sampled and whole networks, separately for each modelling approach, at sampling percentages ranging from 1 to 95% of the underlying actors. Given the comprehensive nature of Dealogic databases, we treat these urban networks formed by the activities of securities firms as being complete (whole networks), when all the underlying securities firms identified in Dealogic ECM and DCM databases have been included. Our results indicate that city network centralities obtained from sampled networks converge on those obtained from whole networks as sampling percentage increases. We achieve reliable results with samples ranging from 4% of the underlying actors for Taylor’s (2001) IWCNM, 10% for Alderson and Beckfield’s (2004) model, to 25% for the IOPA (Pažitka et al. 2019), when we sample the biggest companies first, rather than drawing a random sample. These results contrast with studies of network boundary specification and network sampling in social networks, which suggest that commonly used measures of network centrality become inconsistent with their true values, unless the majority of the underlying actors is sampled (Costenbader and Valente, 2003). We attribute this difference to the specific nature of urban networks formed by APS and particularly the fact that the majority of ties in these networks are formed by the largest and most connected APS firms, while a large number of small firms contribute relatively little to the network centrality of cities, as they often operate from a single location, have no subsidiaries in other cities and seldom engage in inter-organisational projects. This is confirmed by our results based on random sampling, which indicate that much higher sampling percentages—55% (office locations), 100% (ownership ties) and 90% (IOPA)—are needed in order to obtain reliable results. To summarize, researchers can obtain reliable city network centralities in studies of urban networks, provided that sufficient proportion of the most connected firms are included. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We begin with reviewing relevant literature on urban networks and contributions from social network analysis related to the network boundary specification problem. The research design section details the methodological basis of the three modelling approaches considered, outlines the methods used for comparing results across sampled and whole networks and presents our dataset. In the results section, we present the results derived across (1) office networks (Taylor 2001), (2) ownership ties (Alderson and Beckfield 2004) and (3) IOPA (Pažitka et al. 2019) and identify the sampling percentages required to obtain reliable city network centralities from each approach. In the concluding section, we reflect on the implications of the network boundary specification problem for literature on global and world cities and make suggestions for future research.",3

The potential accessibility method makes it possible to analyse entire regions, countries or cities in statistical and dynamic aspects, taking different infrastructural investments under consideration (Vickerman 1974). Since the very beginning, the potential accessibility theory has been based on spatial location of travel sources and destinations in the context of different means of transport, which relies mainly on the land use planning documents concerning areas and surrounding cities (Geurs and van Wee 2004; Hansen 1959; Harris 1954). A particular calculated value of potential accessibility indicates the potential of a given place or region, taking all relations with neighbouring areas into account. The times matrix, created while calculating potential accessibility, depends on the space resistance function which affects attractiveness of a given destination (Rosik et al. 2020). The research method used in this particular paper is the potential accessibility index, which is characterised by the fact that the longer the distance or travel time, the lower the attractiveness of the destination, e.g. population or GDP (Geurs and van Wee 2004). In most studies, potential accessibility is generally shaped by the potential of people living in a certain area. The population potential is a simple indicator depicting a situation in a particular place and time. People moves between different destinations using different means of transport in order to satisfy their everyday needs. Commuting to work (Merchant and Nemhauser 1978) and going shopping (Farber et al. 2016; Widener et al. 2015) are the two most frequently mentioned motives behind everyday travelling. Commuting to work is one of the major travel activities causing road congestion during the rush hours, while going shopping is also in the group of daily activities resulting in temporary road congestion (Goliszek et al. 2020). The two aforementioned activities (O’Kelly and Niedzielski 2009; O’Kelly et al. 2012) do not only cause the afternoon rush hours that makes people to use the public transport means. Recently, researchers are spending more and more time studying and describing operation of public and private transport during the morning (Goliszek 2017) and afternoon rush hours. Such analyses allow to formulate recommendations to avoid wasting time when travelling at different times of the day (Niedzielski and Boschmann 2014; Shearmur 2006; Shirgaokar 2014; Wang and Chen 2015; Yongling and Guonan 2009). In recent years, the researchers have focused on public transport networks and their accessibility in the context of reaching various destinations when using modal transport. The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS; Google 2018) data are most often used in such analyses (Hadas 2013; Rosik et al. 2021). They are made public by urban and regional transport operators and bodies responsible for urban transport systems management (Delling et al. 2014; Farber et al. 2014; Goliszek and Połom 2016; Karner 2018; Wessel and Widener 2016; Wessel et al. 2017; Widener et al. 2015, 2017). The GTFS data allow creating public transport models which generate accurate travel times according to time tables. This accuracy makes it possible to indicate time gaps in public transport operation schedules (Allen and Farber 2019). So far, the analyses using the GTFS data have been focused on commuting to shops and shopping centres (Farber et al. 2014; Widener et al. 2017), health centres (Neutens 2015), and cultural and educational facilities (Allen 2019) and they have indicated significant inequalities in accessibility to those services by means of public transport. While analysing the GTFS data, the researchers were pointing out some disadvantages and limitations of this data format. The analyses based on the GTFS data usually address the frequency of public transport services (El-Geneidy et al. 2015, 2016). Consequently, when the analysed time periods are relatively long, the modelling may not be accurate (Farber et al. 2016; Fransen et al. 2015; Wessel and Widener 2016; Wessel et al. 2017; Yin et al. 2020). However, the lower the frequency of transport services, the more important its precision of modelling. Currently created models of individual transport are mainly based on data derived from online portals or systems gathering data on travel times from GPS transmitters in cars or mobile phones. The GPS data are processed by companies and then made public, e.g. they can be downloaded from Google Maps® website for free. As for other companies, some of them charge fees for making the data available. Google Maps® gathers and visualises real-time traffic data but it is also possible to check averaged travel time values (Lagrell et al. 2018; Wang and Xu 2011; Wang et al. 2013; Rothfeld et al. 2019). TomTom® and Google Maps®/Transit are among the most well-known companies gathering and processing traffic data. However, if a regular user wants to download real-time data and create a model of a travel time matrix for several different destinations, it is not a simple procedure. In order to download data from Google Maps® API, a special application generating real-time map loads and saving them is required (García-Albertos et al. 2019; Xia et al. 2018). Such an application has to be written in a programming language. The author of this article has created an original model of the road transport system in the city of Szczecin using Google Maps® API data (Wang and Xu 2011) downloaded using an application written in Python 2.7. Analysing data on public and private transport is a good research field, which has been developing dynamically in recent years. Moreover, the results of analyses based on open data sources are becoming more and more accurate. Taking different times of the day into account, such analyses would show when differences in operation of public and private transport are the smallest (Bach 1980; El-Geneidy and Levinson 2007; Salonen and Toivonen 2013; Shirgaokar 2014). In the study by Salonen and Toivonen (2013), three different types of models were implemented which includes simple, intermediate and advanced. It made it possible to assess the environmental and social impact of sustainable transport. Other studies that compare different types of transport focus on commuting to work and selection of the most suitable means of transport in the context of land use and planning (Bwire and Zengo 2020). A considerable advantage of the study presented herein is the fact that the advanced model used covers both private and public transport, just like in the study by Salonen and Toivonen (2013). Moreover, not only the peak hours are taken into consideration, but other hours of the day that are not obviously connected with everyday community are considered as well.",6

Franklin,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"As a subject of research, shrinking cities have garnered attention from across the social sciences. Planners have been the largest contributors to this literature, but geographers and economists have weighed in, as well. Within geography, a recent spate of publications has helped to push the subject into further prominence (Bellman et al. 2018; Franklin and van Leeuwen 2018; Franklin et al. 2018; Richardson and Nam 2014; Reis et al. 2016; Weaver and Bagchi-Sen 2014; Weaver et al. 2016). Given the long-standing nature of urban decline in the USA, Germany, and elsewhere, it is natural that most attention should focus on the economic or fiscal causes of decline, the locations it occurs, its myriad impacts, and the most suitable responses. Population geography and demography, however, have been largely absent from this discussion. This is interesting and, especially, ironic, as shrinking cities and urban decline are fundamentally about people: not only people out-migrating, suburbanizing, dying, or aging, but also how many people are living in affected areas and what sorts of demographic characteristics they possess. Such demographic insights are valuable from a practical perspective. Effective policy responses surely require knowledge about the recipients or beneficiaries of said policies. Demographic insights are also useful from a theoretical perspective. Identifying shrinking cities and comprehending the myriad causes and impacts—whether housing vacancy, provision of services, or quality of life assessment—requires understanding and baseline knowledge about the underlying demographic processes at work. This paper explores just one aspect of the demographic element of urban decline: who and how many are affected by recent population loss in US cities. This basic question, to which we do not as yet have answers, offers important foundational knowledge about the demographic characteristics of shrinking cities.",13

Population growth has been supressed since the second half of the twentieth century and set European countries for a trajectory of depopulation. Population decline has prevailed in post-soviet Eastern European states for almost three decades and is beginning to emerge in more populous and economically advanced Western European nations. Despite regional demographic differences, European population decline is expected to commence within the next 5 years, reducing the continental population by around 25 million, or 3%, by 2050 (UN 2017). Population decline would impose major challenges on Europe, leading to declines in economic productivity and growth and increasing pressures on social welfare (Bloom et al. 2010; Coleman and Rowthorn 2011). Depopulation may potentially change the global geopolitical and economic structure, diminishing European nations. European population decline is predominantly linked to below-replacement fertility (Bosch 2000; Coleman and Rowthorn 2011). Despite rises in life expectancy and net-migration gains, European fertility rates have long been insufficient to support population growth as low fertility has remained an inseparable feature of European demography for around 40 years (UNDP 2013). The depopulating effect of sub-replacement fertility has thus far been negated by a positive demographic momentum and migration inflows (Haug et al. 2002; Coleman and Rowthorn 2011). Considering the causal relationship between low-fertility rates and depopulation, an obvious solution would be to increase fertility outcomes. However, government incentives have been received with varying levels of success, and in some extreme instances, fertility has actually decreased due to incompatibilities between fertility initiatives and modern, labour committed family systems (Neyer and Andersson 2008; Thomas et al. 2019). An alternative solution may be offered through increased migration inflows (Alho et al. 2006; Coleman 2008). Positive net-migration is a known short-term solution to modern challenges imposed by low fertility, namely labour shortages (McDonald 2006). However, recently studies have examined the long-term demographic impacts of immigration, with a specific focus on consequential increases to fertility rates (Sobotka 2004, 2008; Goldstein et al. 2009). Empirical studies have reported total fertility increases due to an increasing share of births from immigrant women in various European countries including Norway, France, Spain, Italy and the UK (Østby 2002; Tromans et al. 2009). There is therefore a genuine potential for population decline to be averted through migration gains. Immigration represents a unique opportunity to stimulate population growth and secure demographic stability in Europe, at least for the near future. Since 2011, just fewer than 1 million displaced migrants from Syria have applied for asylum in Europe (UNHCR 2017), although the number of actual arrivals into Europe is estimated to be greater (Quinn 2016). The decision regarding the accommodation of Syrian migrants has been a polarising political issue, as represented by the unequal distribution of Syrian migrants across Europe. Of all European nations, Germany has accommodated the most migrants, most recently estimated at 507,795 or 52.3% (UNHCR 2017). As a nation likely facing depopulation in the near future (UN 2017), the arrival of such a vast migrant population presents an opportunity to combat such demographic challenges in both the short term and long term, if increases to aggregate fertility are a consequence. Whilst there exists some literature concerning aggregate fertility increases through immigration, improvements from forced migration events are yet to be examined. This study aims to address this gap through examining the demographic response to recent Syrian migration in a low-fertility setting, Germany, primarily through assessing the extent of aggregate fertility contributions from migrants and subsequent population change. Particularly, we seek to quantify the potential changes in size and age structure of the German population and determine their regional variations across German states. We draw on demographic data from the German federal statistics office and Syrian asylum migrant applications from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the 2011–15 period. By applying traditional cohort component methods, we estimate fertility responses. We also examine the long-term impact of Syrian migration on the future population of Germany by applying Bayesian probabilistic projection models to produce population projections up to 2100. These long-term projections will enable an assessment of the likelihood of population trajectories under expected future fertility and mortality levels.",6

However, use of the conventional scalar summary estimates of direct and indirect effects reflecting the own- and other-region impacts on the dependent variable associated with changes in the explanatory variables set forth in LeSage and Pace (2009) will not produce valid inferences. We discuss the issues that arise and introduce new methods for interpretation of own- and other-region impacts based on estimates from this type of model. The simple case of multiplicative interaction of two explanatory variables that we explore is likely to be of wide use in applied spatial regression practice, just as it has been in ordinary regression modeling. For example, Miguelez and Moreno (2015) take this approach and estimate a spatial regression model specification that contains a spatial lag of the dependent with a multiplicative relationship between a measure of absorptive capacity and another explanatory variable in their spatial regression model. Standard software can be used to produce valid estimates for the parameters of this type of model. However, the interpretation of the partial derivative impacts from spatial regression models that include multiplicative interaction of two explanatory variables is complicated, and the standard scalar summary direct and indirect effects estimates set forth by LeSage and Pace (2009) that are reported by Miguelez and Moreno (2015) will not produce valid inferences regarding the impact of changes in the explanatory variables on the dependent variable outcomes. We show that this type of model specification produces a situation where there are observation-level effects that result from consideration of the matrix partial derivatives. By this we mean that the own-region and other-region (spillover) impacts arising from changes in the explanatory variables vary with values of the explanatory variable involved in the interaction term. This greatly complicates interpretation of the partial derivative impacts arising from changes in the explanatory variables on outcomes. As a motivation for use of multiplicative interaction of explanatory variables in spatial regression models, consider an issue that has attracted attention in regional science, that we label the absorptive capacity debate. The question posed is whether less-developed regions can benefit from knowledge spillovers originating in more technically advanced regions. The literature has argued that only regions with sufficient capacity to absorb innovations (e.g., to understand, decode, and efficiently exploit new knowledge acquired from external sources) will benefit from knowledge spillovers (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Fu 2008; Caragliu and Nijkamp 2012; Parent and LeSage 2012). This type of issue is one that could be explored by introducing multiplicative interaction of a variable vector measuring absorptive capacity of regions and another explanatory variable as in Miguelez and Moreno (2015) in the context of a spatial knowledge production relationship. There are countless other situations of interest to regional scientists where multiplicative interaction of explanatory variables might be useful in understanding relationships. We use a data-generated model relationship to focus attention on methodological aspects of the problem rather than distract the reader with an empirical application. Our illustration uses state-level taxes and capital stock of the 48 contiguous states as explanatory variables that we label X and Z to generate a dependent outcome variable in a panel data setting. In a panel data setting, there is variation over both time periods and regions in the values of the variables X and Z that play an important role in the own- and cross-partial derivatives associated with SAR or SDM spatial regression specifications that include a multiplicative interaction. To be specific by multiplicative interaction, we mean the vector product \([X \odot Z]\), where \(\odot\) is the Haddamard product, or element-by-element multiplication of the two variable vectors. We note that the issue of interpretation of direct and indirect effects in spatial regression models involving nonlinear explanatory variables can be viewed in a much more general way than the case we consider here. For example, Ay et al. (2018) discuss the issue of interpreting partial derivative impacts of spatial regression relationships involving a model that uses a nonlinear B-spline function for the explanatory variables. (See also Pace and LeSage 2002 regarding use of B-splines in spatial regression models). Lacombe and LeSage (2018) discuss the case of cross-sectional spatial probit models, where the effect estimates also vary according to the nonlinear normal probability density function transformation of the explanatory variables for regions. There are also nonparametric methods that might involve partial linear forms for the explanatory variables (Su and Jin 2010; Zhang 2013), or a nonparametric curve for these (Su 2012), or functional coefficient relationships of the type introduced by Sun (2016). The approach of Sun (2016) tackles the issue of very general nonlinear (but locally linear) relationships involving explanatory and outcomes variables in conjunction with GMM (generalized method of moments) estimation of SAR or SDM model specifications. There are a host of econometric issues that arise with these approaches that make them less likely to be used by regional science practitioners. For example the partial linear forms approach requires knowledge of the economic nature of the interactive structure, the curse of dimensionality arises when the partial linear model relationship involves more than a single explanatory variable, and there are interpretative complications that arise from varying coefficients produced by very general nonparametric methods. We focus on the simpler case of multiplicative interaction of explanatory variables, where the parameter estimates can be produced using conventional spatial regression software. This should make this approach relatively simple to use in applied practice. However, there is a need for special calculations of the observation-level effects based on nonlinear expressions for the matrix partial derivatives that arise in this type of model. By observation-level effects, we mean that the own-region and other-region (spillover) impacts arising from changes in the explanatory variables in this model vary with values of the explanatory variable involved in the interaction term.Footnote 1 In the case of (non-spatial) linear regression models, there is a history of work that considers how the \(n \times 1\) dependent variable vector (y) outcomes are impacted by a unit change in explanatory variables averaged over all (independent) observations. There is also a literature for interaction of \(n \times 1\) variable vectors, say \([X \odot Z]\), which in the case of linear regression models gives rise to a situation where the impact of X depends in a linear way on the level of the variable Z. Lee and Stat (2013) label Z as a moderator variable that impacts the way in which X impacts the dependent outcome variable vector. Dawson (2014) use labels moderation effects and interaction effects to describe alternative roles played by the interacted explanatory variables. In linear models, the estimation and interpretation of the coefficients associated with independent variables as well as their interaction terms are not complicated, since estimated interaction effects can be identified and tested directly (Andersson et al. 2014). In the case of SAR and SDM spatial regression models, the estimation and interpretation of the direct (own-region) and indirect (other-region) impacts on the dependent variable outcomes y arising from changes in the explanatory variables when two variable vectors are interacted (e.g., \(X,Z, [X \odot Z]\)) are complicated by the nonlinear relationship involved in the matrix partial derivatives for this type of model. Section 2 discusses interaction effects in the conventional linear regression model, whereas Sect. 3 takes up this issue in the context of spatial regression models. We set forth the matrix partial derivatives for SAR and SDM model specifications. In addition to calculating point estimates for the direct and indirect (spatial spillover) effects in these models, there is also a need to produce measures of dispersion for these effects estimates. We set forth a computational approach for doing this, based on an extension of the methods set forth in LeSage and Pace (2009). Section 4 illustrates our method using a data-generated example where explanatory variables representing historical panel data values for state-level taxes and capital stock of 48 US states are used as X and Z to generate a dependent outcome variable y based on SAR and SDM spatial regression specifications.",3

Murray,Rui Jiang,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Location modelling is crucial to service system planning for both public and private sectors. In the public sector, the location choices of service facilities involve not only fiscal responsibility but also social good and accessibility (White 1979). Local governments, as an example, provide a range of services, such as libraries and schools, where the intent is to maximise accessibility to people in the community. In the private sector, retail outlets are concerned with locating stores and distribution centres to best serve customers and optimise revenue. Location modelling, a component of spatial analytics, has been supported in geographic information systems (GIS). Commercial GIS packages such as ArcGIS and TransCAD explicitly formulate and solve location models using heuristic methods (Murray et al. 2019). For example, locations models within ArcGIS are solved using the Teitz and Bart heuristic (ESRI 2020) or GRASP heuristic. A major advantage of using a heuristic for solving a location problem is that it requires less time and fewer computing resources to identify a solution (Church and Murray 2009; Tong and Murray 2012). Nevertheless, for most heuristics, there is no guarantee that they will derive optimal or even good solutions. Moreover, even if a heuristic has good performance for one problem instance, the performance does not generalise when this heuristic is applied to another instance of the same type. The inclusion of location analytics within GIS software has promoted the widespread use of location models in various contexts, including solid waste facilities (Khan et al. 2018), fire stations (Adesina et al. 2017) and health care centres (Jankowski and Brown 2014). A summary of these applications can be found in Murray et al. (2019). Yet, this software has technical limitations, with location model results proving to have uncertain solution quality as well as being computationally inefficient (Murray et al. 2019). More concerning is the reproducibility of location models through commercial GIS. By definition, the reproducibility of a study “refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator” (Bollen et al. 2015). There are three major components to a reproducible study (Leeka and Peng 2015): first, the data are available. Second, the code used and the documentation is available. Third, a correct analysis has been performed. A detailed discussion of reproducibility in geographical analysis can be found in Kedron et al. (2019). Specifically, location models in commercial GIS are rarely reproducible. The code of these models is not open. Further, the heuristics used within ArcGIS and TransCAD involve many parameters that affect speed and solution quality. However, the technical details in the heuristics used are hidden from users, and there are no mechanisms for users to know or interact with the parameters. Because of the technical limitations of location models in commercial GIS, researchers have written custom software, often relying on an optimisation solver that can derive optimal solutions (Tong et al. 2009; Tong and Wei 2017). The benefits are that optimal solutions can be identified if such solutions exist, and that modification of models is possible. The custom software, however, cannot necessarily guarantee reproducibility, because the code is often not open for other users. This makes it challenging to reproduce reported approaches and results. Open-source software is a more promising option for using location models. Specifically, open-source software has obvious advantages. First, under open source, the transparency and reproducibility of a method are guaranteed, eliminating the “black box” that hides implementation details (Rey 2009, 2018; Singleton et al. 2016). Second, open-source software assures wide access to and full control of the source code for audit and modification, enabling redistribution of code. Third, it facilitates advanced user extension of software to fit their requirements as necessary. Moreover, although open source does not necessarily mean free of charge, most open source software can be used at no or a low price. Spatial analysts have been embracing open-source access to algorithms and software. Open-source examples that support spatial analysis include GRASS GIS (GRASS Development Team 2017) and QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009), but also PySAL (Rey and Anselin 2007) and GeoDa (Anselin et al. 2006). Buliung and Remmel (2008) and Rey (2009, 2018), among others, argue that open-source has the potential to revolutionise and enhance geospatial research and education and will play a critical role in facilitating discussions on methodological workflows for spatial analytics. Steiniger and Hunter (2013) propose a set of evaluation criteria in the selection of open-source GIS software, highlighting important considerations such as functionality, usability and customization options. The above discussion reinforces that it is crucial to understand function and performance of the open-source tools before deploying them. Open-source alone is insufficient to guarantee reproducibility in location modelling. Available packages differ considerably with respect to model assumptions and capabilities. Proper model specification and implementation is critical, as is solution approach. While usage and application of these methods across a range of disciplines has increased dramatically in recent years (Murray et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2020) and open-source tools for location modelling are continuing to mature, what is significant at this stage is a lack of critical review of the capabilities of these packages. This study investigates open-source tools for applying coverage models. Of particular interest are assumptions, representation and computational efforts. Assessment and comparison against the methods available in commercial GIS software too are of interest. As most reported applications of location models are done using commercial GIS, as noted by Murray et al. (2019) and Xu et al. (2020), and we anticipate that open-source options would likely become popular in applications, we should compare both options in terms of their function and performance. This paper is built upon previous work (Chen and Murray 2021) and distinguishes itself by making several noteworthy contributions to open source location modelling. First, we systematically compare relevant open source options for location modelling using two case studies. Second, we substantially extend the function of two important open source location models. Third, we discuss the conditions that guarantee optimal solutions for a location cover model and point out future directions in this field. This paper is organised as follows. The background of the research is described in the next section. This is followed by an overview of coverage models to be investigated. A detailed comparison of location cover tools is then provided. After this, planning applications are presented to highlight the differences in modelling capacities. Finally, this paper ends with recommendations for future research in open-source developments to support location cover modelling.",4

Any efforts to differentiate these two disciplines would probably have lacked meaning to practitioners of either (see Dampier 1961, p. 144). What today we recognize as early scientists were people who, like John Dee, spent much time contemplating and trying to explain the universe, by means of a curious mixture of mathematics and conjuring (Dee was imprisoned in 1555 for casting horoscopes of Queen Mary; see Forshaw 2017, p. 120). No less an icon of the Scientific Revolution than Newton was once called by John Maynard Keynes “not the first of the age of reason [but] the last of the magicians” for having straddled the emerging divide between magic and science. This divide was most keenly observed in the fruits of magical and scientific thought. Where chrysopoeia–the art of turning base metals into gold–never succeeded at its stated objective, the scientific method has in contrast helped us to understand (and change) the world, in ways that would almost certainly seem like sorcery to pre-scientific peoples (and, one might argue, willfully sub-scientific people in the twenty-first century). A key reason for the success of modern science is its methodic approach to observe, hypothesize, and predict phenomena, if not with full certainty, at least with bounded levels of uncertainty. But this is not all. One of the most famous scientific disputes of all time involves the discovery of differential and integral calculus. It is now accepted that Newton and Leibniz arrived at the principles of calculus independently; slicing space and time into infinitesimal pieces appears to have been an idea that was ripe for discovery. But while Newton appears to have worked on the fundamentals of calculus earlier (giving him notional priority), for some reason he did not publish his fluxional notation for the calculus in full until 1704, approximately 20 years after Leibniz published Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, the first paper to employ his version of calculus. Clearly, it is not enough to claim that one has harnessed infinite powers to describe the universe (q.v., Strogatz 2019): for a discovery to count in science, the process by which those powers were harnessed must be public and clear, so that others can verify the claim and replicate it with consistent success. Unlike magicians, who jealously guard their secrets lest others steal their powers, scientific discovery must withstand the constant challenge of examination and falsification.",7

We have passed the point at which more data are being collected than can be physically stored (Lyman and Varian 2003; Gantz et al. 2007; Hilbert and López 2011).Footnote 1 In addition to traditional forms of data, such as social surveys and censuses, major technological innovations have enabled an explosion in the generation, collection and use of new forms of data (Timmins et al. 2018). Networked sensors embedded in electronic devices, such as mobile phones, satellites, vehicles, smart energy meters, computers, GPS trackers and industrial machines can now sense, create and store data on locations, transactions, operations and people. Social media, web search engines and online shopping platforms have also spurred this data revolution by recording and storing users’ activity and personal information. Data are created as a by-product through interaction with these technological systems. While they are often not designed for research purposes, they can bring value for answering research questions (Timmins et al. 2018).
 The world’s technological capacity to store, communicate and share information has significantly expanded. In 2018, companies worldwide were estimated to have generated and stored an excess of 33 zettabytes,Footnote 2 seven exabytes of new data (Cisco 2018). Networked sensor technology in the financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and media and entertainment industries was estimated to account for 48 percent of global data generation globally in 2018 (Cisco 2018). In July 2019, 66 percent (over 5 billion people) of the world’s population were estimated to use mobile phones, 56 percent (over 4.3 billion) to be internet users, and 46 percent (over 3.4 billion) to comprise active social media users, whose penetration is growing at over 7 percent at year (Hootsuite and We Are Social 2019). Despite the growing volume and speed of data collection and storage, only a small share are actually used. In 2019, a global study found that most organisations analysed less than half of the data they collected (Splunk, 2019). In 2018, a similar global survey estimated that 96% of all generated data in the engineering and construction industry goes unused (Snyder et al. 2018). In 2011, a small share of scientists from a survey of 1700 leading scientists reported to regularly use and analyse large data sets (Science Staff 2011). Only 12 percent reported data sets exceeding 100 gigabytes and use data sets exceeding 1 terabyte (Science Staff 2011). The low utilisation rate of data may be reflective of barriers to access, as well as inability to process such vast quantities of information efficiently. Two key challenges involve privacy and confidentiality concerns, as well as the unstructured nature of data production and storage (Hanson et al. 2011; Manyika et al. 2015). Privacy and confidentiality concerns restrict access to data collected by companies and government agencies. The frequency, detail and geographical granularity of data being generated are unprecedented and therefore ensuring their privacy, confidentiality and integrity is critical. While legislation has been slow in responding to the changing landscape of digital data, it is now evolving in this direction. Major changes to ensure data protection and privacy were made to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into effect in 2018. Innovative institutional arrangements, such as data collaboratives (Verhulst, Young and Srinivasan 2017; Klievink et al. 2018) or services (e.g. Consumer Data Research Centre in the UK), have developed data sharing protocols and secure environments to facilitate access to commercial and administrative data for research purposes. New forms of data are often highly unstructured and messy. They are produced in multiple formats, including videos, images and text; and, are stored in various organisational structures. Data are often not random samples of populations and are collected for specific administrative, business or operational purposes, and not necessarily for research (Hand 2018; Meng 2018; Timmins et al. 2018). In their original form, new forms of data are thus not readily usable limiting their applications. Significant data engineering is required, involving the use and design of specialised methods, software and expert knowledge, and linkage to other data sources (Hand 2018). To our knowledge, no formal analytical framework has been developed to chart the critical data engineering processes to develop purposely-built data products. In this paper, we propose and develop the idea of Open Data Products (ODPs) as a framework to transform raw data into Analysis Ready Data (Giuliani et al.2017; Dwyer et al. 2018) and identify the key features that we contend of this framework. We define an ODP as the final data outcome resulting from adding value to raw, highly complex, unstructured and difficult-to-access data to address a well-defined problem, and making the generated data output openly available. Thus, three fundamental components characterise an ODP: its insightful utility, value added and open availability. We argue that an open data product has two major benefits. First, it enables developing insights from scattered, and/or highly sensitive, and/or controlled, and/or secure data which may be difficult to gather and use, or may not be accessible otherwise. Second, it expands the use of commercial and administrative data for the public good leveraging on their high temporal frequency and geographic granularity. We also contend that there is a compelling need for data open products as we experience the current data revolution. New, emerging data sources are unprecedented in temporal frequency and geographical resolution, but they are large, unstructured, fragmented and often expensive to assemble and possibly hard to access due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. By transforming raw (open or “closed”) data into valuable open data products, new dimensions of human geographical processes can be captured and analysed. Ultimately, ODPs may provide valuable guidance to develop appropriate policy interventions. The paper is structured as follows: The next section defines and develops the idea of ODPs detailing the core elements to developing ODPs. We outline a framework that covers the initial conception of an ODP and moving through to developing and disseminating a product. Following, we discuss some of the challenges involved in the process of developing ODPs. The fourth section introduces some case studies of ODP exemplars which highlight the potential offered through our framework. Finally, we conclude the paper discussing the future potential of ODPs.",21

Bivand,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While Bivand and Gebhardt (2000) did provide an introduction to R as a statistical programming language and to why one might choose to use a scripted language like R (or Python), this article is both retrospective and prospective. It is possible that those approaching the choice of tools for spatial analysis and for handling spatial data will find the following less than inviting; in that case, perusal of early chapters of Lovelace et al. (2019) will provide useful context. Two further pointers include the fact that R and most R add-on packages are open-source software and so without licence fees or other such restrictions. The second pointer is that all scripting languages provide the structures needed for reproducible research, and open-source software gives the interested researcher the means to run the scripts needed to replicate results without cost, given access to adequate hardware. Hence, an overview of the development of the use of R for handling spatial data can cast light on how and why steps fashioning today’s software were taken. Of course, an overview of the use of R for analysing spatial data would also be tempting, but, with about 900 R packages using spatial data handling classes and objects, would far exceed the bounds of a single article. The R statistical programming language and environment has been used for handling and analysing spatial data since its inception, partly building on its heritage from S and S-Plus. When the conceptualization of spatial data was introduced in the sp package (Pebesma and Bivand 2005, 2020, on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) since 2005), it was expected that some packages would adopt its classes. Some years later, adoption rates had picked up strongly, as had use of the sp-based packages rgdal (Bivand et al. 2020, on CRAN since 2003) for input/output and rgeos (Bivand and Rundel 2020, on CRAN since 2011) for geometric manipulation of vector data. Packages depending on sp classes continue to require support as more modern data representations have been introduced in the sf (Pebesma 2018, 2020a, on CRAN since 2016) and stars (Pebesma 2020c, on CRAN since 2018) packages. The sf package provides the data reading and writing, and geometry manipulation functionalities found in rgdal and rgeos, and an alternative class representation for vector data based on the Simple Features standard (Herring 2011; ISO 2004). The stars package adds facilities for handling spatial and spatio-temporal raster and vector data, building in part on work with the spacetime package (Pebesma 2012, 2020b, on CRAN since 2010) and on raster handling in the raster package (Hijmans 2020a, on CRAN since 2010). The raster package will not be discussed in this review, mostly because information in the Github “rspatial” organization (https://github.com/rspatial) repositories suggests that development is in flux and that raster is becoming a new package called terra (Hijmans 2020b). Discussion here will concentrate on packages developed and maintained by the Github “r-spatial” organization (https://github.com/r-spatial) of which I am a member. Newer visualization packages, such as tmap (Tennekes 2018, 2020, on CRAN since 2014), mapview (Appelhans et al. 2020, on CRAN since 2015) and cartography (Giraud and Lambert 2016, 2017, 2020, on CRAN since 2015), give broader scope for data exploration and communication. Modelling and analysis packages demonstrate the considerable range of implementations now available and are often supported with additional code provided as supplementary material to journal articles, for example in the Journal of Statistical Software spatial statistics special issue (Pebesma et al. 2015). The availability of software and scripts provides a helpful mechanism supporting reproducible research and hands-on reviewing in which readers can read the code and scripts used in calculating the results presented in published work (see, for example, Sawicka et al. 2018; Lovelace and Ellison 2018; Evangelista and Beskow 2018, in one issue of the R Journal). Some packages are used by others in turn forming dependency trees; because of these dependencies, we can speak of an ecosystem. Class representations of data are central, with the data frame conceptualization shaping much of the whole R ecosystem. For the modelling infrastructure to perform correctly, the relationships between objects containing data and the formula representations of models are crucial. Because both sp and sf provide similar interfaces for the data= arguments for model fitting functions by behaving as data.frame objects, transition from sp to sf representations is convenient by design. The spdep package (Bivand 2020b, on CRAN since 2002) for exploratory spatial data analysis and the new spatialreg package (Bivand and Piras 2019, on CRAN since 2019) for spatial regression (split out of spdep) have been adapted to accommodate geometries held in sf classes, so both approaches are viable. Other packages, such as mapview, tmap or stplanr (Lovelace et al. 2020) have been revised to permit use with both sp and sf objects. In order to retain backward compatibility, other central packages may choose to handle the coexistence of sp and sf classes in the same way. Developers of new packages should choose to use sf and stars rather than sp, rgdal and rgeos (and terra rather than raster), but existing packages are free to adapt, or indeed to stay with sp, rgdal and rgeos, hoping that they may continue to be maintained. Naturally, contributions to maintenance and development from those using software on which one’s work depends are among the “prices” to be “paid” for open-source software, so “hope” may involve commitment to take responsibility for maintenance. If a maintainer is unable to continue in service, software like R add-on packages is termed “orphaned”, but may be adopted. This occurred very recently with an R linear programming package lpSolve, which has been adopted by Gábor Csárdi to widespread relief and gratitude. Because there is no corporation tasked with maintaining most R add-on packages, their future use has to depend on the user community. One key reason why sf is much easier to maintain is that it was written using the Rcpp package (Eddelbuettel et al. 2011, 2020; Eddelbuettel 2013; Eddelbuettel and Balamuta 2018, on CRAN since 2008) to interface C++ code in GDAL and now PROJ (both C++11), and GEOS code through the C API, whereas rgdal and rgeos have more fragile handcrafted interfaces originally written for C99 and C++98. Maintaining Rcpp/C++11 interfaces is very much easier than older adaptations not as well understood by younger developers. However, the choice of C++ interfaces is not necessarily robust (Kalibera 2019). Since there is a viable alternative to rgdal and rgeos, a fallback in the future for sp-dependent packages will be to use sf for reading and writing data, and geometry manipulation, and to coerce to sp classes before passing to existing modelling code if sp classes are needed. Maintainers of actively developed packages using sp vector classes intensively and that are also impacted by changes in coordinate reference systems (Sect. 4) are advised to consider transitioning to sf, as substantial revisions will be needed anyway. In this review and prospect, the progress seen over the last 20 years will be described, together with the unexpected consequences it engendered. The emergence of new technologies and standards has also led to the desirability of re-implementation of data representations and analysis functionality, some of which is now in place and which will be described. Changes also impact the open-source libraries on which core spatial functionality is built, leading to challenges in ensuring backward compatibility. This will be shown using the example of coordinate reference systems. In terms of positionality, much of what follows will be presented from the point of view of the author, documented as far as possible from email exchanges and similar sources. It is more than likely that other participants in the development of the R-spatial community may recall things differently, and of course, I acknowledge that this description is bound to be partial.",20

Rey,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Although Donoho (2017) traces the origins of data science back to Tukey’s The future of data analysis (1962), it is only recently that this set of previously disparate practices for working with large data sets has begun to be formalised in a way that might allow it to be taught in a university context instead of acquired on the job through ‘learning-by-doing’. One of the most profound practical impacts of this development has been on the ways in which developers share and execute code: although systems for combining code, commentary, and results have been around for some time (e.g.  R-Markdown), these were intended primarily for replicating research outputs, with teaching and interaction as secondary considerations. The emergence of data science—and the overall pace of change in the tools and programming libraries that it employs—gave new impetus to the search for lightweight ways of sharing code and documentation, and an interactive browser-based platform called Jupyter (Kluyver et al. 2016) was the result. University educators in many disciplines are playing catch-up, but geography—thanks to its long relationship with computation (Arribas-Bel and Reades 2018)—has been acutely aware of these developments: changes in the volume and extent of spatial data available (e.g. Graham and Shelton 2013; González-Bailón 2013; Reades et al. 2016), and in the number and range of methods employed to identify patterns in those data (e.g. Fan et al. 2016; Naik et al. 2017; Santibanez et al. 2015; Stevens et al. 2015; Arribas-Bel et al. 2017), are allowing us to tackle questions thought unanswerable just a few years ago. In academia, there has been a ‘turn’ towards coding (e.g. Brunsdon and Comber 2020), but this has not been matched by changes in our teaching practice and there is evidence of a ‘hollowing out’ of once domain-specific skills (Singleton 2014; Singleton et al. 2016): most of what used to be done with specialist Geographic Information Systems (gis) software can now be done using free online resources (e.g. Google’s Fusion Tables, MapBox, Carto, ArcOnline). However, most countries have actually seen an increase in ‘geospatial jobs’ (Solís et al. 2020) indicating unmet demand for graduates who can code using the latest (geo)algorithms and techniques. In this article, we present one means of bringing the benefits of (spatial) data science approaches to instruction using Jupyter ‘notebooks’ for the teaching of the Python programming language and geospatial analysis.",5

This work is concerned with an econometric analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 in Germany during the first pandemic wave in spring 2020. The goal is twofold: First, we identify the significance of commuting-to-work patterns between NUTS-3 regions (Kreise und kreisfreie Städte) as an explicit channel for spatial disease transmission before containment measures have been introduced in mid-March 2020. While it seems natural to assume that the spread of COVID-19 has a spatial dimension, estimating the magnitude of mobility effects related to professional and social interactions is challenging as these interactions are difficult to measure (e.g., social contacts with family and friends, shopping behavior, etc.) and disentangle—even with novel digital data sources such as mobile phone or social media data available (see Schlosser et al. 2020, for an overview).Footnote 1 The identification strategy proposed in this paper makes use of detailed information on interregional commuting flows across German NUTS-3 regions measured at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to proxy structural labor market interdependencies between regions. Although pre-COVID-19 data on interregional commuting cannot directly track behavioral changes in mobility patterns associated with the pandemic development (see, e.g., Lee et al. 2020; Pepe et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2020; Schlosser et al. 2020, for this type of analysis using mobility as key outcome), we argue that the main advantage of our identification strategy is precisely to exploit this exogeneity of using pre-pandemic mobility data to size the infection effects from mobility at the regional population level. To do so, we estimate a series of spatial panel error correction models (SP-ECMs), which allow us to combine elements from a theoretically grounded long-run specification of epidemic diffusion between regions together with a flexible short-run approach that accounts for the nonlinear dynamics of new COVID-19 cases. Building on the SP-ECM specification, our second goal is to assess the effects of containment (lockdown) measures on the strength of interregional disease transmission through job commuting. In the case of Germany, several public health measures were targeted to reduce the mobility of the population in spring 2020 (e.g., Berlemann and Haustein 2020; Hartl and Weber 2020). While, for instance, almost all white-collar workers have been encouraged or ordered to work from home, education institutions, most retail stores and service activities (restaurants, bars, hairdressers, etc.) have been temporarily closed during the first lockdown between mid-March and mid-April 2020. We test for the effectiveness of such mobility constraints in slowing down the epidemic spread by measuring changes to the strength of spatial diffusion of COVID-19 across German regions with and without policy interventions in place. We argue that the analysis of the first pandemic wave and lockdown phase in Germany during spring 2020 is well suited to answer our research questions as both (a) the international arrival of COVID-19 and (b) the imposition of containment measures can be regarded as an exogenous shock to the local population so that early anticipation effects biasing our estimation results are likely to be small. This is less so the case for the second wave in autumn 2020 with lockdown measures being imposed in a much more staggered way accompanied by an inconsistent implementation of these rules (Warren et al. 2021). Foreshadowing some key findings, consistent with prior results we find strong evidence for spatial dependence in regional COVID-19 data during the first pandemic wave. The main novel finding from our study is that this spatial correlation is significantly determined by job commuting—even when we control for other types of spatial dependence. Particularly, job commuting was found to be the first factor that significantly correlated with the spatial spread of COVID-19 after its international arrival in February 2020. With regard to the size of this propagation effect, we find that a doubling of new COVID-19 cases in neighboring regions interconnected through commuting flows is associated with an up to 20% higher number of new COVID-19 cases in a region. Importantly, we also find that the estimated spatial commuting channel (different from spatial dependence of general form) breaks down once mobility restrictions during the first lockdown are in place, which points to the effectiveness of such strict measures in mitigating spatial disease transmission. Our estimated effect size is comparable to recent other studies, such as for US cities reported in Glaeser et al. (2020). From the perspective of public health policy, our results indicate that commuting linkages need to be considered and accordingly monitored as a relevant transmission channel when containment measures are planned. Though apparently effective, mobility constraints bear considerable socioeconomic costs, though, which are discussed in the end of this paper (Sect. 6). Before that, in the next section, we briefly summarize the related empirical literature on modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemic diseases, specifically COVID-19, that is used to guide our estimation approach. This is followed by a brief discussion of the empirical specification and estimator choice in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the data and variables. In this section, we also refer to institutional details of containment measures in Germany and discuss the time span when new infections can be expected to be shown in the data. Empirical results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. Additional topics are discussed in the online appendix.",15

Regions create and use knowledge to build competitive advantage (Asheim et al. 2007). Knowledge networks operate as channels for knowledge creation and transfer (Owen-Smith and Powell 2004; Boschma and ter Wal 2007), through social and business links (Granovetter 1973). These relationships can be more or less intense (Granovetter 1973). A key issue in the literature of knowledge networks is how agents choose other agents for the creation and transfer of knowledge. The literature acknowledges that this happens because of similarities in the attributes of the actors which are referred to as homophily in the sociology literature (Borgatti and Foster 2003), or proximity in the economic geography literature (Boschma 2005). The proximity literature has produced several classifications of proximity (Torre and Rallet 2005; Boschma 2005; Broekel and Boschma 2012; Caragliu and Nijkamp 2016). The common feature of these taxonomies is that they consider the similarities in the attributes of the actors, but they disregard their relative position within the network. The relative position of an actor within the network, however, seems to be important for the creation of strong ties between actors that are beneficial for the actors in order to face uncertain situations (Rost 2011; Crescenzi et al. 2016). Actors are likely to seek to create strong collaborative ties with other more central actors in the knowledge network, than with more peripheral ones. This is because the relatively more central actors are associated with a higher number of connections and, consequently, an easier reach to knowledge resources. The aim of this paper is to define a new measure of proximity, the in-network proximity, able to cover this gap in the literature. Apart from the conceptual justification and definition of this kind of proximity, the paper will also propose an empirical measurement, examining how it affects the probability of repeated collaborations (strong ties) between actors. This study places itself within the literature on core-periphery network structure (Morrison and Rabellotti 2009) and on the effect of proximity on knowledge networks that take into consideration the centrality of actors inside the network (Autant-Bernard et al. 2007; Cassi and Plunket 2015). However, compared with the existing empirical studies that use the absolute difference of centralities of actors inside the network, this paper contributes with an analytical method of assessing whether two actors can be considered central or peripheral, and simultaneously distant or proximate between them. For doing so, we use the quantiles of the absolute differences and the sums of all pairs of actors inside the knowledge network. Empirically, we assess the impact of in-network proximity, alongside other kinds of proximity on the occurrence of repeated research collaborations based on a unique set of data on collaborative projects in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the Italian region of Trentino. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a critical review of the literature on the different dimensions of proximity, pointing out the relevance of the relative distance between actors within a network. Section 3 provides a definition and a measurement for in-network proximity. Section 4 presents the data of the case study analysis, in which the role of in-network proximity on networks’ development is tested. Section 5 presents the results of the analysis, and Sect. 6 discusses the conclusions and the implications out of the findings of the study.",2

Murray,Antonio Ortiz,Seonga Cho,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Marketing and popular media often refer to baseball as America’s pastime, suggesting that it is the most popular sport in America. Whether this is true is open for debate, but clearly it is a broadly popular sport with a huge following. Baseball (and softball) shares similarities to cricket and rounders, among other games, and as a result, there has been considerable speculation about its origins. But there is no denying its popularity worldwide, either in terms of participants or spectators. Some 25 million athletes play the sport baseball or softball (Nuckols 2019), with estimates of more than 500 million fans worldwide. Countries where baseball is particularly popular include the USA, Japan, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Canada, and it was among the first organized sports to return amid the COVID-19 pandemic in places like Taiwan and South Korea. Baseball pits two teams against each other and involves a pitched ball by a player on one team (from the pitcher’s mound) that an opposing player attempts to hit with a bat standing in the batter’s box at home plate. Upon a batted ball in the field of play, the batter tries to advance to one or more bases without being tagged out. Advancing across all three bases (first, second and third) and returning to home plate records a run. The team that scores the most runs wins. There are many rules and requirements for play, but the essence of the game is that a batted ball in the area of play entitles the batter to advance bases. A batted ball that is caught by the opposing team registers an out. Otherwise, the batter may run to consecutive bases as long as they are not tagged out by an opposing player that has possession of the ball. Standing on a base without being tagged en route constitutes safe advance of the bases. Of course, there are many more rules and nuances to the game. Indeed, the rule book for Major League Baseball (2019) is more than 140 pages, plus another 30 pages for terms, definitions, specifications, etc. Of particular interest here is that the fielding team must position nine players in order to catch or field a batted ball, seeking an out (either by catching the ball before it touches the ground or by tagging a batter before they reach a base). The pitcher is required to be on the pitcher’s mound, and the catcher must be positioned behind home plate, but the remaining seven players are permitted to be anywhere in the playing area. Historical convention is that four of the seven players are distributed in the infield to help guard/cover bases and three are positioned in the outfield. Fielder location is clearly important strategically as this will enable quicker response to a batted ball. There have been circumstances where four or more outfielders have been used (Miller 2017), creating speculation and discussion about the effectiveness of traditional conventions to fielder placement. Statistics and analytics have played an increasingly important role in baseball and other sports, enabling insights and gains in predictive capabilities. Noteworthy in baseball is sabermetrics, advanced statistical and empirical analysis. Sabermetrics contributed to the success of the Oakland A’s in the late 1990s and early 2000s and were popularized in the Moneyball book by Lewis (2003) as well as the subsequent feature film starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill based on this book. Of significance is that much data are collected and tracked in professional and collegiate baseball associated with pitchers, batters, fielders, etc. Why? A competitive advantage may be gained through the detection of trends and insight that are revealed in data. Further, better financial investment decision making may be possible. It should come as no surprise then that modern technology is heavily relied upon in data collection and tracking efforts. The TrackMan radar system is particularly common at collegiate and professional ballparks, enabling instantaneous information on ball velocity as well as bearing, distance and location information. While statistical and empirical analysis of such data is widespread, the potential to exploit this information in strategic ways continues to be of great interest. This paper explores the potential of location analytics to support enhanced response and performance through the strategic positioning of outfielders. While much has been made of recording extra outs with the implementation of infield shifts (Lewis and Bailey 2015), there has been less attention to the strategic positioning of outfielders. This is a major oversight as balls hit to the outfield generally have more potential to produce runs. Thus, increasing the chance to record out or improving response time in the outfield is particularly valuable. Location analytics offer the potential to inform and enhance outfielder positioning, moving beyond the subjective and arbitrary approaches that have historically been relied upon and doing so based on objective data-driven methods. The next section reviews relevant background literature. This is followed by introduced analytical methods, in particular a multi-objective spatial optimization model. The positioning of fielders is evaluated using recorded batted ball data for a university baseball team. The paper ends with discussion and concluding comments associated with the enhanced strategic placement of fielders.",3

Goodchild,Wenwen Li,Daoqin Tong,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The surface of the Earth covers some 510 million square kilometers, so a vast amount of digital information would be required to represent it in any detail. But for many purposes it would be sufficient to work from a coarse representation. To create an outline map of the continents, for example, one could omit all detail about the oceans, topography, and human habitation, and capture only a set of lines that follow the coasts (and the land boundaries between Europe and Asia and between North and South America). An additional decision would have to be made about the appropriate level of detail in the representation of coastlines, because the convolutions of many coastlines and their offshore islands might not be relevant to a particular application. It follows from this basic argument that level of detail is a fundamental property of all geospatial data sets, yet there are many ways of defining and measuring level of detail. Many of these are associated with the term scale, but that simple English term is used in many ways, not all of which address level of detail. Specifically, scale is often used to refer to the geographic extent of a study; a study of a small area might be described as small-scale, while a large-scale study would address a large geographic area. However, this special issue is concerned solely with scale’s meaning as level of detail. The importance of scale as a topic in geography and geographic information science is reflected in the number of review books that have appeared over the years (for example, Quattrochi and Goodchild 1997; Sheppard and McMaster 2004; Zhang et al. 2014) and the entries on scale in encyclopedias and manuals, which might suggest that the topic is well understood. Recently, however, scale has taken on renewed significance in spatial analytics, for several reasons. First, as a result of the widespread engagement with social media, the use of wayfinding apps, the launch of satellites capable of capturing images of the Earth’s surface with unprecedented levels of detail, and ready access to novel data sets such as StreetView, the spatial analyst today has access to vast resources of geospatial data at levels of detail that were inconceivable as little as a decade ago. These new data are in turn allowing new questions to be asked and new types of research to be pursued. We now know far more about the spatial behavior of individuals in urban areas; far more about the detailed socioeconomic and demographic structure of neighborhoods; and far more about green spaces and urban horticulture, to cite just three applications. Second, new techniques of spatial analysis have been developed and made available to researchers that exploit scale in novel ways. Deep learning, for example, is capable of examining imagery simultaneously at multiple levels of detail, in contrast to traditional methods of analysis of remotely sensed images that work only with the image’s original pixel size. This kind of multiscale analysis can be said to emulate the capabilities of the human eye and brain and has proved successful at detecting features in images, such as roads that are obscured by trees and parked cars, that had previously proven resistant to automation. Scale is also explored through new techniques such as multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), which attempts to identify the scales of various processes operating in the geographic landscape. Finally, new developments in geospatial representation are addressing the difficulties that have traditionally impeded analysis at global scales. These discrete global grid systems (DGGS) create hierarchical structures based on one of the five Platonic solids, allowing geographic variation at any scale to be represented using spatial elements that are approximately equal in size and shape, almost entirely avoiding the complexities of map projections and the mistakes that are often made when the Earth’s curvature is ignored. In effect, DGGSs allow variation across a curved surface to be represented at constant level of detail. These developments led us to organize a two-day international workshop at Arizona State University in February 2020, bringing together a total of 38 participants to discuss Scale and Spatial Analytics. The workshop was organized under the auspices of SPARC, the Spatial Analysis Research Center, as one of its annual research workshops, with funding from Esri, the ASU School of Geographic Sciences and Urban Planning, and SPARC. Full details of the workshop, including the presentations and summaries of discussion, are available at https://sgsup.asu.edu/sparc/workshop/Scale. The workshop participants agreed that the topic was timely and that it should be followed by journal articles that explored the issues in depth. Thus two special issues of journals were planned subsequent to the workshop: one focused on environmental issues, to be published in the Journal of Landscape Ecology, and this on social issues. This special issue of the Journal of Geographical Systems includes eight papers. Contributors were first asked to submit abstracts, which were reviewed by the editors. Authors of abstracts that were deemed suitable for this special issue were then asked to provide full papers, each of which was subjected to peer review through the procedures of the journal. The next section of this introductory paper provides a review of the papers and explains the order in which they have been organized in the journal. The final section provides an overview, identifies gaps that remain in our knowledge and understanding of the topic, and points to future research opportunities.",

Goulias,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Human movement data obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking or other location-aware technologies (LATs) in the form of trajectories (i.e., time-ordered sequences of locations) are used for a variety of purposes including understanding human mobility behavior, activity patterns, and social interactions (for an early assessment of this potential see Goulias and Janelle 2005). These data can also be used to complement person daily diary surveys to verify reporting of activities and travel (Wolf et al. 2014a, b; Shen and Stopher 2014; Klous et al. 2017; Su et al. 2020, 2021), as a stand-alone tracing of the movement of people to replace expensive travel surveys (Procter et al. 2018; Marra et al. 2019), and understanding the choices and movement decisions of people requiring travel details that cannot be collected in other ways (Hood et al. 2011; Ciscal-Terry et al. 2016; Zimmermann et al. 2017). Movement observations often represent multiple behavioral modes along the movement path and complex patterns across different spatial and temporal scales. When these observations are represented by trajectories, the influence of analysis scale is unavoidable and may affect the outcomes of machine learning and knowledge discovery tasks. In this article, temporal scale is defined as the granularity of movement observations (i.e., the average time interval between two consecutive tracking points). Other terms for temporal scale include temporal resolution, temporal granularity, sampling frequency, sampling rate, and sampling interval, as used interchangeably in this article. The choice of granularity can influence the results of analysis performed on movement data (Laube and Purves 2011; Moreira et al. 2010). Many analytical approaches to understand movement patterns rely on computing first order movement properties from movement trajectories, such as daily travel distance, speed (e.g., point-to-point speed along the movement trajectory and/or average travel speed between origin and destination of an uninterrupted movement), acceleration, turning angle, and path tortuosity or sinuosity (a metric of the amount of variability in movement direction and the shape of a trajectory) (Laube et al. 2007; Dodge et al. 2008). The first order movement parameters form the fundamental components of more complex movement patterns, and hence they are often incorporated as building blocks of machine learning techniques and methods that are required to represent, quantify, contextualize, and analyze movement trajectories to better understand complex human movement patterns such as human interaction in space and time. A primary task prior to movement pattern analysis is trajectory characterization and segmentation based on the first order movement parameters and their derivatives (Dodge et al. 2009). For example, for human interaction analysis, it is essential to first recognize what transport mode people are taking to better identify and contextualize critical interactions. Speed and path tortuosity are two fundamental features that can be easily extracted from raw tracking data to assist trajectory characterization and transport mode identification tasks (Buchin et al. 2011; Schüssler and Axhausen 2008). Hence, it is crucial to understand the impact of temporal scale on computation of these primitive movement parameters prior to more sophisticated human movement analytics. If the fundamental movement parameters needed to infer higher level parameters yield the same values at different scales, one can select the scale which satisfies minimum energy consumption. That is, since movement speed is used to infer transport mode, the sampling scales that result in the same ranges of speed values can also lead to the detection of the same travel modes. In contrast, if the selection of a higher scale yields different values, it may lead to erroneous inferences about the route selected, travel mode, or the estimated time of arrival. In fact, a coarse temporal scale can yield location and/or speed estimates with high error which can compromise many of the parameters controlling the functionality of important real-world applications (e.g., mapping congestion in cities, optimal logistics distribution development) and result in disastrous occurrences and accidents. In addition to exploring the impact of temporal scale on calculating the fundamental movement parameters, previous studies also discuss the impact on more sophisticated human mobility applications such as identifying stops where major activities take place, computing movement entropy which measures the randomness of daily visited locations, and estimating radius of gyration which captures the spatial dispersion of locations where individual activities happened (Ranjan et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2018, 2019). When it comes to the application of identifying human interaction patterns, it is important to take into account the individuals’ activity spaces and accessible areas along the movement paths for potential overlaps (Hägerstrand 1970; Miller 2005; Dodge et al. 2021). It is therefore important to understand the impact of temporal scale on estimation of individual space usage and identifying the interaction between two or more moving individuals. These studies highlight the importance of analytical scale in movement analytics. However, the relationships between the observation scale of movement data and the analysis scales at which movement patterns are captured remain understudied. This article aims at investigating the role of temporal scale in human movement analytics. With this, we take up an important question of “how do decisions surrounding the scale of movement data and analyses impact our inferences about movement patterns?”. Compared to existing studies that are more focused on animal movement in the Euclidean space (Laube and Purves 2011), we investigate the impact of varying temporal scales on understanding human movement which occurs in a more confined network space (i.e., parking lots, roadways, walkways, bikeways, and public transportation stops, stations, and routes). Through a set of computational experiments in the context of human movement, we take a systematic look at the impact of varying temporal scales on common computational movement analytics techniques including calculating first order movement parameters (e.g., speed, path tortuosity), estimation of individual space usage, and interactions analysis among mobile individuals. The outcomes of this study are important in our decisions about temporal scale in movement data collection, mobility analytics, as well as simulation of movement for real-world applications.",2

Domain examples include crimes (Wang et al. 2017; Malleson and Andresen 2015a; Koo et al. 2020) and disease events (Hohl et al. 2016; Delmelle et al. 2014), which typically cluster near city centers or exhibit seasonal cyclic patterns. Knowledge about the intensity, scale, location, and time of such clusters is important. In the case of disease outbreaks, this information is critical to inform authorities on their decision to allocate resources, such as staff for disease prevention efforts (Casas et al. 2010). Spatial and spatiotemporal statistics are a set of popular analytical methods for identifying and quantifying inherent patterns in the data, as they capture geospatial phenomena and their variability in space and time (Bailey and Gatrell 1995; Cressie and Wikle 2015) and across multiple scales (Fotheringham et al. 2017). Among the palette of exploratory statistics used to characterize a given spatiotemporal point pattern, space–time kernel density estimation (STKDE; Nakaya and Yano 2010) stands out. It allows for visualizing the occurrence of events in space and time by computing the localized intensity of the point process at hand and hence, summarizing the distribution of a spatial variable through time. STKDE has been employed as a key analytical procedure for identifying clusters of crime (Nakaya and Yano 2010), exploring human mobility patterns (Gao 2015), as well as discovering outbreaks of dengue fever (Delmelle et al. 2014). Disease risk can be understood as the ratio between the number of disease cases and the population-at-risk within a given area (Desjardins et al. 2020). Therefore, it is imperative to consider density estimates of disease cases in relation to the local population-at-risk (a.k.a. ‘the background’). Otherwise, the estimates are a proxy of the population distribution and we might observe a cluster of high density merely due to a large local population. While conventional STKDE does not consider the background at all, several approaches incorporate spatially varying backgrounds (Shi 2010; Davies and Hazelton 2010; Davies et al. 2016; Tiwari and Rushton 2005). Hence, adjusting for spatial variation of the background is a common practice to date. However, adjusting for spatial and temporal variation of the background is a novelty, to the best of our knowledge. By omitting time in their models, existing methods ignore temporal dynamics (temporal variation) of the background, and are therefore unable to capture rapid population change. However, we currently find ourselves in the age of migration (Castles et al. 2013), where individuals move from their residential location for many reasons: forced migration due to climate change (Martin 2001), conflicts (Mitchell 2011), or to find labor (Münz 2007). For instance, cities experience waves of urbanization (Meentemeyer et al. 2013), suburbanization (Lang and Simmons 2003), re-urbanization and counter-urbanization (Champion 2001). Hence, it is no longer acceptable to ignore temporal population dynamics, which is especially relevant for longitudinal studies. In addition, population data are becoming available at finer spatial and temporal resolutions, and given current technological advances, it is foreseeable that this development will continue (Bhaduri et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2020; Kang et al. 2020). This calls for an extension of the current kernel methods for computing disease risk to address background populations that change over space and time. Adaptive kernels allow for variation in bandwidth (a.k.a search radius) across the study area, while fixed-bandwidth kernels do not. Therefore, fixed-bandwidth kernels may not properly capture human dynamics at varying geographic scales (Yuan 2018). They tend to oversmooth, leading to a loss of spatial detail (Goodchild 2001) and conceal regions of interest (Shi 2010), especially when analyzing large-scale human geographic phenomena, where events like disease cases emerge out of the background. While fixed-bandwidth kernels establish constant areal support, a kernel that adapts its bandwidth to the background is useful to establish constant population support (Carlos et al. 2010). This allows for comparison of disease rates across regions, which is especially suited for analyzing chronic diseases, such as lung cancer (Shi 2010). On the other hand, a kernel that adapts to surrounding cases sacrifices the constant population support property and establishes constant case support. This is suited for analyzing communicable disease, as distance between cases is a reasonable approximation of interaction between infected individuals, a common cause of disease spread (Bhopal 2016). Hence, adaptive kernels allow for measuring the scale over which a point process operates (Fotheringham et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2017). It is important to recognize that there are many ways to obtain a representation of the background (Fig. 1), i.e. from population data at high spatial and temporal resolution. Apart from census data (Fig. 1a), scientists have used social media posts such as tweets (Fig. 1b) as a proxy for population (Malleson and Andresen 2015b). Alternatively, trajectories of individuals (Fig. 1c) may be created through retrospective activity diaries (Chen et al. 2011; Kwan 2000, 2004), or migration history datasets (Shaw et al. 2008). Lastly, residential location may be used to establish the population at risk (Fig. 1d). In addition to the spatial coordinates x and y, the temporal coordinates t1 and t2 may be known, which represent start and end date of residence. In summary, the representations of population in Fig. 1 are profoundly different from each other. Besides availability, the following principle should guide the choice of population data: The scale of the population data should match the scale of the case data. For instance, if we use patient residential locations, we may want to use control data, as activity diaries population information would be too detailed. As the background can be represented in different ways, adaptations to the kernel density method for computing risk estimates are necessary to accommodate such diversity. Different representations of the background: a centroids (e.g. census tracts), b social media posts (e.g. tweets), c trajectories of individuals, d residential locations In this study, we address spatially and temporally varying backgrounds in kernel density estimation, a key omission of many existing applications. We introduce ST-DB, a space–time kernel density estimator that considers a spatially and temporally dynamic background. We compare ST-DB with its purely spatial counterpart and address the question of whether adding time to our analysis yields different estimates of disease risk. While our study focuses on introducing ST-DB and its application to spatiotemporal analysis of infectious disease, it can be applied to any geographic phenomenon that involves point events that emerge out of a background. This article is organized as follows: We explain our methodology, as well as our dataset in Sects. 2–4, illustrate our results in Sect. 5, and finally present discussion and conclusions in Sects. 6 and 7.",3

Carruthers,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Since 1971, the United Nations (UN) has actively monitored a number of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), or countries having structural frailties that make them especially susceptible to economic downturns, natural disasters, human conflicts, contagious diseases, and other existential threats.Footnote 1 As a set, LDCs represent the poorest of the world’s poor, with more than 75% of their people living in poverty and bearing all the deprivation and other cruelties that poverty inflicts. While countries worldwide face challenges, a combination of three factors formally defines LDCs: (i) per capita gross national income (GNI), composed of the gross national product adjusted for the value of investment needed to maintain a constant level of production, measuring prosperity; (ii) a human assessment index (HAI), composed of health and education indicators measuring human capital; and (iii) an economic vulnerability index (EVI), composed of exposure and shock indicators, measuring economic risk. The current list of LDCs has 46 countries—with a combined population of about 12% of the world’s 7.8 billion—33 of which are located in Sub-Saharan Africa. This concentration of poverty is so entrenched that it is understood as common knowledge. Less understood, is the geography of the toll that Sub-Saharan poverty takes on the people caught up in it—and, even less, how this geography has shifted relative to the massive changes in settlement that have reshaped Africa over the past few decades. (Examples of recent progress on this front include Jean et al. 2016, Xie et al. 2016, and Osgood-Zimmerman et al. 2018). As shown in Table 1, which lists data from the last 20 years summarizing the world at large, the 46 LDCs, and the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of urbanization across these groups registered annual averages of 2.15%, 4.08%, and 4.12%, respectively. A closer look is provided in Table 2, which ranks the top 20 countries in the world by their urbanization rates in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019. At the beginning of the timeframe, countries located in Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 11 of the top 20—by the end, they accounted for 17 of the top 20. In all cases shown on the table, the annual rate of urbanization exceeds 4.00%, a pace that yields a doubling in under two decades. Though Africa is the least urbanized of the settled continents, it is experiencing the greatest urban growth of all—mostly in its Sub-Saharan countries, where 15.75% of the region’s 1.1 billion people now live in agglomerations of a million or more (World Bank and World Development Indicators 2020). The rapid transformation of Africa raises a fundamental question, which this paper begins to investigate: has urbanization there been accompanied by improvements in personal wellbeing? While economists, geographers, regional scientists, and others have good reason to think that that urbanization, a process having both spatial and temporal dimensions, makes people in the developing world better off, evidence remains sparse (Glaeser 2013; Young 2012; Glaeser and Ghani 2015; Bryan et al. 2020; OECD 2020). This paper addresses the gap by examining the relationship between urbanization and a key dimension of wellbeing across Sub-Saharan Africa: child growth failure, including (i) stunting; (ii) wasting; and (iii) underweight (Osgood-Zimmerman et al. 2018). Child growth failure is a fundamental indicator of wellbeing because, globally, about 45% of deaths among children under the age of five are associated with malnutrition and most of this death occurs in the LDCs of Africa and Asia (WHO 2021). Like all projects focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, this one faces a tall barrier: namely, that quality data on urbanization and people there is extremely limited, a problem compounded by the fact that what data does exist comes from a variety of sources and was never meant to work together. A main contribution, therefore, is to reconcile an array of data—collected for different purposes, across different spatial scales, and over different timeframes—in a manner that enables some insight into the question set out above. Specifically, the paper combines remotely sensed data on urbanization, collected at continuous time intervals, with microdata on the health of people, collected at discrete time intervals, in a way that enables exploration of the relationship between the two. This reconciliation yields a rich database, covering all of Sub-Saharan Africa, that is used to estimate a series of econometric models, including spatial autoregressive specifications, that systematically connect the large-scale process of urbanization to the small-scale experience of child health outcomes. By estimating models at multiple spatial scales, the analysis is able to evaluate both the compatibility of the data involved and the stability of the relationships it uncovers. Overall, the results suggest that the wave of urbanization breaking across Sub-Saharan Africa is likely to the benefit of its people—but clearly indicate the need for further geographical research.",

Gede Nyoman Mindra Jaya,Henk Folmer,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Dengue disease is a major challenge to healthcare worldwide, potentially leading to death, especially among the poor in low- and middle-income countries (Ak et al. 2018). In addition, there are latent costs related to stress, productivity loss, school absence, and care taking (Wilastonegoro et al. 2020). To reduce health impacts and treatment costs, there have been substantial efforts aimed at the prevention of dengue disease outbreaks (Kampen et al. 2014). For these purposes, statistical models aimed at identifying the causes, transmission mechanisms, and prediction of outbreaks at a fine spatiotemporal scale are of crucial importance (Messina et al. 2019). High-resolution information is needed for research on the etiology of the disease and the development of control and prevention strategies (Ak et al. 2018; Jaya et al. 2017; Jaya and Folmer 2020, 2021a, b; Pokharel and Deardon 2016). Dengue disease typically involves a spatiotemporal pattern (Jaya and Folmer 2020, 2021a, b; Phanitchat et al. 2019; Puggioni et al. 2020); therefore, high-resolution spatiotemporal models and maps of the distribution of relative risk are basic elements of an early warning system aimed at identifying where and when an outbreak will occur (Hanigan et al. 2019; Shi et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2019). In many areas of spatial research including epidemiology, data are often only available at different levels of aggregation (Moraga et al. 2017; Shi et al. 2013; Utazi et al. 2019). If low-resolution information is available whereas high-resolution (cell level) information is needed but lacking, area-to-cell disaggregation through joint area-cell estimation can be applied to obtain the missing information (Moraga et al. 2017; Utazi et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2018a).Footnote 1 Data fusion or data assimilation (Banerjee et al. 2015) and Bayesian melding (Fuentes and Raftery 2005; Liu et al. 2011) are terms used to denote integrating multiple data sources of different spatial resolutions.Footnote 2 The basic concept involves combining area and cell observations in a single statistical model. Combining data measured at different levels of aggregation can improve parameter estimation and increase prediction accuracy (Wang et al. 2018b). However, it may lead to spatial misalignment (Moraga et al. 2017; Sahu et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2014; Utazi et al. 2019), which induces biased or inconsistent estimators (Liu and Bertazzon 2016; Peng and Bell 2010; Saez and López-Casasnovas 2019). Several kinds of correction approaches based on regression models have been developed to deal with area-to-cell misalignment problems (Banerjee and Gelfand 2002; Banerjee et al. 2015). Moraga et al. (2017) and Utazi et al. (2019) applied Bayesian geostatistical analysis to deal with misalignment in spatial non-Gaussian data with linear covariates. However, methods that address area-to-cell misalignment in spatiotemporal non-Gaussian data with nonlinear covariates are less well known. This applies especially to Poisson or Negative Binomial (NB) spatiotemporal data, which are typically applied in dengue and other disease incidence modeling, but also in other kinds of spatial and regional research. In this paper, we introduce the Fusion Area-Cell Spatiotemporal Generalized Geoadditive (GG)-Gaussian Field (GF) model, abbreviated as FGG-GF model, to generate high-resolution (cell) predictions based on observations at lower (area) resolution of the variable of interest (i.e., the number of dengue incidences) and the population at risk, and high-resolution cell data (i.e., weather variables), while controlling for misalignment. Moraga et al. (2017) and Utazi et al. (2019) have shown that the prediction performance of integrated area-cell models can outperform models that use single level data sources. Kammann and Wand (2003) introduced the Generalized Geoadditive Model (GGM), which has become popular in disease mapping (among other fields) because of its suitability for making high-resolution maps (Muleia et al. 2020; Wand et al. 2011). The model assumes that there is a spatially continuous variable underlying all observations which can be modeled using a Gaussian process, usually denoted Gaussian Field (GF). A GF is characterized by a first-order autoregressive model with spatially correlated innovations. The GGM combines the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and the Geostatistical Model (GM). The former was introduced by Hastie and Tibshirani (1986) to provide a flexible means of handling nonlinear and interacting covariates. GAMs are also suitable for handling complex spatial and temporal autocorrelation (French and Wand 2004; Ma et al. 2014). GAMs are nonparametric because they do not require a priori specification of the regression function (Wang et al. 2018a). The GM was introduced by Matheron (1963) to construct high-resolution maps over a particular geographical region based on cell data on (risk) factors associated with a (dependent) variable of interest. The integrated area-cell observations and the combination of non-Gaussian data, a nonlinear predictor and latent model components, in particular the spatiotemporal GF, make estimation of FGG-GF model, prediction, and mapping computationally complex and time-consuming (Barber et al. 2016) because of the “big n” problem. This issue can be handled by transforming a GF with a dense covariance matrix to a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) with a sparse precision matrixFootnote 3 of Matérn covariances (Lindgren et al. 2011). The objective of this paper is to develop a high-resolution prediction and mapping procedure for spatiotemporal Poisson or Negative Binomial data applying a Fusion Area-Cell Spatiotemporal Generalized Geoadditive-Gaussian Markov Random Field (abbreviated as FGG-GMRF) model. Inference and prediction are handled in a Bayesian framework. The approach will subsequently be applied to dengue disease risk in Bandung city, Indonesia. The purpose is to predict and map the relative dengue risk at subdistrict level, given observations on dengue incidence and population at risk at district level and weather risk factors at cell level.Footnote 4 Special attention is paid to high-risk districts and subdistricts requiring public intervention (Aguayo et al. 2020). The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the spatiotemporal GG-GF model. Section 3 presents the FGG-GF and FGG-GMRF models and the Bayesian inference framework. The link between the GF and GMRF models is summarized in Appendix 1. Section 4 applies the methodology to dengue incidence in Bandung city, Indonesia, and Sect. 5 summarizes and concludes the conducted research.",6
24.0,4.0,Journal of Geographical Systems,26 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-021-00366-2,A spatio-temporal autoregressive model for monitoring and predicting COVID infection rates,October 2022,Peter Congdon,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Forecasts of future infectious disease incidence have had major policy importance, for example in the COVID-19 epidemic of 2020-2021. However, even short-term forecasts may face difficulties in practice. These include limited data, quantifying forecast uncertainty, and specification issues (Petropoulos and Makridakis 2020; Roda et al. 2020; Stehlík et al. 2020). Where separate infection time series for a number of areas are available, this may assist forecasts through a borrowing strength mechanism (Haining et al. 2021), with Shand et al. (2018) noting the gain from taking “advantage of the spatial and temporal dependence structures so that the statistical inference at one location can borrow strength from neighbouring regions in both space and time”. However, modelling and predicting area trajectories in infectious disease poses particular problems when counts are changing rapidly in epidemic situations, and there may well be geographic infection hotspots. Notions of borrowing strength through spatial random effects are a major feature of the Bayesian disease mapping approach for area disease counts (Kang et al. 2016), and adaptations of disease mapping to modelling longitudinal infectious disease data have been discussed in a number of papers (e.g. Clements et al. 2006; Coly et al. 2021). Consider, in particular, applications to epidemic time series for sets of administrative areas, which are available in several countries for the COVID-19 epidemic. A widely adopted strategy for such data, aiming at short term prediction, involves low order autoregression in infectious disease counts or rates, in both an area itself (the focus area), and in areas surrounding the focus area (Shand et al. 2018; Paul and Held 2011). Existing approaches have focussed on spatial variation in autoregressive dependence, so allowing for geographic heterogeneity (Dowdy et al. 2012). The contribution and novelty of this paper is to show how different specifications of autoregressive dependence in incidence counts may considerably impact on adaptivity in epidemic situations. In particular, we introduce temporal as well as spatial variation in autoregressive dependence and show that this feature provides much improved predictive performance in situations where infection counts are rapidly changing. Such rapid fluctuations in cases, associated with multiple epidemic waves, have been a feature of the COVID-19 epidemic. Sharp upward trends in cases have initially tended to be geographically concentrated, with subsequent diffusion away from initial hotspots (Dowdy et al. 2012). Effective policy responses in such situations depend on forecasting approaches that provide a perspective on short-term future implications of current trends (Shinde et al. 2020). In particular, geographically disaggregated forecasts are important for prioritizing interventions or severity designations, such as the “local tiers” in the UK COVID-19 policy response (Hunter et al. 2021). The approach used here can potentially be generalized to model longitudinal count data in non-disease applications involving areas, or for longitudinal count data for units other than areas. An example of the former might be applications involving spatial forecasting and spatial diffusion of count data (e.g. Glaser 2017; Glaser et al. 2021). Examples of such diffusion include behavioural copycat effects (Schweikert et al. 2021). In this paper, we assess predictive performance of an autoregressive model for infectious disease counts, applied to COVID-19 data for 144 English local authorities during the UK epidemic second wave—at the end of 2020 and into early 2021. These local authorities are in the South East of England, where a sharp (and geographically concentrated) upturn in cases in late 2020 was attributed to the emergence of a new COVID variant, the “Kent variant” or alpha variant (World Health Organization 2021). The model proposed here allows for both spatial and time variation in autoregression coefficients. We show clear gains in prediction over a less general specification. Impacts of alternative model features are considered, namely the choice between a linear (identity link) or log-linear model form, and the assumed form of weighting infections in neighbouring areas. We use Bayesian inference and estimation, via the BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) package (Lunn et al. 2009).",

It was firstly proposed in criminology as Rossmo´s Criminal Geographic targeting algorithm -CGT- (Verity et al. 2014; Gorski 2021) as a method to deal with serial killers (Butkovic et al. 2019) and later for the spreading of populations of invasive species, for targeting writers (Hauge et al. 2016) and also in epidemiology (Papini et al. 2013, 2017a; Santosuosso and Papini 2016). The model requires that there is only one spreading centre and that this centre is surrounded by a buffer zone (Rossmo 2000), that is an area around the spreading centre itself where the probability of finding an event is extremely low. In criminology, but still more in biological invasions, the existence and the extension of the buffer zone should be checked case by case. B (the parameter used to represent the buffer zone around the offender’s home (see Fig. 1S in supplementary material), is a number that is between zero and the maximal distance of an event from the spreading point, otherwise the analysis would not produce any result. Moreover, in the model the probability of finding an event tends to decline proportionally to the increase in distance of the event from the offender’s home. Red zone reconstruction based on a single event and a given parameter B. The red circle (annulus, more exactly) is that where the probability of finding the spreading centre is 95%. The yellow zone is that with 90% of probability, and it would comprise also the red zone; while the green annulus is that with 85% of probability and contains also the yellow and the red zone. Part of the circle of the maximum probability (in red) of centre localization falls outside the map A GP uses coordinates of points (corresponding to the events of interest) to calculate a probability surface called a geoprofile (Rossmo 2000). The geoprofiles provide areas of different priority on the map with a varied probability density (Rossmo 1993, 2000). The geoprofile consists in an approximated localization of an area (often represented as a red area) containing the spreading centre, where the probability of finding it is higher than a given threshold (typically 95%). After its first use in criminology, GP was applied to biological problems such as the targeting of an infectious disease (Papini and Santosuosso 2016), the prediction of nest locations of bumble bees (Suzuki-Ohno et al. 2010), animal foraging (Le Comber et al. 2006; Raine et al. 2009) and shark hunting patterns (Martin et al. 2009). The obtained results can be compared to those of other analytical methods of mapping the higher or lower probability of crimes occurrence in a given area, as in Quick (2019). More recently, GP was used to guess the source of an invasion by alien organisms using the positions of their current populations (Stevenson et al. 2012; Cini et al. 2014; Papini et al. 2017a). In this case, in the place of the offender’s home in criminology, the spreading centre will be the first place of introduction of an alien organism with invasive capability (Papini et al. 2013). Such data are increasing with respect to the past, also due to the diffuse monitoring activity on the territory, as with the Citizen science initiatives (Baker et al. 2019). This analysis is useful, since the knowledge of the source of events can suggest hints about the offender’s home or give ideas about the control methods of the invasion of alien plants and animals (Cini et al. 2014). Recently, further refinements of the method were proposed to a) improve the reliability of GP from the point of view of possible presence of multiple waves of invasion, rather than from a single starting point (Cini et al. 2014), b) to increase the robustness of the results with a jackknife procedure (Papini et al. 2017b), c) to give different weights to data on a quantitative basis (for instance on the basis of the population dimension in a given point in the case of an invasion) or several methods of data partitioning (Santosuosso and Papini 2018; Cini et al. 2019). GP may even be associated with other methods that could record the presence of events to be considered outliers of the distribution, as with the Isolation Forest method as defined by Liu et al. (2012). This method was implemented by Santosuosso et al. (2020) on biological invasions. In order to overcome some of the pitfalls of GP analysis, some authors proposed alternative approaches, such as Dirichlet process mixture -DPM- (Verity et al. 2014), the Topological Weighted Centroid -TWC- (Buscema et al. 2018a,b) or the O'Leary's simple Bayesian model (2009, 2010, 2012), even if GP remained the method of choice for many analyses aiming to find a centre of a series of events. Stevenson et al. (2012) showed also that GP gave better results compared to other techniques in 52 of the 53 data sets explored for invasive species spreading analysis in Great Britain. One of the main concern with GP is that some parameters must be provided by the users, such as the buffer zone dimension (the above mentioned B parameter). This parameter represents an area around the spreading point where the probability of finding an event is low, is easy to be understood in criminology, but less in the case of a biological invasion. Nevertheless, evidence of buffer zone in many cases of spreading of invasive species have been recorded and calculated for many organisms, both animal, plants and algae (Stevenson 2012). In these cases the B value must be evaluated case by case on the basis of the biology of the involved organism. It is important to understand how the approximation in providing this parameter (that must be chosen ad hoc, depending on the type of investigated events) can influence the precision of the results. Moreover, it must be kept in mind that the use of the method always produces a result, independently of the correctness of the field data (observations/events) and the precision of the parameters used for the analysis. This investigation is not intended as a validation of GP, that has already been object of several contributions, but it aims, rather, to answer an important question: is it possible to calculate how the choice of the B parameter influences the result? Or in other words: is it possible to evaluate if the inevitable inaccuracy of the B parameter can anyway produce feasible results? And after how many observations/events? In this article we faced the problem by simulating the data sets with a variable error to be added to the B parameter (known a priori, since it was chosen during the simulation itself) and calculating how the growing inaccuracy of the B parameters affected the results, together with an increase in the number of observations. The idea is to find an evaluation about the lowest possible number of observations/events that can still provide a reliable geoprofile, together with the highest allowed variation (inaccuracy) of the B parameter. The question is relevant, since the number of available events is sometimes relatively low, independently of the researcher’s will, and the evaluation of the B parameters not completely understood, depending on the biological properties of the organism from the point of view of propagation. The research question is hence: how “wrong” (inaccurate) can be the parameters chosen for the analysis, in order to obtain still a reliable result?

Rather than co-location, it is connectivity between people that promotes interactions and learning in urban spaces, between urban spaces, but also between urban and more remote locations (Farole et al. 2011; Grillitsch and Nilsson 2015; Martin et al. 2018). However, connectivity is not disconnected from co-location. A majority of our social interactions occur locally in spatially embedded networks (Bettencourt et al. 2010), where research accentuates the effects of ‘local buzz’ for firms performance (Bathelt et al. 2004) and the scaling effects of local density for learning and development of human capital (de la Roca and Puga 2017). Connectivity is therefore central to the geography of the economy (Glaeser and Maré 2015) and relates both to organizations and individuals. However, the data and methodologies used to capture connectivity have been limited due to the difficulty in gathering and analysing detailed observations in time and space about how people interact and move across space, e.g. relying on time geography diaries that are unfeasible on large scales (Farber et al. 2013; Scholten et al. 2012). Mobile phone data potentially offer a rich and unprecedented source of data, which is exhaustive in time and space and closely follows movements and partly communication activities of individuals (Ahas et al. 2007a, b; Kwan 2007; Steenbruggen et al. 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, research using mobile phone data to measure connectivity in the field of economic geography has been limited, while it has been a more prominent feature in contemporary research among related fields. This paper, therefore, provides a methodological overview of how mobile phone data has been used in studies related to economic geography, elaborates on key findings for economic geography, identifies the methodological challenges, and outlines opportunities for future research on the geography of connectivity using mobile phone data. Since the late twentieth century and the introduction of the computer chip, the world has increasingly become digital. In most of everyday life, individuals interact with devices that leave digital footprints, but most importantly allow for communication across space, which is unprecedented in human history. Social networks are no longer mainly defined within spatial scales, where interactions between individuals would occur on the streets and corners (Jacobs 1969). Communication technology cuts across scales and allows for networks and structures to transcend distance with greater impact than before. This increase in the opportunities for communications across scale have altered the geography of societies, allowing self-organizations that no longer function solely through physical connectivity but through increasingly ‘aspatial’ connectivity. Mobile phones connected to cellular networks have been essential in this development. From the start, mobile phones through their connection to the GSM network have provided individuals with the ability to stay connected to their social networks regardless of their geographical proximity, allowing both the maintaining and development of social networks across scale. Since the turn of the millennia the use of mobile phones for communication has grown exponentially, which has resulted in a society wide diffusion of the smartphone that allowed for far more applications than mainly communication (Steenbruggen et al. 2015). The development of applications such as WhatsApp, Google maps, Instagram, with increasingly location-based services, from providers such as Twitter, Facebook, Google has increased the utility of the mobile phone and consequently the everyday use. Subsequently, the amount of data generated, as well as the variety of methods that can be employed to collect data, have increased. Not surprisingly, the increasing data generated from people’s everyday usage of the phone, whether being passive (GPS tracking, WiFi probing, ID tracing) or active (geolocating, calls or texts), have seen increasing interest from researchers. Topics have ranged from mobility analysis (see e.g. Cottineau and Vanhoof 2019; Pappalardo and Simini 2018; Vanhoof et al. 2018), mobile social network analysis (e.g. Gaito et al. 2017; Mamei et al. 2018), tourism (e.g. Ahas et al. 2007a, b; Raun et al. 2016), social influence (e.g. Peng et al. 2017a, b; Singh and Ghosh 2017), literacy (e.g. Blumenstock et al. 2015; Schmid et al. 2017), development, or segregation and poverty (e.g., Hedman et al. 2021; Hernandez et al. 2017; Östh et al. 2018). Furthermore, some studies have developed methods for analysing mobile phone data together with socio-economic factors, using aggregated data. The studies are evidently growing in number and variety, and whilst there are some reviews, they either focus on specific data sources, such as GPS data (e.g. Wu et al. 2016), or it has focus on specific outcomes, such as social networking big data (Peng et al. 2017a, b). Others are dated and are mainly encompassing the early stages (Raento et al. 2009; Ratti et al. 2006). Existing reviews examine the potential of big data for social sciences in general (Lazer and Radford 2017) and its benefits to urban managements and policies (Steenbruggen et al. 2015). However, a state-of-the-art review and discussion about the potential contribution of mobile phone data to study the geography of connectivity specifically is missing. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion of methodologies, limitations, and opportunities of mobile phone data for economic geography. The focus lies on examining how big data in the form of mobile phone data could improve the empirical foundations for the analysis of connectivity within the field of economic geography. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review applying the methodology developed by Tranfield et al. (2003). In total, we screened 427 articles obtained from Ebscohost and 189 articles from Web of Science. The detailed review included 140 articles, which we evaluated and summarized on four dimensions: (a) research questions and the literature the article contributes to, (b) methods of combining spatial mobile phone data with data relevant tor economic geography, (c) key findings, and (d) limitations. Section 2 describes how the literature review was conducted. Section 3 discusses methodological approaches for analysing mobile phone data and linking it to other data sources, as well as limitations. Section 4 synthesizes the main findings about human mobility, social networks, and aggregate patterns of human mobility and social networks. Section 5 elaborates on the prospects of using mobile phone data to capture connectivity and learn about its causes and effects in the field of economic geography.",1

Goodchild (2011) raised key concerns about existing Geographic Information systems (GISs) driven by technologies that favor the implementation of a strict notion of space. Space is mostly defined in terms of Euclidean geometry and the Cartesian coordinate systems, and it is contrasted with place in the literature because the latter is conceptualized as constructed by humans. Based on both philosophical and humanist notions, there are many representations of how platial information be integrated in existing GISs, that are presently based on ‘space’. In this work, we aim to present a formalism for platial representations that is time dependent and does not consider ‘space’ and ‘place’ to be necessarily separated. Moreover, in the consideration of time and movement, we introduce the idea of ‘platial mobility’ that draws upon the mobilities paradigm (see, e.g., Hannam et al. 2006 and Urry 2016) and is a generalization of various notions of place in the literature that are ‘static’ in their definition. In other words, by introducing such mobilities via sociological considerations in platial representations, we are also generalizing the usual space-dependent notion of mobility toward including further consideration of place and time in GISs. The paper is organized as follows. We begin with the introduction to the distinctions within the notion of spaces and places. In the following section, we introduce the notion of ‘moving places’ and its platial representations, working with observables which have the possibilities of having both space and places connected in relationships. Since places and their movements are humanly and socially constructed, we then introduce the key ideas of the mobilities paradigm in sociology, and how these can help generalize the notions of mobility within GIScience which are Euclidean space and time-dependent. The resulting concept, “platial mobility”, is then outlined. In these sections, we provide a thorough literature review of place-based GIS and mobility along with how these notions are used in other disciplines. With the platial mobility formalism defined, we next discuss the means through which various platio-temporal representations and platial mobility can be formally identified and studied is explored in various cases. This includes the use cases of the Lake AttabadFootnote 1 disaster which occurred in 2012 and led to the movement and displacements of a vast section of the population, the relocation in the Eferding Basin, caused by severe flooding events in 2002 and 2013,Footnote 2 and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We then discuss how our ideas of “platial mobilities” can be useful in better representing such complex phenomena through a fundamental and joint consideration of both spaces and places, as well as accounting for the sociological aspects in such large-scale movements and disasters. Overall, we consider the various implications of our work and how it can contribute to existing developments of platial representations in GIScience. Our approach is based on pragmatic and practical considerations of how to formalize and generalize platial representations using both mathematical/geometric and sociological considerations. We contend that the platial mobility framework is a paradigm shift for GIScience with new ways to collect and integrate spatio-temporal data with qualitative data to provide a holistic means for both developing better understandings and usefulness for end users and public. This framework has potential for improving existing approaches and its relevance could be significant especially in an era of increasing global-scale crises such as climate change impacts and pandemics.",

(2008), Elhorst (2014), Pesaran (2015) and Baltagi (2021) among others. Static spatial panel data methods are long-established, but more recently dynamic spatial panel data models have come to the fore as highly informative and relevant (see for example Parent and LeSage 2012; Yu and Lee 2008; Elhorst 2014). The predominant approach in the spatial panel model literature has been an assumption that the regressors are exogenous, apart from spatial and/or temporal lag terms relating to the endogenous variableFootnote 1 and typically estimation has focused on maximum likelihood and related methods. This presents a challenge in the presence of endogenous regressors. The focus in this paper is on dynamic spatial panel models in which endogeneity extends beyond spatial and temporal lags of the dependent variable. Baltagi et al. (2019) give extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating the consistency of the estimates produced by a spatial version of ‘difference generalized method of moments (GMM)’, an approach which easily accommodates endogenous regressors.Footnote 2 The main contribution of the paper is via the approach of Le Gallo and Páez (2013), who advocated the use of synthetic instruments to eliminate endogeneity bias in cross-sectional regressions, which is here extended to GMM estimation of dynamic spatial panel models. The intuition behind synthetic instruments is that because they are based on the invariant topology of the geographic space, typically they are exogenous to the spatio-temporal process being modelled. Specifically, because the endogenous variable(s) invariably has a non-random spatial distribution, some inherent dimensions of the topology will often be quite strongly correlated with the endogenous variable. Synthetic instruments deriving from these inherent dimensions typically possess hard-to-find ideal properties of instrumental variables, namely exogeneity and yet correlation with the endogenous variable. In this paper, synthetic instruments help resolve some pitfalls of GMM estimation arising when there is an overabundance of instrumental variables. This can be exacerbated with spatial data, where the suite of instruments might be enhanced by the use of the spatial lags of variables in addition to variables per se (Kelejian and Prucha 1998, 1999; Pace et al. 2012; Baltagi et al. 2019). Moreover, instruments are often weak, with negligible correlation with endogenous variables. In contrast, synthetic instruments are invariably strong, with typically very high correlations. By replacing weak instruments with fewer synthetic instruments, one is likely to obtain more reliable inference. In particular, reducing the number of instruments eliminates problems relating to the crucial Sargan–Hansen test of overidentifying restrictions. An associated problem is the downwardly biased parameter standard errors associated with two-step GMM estimation, which causes upward bias in t-ratios. To remedy this, two related finite sample corrections are reported: the well-known Windmeijer correction and the ‘HKL’ double correction (Hwang et al. 2022), which also allows for overidentification bias. Finally as an illustration, synthetic instruments and standard error corrections are applied to real data to provide a stronger inferential basis to published research.

Paul Elhorst,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The north of the Netherlands hosts Europe’s largest natural gas field, which has provided energy to most Dutch households since the 1960s. However, extracting gas from it induces mild earthquakes (Kamp 2013, p.443) that negatively impact house prices in the region. Although this impact has been clearly documented in the literature (Francke and Lee 2013, 2014; Koster and van Ommeren 2015; Bosker et al. 2016; Marlet et al. 2017), there is still uncertainty about the spatial and temporal extensions of the problem. Their determination is as policy relevant as it is difficult to achieve for at least two reasons. First, simultaneously measuring the magnitude of the impact, determining the extent of the area, and the length of the period in which the earthquakes affected house prices is challenging. Second, a fundamental, yet overlooked aspect in estimating the impact from externalities on house prices is that housing market transactions data typically present weak cross-sectional dependence (Chudik et al. 2011), i.e., house prices affect each other locally.Footnote 1 Real estate agents in the Netherlands apply the sales comparison approach (SCA) to advice their clients on a suitable list price when they try to sell their properties (Op’t Veld et al. 2008). To calculate it, they use transaction prices of recently sold, nearby dwellings with similar hedonic characteristics. List and transaction prices of the same house are usually highly correlated since both are increasing functions of the seller’s reservation price, implying that price data from house transactions are not independent from other similar, proximate, and previously settled house prices. Consequently, if the price of a specific house is affected by earthquakes, all prices for which this house has served as a reference will be indirectly impacted. Much of the literature measuring housing market effects from earthquakes in the Netherlands have turned to the comparison between house prices in so-called affected and those in neighboring areas, assumed to be unaffected. In addition, many studies take the event of the strongest earthquake, the so-called Huizinge earthquake of August 2012, as the moment that earthquakes began to affect house prices in the region. However, the phenomenon of weak cross-sectional dependence may have led to an insufficiently accurate determination of the area and period in which earthquakes have affected house prices. The underlying spatiotemporal relationship between similar dwellings needs to be modeled to adequately measure the magnitude of the impact of earthquakes on house prices and determine the extent of the area and period over which earthquakes affected the housing market. Jansen et al. (2016) evaluate 13 models and methods that have been proposed to study the impact of earthquakes on housing prices in the north of the Netherlands. However, none of them has used spatial econometric methods, leading the authors of this report to recommend further exploring this method (p.96). This study fills this gap. In addition to previous housing market studies using spatial econometric models, the spatiotemporal relationships are not only based on distance and time, but also on the pairwise degree of similarity between dwellings computed as an index described in Op’t Veld et al. (2008), extensively used by Dutch real estate agents associated to the NVM.Footnote 2 Moreover, we account for strong cross-sectional dependence. This concerns international perturbations and shocks, such as recessions, banking and currency crises, technological breakthroughs, changes in the supply of oil that affect confidence in the economy, as well as national policy changes in the tax, social security and pension systems, such as an increase of the retirement age, the interest deduction scheme in tax legislation, and the transfer tax on house transactions. Most studies control for cyclical patterns by adding time-period fixed effects to their price equations. However, several studies show that a fixed effects strategy is a special case of a much wider class of models that control for strong cross-sectional dependence (Pesaran 2006; Bailey et al. 2016a; Halleck Vega and Elhorst 2016; Shi and Lee 2017). Following Pesaran (2006), we include period-specific cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and allow its coefficient to vary across space. Bailey et al. (2016a) are one of the first studies combining both weak (local) and strong (global) cross-sectional dependence in one framework. In contrast to this study, we use individual rather than aggregated data and a simultaneous rather than a two-stage approach, with the difference that the response to the cross-sectional average only differs between municipalities and not between individual observations. We calculate each earthquakes’ peak ground velocity (PGV) at each house’s geographical coordinates using a seismological model presented in Dost et al. (2004). PGV gives the speed with which the ground moved at a given location because of the tremor of an earthquake, providing a proxy for the seismic intensity that a tremor exerted on a specific house. Although this measure has been used in the literature before, it has only been employed to identify the number of earthquakes that could be felt, i.e., PGV\(>0.5\) cm/s (Koster and van Ommeren 2015). Alternatively, we construct a variable that accumulates the PGV of each earthquake that took place before each house was sold and subsequently break it into different bins to allow for potential nonlinear effects. We also compare the results with those that are obtained when using one overall PGV measure or when measuring PGV over the last year only. We use detailed data on housing transactions taking place between 1993 and 2014 in the three most northern provinces of the Netherlands: Groningen, Drenthe, and Friesland. This research area is wider and this period is longer compared to that in Koster and van Ommeren (2015), which is the closest study to this one, since these authors used data on transactions restricted to the period 1996 to 2013 and to the province of Groningen. These extensions are important in determining the extent of the impact without any prior and arbitrarily set area of study. Similarly, a more extensive period will allow for a better identification of the effects stemming from earthquakes before the Huizinge earthquake in 2012. In the concluding section, we discuss additional problems that need to be accounted for when using data after 2014. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature overview on hedonic models for house prices and on spatiotemporal modeling of real estate markets. Section 3 describes the data employed and the applied empirical strategy. Section 4 reports and discusses the main empirical findings. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",

Of course, the lockdowns enforced in many European countries immediately impacted shopping behavior due to the closure of “non-essential” retail stores. However, these lockdowns were temporary and cannot be considered solely responsible for the enormous increase in the relevance of online retailing. Several studies suggest that during the pandemic—independent of any lockdowns—voluntary behavioral changes such as reductions in shopping mobility and switching to e-shopping due to fear of coronavirus infection occurred (e.g., Chenarides et al. 2021; Goolsbee and Syverson 2021; Jacobsen and Jacobsen 2020; Jiao and Azimian 2021; Shamshiripour et al. 2021). In addition, in many European countries, the face mask mandate in retail stores, which many consumers found uncomfortable or categorically rejected, may have impacted shopping behavior (Bonial 2020; Knotek et al. 2020; Taylor and Asmundson 2021). In view of the above findings, one can assume that the pandemic situation has also influenced spatial shopping behavior, independently of forced business closures, particularly in favor of e-commerce. Research on shopping behavior has so far focused on either store choice in physical retailing or channel choice in multi-channel retailing, using either store choice or channel choice models (see Sect. 2). The studies mentioned above, on the other hand, refer to changes in (shopping) behavior in the COVID-19 pandemic, but without modeling spatial shopping behavior. Unfortunately, there have not yet been any model-based studies on spatial shopping behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to fill this gap. Based on an empirical, model-based store choice approach, the current study attempts to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the main drivers of spatial shopping behavior given the availability of both physical and online stores? (2) Have the determinants of spatial shopping behavior changed during the pandemic? (3) Have fear of infection and the obligation to wear a face mask in retail stores influenced channel choice in favor of online retailing? In order to answer these questions, Wieland’s (2021a, b, 2023) study design on micro-econometric modeling of spatial shopping behavior in a multi-channel context is here repeated for the purposes of comparison. The empirical analysis focuses on consumer electronics retailing and furniture retailing. Empirical data on shopping behavior was collected via a representative consumer survey conducted in three German regions. The econometric modeling approach follows on from Wieland’s (2021a, 2023) previous studies on consumer electronics and furniture shopping; it is based on the hurdle model, which is used frequently to answer questions about individual consumption decisions and with which it is possible to split human behavior into an “if” and a “how” decision. Since the model is designed for micro data, it is possible to include individual consumer characteristics of both an objective and subjective nature. The current model considers shopping transaction costs, store characteristics, and psychographic consumer characteristics (shopping attitudes). In order to investigate the influence of the pandemic on shopping decisions, attitudes including fear of infection and the perceived burden of masks were also surveyed and integrated into the model as explanatory variables. The study approach demonstrates that online and physical retailers can be incorporated into a store choice model for spatial shopping behavior, which is originally derived from retail location theory and developed for physical retail locations alone. The fact that such a model can also be used for the multi-channel context represents a theoretical and methodological extension of the analysis concepts in retail geography. With respect to the comparison of shopping behavior before and during the pandemic, it can be shown that the determinants of shopping behavior have largely not changed. While channel choice is mainly explained by the age of the consumers, their attitudes and, in some cases, their place of residence, transaction costs and store features have a major influence on store choice. The pandemic situation—in the sense of fear of infection and mask aversion—has only a minimal impact on shopping behavior, if at all. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the literature on spatial shopping behavior in the context of retail location theory, multi-channel shopping behavior, and voluntary behavior changes during the pandemic. Section 3 outlines the modeling approach, the explanatory variables, and their expected impact, as well as the data collection procedure. In Sect. 4, the empirical findings are presented in terms of descriptive results, intermediate results toward the psychographic consumer attributes, and model results for the three survey areas. Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions of this study and discusses some limitations of the study.",
