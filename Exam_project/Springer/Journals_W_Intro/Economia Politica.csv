One key event during that period was the publication, on December 5, 2012, of the report “Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union” authored by the so-called “four presidents” (Van Rompuy, Barroso, Juncker e Draghi) which identified four pillars on which a “stable and prosperous” monetary union could be built (see European Commission 2012). One of these pillars—together with the banking union (or, more precisely an “integrated financial framework”), the integrated economic policy framework, and the strengthening of democratic legitimacy—was the “fiscal union”—at least this is the term used by many to refer to it, although more precisely the report referred to the achievement of an “integrated budgetary framework ensuring both sound national budgetary policies and greater resilience to economic shocks of the euro area as a whole”. Since then, progress has been made in all these areas, although to different extents, with more progress being made in achieving an integrated financial framework. The update of the four presidents’ report issued in June 2015 (actually now the five presidents’ report, following the inclusion of the president of the EU Parliament; see European Commission 2015) makes new proposals on how to advance in integrating the institutions of the euro-area but is relatively less ambitious than the previous report, at least in terms of short-term objectives. The debate on the medium and long term future of European institutions is, however, still very much alive (see, for example, Sapir and Wolff 2015). The need to base this debate on adequate information motivated the studies collected in a volume published at end-2014 (Cottarelli and Guerguil 2014), which was prepared primarily by economists of the Fiscal Affairs Department of the International Monetary Fund. The idea underlying this volume is that, in designing future European fiscal institutions, it is useful to look at the features of these institutions in other economic areas that share the same currency, the defining element of the euro area, and compare them with the current fiscal institutions in the euro area. In doing this, there is an obvious problem: other economic areas that share the same currency are—with the exception of the two African monetary unions and of the small Caribbean monetary union—also political unions while the euro area is not a full political union, at least not yet! In order to alleviate this problem, the book focused on fiscal institutions in policy unions in which the political power is less centralized, namely in federal states. In any case, even if imperfect, comparisons with federal states can still provide information on how some economic policy problems that characterize common currency areas have been addressed, thus providing a benchmark against which to assess current European institutions and perhaps suggesting the direction in which these institutions will evolve over the long term. This article, based on the empirical evidence presented in the book, argues that the key differences between the fiscal institutions of the European Union and those of fiscal federations arise from the very limited role played in Europe by the Union budget, which is extremely undersized with respect to what is found even in the most decentralized fiscal federations. Furthermore, it is argued that the existence of a large federal budget plays a key role in ensuring the good working of a monetary union. Thus, while not being the only solution to the existing problems, the strengthening of the EU budget provides the logical evolution of—a logical ending point for—the process of integration of European institutions over the long term.",6

Panteghini,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The deductibility of interest payments ensures a tax benefit to debt-financed firms. Accordingly, a fair amount of research has found evidence that debt usage is positively affected by corporate tax rates, as argued by Graham (2003). These results support the idea that companies can trade-off the tax benefits of debt finance with the expected costs of default, therefore obtaining an optimal capital structure.Footnote 1
 As stressed by Gordon (2010), corporate financial choices can also be explained by information asymmetries. In particular, Akerlof (1970) lemon problem fits well with capital markets. As pointed out by Myers and Majluf (1984), when corporations seek outside finance, investors learn that the firms need funds. For this reason, firms with less pressing needs for cash (those who are doing well) will forego outside finance, even at the cost of foregoing good investment projects. Only weaker firms borrow.Footnote 2 This fact is supported by robust evidence, showing that the use of debt declines when profitability rises and led Myers (1993) to state that taxation is irrelevant in terms of financial choices. Subsequently, he added that it is “of third-order importance” (Myers et al. 1998).Footnote 3
 This lively debate demonstrates that there is much to learn about the possible interactions between taxation and corporate finance. It is worth noting that this literature mainly focuses on the demand side of capital markets, thereby investigating the determinants of corporate capital structure. This is somewhat surprising, since lenders (in particular, banks and other financial institutions) crucially affect both the amount and the cost of debt. In our view, both sides of financial markets should be investigated. For this reason, we develop a screening model that aims to study the effects of corporate taxation on credit market equilibria under asymmetric information. To the best of our knowledge, only a few papers have dealt with public policies and the supply side of capital market.Footnote 4 Relevant exceptions are (de Meza and Webb 1999, 2000) who focus on public policy and welfare analysis, under credit rationing. Building upon the well-known contributions by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) and de Meza and Webb (1987). Boadway and Keen (2006) generalize the findings of both papers by analyzing screening and signaling equilibria. In particular, they assume a continuum of potential firms, each with its own project characterized by a given probability and return in case of success, and a competitive banking sector. They investigate welfare-improving policy interventions. However, they admit that “it would be dangerous to draw any strong conclusions for policy”, from their results and that “it is tempting to invoke the principle of insufficient reason to ... seek to impose any corrective tax or subsidy at all” (p. 501). In the same vein, Fuest and Tillessen (2005) study public assistance programs for entrepreneurial investment based on closed ended subsidies, namely, tax benefits granted only up to a certain absolute limit. To deal with the optimality of this policy they apply a three-stage model where banks offer loan contracts, then firms apply for the contract they prefer and finally banks decide whether to accept the application or not. They show that under asymmetric information, banks distort investment in order to prevent mimicking. In this case, open ended (i.e., unlimited) taxes or subsidies are preferable. More recently, Minelli and Modica (2009) use the Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) approach to find optimal policies under asymmetric information. By assuming the existence of banks with market power, they study three kinds of policy tools: interest rate subsidies; investment subsidies; loan guarantees. They show that interest rate subsidies and loan guarantees are optimal to correct market equilibrium inefficiency. Simon (2011) provides an explanation for a government to discriminate between debt and equity financing. Assuming that entrepreneurs are risk-averse, she shows that equity generates more surplus than debt, because it also provides insurance. If, therefore, the government aims at extracting surplus from entrepreneurs it should tax equity-financed income more heavily. The following interesting aspect, however, has been disregarded by public policy papers using asymmetric information: the effect of the business cycle on credit market conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, the spread between the high-yield and the investment-grade interest rates on corporate loans in the EU and US crucially depends on the business cycle.Footnote 5 In particular, downturns in 2001–2 and 2008–9 led to a sharp increase of this variable. We can claim that the interest rate paid by corporations of different types is closer (more different) during a recovery (downturn). The spread between the high-yield and the investment-grade interest rates on corporate loans (Global Financial Stability Report, October, 2013) Our paper departs from the above articles in several respects. Firstly, we aim to set up a theoretical environment where five pieces of evidence are accounted for: (1) the existence of a tax incentive to borrow [see e.g., Miniaci et al. (2014)]; (2) the presence of asymmetric information in credit markets [see Gordon (2010), and the papers cited herein]; (3) the screening activity of lenders [see e.g., Bester (1985) and, especially, Besanko and Thakor (1987), who, as in our framework, use the loan size as a screening device]; (4) the negative relationship between leverage and profitability [see e.g., Miniaci et al. (2014)]; finally, (5) the business cycle effects on the spread between the high-yield and the investment-grade interest rates on corporate loans (see Fig. 1). This would lead us to consider both sides of capital markets. In addition, we highlight and investigate the joint effects of the business cycle and of taxation on credit market equilibrium.Footnote 6 In order to focus on the relationship between corporate taxation and the financial market, we depart from de Meza and Webb (1999, 2000) by assuming that credit is unconstrained. Our two-period model assumes a given number of risk-neutral firms that invest under taxation. Firms can issue equity and/or apply for a loan from external lenders to finance an investment project, whose cost is normalized to unity. There are two types of firms: bad firms’ projects succeed with lower probability and yield lower expected returns than good firms’ ones. We assume the existence of a capital market with at least two homogeneous risk-neutral lenders competing à la Bertrand. In particular, they operate in an asymmetric information context, where firms’ probability of success in unverifiable. Borrowing is regulated through a loan contract characterized by interest rate and amount of funding. In addition, we let the lenders decide whether to commit or not to the contract proposed to firms, but not yet signed by the parties. In case of non-commitment, the lenders can reject loan applications. The converse is true if they commit.Footnote 7 Given these assumptions, we find three main results. Firstly, if the percentage of bad firms in the economy is low relatively to that of good firms, a pooling equilibrium without commitment is found, where bad and good firms sign the same loan contract. Interestingly, the pooling equilibrium disappears when the option of non-commitment is absent, i.e., when the lenders cannot reject firms’ applications for loans. By contrast, when the percentage of bad firms is large enough, a separating equilibrium arises, with or without commitment. In this case, good firms pay a lower interest rate but receive less debt than bad firms. Put differently, firms with less pressing needs for cash (i.e., good ones) have lower leverage.Footnote 8
 Secondly, the above result crucially depends on corporate taxation, in that the threshold portion of bad firm below (above) which a pooling (separating) equilibrium exists is affected by the level of corporate tax rate. Finally, we provide some comparative statics on the portion of bad firms. We expect such a portion to increase during a downturn. In this case, we prove that the rise in the corporate spread between the high-yield (i.e., bad firms) and the investment-grade (good firms) interest rates, highlighted in Fig. 1, is more likely when the corporate tax rate is high enough. When, however, the portion of bad firms decreases (e.g., following a recovery), the reduction in the corporate spread, observed in Fig. 1, is more likely when the corporate tax rate is relatively low. Overall, we conclude that the impact of the business cycle on the credit market equilibrium can be affected by taxation. In the working-paper version of the paper (Cohen et al. 2014), we also provide a welfare analysis and discuss corporate tax policy implications. The structure of the paper is as follows. The model is presented in Sect. 2, and describes financial choices under both symmetric and asymmetric information. Section 3 derives comparative statics results. Section 4 summarizes our findings and concludes. Appendices 1 and 5 contain the proofs of our results.",2
33,1,Economia Politica,05 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-016-0023-5,Education and training in a model of endogenous growth with creative wear-and-tear,April 2016,Adriaan Van Zon,Roberto Antonietti,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In a recent paper, Jones and Romer (2010) present a list of five stylized facts that characterize the world economy in the last 50 years, which include steady increase in human capital per worker in the form of a sustained increase in educational attainment. There is a strong consensus in the academic literature that human capital is an important determinant of productivity at both the individual and the aggregate level. At the macroeconomic level, in particular, there is evidence that human capital investments have a positive impact on productivity growth, not only in the short run but also in the long run, through their contribution to technological progress. Human capital has become a crucial element in technology-driven sustainable growth in which new technologies continuously replace existing ones, but require people continuously to learn how to operate them efficiently. However, human capital as such, encompasses different types of investments in people. While the economic literature on the determinants of aggregate productivity growth generally focuses on one aspect of human capital, i.e. education, labor economists point to the importance of other types of human capital, in particular learning-by-doing (Arrow 1962), experience, and on-the-job training (Schultz 1961; Mincer 1962; Becker 1964). Thus, the economic role of education has been widely recognized but the relationship between technological change, training, and economic growth is less well acknowledged. In particular, economic theory does not provide a clear-cut prediction about the sign of the relationship between technological change and investment in job-specific training. One argument is that technological change makes formal education and previously acquired skills obsolete, thus increasing investments in specific training or experience, and reducing investment in general education (Weinberg 2004). An alternative view is that general education enables workers to adjust to and benefit from technological change, so that there are higher incentives to invest in schooling than in specific, on-the-job, training (Welch 1970; Gould et al. 2001; Gould 2002). According to the small body of available evidence—primarily based on the US case (Lillard and Tan 1986; Bartel and Sicherman 1998): (1) the incidence of training is higher at higher rates of technological change; (2) more educated individuals are more likely to receive on-the-job training, but technical change tends to remove this effect as the training gap between highly educated and less educated workers narrows; (3) when a new technology is first introduced, the general skills of highly educated workers act like a substitute for firm training. As experience with the new technology accumulates, it becomes possible to train less educated employees to perform new tasks. Table 1 shows that, in the European Union, between 2005 and 2013, the macroeconomic trends are characterized by increasing average effort in R&D activities and an increasing share of tertiary educated population. However, in relation to training trends, we note that between 1999 and 2010 the total number of training hours generally decreased, together with an average increase in the number of firms providing continuous vocational training courses, and an increase in the share of participants in vocational training courses.Footnote 1
 Against this background, we investigate: (1) what is the relationship between faster introduction of new technologies and the human capital composition of a country’s workforce? (2) Does technological change make training more efficient? (3) Do people get enough education to minimize firms’ training costs? We try to shed some light on these questions by developing an endogenous growth model in which the adoption of a new technology is supposed to be costly for firms, since before the technology can be used for production, the relevant workers need to learn how to operate it. We further endogenize the process of general knowledge accumulation by making households decide upon their level of education in the context of the optimal allocation of their income derived from working and the ownership of assets (firms in this case), over consumption and accumulation of assets and human capital. Acquiring education comes at an explicit cost (education fees) to these private households.Footnote 2
 The model we develop combines elements from Romer (1990), Aghion and Howitt (1992), and Ramsey (1928), so that productivity growth is the result of firms’ ‘love of variety’ and of quality improvements in a context of intertemporally optimal consumer decisions. However, in our model, the obsolescence of older intermediate inputs is gradual rather than complete, as in a ‘creative wear and tear’ process where all varieties can live forever although they gradually fade out over time (Van Zon and Yetkiner 2003). To this basic set-up, we add the notion of the crucial importance of heterogeneous human capital for economic growth, and employ Ramsey’s (1928) intertemporal optimization framework to endogenize the household decision regarding the allocation of resources across different activities including consumption and the accumulation of (general) human capital, through a process of self-financed education.Footnote 3
 Our simulation results show that, in times of rapid introduction of new technologies, the optimum ‘portfolio-mix’ between general and specific human capital changes in favor of the former, since it provides a relatively more efficient basis for acquiring specific skills that are prone to creative destruction. However, in a general equilibrium setting with endogenous education costs, households tend to under-invest in education, leaving training cost reductions and growth opportunities unexploited. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related literature. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 presents a numerical simulation exercise, for the partial and general equilibrium specifications of our model. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.",1
33,1,Economia Politica,12 January 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-016-0022-6,On the volatility transmission between oil and stock markets: a comparison of emerging importers and exporters,April 2016,Elie Bouri,Riza Demirer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Volatility spillovers between the oil and stock markets have become an important issue for policy makers and financial market participants whose hedging decisions and energy policies are often affected by the uncertainty in the oil market. Clearly, higher oil prices may lead to higher production costs which in turn may affect corporate earnings and thus stock prices. Oil price shocks can also affect macroeconomic variables including GDP growth rates and inflation expectations (e.g. Hamilton 2005), which in turn can affect corporate earnings expectations. In fact, a number of studies including Chiou and Lee (2009) and Choi and Hammoudeh (2010) show that oil volatility shocks can lead to substantial stock market movements and volatility jumps. Considering that energy expenditures can account for a relatively large portion of GDP in developing nations, volatility in energy prices can present a major challenge if exposure to energy price fluctuations is not properly hedged. To that end, modelling volatility interactions between the oil and stock markets is a matter of particular importance for both corporations and policy makers in their strategies to manage energy price risks and mitigate the negative effects of cross-border shocks in their operations. While the theoretical linkages that relate oil and stock prices to common factors are not well established (Awartani and Maghyereh 2013), the empirical literature has often associated oil price risk with systematic risk factors, driving risk and return dynamics in stock markets. In fact, in a recent study, Demirer et al. (2015) show that oil price sensitivity of stocks can serve as a systematic risk proxy, leading to a significant and positive risk premium in stock returns. However, the literature on the volatility interactions across the oil and stock markets has largely focused on the stock markets of large, oil-importing countries and major exporting nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (e.g. Malik and Hammoudeh 2007; Arouri et al. 2011; Awartani and Maghyereh 2013). Clearly, as Filis et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2013) note, the effect of oil price shocks on stock returns will be significantly different for importing and exporting countries. In this study, we provide a comparative analysis of the volatility transmissions across the oil and a number of emerging (oil) importers and exporters by performing the causality-in-variance test developed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006). Our findings suggest unidirectional volatility transmissions from oil prices to stock markets, particularly in the case of the net exporting nations of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE, while country-to-oil effects are largely ruled out. On the other hand, we observe significant volatility spillovers from oil prices to emerging importers during the post-global financial crisis (GFC) period, suggesting that emerging importers are not immune from oil market volatility spillovers as well. The findings suggest that the information on oil market volatility combined with the magnitude of volatility spillovers can be utilized towards modeling and monitoring volatility shocks in emerging stock markets. We conclude that policy makers who are concerned about stability in the stock markets can design and implement appropriate regulations and courses of action to effectively cushion the impact of oil volatility shocks on the domestic stock market. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the vast literature on oil-stock market linkages. Section 3 presents the data and methodology. Section 4 discusses the empirical findings from volatility spillover causality tests and the impulse response functions; and Sect. 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of policy and investment implications.",32

In the long term, it is expected that differential growth rates, combined with demographic developments, will shift global economic power from advanced to emerging and developing countries. The global financial crisis has accelerated this development. While in 1999 emerging and developing economies collectively accounted for 42 % of global GDP on a purchasing power parity basis, by 2014, they held 55 %, and this is expected to rise further to 61 % by 2020.Footnote 1 Against the background of an increasingly integrated global economy and important shifts in global economic weights, the effective governance of the world economy is becoming ever more important. Long-term trends in global economic governance are clear when looking at the evolution of the international monetary system. Historically, international monetary relations in the post-WWII era were governed by the Bretton Woods system. Its essential feature was a fixed exchange rate of all currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar, which reinforced the central role of the dollar in global governance. In the 1960s, the Bretton Woods system came under pressure, as the US dollar’s fixed value against gold was seen as overvalued due to the rising US current account deficit. The system dissolved between 1968 and 1973, and the major currencies commenced floating against each other permanently. Global economic governance has in recent decades evolved towards a more multipolar system. Monetary relations are no longer solely centred on the US dollar, but instead are built on several pillars, including the euro, the yen, the pound sterling, and a renminbi, which is growing in significance. The increasing role of the renminbi demonstrates the rise of emerging markets and developing countries in the international economy. The greater economic weight of emerging and developing countries means that they expect an increased role in global governance. The challenge will be to further open up the existing system to include the ‘newcomers’ in an appropriate way. Reforming global economic governance became unavoidable after the global financial crisis, which had profound systemic consequences. At the economic level, the crisis made clear the extent of global interdependence and spillovers. This meant that at the political and institutional level, the appropriate response was to step up international cooperation, resulting in the emergence of the G20 as a new forum for the coordination of economic policy. These changes affect the role and position of Europe in the world. The EU remains a key partner in the new global order. Depending on the measure, the EU accounts for 17 % (GDP based on PPP) or 24 % (GDP in nominal terms) of the global economy. The EU is also the world’s largest trading block and a leader in international investment. The central question is how to position the EU in a post-crisis world, and how we manage to punch according to our weight in the global economy. In what follows, I argue that in order to remain a leader in global economic governance, Europe will need to face up to a number of mainly domestic challenges, while at the same time making use of and enhancing its existing strengths.",1
33,2,Economia Politica,21 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-016-0032-4,The ECB: a reluctant leading character of the EMU play,August 2016,Francesco Saraceno,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The global financial crisis that began in 2008 seems to slowly fade away, as the world economy continues to recover from the worst shock since the 1930s. Recovery is fragile and uneven: In particular, the EMU only recovered pre-crisis output levels at the end of 2015, and emerging economies may face difficult times ahead because their potential growth has been impacted by the crisis (and by increased geopolitical risks). Yet, even if revised downwards, the IMF global growth forecast for the years ahead is acceptable. The first phase of the crisis has been extensively discussed, and here we can just recall the salient facts: the unraveling of a small speculative sector of the US credit sector, the market for subprime loans, generated a cascading effect on the rest of the global financial system. Contagion was mostly due to the deregulation which allowed the proliferation of increasingly opaque financial instruments, spreading toxic assets in the portfolios of often unaware owners, and leading at the same time to excessive risk-taking and debt. When the US housing bubble burst, financial institutions worldwide, but also households and firms, rushed to sell their assets. This deleveraging process led to a credit crunch and to a drastic reduction of investment and consumption. The financial crisis therefore spilled to the real economy. The policy response followed the typical textbook recipes that are known since Keynes wrote the General Theory in 1936: on the one hand, the prompt intervention of central banks through massive credit to financial institutions prevented the meltdown of the financial sector. This injection nevertheless, was ineffective to restart the economy. In the process of deleveraging, banks, businesses and households shrank their balance sheet, thus reducing credit at a faster pace than liquidity was increased by central banks (Adrian and Shin 2010), which was therefore not turned into demand for goods and services. This liquidity trap, familiar to historians, made monetary policy lose traction, as was clear by the end of 2008. In line with Keynes’ prescriptions, fiscal policy then took the witness; in the spring of 2009, most advanced and emerging economies implemented massive stimulus plans that supported demand and put the economy on a recovery path, even if at the price of a generalized deterioration of public finances. The European economy, in particular Eurozone countries, began to diverge from the other advanced economies when Greece made public, in the fall of 2009, frauds in the management of public finances that had been going on for the previous decade. The Greek crisis revealed imbalances that went well beyond public finances’ irresponsibility in the Eurozone periphery (Saraceno 2013a). Since then, while the rest of the world economy is heading toward a recovery certainly fragile, but irreversible, the Eurozone is tangled into a never-ending crisis, which may still endanger the very existence of the single currency. The scope of this paper is to assess the response to the crisis looking both at the policies followed, and at the rules and institutions that the EMU has in place to ensure its governance. The focus will be on monetary policy that, most probably against the will of ECB presidents Trichet and Draghi, came to be at the forefront of the fight against the crisis. In a nutshell, I will argue that the ECB has been the only institution fighting against the breakup of the Eurozone, but mostly for the wrong reasons, i.e. the inertial and wrongheaded fiscal policy of Member States. I will then argue that this dysfunctional behavior of European policy makers is the fruit of a European version of the Washington Consensus, that has shaped institutions and, even more importantly the mindset of European policy makers. The structure of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 will assess the precarious EMU health. The following section will build on previous work (Fitoussi and Saraceno 2013) to describe the theoretical underpinnings of the so-called Berlin–Brussels–Frankfurt (BBF) consensus. Section 4 will then will address the behavior of the ECB during the crisis, showing how it went as far as the treaties allowed, and sometimes beyond, to fight speculation and the threat of exit by peripheral countries. Section 5 will deal with what should be done to finally lift the EMU economy out of the crisis. I will argue that in a liquidity trap there is only so much a central bank can do, and that the answer lies in more active fiscal policy; this in turn would require modifying the current fiscal framework. The section will conclude asking whether a dual mandate, or even a triple mandate embedding fiscal stability, would better equip the ECB to fight recessions and foster economic growth.",6

The standard approach of mainstream economics—based on a “well-behaving” representative firm operating in well-defined market contexts—can hardly be reconciled with the extent of such heterogeneity.Footnote 2 Evidence from Bottazzi et al. (2010) for the period 1991–2004 shows that (labour) productivity differentials within French and Italian manufacturing firms in the same three digit sector, measured as ratios between the 95th percentile and the 5th percentile, range from 2 to 9. In US manufacturing, considering firms in the same 4 digits industries, Syverson (2011) reports an average p90-p10 difference in (log total factor) productivity around 2. This heterogeneity appears to be pervasive across countries and persistent over time; similar results have emerged from studies on firm size, efficiency, profitability, innovation, and growth rate (Moreno and Coad 2015; Colombelli et al. 2014a). The search for alternatives to the mainstream approach needs to identify the key factors shaping heterogeneity while getting rid of the “noise” of individual observations, so that causal relationship can be explored. The Pavitt Taxonomy (Pavitt 1984) considered the nature, sources and patterns innovation, as well as firm size and market structure, identifying four classes: Science Based Industries, Specialized Suppliers Industries, Scale Intensive industries, Supplier Dominated industries. Its empirical base was the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) database on innovation in UK firms, and it convincingly identified regularities and differences among firms and industries, becoming a milestone in innovation and business studies. It was developed in parallel to work on evolutionary/Neo-Schumpeterian approaches (e.g. Freeman 1982; Dosi 1982, 1988) exploring the importance of diversity in economic activities. The original work was focused on manufacturing (putting the entire service economy in the suppliers dominated class); a more recent literature has used a similar approach for investigating innovative activities in services (Tidd et al. 2005; Gallouj and Savona 2009). Efforts to extend or redefine industrial or firms taxonomies have usually focused on the production/innovation side, trying to cluster economic units according to their characteristics and strategies. However, one of the advantages of the Pavitt Taxonomy was its ability to fit the diversity of industries in the context of the relationship between innovation and economic performance. This article reassesses the Pavitt Taxonomy and extends it to service industries on the bases of systematic empirical evidence; using a complex array of techniques, we provide a grouping that incorporates varieties of input and innovative strategies and differences in the nexus innovation-performance. Focusing on regularities at the industry level for both manufacturing and services, we propose and test a Revised Pavitt Taxonomy. A major novelty of this article is the systematic and detailed use of empirical evidence and statistical tests, using the rich information provided by European Community Innovation Surveys (CIS).Footnote 3 They account for different dimensions of innovative efforts, addressing the nature of innovation, its sources, strategies, cost, outcomes and economic relevance. This analysis is based on the sectoral innovation database (SID), developed at the University of Urbino, which provides data from three waves of the CIS for 38 manufacturing and services industries in eight European countries (Pianta et al. 2015). Our methodology uses a variety of statistical tools—descriptive statistics, distributional tests, principal component and regression analyses—to test the stability of the Revised Pavitt Taxonomy over time and across countries. Our findings confirm that the four classes originally identified by Pavitt still hold after a proper placement of service industries—including ICT intensive activities. Moreover, the Revised Pavitt Taxonomy is able to account for the diversity in the determinants of innovation and in the innovation-performance link across European industries. This article proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 discusses heterogeneity and introduces our approach; Sect. 3 reviews the literature on applications and extensions of the Pavitt Taxonomy; Sect. 4 presents the Revised Pavitt Taxonomy and its empirical grounding, Sect. 5 provides some econometric tests. Section 6 briefly concludes.",71

These issues are today much debated, and several studies have concentrated on the drivers of movements in the relative demand for skills. The early empirical literature, based on industry data, agreed that technical change was mainly responsible for the skill upgrading and the rising wage gap. This conclusion has been supported by the finding that most of the variation observed in skill utilization has occurred within, rather than between, sectors.Footnote 1 Indeed, according to the skill-biased technical change (SBTC) view, rapid technological change, especially when associated with the introduction of computers and automatization processes, modifies the workforce composition within sectors, increasing the employment share of skilled workers and reducing the demand for unskilled workers and hence their wages. By contrast, explanations based on product-demand shifts, such as international trade as modeled in standard-trade theories, predict shifts of workers between sectors. Countries with a more skilled labor force specialize in industries which use that factor more intensively. As a result of an expansion of trade, workers should move from contracting industries to expanding ones, changing the aggregate ratio between skilled and unskilled workers and their relative wages. The conclusions derived from industry-level analyses, however, have been recently challenged by a new stream of empirical studies based on firm-level data.Footnote 2 Research based on micro data suggests that most of the movements in labor composition and relative wages happen within firms and that, at least some of these changes, are due to the differences in firms’ involvement in the international trade. This paper contributes to this emerging literature by providing new evidence on the firm-level dynamics in labor market outcomes underlying the industry-level patterns. Using micro-level data, it investigates the employment structure and the wage dynamic for Italian manufacturing firms in the early 2000s. The use of firm-level data enables us to assess whether the employment and wage movements have taken place between or within sectors, and within sectors, between, or within firms. To investigate the labor market dynamics, we implement a decomposition analysis that breaks the variation in the skilled-wage bill ratio down into employment and wage changes. We innovate with respect to the existing literature by proposing a methodology that takes simultaneous account of variations in the skill intensity and the wage gap and that consistently combines the industry-level analysis with the firm-level one. Moreover, to detect the role of technology or international competition in driving firms’ skill reallocation and wage premium changes, we run the decomposition analysis for different categories of firms depending on their technological efficiency and international involvement. Finally, we also consider changes in the hourly wage premium and skill intensity. In fact, firms may modify the structure of the workforce by changing the relative number of hours worked and the hourly wage of skilled workers. The results obtained using annual data may, therefore, conceal additional movements on the hourly margin. Changes in the average hours worked at the firm would eventually be accounted for in factor prices (annual wages) rather than in quantity movements (total hours employed). The main findings of the empirical analysis are summarized as follows. The decomposition analysis confirms the relative importance of within-firm changes in explaining the labor market outcomes: most of the movements are reported within sectors, and within sectors, the greatest variations occur within business units. By contrast, changes between industries, but also between firms, are very small. The finding that shifts occur especially within firms, therefore, supports models that mainly explain the skill composition and the wage dynamic using a micro-level perspective. Our results suggest that there was a restructuring process in terms of skill composition among Italian manufacturing firms during the early 2000s.Footnote 3 On average, firms substituted unskilled with skilled labor, providing evidence of a skill-upgrading mechanism. Movements between sectors were instead observed from high- to low-skill sectors, which might reflect the Italy’s peculiar specialization in the production of unskilled-intensive traditional goods. The restructuring process in terms of skill composition was not followed by a corresponding movement of wages. The relative price of the skilled factor was not adjusted positively as a consequence of the rise in the demand for skilled labor. The wage premium within firms fell, meaning that the wage gap narrowed. Although the data available do not allow us to test any theoretical explanation, the fact that the relative prices did not adjust to factor movements may be due, on the one hand, to the peculiarities of the Italian wage-bargaining mechanism and, on the other, to the reforms implemented in Italy during the period examined to increase the labor market flexibility. The empirical exercise reveals that technical efficiency and trade activities are linked to this within-firm reallocation process between skilled and unskilled workers. The increase in the relative employment of skilled workers and the decrease in the wage gap between high- and low-skilled workers can be substantially attributed to changes in exporters and importers and in more productive firms. Although we cannot give any causal interpretation to our results, the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that both technical progress and the strong and sharp increase in competitive pressure following the international integration of marketsFootnote 4 matched by the process of European integration, triggered a restructuring process that occurred within rather than across firms. Finally, the decomposition of the hourly wage premium and skill intensity reveals that additional effects are detected when these unexplored margins are considered. The results suggest that the annual wage gap is pushed by a substantial fall in the hourly wage premium enjoyed by skilled workers. Not only has the hourly wage premium fallen, but on average firms have increased the numbers of hours worked by the skilled factor. This rise partially “offsets” the overall effect of the substantial fall in the hourly wage premium over the annual wage inequality. It follows that the fall in the annual wage premium would have been even larger without this adjustment in the number of hours worked. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a broad picture of the macroeconomic context characterizing the Italian economy for the period under consideration, and it contextualizes the analysis in the literature. Section 3 describes the data set and the construction of the variables used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 outlines the industry- and firm-level decomposition framework and shows the results of this decomposition. Section 4.3 runs the decomposition analysis for different categories of firms depending on their technological efficiency and international involvement. Section 5 takes a closer look at the data, by extending the analysis to the further disaggregation of the annual wage into the price and quantity components. Section 6 concludes.",

In the jargon of financial markets, this term is nothing but the acronym of six developing countriesFootnote 1 on which international investors should speculate, in search of high (and safe?) returns. Most observers believe that recent macroeconomic data fully confirm optimistic perspectives on Colombia. In 2013, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) portrayed Colombia as a […] success story [which] is now one of the most open and most business-friendly countries in Latin America […and in which] new opportunities are opening up for foreign investors, particularly in hydrocarbons and mining, construction, and electricity, and there is free-trade access to the US market’ (The Economist Intelligence Unit 2013, p. 8). Park Madison Partners (PMP), a New York based business leader in the real estate sector, acknowledges Colombian achievements as being due to “sound” macroeconomic management of the economy. According to PMP, fiscal discipline and a successful inflation-targeting monetary policy have contributed towards creating a stable macroeconomic environment together with persistently positive growth rates, even in the wake of the most recent worldwide financial crisis,Footnote 2 see Fig. 1 (left-hand side). PMP further notes that Colombian monetary authorities have wisely decided not to obstruct any market-driven appreciation of the Colombian peso, in order to reassure foreign investors regarding the political commitment to avoid market distortions and policy-induced exchange rate risks.Footnote 3 Thanks to such policies Colombia is now characterized by ‘a vibrant and developing capital market […and the above] attractive fundamentals also create significant opportunities in the real estate (PMP 2013, p. 12).’ The increasing net inflow of capital observed in the Balance of Payment (Fig. 1, right-hand side) would seem to confirm Colombia’s bright future. Source: DANE Annual real GDP growth (left), balance of payments surplus (right) The above reports and recent analyses by the Colombian governmentFootnote 4 create the impression of a perfectly sound economy enjoying high and stable growth. In this paper, we argue that this apparent situation has a much broader aspect and such seemingly good performances hide more disturbing processes. On the one hand, past and prospected macroeconomic records have largely depended on—and indeed will continue to hinge upon—the increasing exploitation of Colombian natural resources, as well as high commodity prices on international markets. On the other hand, and perhaps more fundamentally, a dangerous process is currently unfolding within the Colombian economy, i.e. a dependence on foreign capital inflow to support a surprisingly high current account deficit.Footnote 5 We believe these facts may pose serious challenges to Colombian development in the near future. International and domestic institutions have shared some of the above concerns. OECD (2013), for instance, explicitly points out the relative, and at times absolute, contraction of the non-resource-based tradable good sector with respect to the energy and mining industry. In a working paper published by the Central Bank, Ojeda et al. (2014) elaborate on a DSGE model to assess the effects of a natural resource boom in the context of a three-sector small open economy. Both analyses share the description of structural (sectorial) changes in the Colombian economy, which follow the lines of a standard Dutch disease phenomenon. In a nutshell, the expansion of the energy sector and the ensuing foreign revenue windfall first raise domestic expenditures and lead to a real exchange rate appreciation. This, in turn, makes domestic manufacture less profitable and less attractive for investment, thus downsizing it. The two papers conclude with similar policy implications. For example, they advise for counter-cyclical fiscal policies in order to cut expenditures and soften real exchange rate appreciation. The focus of this paper is different. We do not want to establish whether there is Dutch disease in Columbia or not. Rather, we claim that, on top of the long-run dynamics traditionally associated with a Dutch disease (i.e. de-industrialization, exchange rate appreciation etc.), Colombia is experimenting unsustainable medium to long run financial dynamics related to the Dutch disease impacts on the balance of payments. For this reason, we will concentrate our analysis on the dynamics observed in the balance of payments components, namely the trade balance, the net factor payments and the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows. The astonishing expansion of the energy and mining industry in Colombia mostly relies on FDI targeting the sector. The object of this paper is to check whether such a boom might give rise to financial fragility (boom-and-bust cycles) and a deterioration of growth prospects. The fundamental mechanics of what we are suggesting are as follows. Mounting FDI inflow leads to net positive inflow of (foreign) capital and, in a flexible exchange rate regime, to nominal (and real) appreciation of the domestic currency. At first, such an appreciation jeopardizes Colombian manufacture’s competitiveness and exports, thus inducing considerable manufactured goods trade deficits and some de-industrialization.Footnote 6 On top of this, the exchange rate nominal appreciation attracts short-term portfolio investments, thus further appreciation, further de-industrialization and mounting foreign debt. Eventually, the repatriation of profits accruing to foreign investors in the energy sector (as well as the growing manufacturing trade deficit) leads to a deterioration in the current account such that the overall balance of payments may turn negative. The ‘boom’ turns into a ‘bust’ and, without central bank’s interventions, the exchange rate depreciates. Such medium run cyclical dynamics may be detrimental to long-run growth because it is likely to reduce (both directly and indirectly) the share of manufacture in total GDP and manufacturing constitutes, à la Kaldor, the ultimate source of labor productivity growth and long-run development. Our purpose, and let us assert this point, is thus to establish whether this Colombian pattern of growth is macroeconomically viable and sustainable in the medium to long run. Section 2 briefly outlines the abundant literature on Dutch disease, to make it clearer what we are (and what we are not) discussing. Section 3 provides evidence supporting the idea that Colombia is currently experiencing a de-industrialization process. Section 4 continues the analysis by observing some interesting macroeconomic features of the current Colombian pattern of growth. In particular, we look at changes in the sectorial destination of Foreign Direct Investments and at the decoupling in the dynamics of the current account and trade balance. Section 5 recapitulates our findings and describes briefly the risks associated with such a pattern. To emphasize these risks and make them more evident, we provide a scenario analysis, assessing the financial stability of the processes currently unfolding in the Colombian economy. We conclude discussing some policy options.",15

Veltri,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the publication of the best seller Nudge (Thaler and Sunstein 2008), the growth in the relevance of ‘Behavioural Economics’ (BE) and ‘Nudging’ has been exponential, both in terms of the adoption of behavioural perspectives in policy making and of ongoing academic research. With some simplification three strands can be singled out. First, the widespread application and institutionalisation of behaviourally inspired policy-making beyond the two initial cases of the US and the UK (Lunn 2014; Sousa Lourenço et al. 2016). Second, a discussion within the field of economics as to the place and contribution of BE toward ‘Evidence Based Economics’ (Chetty 2015; Thaler 2016). Third, the explosion between 2010 and 2016 of a multidisciplinary and multi-domain meta-literature of commentaries and essays for and against ‘Nudging’ that deal with its conceptual, theoretical, and philosophical underpinnings, as well as with its political and ethical implications (Blumenthal-Barby and Burroughs 2012; Gigerenzer 2015; Gold and Lichtenberg 2012; Hausman and Welch 2010; Jones et al. 2013, 2014; Kosters and Van der Heijden 2015; Marteau et al. 2011; Oliver 2015; Rebonato 2012, 2014; Saghai 2013; Selinger and Whyte 2011; Vallgårda 2012; Sunstein 2015a, b). Explaining the circumstances of the momentum of behavioural policy and behavioural economics could be a chapter in the sociology of knowledge. It is argued that the basic principles and underpinnings had existed for a long time, at least from the work of Simon (1957) and Tversky and Kahneman (1974) or as far back as Adam Smith and various other economists of the early 20th century (Thaler 2016, pp. 1578–1579). The impact of the book Nudge itself should not be overlooked (Kahneman 2013, pp. viii–ix). Yet, one could advance also other interpretative hypotheses such as done by Straßheim et al. who argue that behavioural economics has gained policy relevance (1) by leveraging the political epistemic derived by ‘easily demonstrable forms of experimental evidence’ and (2) because behavioural approaches allegedly redefine the relations between science, politics, and citizens at the time when the Evidence Based Policy programme is clearly in crisis (2015, p. 251). Indeed, elsewhere we also suggested that one of the main allure of the behavioural turn in policy resides in the use of Randomised Control Trials (RCT) and warned that this might be an ineffective shortcut to filter out value judgements from the design of policy options and overlook the importance of theoretical constructs (Bogliacino et al. 2015a). In this editorial we briefly consider the three trends outlined above (diffusion of behavioural policy-making, evidence-based economics, and the meta-literature on nudging) and argue in favour of a fruitful dialogue, which is currently missing. In doing this, we sketch the policy triangle of politics, value and evidence as a potential guidance.",17

An experimental study of car eco-labels,December 2016,Cristiano Codagnone,Giuseppe Alessandro Veltri,Francesco Mureddu,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the 1980s, and more so after the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, ‘eco-labels’ have become popular policy measures aimed at encouraging consumers to adopt environmentally friendly consumption (Horne 2009, p. 179), a pressing need in the context of increased commitment to tackle climate change. Such labels are designed to offset the information asymmetry between manufacturers/providers and consumers in various domains, from domestic energy supply (Momsen and Stoerk 2014), to motor vehicles (Teisl et al. 2008), wine products (Delmas and Grant 2014), and food (Vlaeminck et al. 2014). However, the use of labels has been criticised on the grounds that they are based on the assumption that consumers and firms behave irrationally; on the absence of evidence of an energy-efficiency gap (Gayer and Viscusi 2013, p. 249); and on the claim that labels may lead consumers to over-value energy consumption in the purchase of goods (Sahoo and Sawe 2015). As a result, policy instruments such as ‘eco-labels’ must be based on robust evidence. This pressing need for evaluation is further required by the debate on libertarian paternalism (Rebonato 2014; Thaler and Sunstein 2003), since labels are typically discussed as tools for nudging consumers. The ‘nudge’ strategy (Thaler and Sunstein 2009; Sunstein 2013) is a new trend in evidence based policy making that draws upon behavioural insights in the design of public policy interventions (Codagnone et al. 2014a; Sousa Lourenço et al. 2016; van Bavel et al. 2013, 2015). In the EU, labelling was introduced to tackle climate change in relation to passenger vehicles, Directive 1999/94/EC. The formal evaluation of the car labelling Directive started in 2015, and was seen as an opportunity to rethink labelling in the context both of a better knowledge of policy evaluation and of behaviourally informed consumer policy. This article reports findings from a laboratory experiment and a multi-country online experiment on the effects of eco-labels for cars and promotional material in orienting consumers’ purchasing choices. The experiments, both randomized control trials, were undertaken in the framework of a study for the European Commission supporting the revision of the existing European ‘car labelling’ Directive (Codagnone et al. 2013). The study was designed to contribute evidence on eco-labels effectiveness from an experimental behavioural perspective. In the lab, the main task was to select a car among a set of options (discrete choice task), with the cars shown with a label on the side, and to answer a set of questions afterwards. We used the choice as a revealed preference in terms of fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions, and we checked if, in answering the questions, the participants correctly processed the information shown on the label. In the online experiments, the main task was to declare the willingness to pay (WTP) for a car, through a multiple price list (MPL), and answer a set of question afterwards. In this case, as well, the car is shown with a treatment on the side (a label or a customized promotional material). We use the declared price as elicited willingness to pay, and we check if in answering the questions the participants correctly process the information shown on the treatment. In designing the variants of car labels and other materials, we faced the challenge of combining legislative requirements prescribing what information must be provided in a label with the theoretical and empirical evidence on the relevant heuristics and biases and that could be used to nudge consumers in the desired direction. Thus, the study was an exercise in ‘realistic nudges’—testing interventions that were both compatible with existing legislation and stood a good chance of not being resisted by the stakeholders, especially manufacturers. The main results were as follows. Labels directing attention to fuel economy or running costs were more easily understood by the consumers, and impact on choices through a form of mental accounting of fuel consumption. The same result was found in the elicited willingness to pay. In particular, large and expensive cars tend to be given less value when fuel economy is made salient. Information on CO2 emissions and green issues in general had little impact unless it was linked to future fuel saving. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the state of the research on behavioural science applied to ecological behaviour, together with the relevant regulatory framework; Sect. 3 details the experimental methods and materials; Sect. 4 the results and Sect. 5 provides a discussion of the findings, the limitations of the study and the policy implications.

Europe has gone through a series of crisis in recent years. Nevertheless, seen from a wider perspective, European integration has been a success story. In these times of accumulating crises, it is important to be aware of this. The European Union has guaranteed peace, democracy and prosperity for its citizens and Member States for almost 70 years. It is still the greatest political achievement in history that has served the people of our continent. The European Union and Europeans themselves have turned the page of a tragic history by freeing ourselves from fascist and communist dictatorships. We have created a new image of Europe in the world, far removed from imperialism and colonialism. We have set up and improved the Single Market and enabled the free movement of people, goods, services and capital among Member States; we have created a currency union and defended it amidst the challenges of a global economic and financial crisis. We have found our way back to economic growth and fiscal consolidation in most Member States. Furthermore, we have managed to attract many more Member States. We can be proud of these achievements. We should point them out more often. But we cannot take them for granted, and we should draw lessons from our mistakes. The rapid succession of crises of all kinds—“the multiple crisis, the polycrisis”—has provoked a deep shock, leaving wounds that are not yet healed. Some crises came from outside the Union (banks, refugees, terrorism), some came from within (eurozone, economy, Brexit). Trust was broken or on the verge of being broken in pillars of our societies: banks and the currency. Incomes, jobs and savings were threatened. It takes time before trust is restored. Whatever the source of crisis, citizens are asking for solutions from our national and European authorities. B. But the crisis is much deeper. It is about our socio-economic model, at a national, European and global level. When people become afraid of “space”, it shows they are longing for a “place” that protects them, one where they feel “at ease and at home”. In the Brexit-referendum, mostly older people wanted their “home” back—the nostalgia of “the good old days”. Young people voted overwhelmingly for Remain, knowing that the old world would not return. The first group are the—according to Thomas Friedman—“wall” people, ready to build walls in order to prevent others from coming in. The others are “web” people, embracing globalisation with its pro’s and its cons. This represents a fundamental and inevitable choice also in Europe and in the States. At the same time, we have to find a way to alleviate the tension, to bridge the distance between space and place, between web and wall. We need to address the worries of our younger and older citizens, by giving them better protection in many respects, correcting the market economy by tackling unemployment, irregular migration, climate change, huge inequalities and unfair competition, and by providing physical security. We need a new version of the social market economy at the European and even at the global level. We need a new social contract, a new consensus. Only this way we can turn fear into hope and liberate people from the feeling of powerlessness. We need more social harmony and less polarisation. More moderation and less aggressiveness. This, I repeat, at the European and at the global level. We need counter vailing powers to correct the brutal forces of the markets—the financial crisis was a warning shot. Much is at stake, but it is still doable.",2

More specifically, it aims to ascertain whether or not the returns on these investments in terms of sales of products new to the market (innovative sales) differ between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms, and whether or not returns are affected by a firm’s knowledge intensity.Footnote 1
 The general idea behind is that the knowledge created by a workforce trained to develop and/or introduce innovations can be better socialised and circulated within the firm (Boothby et al. 2010). This means that the effectiveness of innovation is contingent upon investment in the necessary human capital and training to support new technologies (Piva and Vivarelli 2009).Footnote 2 Stated simply, the better the people who manage a firm’s knowledge are trained in developing or introducing innovation, the better a firm’s performance (O’Dell and Jackson 1998). Specific-to-the-firm training contributes both to fostering knowledge circulation and to the production of new knowledge. Better knowledge circulation increases the sharing of tacit knowledge between individuals (Nonaka et al. 2000) and the absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990) of the firm, and consequently its ability to convert ideas into new products and sell them. However, it is reasonable to presume that the same amount of expenditure on training may generate different returns (in terms of innovation output) according to the size of the firm carrying it out and its stock of skilled workers. For instance, returns on training might differ between smaller and larger firms because of the different types of training provided and depending on the stock of available human capital on which to build.Footnote 3 Larger firms provide more frequent, formal and institutionalized training that guarantee continuous lifelong learning than smaller firms, which face greater financial constraints. In addition, smaller firms may find it more difficult to quickly adapt workers’ skills to the permanent evolution of job requirements resulting from the high speed at which technological change occur, which requires the continuous upgrading of a firm’s labour force. Similarly, returns on research and development (R&D) personnel, which in the following is used as a proxy for a firm’s stock of human capital and its innovation effort, may be affected by the scale of production because the larger the firm, the larger the amount of other intangible resources, for example personnel in marketing, design, etc., that can be combined to favour the success of a product and to make the most of knowledge circulation. Although smaller firms are more flexible, they often tend to have limited resources and competences, and, as a consequence, R&D returns tend to be greater in larger firms (Lichtenberg and Siegel 1991). The argument behind the hypothesis of differences in returns on training and R&D personnel due to differences in knowledge intensity between firms hinges on the abovementioned idea that the larger the stock of skilled employees, the larger will be the stock of knowledge on which the new knowledge created through training can build. Therefore, assuming the existence of knowledge spillovers at firm level and among employees, we might argue that the return on an investment in training and/or R&D personnel would be expected to be larger the larger was the stock of in-house skilled human capital. In addition, training and R&D are a prerequisite for benefiting from these spillovers. To the extent that larger firms invest more (and on a more continuous basis) in training and skilled human capital than smaller firms and that these expenditures increase productivity at firm level, it follows that larger firms may gain a competitive advantage. To examine these issues, this study uses non-anonymous data from the third wave of the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS),Footnote 4 which concern 1998–2000 and cover 23 European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden). The choice to use this wave of the survey rather than one of the more recent ones was made because this was the last wave to collect firm-level information on the number of employees with tertiary education, and it provides more detailed information on training expenditures.

While the former started reversing as of 2011 in the midst of the Euro crisis, the latter did not go through a symmetric adjustment (for empirical evidence, see for example Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2011). This paper identifies a common explanation for both the build-up and the asymmetric reversal of macroeconomic imbalances in the EA. Focus is on the behavior of the private sector, and more specifically on the drivers of debt-financed household consumption and the way in which (over)-borrowing might have been distributed across categories of income in each country. The debate on the origins of EA imbalances and the mechanism through which they have been unwinding in the periphery and not in the core is not fully settled. Some support the competitiveness hypothesis, according to which imbalances relate to differences in cost competitiveness between the core and the periphery that have come to light following the loss of the exchange rate as a policy instrument (Zemanek et al. 2009; Belke and Dreger 2013). Others stress the role played by capital flows. In this case, imbalances reflect the fact that excess savings in the high-income core of Europe moved to the low-income periphery following the abolition of capital controls in the European Single Market (ESM) as of 1990 and the subsequent elimination of exchange rate risks starting with 1999. This downhill flow of capital is justified both on the supply and the demand side. Credit supply by core countries is driven by the expected rate of return (Abiad et al. 2007; Giavazzi and Spaventa 2010; Jaumotte and Sodsriwiboon 2010; Schmitz and Von Hagen 2011). Credit demand in poorer peripheral countries stems from the fact that households get indebted to increase current consumption, for example, because they become optimistic about future income as in standard inter-temporal consumption models (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2002; Fagan and Gaspar 2007a, b).Footnote 1
 Both hypotheses have limits. The competitiveness hypothesis does not account for the decoupling of export performance and standard cost competitiveness indicators, e.g. unit labour costs (ULC) or real effective exchange rates (REER) deflated by ULC (Gaulier and Vicard 2012). It is also not necessarily consistent with the fact that current account reversal in deficit countries was mainly achieved through a contraction in demand (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2011). On the other hand, the capital-flow hypothesis overestimates the role of per capita income and treats countries like homogenous blocks, failing to account for the role of household heterogeneity and in particular for the fact that the propensity to get indebted is likely to vary along the income distribution. The question of who holds debt is relevant because it determines the macroeconomic consequences of household indebtedness over the cycle (Eggertsson and Krugman 2012), potentially shedding light on current account reversal. The argument we put to the test is that some EA countries imported large amounts of capital from abroad hence their current account deficits because they were relatively unequal societies, with a large cohort of lower-income groups that experienced a sudden relaxation of collateral constraints following EMU-induced financial integration. They then started over-borrowing against optimistic expectations about future income. The same is not true for less unequal EA countries where, prior to EMU, collateral constraints had been biting only for a smaller negligible share of the population.Footnote 2 The hypothesis is tested with a difference-in-difference approach to panel data so as to isolate a causal relation between EMU-induced financial integration and external imbalances. Our perspective is equally useful to understand the reversal of current account deficits. The crisis and the ensuing credit constraints forced deleveraging on the same portion of the population that got indebted in the first place and that had no alternative but to restrain consumption considering that lower-income (unskilled) workers were the first to be pulled out of the labour market and hardly had financial buffers. There is indeed suggestive evidence that there is something about external positions and income distribution starting with the 1990s. Figure 1 shows the relation between the current account in proportion to GDP and income inequality for a group of EA countries including early members plus Greece. Income inequality is captured by the Gini coefficient, which measures the distance in income between two random income groups in the population. Values are taken from Solt (2009), who provides a standardised indicator so as to allow cross-country comparability. The time frame from 1980 to 2015 is divided in two sub-periods, one before EMU-induced financial integration from 1980 to 1998, and one after full financial integration from 1999 up to 2015. The year 1999 is chosen to indicate full financial integration because this is the time when exchange rate risks are eliminated, thereby enhancing capital mobility and therewith also downwards interest rate convergence. Starting income inequality is juxtaposed to the average current account position over each sub-period. The current account-inequality nexus becomes statistically significant and negative only under full financial integration. On the other hand, conditioning the relation between per capita income relative to the US and external positions on the expected level of financial integration does not deliver equally strong results arguably because mean per capita income does not allow exploiting moments in the distribution of income, which is what is expected to drive the results in our framework. Source: Own elaboration based on Ameco and Standardised World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). The sample includes all euro area countries that entered in the first wave (except Luxembourg) plus Greece Mean current account and initial inequality a before full financial integration (1980–1998) and b after full financial integration (1999–2015). The link between income inequality and current account positions is not new in the literature. Kumhof et al. (2012) have shown that greater inequality induces those that are negatively affected to borrow because of habit persistence, which also leads to the endogenous development of domestic credit markets. With increasing openness to international capital markets as well, higher-income groups become intermediaries of foreign savings, something that allows them to significantly increase their consumption. Current account deficits are therewith generated. More similarly to what is done in the present paper, Al-Hussami and Remesal (2012) introduce heterogeneity in an inter-temporal consumption model and argue that rising inequality is associated with worse external positions because of the behaviour of low/middle-income groups, who borrow to emulate the consumption patterns of high-income groups. They further show that such an outcome is reinforced in countries with above-average levels of financial liberalization. Compared to them, we make a different point in that we explore the effects of EMU-induced financial integration for different income distributions, independently of the actual dynamics of inequality. This paper contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, while building on the idea that current account deficits in the periphery reflect capital inflows financing households that try to maximize consumption inter-temporally as, for example, in Blanchard and Giavazzi (2002) and Fagan and Gaspar (2007a, b), we depart from a representative-agent framework by assuming that desired private indebtedness varies depending on initial levels of income, being mostly concentrated at the lower end of the income distribution once collateral constraints get relaxed. This explains why, under EMU, more unequal countries that had a higher share of lower-income groups had also worse external positions than the others. Second, differently from both Kumhof et al. (2012) and Al-Hussami and Remesal (2012), we are not concerned with the dynamic relation between income inequality and external positions, but with the impact of financial integration for different income distributions. Third, we stress the role of forward-looking expectations in driving inter-temporal consumption rather than habit persistence and/or the desire to emulate wealthier groups. Finally, an additional feature of our framework is that we use the EMU process to represent an exogenous shock in credit supply differently from, for example, Kumhof et al. (2012), where liquid credit markets emerge endogenously from inequality dynamics. We are thus justified in using a difference-in-difference estimation technique, which together with other elements in the specification minimises the problem of the endogeneity that may well exist between financial integration and income inequality.Footnote 3
 The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on macroeconomic imbalances. Section 3 presents stylized facts. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy and the results. Section 5 concludes.",5

According to the Commission’s communication regions suffering from structural weaknesses which limit their competitiveness and prevent them from contributing fully to sustainable economic growth in the EU tend to be those which suffer from structural problems. Development problems are more acute in lagging regions which lack the necessary infrastructure to be able to compete on equitable terms with other regions of the Union.Footnote 1 In this respect, the Regional Policy of the European Commission has set up financial tools with the aim of reducing regional disparities: the structural funds and the cohesion fund. ERDF is the most intensively used policy tool set up by the EU included in the structural funds to enhance the speed up of the process of convergence between European regions as well as social development. This fund was introduced to overarching objectives and priorities in various areas. In particular, one particular area absorbed the bulk of funding (EC 2011): the environment and more specifically the waste management sector (total EUR 6.11bn in ERDF funding allocated by the Member States).Footnote 2
 The sector is regulated by The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) which sets out the basic principles for waste management across the EU, such as the “waste hierarchy”. The waste hierarchy has an order of priorities for waste management with the preferred option of waste prevention, followed by re-use and recycling (EC 2010). Given that the vast majority of investments addressing these priorities are heavy infrastructure investments into waste management systems, the paper concentrates its efforts on the ERDF tool, as it provide nearly all the environmental infrastructures on recycling funding from the EU budget under the respect of the environmental legislation.Footnote 3
 In addition to EU legislation, the planning requirements of the recycling framework has led to the production of national waste management strategies. EU Regional Policy shows, in fact, that the main aim of Italian waste policy, in accordance with international objectives, is the achievement of a sustainable system based on the EU integrated waste strategy (APAT 2007). The waste management sector in Italy in the programming period 2007–2013 is in a period of major change and still far from a consolidation at an industrial level. Various factors highlight the gap between Italian and European regions; unsophisticated management structures, both for dimension and territorial and industrial integration (dwarfism of the offer structure); lack of suitable facilities, both in terms of number and average size of facilities; low productivity of collection services, mainly due to the exceptionally small sizes of the businesses in Southern regions. On the other hand, there are examples of noteworthy efficiency, especially in the North, which show how the country appears divided, the northern regions being able to keep up with the best European examples.Footnote 4
 Italy, in fact, may be categorized under two waste generation and management “groupings”, according to its regional strategy of modernizing or building waste facilities. The first group comprises the Northern regions with high levels waste generation and recycling (EEA 2013; Mazzanti et al. 2006) eligible under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective. The second group includes the Southern regions with low recycling rates and poor infrastructures of waste management eligible under convergence objective.Footnote 5
 In this regard, municipal waste requires largest infrastructure developments,Footnote 6 notably for the expansion of recycling capacities, composting and sorting plants and several initiatives have affected the development of EC regulations intended to harmonise environmental policy in Europe by creating common perceptions, standards and responsibilities for the Member States. Thus regional operational programmes (OPs) for the convergence regions were included, properly, as major ERDF-funded infrastructure projects managed at regional level.Footnote 7
 In conclusion, with the European Regional Development Fund Regulation No. 1080/2006 the Union invested in ItalyFootnote 8 and across all of Europe’s regions to allow the Convergence regions affected to catch up with the EU’s more prosperous regions and Italy has been a unique national example of the use of explicit incentives to improve the performance of regional development in the southern area of greatest needFootnote 9 (OECD 2009). However, although the regulation and the scope of EU Cohesion Policy, ERDF has undergone many implications. Since most of the convergence regions that benefit of this fund are the ones with a low institutional quality, the European Commission decided that in order to receive financial assistance from the EU Funds, the Member States are obligated to co-finance their regional projects, meaning that all the supporting payments from the EU are granted on specific conditions. This implies that the country’s institutional capacity to distribute, invest and absorb the EU grants efficiently has become an essential determinant of European cohesion process and has attracted different considerations. A wide variety of literature is trying to answer a question how effective ERFD are in speeding up the process of convergence in different priorities of interest as in our case the environment, another piece of debate emphasize that only for countries with “right” institutions any fund is effective, what suggests that institutional quality is a key-pillar for regional and cohesion policy effectiveness as well. In this light, we consider that the impact of “untraditional” institutional variables on effectiveness of the EU Structural Funds is not to be neglected and therefore needs to be examined in more detail. While, the European Commission, in fact, does not have the general power to enforce European waste law directly in the Member States. Member States have the discretion, the duty and in theory should have the means to implement waste funds ensuring their effectiveness on national or regional/local level (BIO intelligence Service 2011) but sometimes the waste management structures are inadequateFootnote 10 and criminal activities counteracting the implementation of the funds. This might not only, consequently, lead to an inefficient use of EU budget, but also have the adverse effect on the process of convergence. This is why the aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the ERDF in the programming period 2007–2013 and analyze the efficiency of absorptionFootnote 11 EU funds assistance in separate collection process matched with the quality of public institutions in Italy. This goal is to be reached in two ways: first, our econometric analysis verifies the existence of common trends prior to the Regulation (EC) No. 1080/2006 between the two groups of regions considered. The existence of a common trends is essential for the estimation of the frontier function as well as specified by equation; secondly it illustrates the stochastic frontier analysis results putting the emphasis on the efficiency scores analysis. The paper is structured as follow. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature presenting evidence on ERDF on separate collection projects in Italy highlighting the need to intensify research in this environmental priority and the role played by institutions in fostering appraisal environmental actions. Section 3 reviews the methodology by a stochastic frontier approach, Sect. 4 presents the data used and shows the econometric analysis with a fourfold aim. Section 5 propose a significant contribution to the understanding that the effectiveness of public policies on recycling is related to institutional quality with emphasis on the efficiency score analysis. Section 6 makes the conclusions.",12

Perhaps the most common definition of corruption is provided by Rose-Ackerman (1975), who describes corruption as “the misuse of public office for private gain”. Furthermore, Wang and Rosenau (2001) see corruption as some kind of secret collaboration between public officials and subjects from the private sector, which is not consistent with the public interest. This collaboration is motivated by private financial gain. There is very little doubt about the negative consequences of corruption. Most studies clearly conclude that corruption has a negative impact on economic growth (Mauro 1995) as well as income equality (Gupta et al. 2002; Gyimah-Brempong 2002). Moreover, the problem of corruption is also often closely linked to the problems of the shadow economy and tax evasion. As reported by Buehn and Schneider (2009), there is a positive two-way relationship between the shadow economy and corruption. According to Hudson et al. (2012) corruption and the desire to avoid corrupt government officials are the key drivers of businesses into the informal economy. In light of these findings, the search for factors affecting corruption becomes increasingly important. Our research expands the findings in this area in several different ways. In the forthcoming section we provide a review of the literature dealing with the problem of corruption and its potential determinants. In further sections, we describe the methodology and data used in our model. We apply logit regressions based on data obtained from Eurobarometer in order to examine the potential individual and country-specific determinants of corruption. Considerable attention is also paid to the role of corruption tolerance and its potential determinants. We believe the tolerance of corruption to be one of the most important issues that needs to be faced in respect to the general problem of corruption.",17

 The European Union, more particularly the Euro-zone, has always been a “would be, maybe” federal union; and since the difficulties thrown up in the financial crisis of 2008, it has become a de facto emerging economic federation. However, the weak economic performance since the introduction of the Euro, and a poor performance since the debt crisis of 2008–2012 (most evident in the difficulty of getting out of that crisis), has revealed the EU to be an accidental and incomplete economic federal union. The real difficulty is that, despite much technical analysis and political advice on how specific policies should be designed, there is no conceptual framework to guide the policy making process and little coherence between the existing institutions in its implementation. Some forward thinking is needed here. In the delegation literature, principally that concerned with monetary policy and the design of central bank operating procedures, a distinction derived from principal-agent models is drawn between instrument independence vs. target independence. Under the former, regional decision makers act as agents for the federal government and have no responsibility beyond being held accountable for having reached the criteria that others have set for them as efficiently as possible and at least cost—without wasting resources, creating additional uncertainties, or absconding with the money. They have no responsibility for designing those criteria; or for considering whether they are the best criteria or best policy priorities; or for whether the policymakers in question have been allocated the most effective policy instruments to do the job. Agents under instrument independence have the freedom to use their policy instruments as they see fit and are held accountable for having done so in the most efficient manner as defined by pre-assigned criteria. But they are not responsible for the overall performance of their economy or the federal economy of which it is a part, or for spill-overs imposed on others, or whether the criteria are consistent. In the absence of explicit coordination, a coincidence of preferences and a detailed knowledge of the region’s exact circumstances at the federal level, those criteria will not achieve the best performance. Target independence is different. Here the regional policymakers set both the criteria and the priorities for good performance, and pick instrument values so as to produce the best outcomes for themselves within the wider economy, taking into account local conditions, preferences and spill-overs. There is still a coordination problem if there are conflicts between regional optimality and optimality at the union level. But that is true for a fully independent economy too. Some safeguards may need to be inserted to ensure that we all benefit from the spill-overs from a better performing federal economy and better outcomes in national economies. In this case, regional policymakers are held accountable for their instrument settings and for the performance of their own economy. And they have the capacity to create better outcomes because they can make a wider set of choices in a problem which is otherwise the same as instrument independence. The distinction between instrument independence and target independence is a useful way to demarcate the differences between systems with full autonomy, and those with partial autonomy but otherwise dependent on grants, assigned tax revenues, or shares of domestic taxes. Examples of the former, with target independence and extensive autonomy include the US, Canada, and some Spanish and Italian regions; examples of the latter are Australia and Germany who redistribute regional revenues through a grants commission and the Finanzausgleich process respectively.Footnote 2
 Any government faces the challenge of supporting economic activity in the face of constrained public finances. In the Euro zone, this creates a debate over how much autonomy nation states should have to address the problems which they face, vs. the problems the union faces (recognising that gains in union performance improve national outcomes, but only imperfectly. It is not a one-for-one replacement). This forces us to distinguish between funding mechanisms in which policy makers are held accountable for raising and spending a defined stream of money on pre-specified objectives, vs. regimes which give national parliaments the capacity and responsibility to raise and spend the sums of money that they think would most improve economic performance and the standard of living of its citizens. Our argument is developed along three lines. First, after setting out the fiscal federalism framework within which the argument is set, we offer a critique of the rules for a partial devolution (usually restricted to income and sales taxes with restricted borrowing powers). Second, we review a model of fiscal federalism where comprehensive powers over taxes and spending are devolved, but are constrained to remain consistent within the macroeconomic framework and constitutional integrity of a Federal Union. Third, and most important in the current state of the debate, we emphasise that coordinating fiscal policies, possibly through a unified budget, is only one theme. It is more important in practice to ensure a proper coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, to make sure that they are used consistently in support of one another. To this end, I introduce the idea of GDP bonds to make that coordination automatic and to make each policy more effective than when acting alone. This adds an element of automatic, but reversible, “monetary federalism”. The purpose of this rather formal approach is to make clear the key implications: There has to be a central budget of sufficient size, alongside national budgets decided on by national policymakers. This is necessary to ensure that any federalism effects are “by design”, not by default as happens in highly centralised systems, such as France or the UK. It also gives the national governments ownership and a direct input via their own fiscal choices. Policymakers must decide on the degree of federalism; that is, how large the devolved taxes and spending should be in proportion to union-wide income. This is to prevent the union budget and federalist effects becoming too small to be effective or to be redistributed in the wrong places. But there is no need to have a central (federal) finance minister in charge. The redistributions are automatic; they do not need parliamentary approval each time they occur. However, it would be helpful to have a joint oversight council to monitor that the system is running smoothly, is consistent with our objectives, and that unreasonable spillovers are not being imposed on individual participants. By manipulating the balance between vertical and horizontal transfers (see below), it is possible to control who bears the costs of running the system.",3

In this paper, we investigate the situation in which the delegation parameter of the public firm is determined by maximizing social welfare, whereas the sales delegation parameter of the private firm as in Fershtman and Judd (1987), Sklivas (1987), and Vickers (1985) is determined through bargaining between its owner and manager à la Binmore et al. (1986). In the context of a mixed oligopoly, the endogenous selection problem of strategic contracts has been extensively investigated recently.Footnote 1 Matsumura and Ogawa (2012) first considered the endogenous determination of strategic contracts by public and private firms in an entrepreneurial mixed duopoly. They showed that only price competition, that is, the p–p game, can become the equilibrium market structure, irrespective of the relationship between the firms’ goods under the pure strategic contract class.Footnote 2 More recently, Chirco et al. (2014) showed that no equilibrium market structure exists in a mixed duopoly with a sales delegation under the existence the managers in public and private firms. Assuming bargaining over the sales delegation within the private firm, Nakamura (2015b) assessed the robustness of the result obtained in Chirco et al. (2014) by introducing the relative bargaining power of the private firm’s manager to that of her owner à la Van Witteloostuijn et al. (2007).Footnote 3 Nakamura (2015b) resolved the impossibility result obtained in Chirco et al. (2014) when the relative bargaining power of the manager to that of the owner within the private firm is sufficiently high. More precisely, when the manager’s bargaining power is sufficiently high, Nakamura (2015b) used the p–q game to show that the strategic contract of the public (private) firm being a price contract (quantity contract) can become the unique equilibrium market structure. Then, we confirm the robustness of the results on the endogenous selection problem of strategic contracts by the owners of the public firm and the private firm wherein both adopt sales delegation contracts, as considered in Nakamura (2015b), against the case wherein the weighted sum of social welfare and quantity is adopted by the public firm as a strategic contract in the fashion of Heywood and Ye (2009).Footnote 4
 In this paper, we first showed that when the relative bargaining power of the manager to that of the owner within the private firm is sufficiently low (near zero), no equilibrium market structure exists under the pure strategic contract class, similar to Chirco et al. (2014) and Nakamura (2015b). Note that provided that the strategic contract of the rival firm is fixed, the optimal strategic contract of each firm is different from that in Chirco et al. (2014) and Nakamura (2015b).Footnote 5 Furthermore, when the relative bargaining power of the manager to that of the owner within the private firm is moderate, the market structure wherein the strategic contract of the public (private) firm is a quantity contract (price contract) becomes the unique equilibrium market structure. This result is explained by the fact that here only the owner of the private firm changes his strategic contract from a quantity contract to a price contract if the strategic contract of the public firm is a quantity contract. Further, in such a case, as long as the strategic contract of the public firm is a quantity contract, the owner of the private firm chooses a price contract to loosen market competition by seeking a higher price, implying that the q–p game wherein the strategic contract of the public (private) firm is a quantity contract (price contract) can become the unique equilibrium market structure.Footnote 6 Moreover, as the relative bargaining power of the manager to that of the owner within the private firm becomes sufficiently high, the public firm also changes its optimal contract when the strategic contract of the private firm is a price contract. More concretely, since market competition is sufficiently intense in both the q–p game and the p–p game, the ranking of social welfare between the q–p game and the p–p game is determined not by the ranking order of the quantities of both firms 0 and 1 but by the ranking order of their prices between the q–p game and the p–p game.Footnote 7 As a consequence, the owner of public firm 0 changes his optimal strategic contract from a price contract to a quantity contract if the strategic contract of the private firm is a price contract when the relative bargaining power of the manager to that of the owner within the private firm is sufficiently high. This yields the result wherein the p–p game can become the unique equilibrium market structure.Footnote 8
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we formulate a mixed duopolistic model with differentiated goods to investigate the endogenous selection of strategic contracts by the owners of both public and private firms. In Sect. 3, we derive several market outcomes in the four games, which are classified on the basis of the strategic contracts chosen by the firms’ owners. Then, we induce the equilibrium market structure (s) as a consequence of the selection of strategic contracts by the owners. We state several similar and different points obtained between this paper and Nakamura (2015b). Section 4 concludes with a number of remarks. In the ""Appendix"", we present the process of deriving the market outcomes, except for the owners’ payoffs in the four games.Footnote 9

34,2,Economia Politica,23 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-017-0061-7,"Informal state–business connections, institutions, and economic growth",August 2017,Mohamed Ismail Sabry,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In today’s world, the two extremes of (communist) socialist central planning and laissez-faire are tales of the past. Continuous interactions between government officials and businesspeople in market transactions are inevitable, opening the way for state–business cooperation and, consequently, various forms of state–business relations (SBR). At the heart of these relations are connections and networks that are expected to evolve as a result of repeated countless interactions and transactions between both parties. While it is easy to envision that both parties will benefit from these relations, it is rather more difficult to predict the effect of these relations on society. It is believed that collaboration between the government and businesspeople can compensate for the deficiencies of each party. It can provide a way to overcome business failures, such as coordination externalities and the need for public inputs (Hausmann et al. 2008), as well as to overcome government failures such as imperfect information and foresight (Hausmann and Rodrik 2003). The result should be better economic outcomes. This is what the literature on developmental states and good governance suggests in one way or another. Nevertheless, the literature on rent seeking presents a totally different perspective. As argued by Olson (1982), in their search for distributional gains, interest groups such as businesspeople pressure the government and influence its policies and regulations. This ultimately leads to a loss of efficiency and lower economic growth. The impressive economic growth of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the aftermath of the Second World War arguably owes much to the devastation of their interest groups during the war. Choi and Thum (2007)—among many others—reinforce this claim empirically (Mueller 2003, 554–558). Another point to consider is the difference between formal and informal SBR. While formal SBR (represented, for instance, by public–private dialogues, PPD) are now widely acknowledged by major international institutions such as the World Bank (WB) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to lead to positive economic outcomes,Footnote 1 there is considerable doubt that this is the case for informal SBR. Informal SBR based on uninstitutionalized personal relations provide a means for connected businessmen to gain privileged access to public resources, regardless of efficiency. With this being the case, the positive effect of informal SBR on growth is questionable and interesting to explore. Even though they are not the ideal form of SBR, informal SBR are arguably a core component of SBR, if not the most common form. Not every country is able, or in fact willing, to successfully institutionalize and formalize its informal SBR.Footnote 2 The economic outcomes of informal SBR (just like SBR in general) seem to depend on the institutional and economic settings present in each country. A classic example is the Cold War economic miracle of South Korea, with its unique experience characterized by close SBR with an informal SBR component. This example has long inspired the literature on developmental states. With German civil legal origins, authoritarian rule until the 1980s, high levels of cronyism and corruption, Buddhist culture and low ethnic fractionalization, close informal SBR (among other forms of SBR) led Korea to higher rates of economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s. However, the outcomes were different in Sub-Saharan African countries. Many of the post-colonial ruling military juntas empowered businessmen who shared the same ethnic or clan origins,Footnote 3 resulting in close informal SBR based on bonds of blood and clan. They suppressed political opposition, had high levels of corruption and cronyism, inherited and adopted the French legal system, and had high levels of ethnic fractionalization. The outcome was barely satisfactory economic growth levels (Rock and Bonnett 2004), causing the region to become one of the poorest worldwide. The difficulty associated with identifying which and how various factors are responsible for the economic growth resulting from informal SBR poses a challenge to academic research. This paper is an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of informal SBR on economic growth while accounting for institutional settings. Informal SBR are addressed by considering them to be aggregations of informal networks or informal state–business networks (SBN). These networks are analyzed based on the types of connections that bind their constituent members. The paper focuses on informal SBN based on what could be termed social and political connections (SPC): familial, tribal, common political party membership, and other similar connections that bind government officials and businessmen. Based on the understanding that SPC interact with various institutional factors in each country, this paper accounts for the interactions between relevant institutional factors and SPC. The effects of these interactions on economic growth are then examined both theoretically and empirically. Thus, this paper attempts to answer two questions. The first is: which institutions—specifically governance institutions—help SPC to realize higher levels of economic growth? The second is: can SPC correct the institutional deficiencies of some institutions and lead to better economic outcomes? To answer the first question, the possible effects of the interactions of SPC with the rule of law, regulatory quality, voice and accountability, control of corruption, government effectiveness, and bureaucratic quality (independence) on economic growth are discussed theoretically and examined empirically. To address the second question, the interaction terms of SPC with some of the institutions that are suggested in the literature to have negative effects on economic growth (hierarchical cultures, ethnic fractionalization, and the French legal system) are examined to determine whether SPC are able to correct their effects. This paper is a novel attempt to understand informal SBR while accounting for other institutional factors, both theoretically and empirically. It reveals that changing the institutional setting in which the SPC operate can lead to different economic outcomes, and that pervasive SPC can correct for or worsen the effects of certain institutional factors. The approach used here differs from that used in a growing body of literature such as Sen and te Velde (2009) and Leftwich (2009), which evaluate SBR based on their “effectiveness.” This paper instead takes a judgment-free (positive) approach that focuses on networks and the prevalence of connections as criteria for determining the intensity of SBR. It then assumes that the effect of SPC is dependent on the institutions in which the SPC are operating. It should be noted that the effects of the interactions between SPC and various institutions on economic performance have only rarely been explored empirically in the existing literature on SBR, meaning that this paper is among the first to address this issue. The next section starts with a discussion of SPC as a form of informal SBR and SBN, and the effect of SPC on growth. The effects of the interactions of the studied institutions with SPC on economic growth are then explored theoretically. This is followed by a methodological section that highlights an OLS cross-sectional regression model which is used to examine the arguments of the theoretical section. After that is a section providing the results and a discussion that brings together the theoretical reasoning and empirical findings. The paper ends with a conclusion that sums up the findings of this work, presents policy recommendations, and points out limitations of this research.",6

34,2,Economia Politica,05 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-016-0043-1,Joint liability taxation and group auditing,August 2017,Francesco Reito,Salvatore Spagano,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, we propose an alternative form of taxation policy based on joint liability among taxpayers, and a tax return investigation that we call group auditing. We build our analysis on the classic principal-agent framework of Allingham and Sandmo (1972), and consider a very simple one-period economy with a benevolent government and a large number of taxpayers. At the end of the period, taxpayers can obtain either a positive income or nothing. There are two types of taxpayers with different probabilities of obtaining the income, and this results in an asymmetric-information problem: while taxpayers know each other’s quality, the government knows only the distribution of types in the population. In addition to hidden information, we assume that taxpayers with positive income may decide to be either honest and pay the due amount of taxes or dishonest and try to evade their payments. The government can implement one of two taxation policies: (1) individual liability taxation, i.e. the standard taxation of individual taxpayers; (2) joint liability taxation, which works as follows. The government asks taxpayers to form groups of two, in which both members are jointly responsible for each other’s tax liability. In the event one member obtains no income or evades the payment, the one with positive income must pay both the individual and an additional joint liability sum. If the joint liability policy is introduced, the government can choose between two audit systems: (2a) individual auditing of each taxpayer if the income reported is lower than a minimum threshold; (2b) group auditing, whereby, if only one of the two group members reports zero income, no audit will take place since one taxpayer will pay for both. If, instead, both taxpayers report zero income, the government will audit, initially, one member of the group. Such a taxpayer can be either dishonest or honest. If dishonest, the taxpayer will be forced to pay for the whole group liability (individual and joint tax). If honest, the government will subsequently audit the other group member. As a result, auditing will take place only when both group members report zero income. The main result of the paper is that, under both joint liability and group auditing, the tax burden is lowered for taxpayers, and the government can achieve a Pareto improvement over standard individual taxation. The reason is that group auditing is performed less frequently than individual auditing, and thus it is less expensive for the government. This reduction in public costs can then result in a reduction of the tax burden if the government follows a balanced budget constraint, and this may generate room for a Pareto improvement. In more detail, we will show that, for joint liability taxation to be Pareto efficient, the equilibrium structure is such that only taxpayers with high probability of obtaining their income are subjected to group taxation, whereas taxpayers with low probability are taxed individually. The joint liability taxation we propose must be considered as a thought-provoking policy, and indeed it may appear at first glance to be unrealistic and unconventional (for the fact that each member of the group is responsible for the aggregate tax liability). But, in the model we show that group auditing is always less costly to implement than individual auditing, and that it may lead to an increase in the expected payoff of taxpayers. Therefore, the policy can be seen as a voluntary and non-coercive instrument that can be implemented only if it results from a fully democratic process. This is in line with the conclusions of Mankiw and Weinzierl (2010), who point out how people may feel at first uncomfortable with a provocative policy proposal, such as a tax on the height of individuals reducing the utility of the tall for the short, but then more favourable if the intervention can generate a Pareto efficient outcome.Footnote 1
 In theory, the mechanism of joint taxation can be applied to any group of taxpayers, families, firms or simply individuals who know each other’s characteristics and produce a similar expected profit/income (for example, doctors, lawyers and other professionals). One can easily imagine a way to implement the policy. For instance, consider two doctors in private practice who are given the opportunity by the government to choose between two alternative tax structures. They can either pay their taxes individually, or form a group of two taxpayers in which both are jointly liable for the overall tax burden. Doctors can be familiar with each other, but not enough to verify the true final return of their peers (a typical situation for professionals of the same field). If both report positive income, each one will enjoy a reduction in the amount of individual taxes due, whereas, if one group member reports zero income, the other will pay for both.Footnote 2 Take as a practical example the case of Italy. It is interesting to note that doctors in private practice reported in 2012 an annual average income of about 30,000 euro before tax, much lower than a first-year assistant professor (ricercatore), or than small artisans. The percentage of tax evaders among doctors has increased from 25.5 to 34 % between 2004 and 2012, for the recent increase in anti-tax evasion measures.Footnote 3 Probably, in Italy, doctors would benefit from a different incentive-compatible tax policy. However, the joint liability system may seem to have a more direct application to developing economies, where tax administration still remains one of the main obstacles to modernization and economic growth. Bahl and Bird (2008) report that the gap between industrialized and developing economies in the average tax ratio on gross domestic product has fairly remained constant in the last decades. The tax ratio in richer countries is now about twice the ratio in developing countries, which are constrained to a level of taxation of nearly 17 % of GDP (for very poor countries the ratio may be even lower, with an average of about 10–12 %).Footnote 4
 Given that the problems of raising adequate tax revenues (as weak enforcement incentives, imperfect information and income-hiding strategies) are in part similar to those faced by microfinance institutions in providing financial services to small borrowers, this paper can be related to the strand of literature on group lending and joint liability contracts. Group lending is a lending arrangement whereby a microcredit bank requires borrowers to form a group in which all members are jointly liable if some of them do not repay their individual loans. The key feature of joint liability is that it serves as implicit collateral for very poor borrowers, and thus can help mitigating the problems of enforcement, monitoring or information asymmetry commonly faced by lenders (see for some of the first theoretical contributions, Stiglitz 1990; Varian 1990). In particular, the model analyzed in the paper is similar to the works on endogenous group matching under asymmetric information by Armendariz de Aghion and Gollier (2000), and Ghatak (2000). In Armendariz de Aghion and Gollier (2000), group lending can lead to a reduction in the cost of auditing for the lender, and solve credit rationing for creditworthy borrowers. Ghatak (2000) comes to a similar conclusion, and in addition he shows that potential micro-borrowers always sort themselves into homogeneous risk-type groups. The reason is that low-risk borrowers would never find it profitable to match with high-risk types, even if ex-post side transfers between group members are possible (a result known as “positive assortative matching” in microfinance). We believe that, if joint liability has proven to work well in the credit market (e.g. in group lending and credit guarantee associations), then it may have some practical relevance in the context of anti-tax evasion policies. The model analyzed in this paper is also close to the taxation games in Falkinger and Walter (1991), and Boadway et al. (2002). In Falkinger and Walter (1991), the authors propose a policy intervention that leads to self-selection of taxpayers into different tax groups. Taxpayers face a trade-off between the probability of not being audited and the amount of the sanction so that, in equilibrium, individuals who are likely to evade large taxes, “big fishes”, are separated from those who evade lower amounts, “small fishes”. Unlike Falkinger and Walter (1991), in our paper, taxpayers can be separated into groups on the basis of different levels of individual and joint liability tax levels. But, similarly, we show that the Pareto-efficient equilibrium tax configuration is such that taxpayers with high income probability (which can be assumed to be big fishes) are taxed in groups, and taxpayers with low income probability (small fishes) are taxed individually. Boadway et al. (2002) analyse a tax-evasion game where taxpayers, involved in the same market transaction, can cooperate to evade their tax payments. In contrast, we choose not to analyse the potential collusive behaviour of taxpayers (although we will briefly consider the possibility of collusion-proof equilibria), and focus our discussion on public audit expenditure and welfare analysis.Footnote 5 Other papers analyse the effect of joint taxation on the most elementary tax group, the family. Boskin and Sheshinski (1983), for example, argue that a joint household taxation is generally not Pareto efficient. The reason is that, if the labour supply elasticities of the two spouses-earners are different, optimality is achieved when they receive different tax treatments, while the tax distortionary effect would be higher under joint taxation. Similarly, Apps and Rees (1999) show that, even if household members have different marginal productivities of labour, individually targeted tax levels can be more efficient. Piggott and Whalley (1996) and Kleven and Kreiner (2007), instead, consider goods and time as inputs of the household production function, and show that a shift from individual to joint taxation, under a general system of commodity and income taxation, can be welfare improving. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 builds up the model framework. Section 3 briefly describes the standard individual liability taxation. Section 4 introduces the joint liability policy. Section 5 shows the welfare consequences of implementing the group auditing system. Section 6 concludes.",1

Let me start from a point of reflection on the consequences of the crisis. The global economy seems to be exiting the deep crisis, which has generated deep scars and these scars still have to be addressed. But it also has generated a permanent slipover over the policy debate. There is wide spread skepticism among citizens with respect to policy making, policy makers and policy institutions because of their apparent inability to deal with challenges such as poor state of the economy, large unemployment, loss of welfare, increasing inequalities. This state of dissatisfaction feeds on a demand for change. The problem is that this demand for change takes often the culture of rejection, culture of denial, convictions, beliefs, expectations and opinions are translated into solutions that are hardly based on sound assessment and analysis. This of course has possible negative implications for governments and I would also say for democracy. Policy makers need the scientific community to provide best efforts to improve the quality of the public debate, about the economy, about healthcare, about the environment, as you are doing now. It is important, I would say imperative, to prevent decision making to be made on uninformed beliefs, emotions and denial. So again, the contribution you are producing to the G7 debate, of which this year Italy holds the Presidency, is extremely welcomed and timely. Your three statements are all very relevant and on behalf of the Government let me thank you again for this effort, let me thank again the Accademia dei Lincei and Alberto Quadrio-Curzio for his own personal effort.",

Since then, the world economy has witnessed the economic upturn of most emerging economies, which has brought about massive increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Most developed countries have often played leadership roles in GHG abatement strategies, with Northern European countries standing first in this ranking (Mazzanti and Musolesi 2013). On this basis, the EU launched a new binding target for 2030 in January 2014 to cut emissions by about 40% with respect to 1990 levels (the EU Kyoto target was a cut of 8%). In 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), was organized in Paris. Though a success to some extent—namely, the recognition of the necessity of stabilizing temperatures below a defined threshold—the conference did not generate a setting for a globally coordinated environmental policy agenda. Financially speaking, countries should contribute to the funding of a Global Carbon Fund, eventually through ecological tax revenues (Ekins and Speck 2011; European Environment Agency 2016). As far as strict environmental policy implementation is concerned, countries are free to choose their most desirable implementations at national and regional levels, without having to pursue specific targets (as in the Kyoto era). There thus remains a strong necessity to learn from the past to develop future targets and international agreements, even more so within a setting where the actions of individual countries/regions, rather than ‘global protocols’, play a primary role. 
Musolesi and Mazzanti (2014) recently analyzed various groups of advanced countries within the OECD area. In particular, they focused on the ‘Umbrella group’ (Barrett 2003 for a definition of the group, which is essentially formed of countries that have historically placed mild/low policy emphasis on climate change) comprising North America, Japan, and Oceania; Northern Europe (NE); and Southern Europe (SE) and concluded that nonlinear time effects weigh more than income in driving carbon emissions. These time-related factors explain the reduction of CO2 levels in Northern Europe, where a bell-shaped carbon–income relationship is observed only for the Scandinavian countries. This evidence highlights the fallacy of simplistic environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) interpretations (Harbaugh et al. 2002; Brock and Taylor 2010) and necessitates further investigations of specific time-related events. Indeed, separating income and time effects by using a smoothing nonparametric approach is useful for capturing complex nonlinear dynamics; however, the specific time events that had (eventually abrupt) effects on emissions trends remain unexplored. The paper touches on a new strand of literature, which analyzes the long-run relationship between the economy and the environment (here, economic development—CO2) and assesses the possible variables’ stationarity around a deterministic nonlinear trend (Bierens 1997)—which generalizes the idea that a time series can be stationary around a breaking deterministic linear trend, as in Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Perron (1989)—while most of the previous studies assume that the variables are first-order integrated processes (e.g., Perman and Stern 2003). Then, by using an interrupted time series approach (Box and Tiao 1975; Pankratz 1991), this paper investigates the impact of temporal structural breaks on the above-mentioned groups of advanced countries. Currently, these countries play a leadership role in GHG reduction proposals, although with heterogeneous targets and policy approaches. Reactions to historical shocks, such as major policy events, oil price shocks and (correlated) wars (Hamilton 2003), may strongly differ between such groups and, in turn, may heterogeneously affect emissions (Almer and Winkler 2017; Hamilton 2003). Panopolou and Pantelidis (2009) show that the oil crisis affected carbon ‘club’ convergence in per capita carbon emissions. Their study on clubs and structural similarity over time shows that while convergence at the global level, among all countries, was significant in 1960–1985, it was not significant in 1975–2003. The present paper primarily focuses on a key historical well-known policy event, i.e., the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Environment and Development that was held in Rio (henceforth denoted as 92RC in comments and tables), and also consider other unknown time breaks that might have shaped the possibly nonlinear long-run carbon–development relationship. In principle, there is almost an infinity of ways to model structural breaks. They may differ with respect to their duration (transitory or permanent), their onset (gradual or abrupt) and may take many alternative shapes. We detect the time and the pattern of these breaks using the the methods described by de Jong and Penzer (1998). This allows the detection of different types of breaks, which are modeled, for example, by combining a step or a pulse function with alternative transfer functions (see, e.g., Box and Tiao 1975; Perron 2006).",4
34,3,Economia Politica,29 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-017-0060-8,Environmental tax reform and the potential implications of tax base erosions in the context of emission reduction targets and demographic change,December 2017,Stefan Speck,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since more than two decades the call for the widespread application of market-based instruments for environmental policy has never fallen silent, in particular from international organisation, such. World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission (Fay et al. 2015; IMF 2012; OECD 2010, 2013; EC 2014). The reasons for this demand are still valid today: ‘Environmental taxation are an efficient market-based instrument to achieve environment policy objectives while supporting growth-friendly budget consolidation (EC 2015b)’, i.e. environmental as well as economic and fiscal benefits can be achieved simultaneously. In the same context it is also worthwhile to reiterate that the concept of shifting the tax burden from labour to environmental taxation as a means to support sustainable growth and fiscal consolidation still attracts attention, as societies have become increasingly aware of the systemic links between environmental problems and the need to formulate coherent, integrated policy responses. This recognition is today reflected at all levels of EU policy, as articulated by the European Commission (EC): The structure of tax systems, and particularly the shifting of the tax base from labour to other sources, is an essential aspect of on-going reforms. A priority for many Member States is to alleviate labour taxation in order to increase incentives to work and to reduce the relatively high cost of labour, in particular for low-skilled workers …. More generally, progress can still be made to reduce the overall tax burden and/or to make the tax system more efficient and less distortive. (…) Some recommendations thus focus on (…) removing environmentally-harmful subsidies and on further shifting the tax base away from labour to taxation which is less detrimental to growth such as environmental or recurrent property taxes (EC 2014). On the revenue side, it is important to ensure an efficient and growth-friendly tax system. Employment and growth can be stimulated by shifting the tax burden away from labour towards other types of taxes which are less detrimental to growth, such as recurrent property, environment and consumption taxes, taking into account the potential distributional impact of such a shift (EC 2015c). It is worthwhile to highlight that revenues generated from these types of taxes amounted to 2.5% of GDP at EU-28 level. However, the trend is different as the share of property tax revenues to GDP increased from 2.1% in 2005 to 2.5% in 2014 and on the contrary the share of environmental tax revenues remained constant during this period. Only two EU Member States reported an increase in the share of both taxes, namely Greece and Italy. Tax-shifting programmes have been implemented in several EU member states as well as in countries outside of Europe in the past (Speck and Jilkova 2009; Sustainable Prosperity 2012). Carbon pricing either implemented in the form of carbon taxation schemes or via emission trading schemes is one of the tools for implementing such tax-shifting programmes. The concept of tax-shifting policies, i.e. environmental tax reform, is closely related with the double dividend hypothesis (Pearce 1991; Goulder 1994). The case behind this concept of that ETR can trigger off both improvements in environment (an environmental benefit) and in the economy, in particular by increasing employment given the reduction in the tax burden levied on labour (an economic/environment benefit—see for example Goulder 1994 and Ekins 1999). Proponents are claiming that both types of benefits can be achieved simultaneously as the current tax system entails severe distortions in the economy and that these distortions can be eased by recycling back the environmental tax revenues and thereby reduce the rates of some of these distortive taxes. On the contrary, opponents of the concept are contending these arguments stating that this discussion is too simplistic ignoring important links within the existing tax system which can be the source of deadweight losses related to the labour market (Goulder 1994; Bovenberg and Goulder 1994; Parry and Oates 2000; Fullerton et al. 2008). Theoretical and empirical findings indicate that a double dividend, i.e. both a reduction in CO2 emissions (environmental sustainability) and improvements in the labour market (job growth and improved equity) are possible if policies are well-designed. Environmental tax reform has been implemented successfully in several European countries and around the world in the past three decades (Bach et al. 1994; Andersen and Ekins 2009; Sustainable Prosperity 2012). Furthermore, carbon pricing is regularly stated as a prerequisite for the transition towards a low carbon economy. But this can lead to a challenge of how to combine the priorities and objectives of environment/climate policy on the one hand and fiscal policy on the other in the medium- to long-run. In the context of the transition towards a low carbon the discussion of decarbonisation pathways is also relevant. Carbon pricing is one of the policy features discussed but other policies are also required for this transition process. Detailed discussions and strategies are presented for Germany (Hillebrandt et al. 2015), for the UK (Pye et al. 2015) and for Italy (Virdis et al. 2015).Footnote 1
 One of the challenges for environment and climate policies is their long-term perspective as compared with the relatively short-term challenges and requirements of economic and social policies, in particular with regard to employment policies, and guaranteeing fiscal sustainability. Policymakers therefore face a significant challenge in reconciling slightly abstract, long-term goals with political realities.

 Source: author based on Eurostat data (it should be kept in mind that this analysis is a snapshot of past developments meaning that the trend may differ when based on different and/or shorter time periods) GDP, tax revenues and employment in the EU-28 (2002–2014). The past development in environmental tax revenues differs between EU-28, Germany and Italy which are revealed in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. At the EU-28 level it is clearly visible that environmental tax revenues increased at the beginning of the 2000s but then remained constant following by a reduction. Since the economic and financial crisis of 2008/2009 the trend showed an increase. However, the increase in labour taxation was higher than the increase in environmental tax revenues over the whole time period stating that a shift from labour to environmental taxes did not materialise. Source: author based on Eurostat data GDP, tax revenues and employment in Germany (1995–2014). Source: author based on Eurostat data GDP, tax revenues and employment in Italy (1995–2014). The sharp increase in environmental revenues came along with the introduction of the environmental tax reform in Germany between 1999 and 2003 (Fig. 2). Since then environmental tax revenues declined. Interesting is the trend of labour taxation revenues as they closely followed the GDP growth until 2000 and also increased during the last years after a reduction between 2001 and 2005. Since 2005 the increase in labour tax revenues went along with an increase in employment. This almost parallel development paused since 2010 when the rise in labour tax revenues increased faster than the creation of new jobs. A different development was found in Italy as the revenues generated by labour taxes grew with a higher growth rate than GDP, environmental tax revenues as well as employment. Environmental tax revenues declined between 1995 and 2008 but increased considerably between 2008 and 2012. One of the reasons of this growth was the increase in tax rates levied on petrol and diesel.",7

Institutions represent the main pillar of the economic performance of a country (Acemoglu et al. 2001), and they help explaining cross-country differences in economic performance since economic policies influence human and physical capital accumulation, investment opportunities, international openness, as well as income redistribution, thus affecting economic growth (Hall and Jones 1999; Acemoglu et al. 2005). The topic has been investigated from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view, and emphasis has been put on two main relationships: the democracy-growth relationship and the political instability-growth relationship. Following Hirschman (1994), Feng (1997) and Gupta et al. (1998), three main positions emerge on the democracy-growth relationship. The first position—“the conflict school” (Feng 1997)—considers democracy as detrimental for the economic growth since it may slow growth if it comes premature—especially in developing countries—and because democratic regimes may be less able to implement valid growth policies than autocratic ones. A negative effect of democracy on economic growth is based on the idea that democratic governments undermine property rights to redistribute income to the majority of citizens and they tend to discourage investments in favour of current consumption in order to increase their chances of re-election (Keefer 2007). These effects become stronger in low-income countries characterised by a relatively recent transition towards democratic institutions, which tend to be weak and unstable (Kelsall and Booth 2013). The second position—“the compatibility school” (Feng 1997)—argues that democracy tends to enhance economic growth by allowing the exercise of civil, political and economic rights, as well as by guaranteeing property rights and market competition (van de Walle 2001). Moreover, democratic governments invest more in public goods and, in particular, they are more likely to sustain the formation of human capital, which is a fundamental input in the innovation process (Gupta et al. 1998; Baum and Lake 2003; Stasavage 2005). The third position—“the sceptical school” (Feng 1997)—underlines a negligible effect of democracy on economic growth stating that it is not democracy—or autocracy—per se which may enhance growth, but the institutional structure characterising a country, as well as its development strategies. Studies on the political instability-growth relationship have emphasised a negative effect of political instability on the (long-run) economic growth. This inverse relationship is based on the idea that political instability generates uncertainty across economic actors and with respect to the institutional environment, thus negatively affecting—domestic and foreign—investment decisions. Moreover, political instability may induce opportunistic behaviour in policymakers and it is likely to reduce their political horizons (Drazen 2000; Aisen and Veiga 2013). Empirical evidence on the effects of political instability on the economic growth tends to support this negative relationship, independently of the measure used to capture instability. Barro (1991) finds that the number of annual revolutions, coups de états and political assassinations have a negative effect on growth. Alesina et al. (1996) find that the propensity for a government to collapse has a negative effect on GDP per capita growth. Feng (1997) finds that the number of regime changes negatively affects growth. Gupta et al. (1998) find that the number of deaths in internal wars has a negative effect on the long-run growth. Jong-A-Pin (2009) investigates four dimensions of political instability, i.e. politically motivated violence, mass civil protest, instability within the political regime and instability of the political regime, finding that only the instability of the political regime has a significant negative effect on growth. Similar findings are provided also by Aisen and Veiga (2013). On the contrary, empirical evidence on the democracy-growth relationship is less conclusive: in fact, some empirical contributions find a positive effect of democracy on growth (e.g. Gupta et al. 1998; Kurzman et al. 2002; Barro 2003; Gerring et al. 2005), while others underline a negative (e.g. Barro 1996; Feng 1997; Yanikkaya 2003; Aisen and Veiga, 2013) or negligible effect (e.g. Alesina et al. 1996; Ramírez and Loboguerrero 2002) on growth rates. Kurzman et al. (2002) analyse 47 quantitative contributions finding a positive effect of democracy on growth in 19 works, a negative effect in 6 works and a negligible effect in 10 works. They find a mix of positive, negative and insignificant effects in all the other studies. Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu (2008) apply a meta-regression analysis on estimates from 81 empirical contributions: they do not find evidence of a negative effect of democracy on economic growth, while evidence of an indirect (positive) effect. This paper tries to contribute to this debate investigating the effects of democracy and political instability on the short-run GDP per capita growth, and focusing on the African experience. Specifically, institutional factors are captured through three variables: (1) an annual democracy index to proxy for the democracy level of a country, (2) a measure of legislature effectiveness to proxy for political and institutional quality and effectiveness and (3) the annual number of government crises occurred to proxy for political and regime instability. The analysis is conducted on a sample of 50 African countries observed over the period 1981–2001. Africa represents a relevant case study to analyse the relationship between institutions and economic growth, in particular in terms of democracy, efficiency of the political setting and regime instability. In fact, a weak institutional framework characterises many African countries, and the Sub-Saharan region has experienced the slowest economic growth in the world (Goldsmith 1998; Aron 2000). Empirical evidence suggests that the institutions–growth relationship tends to be particularly emphasised for African countries, whose growth patterns seem to be only partially explained by traditional economic and demographic determinants (Easterly and Levine 1997). On the one hand, many African countries have experienced a process of democratisation starting from the 1990s, with higher growth rates than in the previous decades (Herbst 2001; Bates et al. 2012). For example, Knutsen (2009), Bates et al. (2012) and Masaki and van de Walle (2014) find a positive effect of democracy on the economic performance in Sub-Saharan countries. On the other hand, political instability has characterised almost all African countries, and frequent and long-lasting political conflicts—both within a country and among countries—have shaped and undermined their growth processes since the 1960s (Easterly and Levine 1997; Fosu 2001; Seifu 2009). Empirical evidence suggests a strong and negative link between political instability and economic growth (e.g. Nkurunziza and Bates 2003; Gyimah-Brempong and Taynor 2005), while only few contributions suggest a positive relationship between instability and growth in the Sub-Saharan region (e.g. Fosu 2001). Moreover, empirical results suggest a positive relationship between institutional quality and economic performance in African countries (e.g. Ngeleza et al. 2011), as well as significant institutional spillovers occurring across neighbour countries (e.g. Easterly and Levine 1998). The empirical exercise employs spatial econometric models, besides standard panel data techniques, to analyse the determinants of the GDP growth. The idea is that countries do not operate as isolated units such that spatial interdependence across them exists and is likely to—positively or negatively—affect their economic growth processes. A Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) augmented to capture the temporal dynamic of the growth process is specified in order to analyse also institutional externalities from neighbour countries. The robustness of the results is tested using four different spatial weight matrices, and the standard geographic-based matrix is augmented to capture also non-geographic distances between countries. Specifically, the SDM is estimated using (1) a geographic-based matrix, (2) an institutional-based matrix considering the common legal origin of countries, (3) a cultural-based matrix considering similarities in the dominant religious beliefs and (4) an immigration-based matrix constructed using immigration flows between countries. The contribution of the paper to the existing growth literature is three-fold. First, it provides further insights on the institutions–growth relationship explicitly accounting for cross-country institutional spillovers, i.e. testing whether and how the neighbour countries’ institutional setting influences economic growth in the home country. To this aim, the methodological approach adopted extends previous contributions either employing non-spatial econometric techniques or employing spatial econometric techniques only able to partially capture spatial interactions, namely Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error Model (SEM) and Spatial Cross-regressive Model (SLXM).Footnote 1 Second, it explicitly accounts for several dimensions through which neighbour effects are likely to materialise and produce effects on the economic growth. As previously underlined, spatial spillovers are modelled accounting for both geographic proximity and a combination of geographic and non-geographic proximities between countries (e.g. Plaigin 2009; Arbia et al. 2010; Claeys and Manca 2011). This approach represents an improvement with respect to previous contributions considering either only geographically-driven spillover effects—the standard approach—or only non-geographic proximity measures (e.g. Ying 2005; Ahmad and Hall 2012). Finally, it significantly improves the literature on economic growth and, in particular, on the institutions–growth relationship in African countries (1) by investigating simultaneously three different dimensions of the institutional setting of a country (i.e. the type of regime, its (in)stability and the effectiveness/quality of institutions), while previous contributions tend to focus on one or two aspects only, and (2) by adopting a more rigorous (spatial) econometric approach able to identify potential cross-country institutional spillovers—an issue which has been only partially addressed in the literature. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the econometric methodology. Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical results. Section 4 concludes the paper.",13

On the one hand, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has generated a large amount of interest in the economics and management literature (see, e.g., the survey article of Carroll and Shabana 2010).Footnote 1 On the other hand, network industries are among the fastest developing sectors of advanced modern economics. With regard to the firms’ CSR behaviours, numerous reports have witnessed an increasing trend of this phenomenon: for instance, the KPMG Survey of Corporate responsibility (Cr) in 2013 observes that “this year the research is more broad-ranging than ever, covering 4100 companies across 41 countries (the last survey in 2011 looked at 3400 companies in 34 countries)…the growth in the number of countries and companies covered in this survey is just one indication of how Cr reporting has evolved into a mainstream business practice over the last two decades.” (KPMG 2013, 3). In particular, as regards countries showing this trend “..large companies in Italy, Spain and the UK lead the world for the quality of Cr reports. European G250 companies achieve the highest average quality score for their Cr reports at 68 out of 100. This compares with average scores of 51 for companies in the Americas and 48 in Asia Pacific.” (KPMG 2013, 17). The economy of social and environmental sustainability plays a crucial role in the European Union, as is clearly shown by the fact that more than 10% of the total European Economy (in terms of GDP), with more than 11 millions of workers (6% of total employment) belongs to this sector. With regard to the relevance of network goods in modern economies, one may think the large-scale expansions of, for example, telephones, mobile devices and software: it is natural to observe that the utility of a particular consumer from using those goods increases with the number of other users.Footnote 2 Moreover, it is important to note that most giant firms in network industries are distinctly oriented towards CSR behaviours, so that the production of network goods and the exercise of CSR behaviours goes hand in hand. In fact, according to the Reputation Institute Global CSR survey, among the world’s top ten companies with the best CSR reputations, large multinationals active in network industries are prevailing, as Table 1 shows, which reports the top 10 companies of the past 3 years of the Global CSR RepTrak® (Reputation Institute 2015). Moreover, a growing literature in industrial organisation has recently recognized the crucial role played by unions in oligopolies (see, for example, Dowrick 1989, 1990; Horn and Wolinsky 1988; López and Naylor 2004). Given the importance of network industries in contemporary economy, it is timely to investigate what is the impact of unionisation in those sectors. Several large companies in those industries (e.g., Silicon Valley giants such as Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Apple) are mainly not unionised. However, workers have recently been able to form unions in those companies. For instance, in early March 2015, due to recently passed legislation in California, Apple bowed to pressure from the labour union SEIU-USWW and agreed to directly employ security guards on its Cupertino, California, campus instead of hiring the work out through a subcontractor. Then, Facebook shuttle drivers gained final approval for their union contract (Al Jazeera America 2015). In September 2015, 38 bug tester who work full time in Microsoft’s offices to review apps voted to create a union, the Temporary Workers of America (BloombergBusinessweek 2015). Therefore, if the workforce in large CSR companies in network industries is to become unionised, it is rather natural to investigate the impact of bargaining for those companies and the overall welfare. A classical result in the unionised firm literature is that profits are higher when firms bargain only over wage and choose employment (right-to-manage, RTM) with respect to the ones when they also bargain over employment (simultaneous, EB, or sequential efficient bargaining, SEB) (Naylor 2003).Footnote 3 Indeed, a central issue of labour market institutions in advanced economies is the selection of the bargaining agenda between firms and unions, and the rise of possible conflicts of/common interest among the bargaining parties. Other established results of the unionised firm literature are that unions (and consumers) always prefer the EB agenda and thus a (possibly undesirable) conflict of interest between the bargaining parties (and agents) always occurs (Bughin 1999; Buccella 2011). A few papers have recently revisited the selection of the bargaining agenda (Fanti 2015; Buccella and Fanti 2015; Fanti and Buccella 2015, 2016). In particular, Fanti and Buccella (2016) analyse the choice of the bargaining agenda in a unionised monopoly with network effects. Those authors show that, in contrast to the established result that in pure monopoly the firm always chooses RTM, a SEB agreement is preferred, provided that the intensity of the network is sufficiently strong. Such a result means that in network goods industries the firm’s choice of the SEB arrangement allows to eliminate the conflict of interests between different agents and achieve a Pareto-superior outcome. However, none of the previous contributions considers the presence of CSR firms. Despite the relevance of both positive consumption externalities and CSR, issues pertaining to network goods industries with CSR rules, to the best of our knowledge, are scanty in the literature on unionised industries. In this paper we aim to fill this gap. An objective of the paper is to investigate whether firms’ engagement in CSR activities is always desirable from a social welfare point of view when labour market institutions are considered. ScholarsFootnote 4 as well as policy-makersFootnote 5 claim that CSR activities have positive effects on social welfare. Moreover it has been also argued that a direct social-welfare-enhancing effect may stem from the emergence of the CSR phenomenon through its role in mitigating market failures as substitutive of a socially costly market regulation,Footnote 6 as noted by Valach (2015, 1705): “From a welfare point of view, promoting corporate social responsibility can be an alternative or complementary way for regulation to confront market failures. Regulation is costly; it has limitations originating from asymmetric information and political constraints. It also has a limited impact over global public goods (global warming, Amazon deforestation, biodiversity loss, or child labour). Corporate social responsibility can reach where national regulations fall short and have a great impact on our wellbeing.” Given the relevant presence of CSR firms in Europe, European policy makers are actively working for a further promotion of firms’ social concerns.Footnote 7 Since the promotion of CSR is high on the policy agenda for sustainable development in many countries, then it is of interest—especially for European countries which have a sizable presence of both CSR firms and unionised firms—to investigate so far unexplored effects of CSR rules such as those on the choice of the bargaining agenda. More in detail, we want to answer the following research questions: first, how does firms’ social concern change the above mentioned result under network effects? Second, how are the agents’ and societal welfares affected by the modification of the agenda’s choice induced by firms’ social concerns? Indeed, the main result is that, rather surprisingly, the adoption of CSR rules by firms restores the classical bargaining agenda result. Thus, since the RTM agenda is welfare-reducing, we show that, through this channel, the expected welfare-enhancement effects occur because of the CSR activities’ promotion is challenged. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the basic monopoly-union bargaining model and then presents and discusses the results. Finally, the last section summarises the main results and their welfare implications and suggests directions for further research on the subject.",9
34,3,Economia Politica,03 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-017-0067-1,Competition and environmental quality as conflicting objectives: the case of the European municipal waste industry,December 2017,Francesco Silvestri,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Municipal waste (MW) is the waste generated by households. In Europe, local bodies at the municipal level are legally obliged to provide a collection system for MW, following regulations and guidelines given by communitarian directives, national laws, and regional plans. Besides setting the minimum targets to be reached and the environmental standards to be met, European Union (EU) claims that MW should be handled and disposed close to the location where it is generated. The justification of this policy is rooted in the two pillars of self-sufficiency principle and of proximity principle (hereafter SSP/PP), and it aims on the one hand at preventing the creation of pollution havens in regions with lower standards, and on the other at making local communities aware of their environmental responsibilities (a counterforce to the Not in My Back Yard syndrome). In this paper, we claim that the economic motivation for SSP/PP is that it induces a sufficient level of separated collection and as a consequence, it is the chosen mechanism to keep environmental externality at a tempered level. However, in the tradition of environmental economic studies it is worth exploring if other instruments, such as Pigouvian taxation, could be more effective in reaching the same objective in terms of externalities, without renouncing to the benefits of a more competitive market. The MW industry exhibits different characteristics, according to the stage of the industry taken into consideration. Due to scale and density economies, the collection segment can be considered as a legal monopoly, while its nature of public merit/good (a bad collection causes significant negative externalities to the local community) advocates for the implementation of a compulsory public service. The disposal segment should still operate in a competitive regime, but SSP/PP forces to find the disposing facility inside a well defined district and among a restricted number of disposal agents, allowing them to exploit a scarcity rent. In-between collection and disposal, an intermediate step is placed: the separate waste collection or reuse-recycling segment. SSP/PP regime leads to the establishment of a strict sub-regional market for MW management, a situation with no correspondence in other goods or service markets throughout EU, and introduces real challenges to competition in the MW sector. One strategy used by the Collector to escape the “capture” of the Disposer is to foster a separated waste collection system. In this sense, separated collection is a market competitor to end-of-the-pipe disposal. In Fig. 1 we represent the demand for disposal of MW by the Collector. Once the disposal toll a* is given, the quantity of waste q* directed to end-of-the-pipe facilities is identified. Since the Collector is obliged to process the whole amount of MW generated (Q), and the available methods to do it are just end-of-the-pipe disposal or MW selection, a* characterizes even the quantity d* of selected MW. In this sense, the higher the disposal toll a*, the lower the quota of MW directed to end-of-the-pipe solutions, and the higher the residual quota of separated collection operated. The demand for disposal of MW Recycling has a lower environmental impact with respect to alternative disposal solutions (landfill or incineration). As a consequence, we can consider SSP/PP as a command and control policy to reach a satisfactory environmental performance in the MW management. Nonetheless, from standard environmental economics we know that command and control is hardly an efficient policy. As a matter of fact, we demonstrate that abandoning the SSP/PP (i.e. opening the disposal market to competition) and levying a Pigouvian tax on the amount of MW disposed in end-of-the-pipe facilities would increase the total welfare, even though it could be detrimental to strict environmental quality. In the following sections, after a brief outline of the relevant literature on the issue (Sect. 1), we set up the general assumption and conditions for the model (Sect. 2), and depict a benchmark case where SSP/PP is enforced (Sect. 3). Using standard Industrial Organization models, the benchmark is compared with the situation in which SSP/PP is relaxed and the disposing sector is opened to higher competition (Sect. 4). We see that opening the disposal sector to competition is detrimental to MW selection and recycling and, because of the pollution related to end-of-the-pipe disposal and to environmental quality. We run a welfare analysis to compare the efficiency of SSP/PP with respect to Pigouvian taxation (Sect. 5). Finally, the existence conditions for the solutions of the model are discussed in the “Appendix”.",2

Conventionally, a reasonable way to approximate talent is given by monetary value. The paper explores the relationship between success in Italian professional football top league, Serie A, and the aggregate payroll of players. We apply three alternative measures for success and control for a wide set of covariates that are supposed to be related to sport performance. To perform the analysis, we collected data for 39 Italian professional football teams of Serie A tournaments (from season 2001/2002 to 2014/2015). The analysis is made of two steps. First, we test whether aggregate wage is a robust determinant of sport performance by means of a static panel estimation. Secondly, since the current level of aggregate wage is likely to be endogenous in the past realizations of the dependent variable (through increased revenues due to successful performances), in the second step we apply an IV dynamic panel model. The exogenous instruments chosen are supposed to influence socio-economic unobserved factors which eventually turn to have an impact on teams’ likelihood of sport success. In sum, our approach combines alternative estimation techniques (Fixed-Effects and System-GMM) in order to assess the robustness of the results, and in particular to directly tackle endogeneity. The paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 surveys the relevant literature. Section 3 describes data, and Sect. 4 outlines the estimation strategy and results of our two-steps analysis, including both fixed-effects and dynamic panel data instrumental variable specifications. Finally, in the last section we present some concluding remarks.",6

In the 1970s, the Green Revolution in agriculture was at its height, based on a package of practices and inputs: high yielding varieties of rice and wheat, chemical fertilisers, and assured irrigation. To this was added mechanisation, especially tractors, in line with the American model of farming which served as a touchstone then. But was this choice of technology appropriate for a labour surplus country such as India? The prevailing view was that mechanisation would improve productive efficiency on Indian farms. I found that by empirically disaggregating the effects of mechanisation by techniques, operations, and farm size, I arrived at quite different results from those of aggregative studies. In particular, tractors, in themselves, added little to output while reducing labour demand. The thesis, published as a book, Mechanization in Indian Agriculture (Agarwal 1983), was appreciated for its methodological innovativeness and empirical results, and influenced the debate on farm mechanisation in India. Subsequently I worked on the gender impact of High Yield Variety (HYV) seeds and mechanisation, comparing Asian and African countries and states within India. This work again challenged prevailing assumptions, but this time those of gender scholars who argued that mechanisation was bound to displace female labour. My results showed the opposite, since the operations in which most female labour was employed were not the ones being mechanised, again illustrating the importance of disaggregated analysis and careful empirical testing. The Green Revolution brought food self-sufficiency to many developing countries in the 1980s, but today we are facing the consequences of falling groundwater tables and degraded soils, under the shadow of climate change. Common to both periods—the 1980s and today—however, is the limited visibility of women farmers in analysis, data and policies. This is despite a growing feminisation of agriculture globally, as more men than women first move to non-farm jobs. In Asia and Africa, for instance, in 2012, 43% and 47% respectively of agricultural workers are women and their proportions have been  growing. As I argue in several papers, our food security and farm output will thus depend increasingly on women farmers. Yet they have limited access to land, productive inputs, irrigation, information on new technologies, credit facilities, and markets. This reduces their productivity. In contrast, my ongoing research in Asia, and the work of other scholars in Africa, shows that if women farmers had the same access to inputs as men, they could do as well, or even better. According to FAO’s State of Food and Agriculture Report 2011, productivity on women’s farms could rise by 20–30% as a result, and agricultural output in developing countries could be 2.5–4% higher. This potential remains untapped. Women are also undercounted as workers. Their productive work for the household—fieldwork, cattlecare, fetching fodder and firewood, etc.—remains invisible, unpaid, and largely excluded from statistics. There is a vibrant debate today on why Indian women’s labour force participation is so low. A paper I wrote in 1984 shows how biases in defining work and underreporting by male enumerators and respondents, not just in India but in many countries, can lead us to count women workers as non-working housewives. In fact, if we take a narrow definition based only on women’s paid work, rural women’s work participation in India today is only 17.5%, but as recent research shows, if we take a wider definition and add home-based production, self-employment, and declared unemployment, we get a rate of 64.8% (Dubey et al. 2017). Many people also assume that women are less efficient than men. As a doctoral student, I found that agricultural economists were counting women’s labour as equal to half of male labour simply because their wages were half of men’s. In other words, labour market discrimination was being translated into academic bias. To challenge this, I needed evidence. Then I came across an experiment done by an engineer at the Punjab Agricultural University in North India. He had tested potato-digging equipment on women and men and found that women took one-third or half the time men took for the same job. In fact, women were more efficient by every measure. This helped me justify counting male and female labour at least as equal. It was the most debated point in my viva voce! A related theme in my work was the gender impact of technology and women’s access to it. I examined the impact of a range of technologies—from HYV crops to mechanised equipment and cooking stoves. Consider the case of stoves. When I was interviewing farmers in the Punjab, India’s most prosperous state, I was struck by the fact that men were using tractors but their wives were still cooking with firewood and cropwaste on smoky stoves. Even today, many rural women cook on old stoves with firewood or other unprocessed biofuels. In fact, firewood remains the single most important cooking fuel in rural South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa: 65% of rural households in India and 90% in Nepal use mainly firewood for cooking. This leads to indoor air pollution from cooking smoke, causing serious health problems. In developing countries, women’s risk of mortality is found to be 50% higher than men’s from smoke-related infections, and women account for 60% of the 1.6 million deaths per year just from this cause (Modi et al. 2005). Many solutions have been offered for reducing kitchen smoke—from improved stoves to clean energy such as biogas. But the dissemination of these innovations to users remains a challenge. In the 1980s, the prevailing view, espoused by sociologists such as Everett Rodgers, was that people fail to adopt new technology due to ignorance of its benefits. In contrast, my research showed that technology adoption was restricted mainly by financial and social constraints faced by users, especially women. These and related ideas on the need to adapt technology to user needs, and the importance of bottom-up diffusion of innovations, are discussed in my 1986 book Cold Hearths and Barren Slopes: The Woodfuel Crises in the Third World (Agarwal 1986). In fact, women rarely have a say in the design of most equipment they use, especially agricultural equipment, and few own such equipment themselves. In Gambia, for instance, less than 1% of women farmers were found to own a seeder relative to 27% of male farmers. In Kenya, the value of farm equipment owned by women farmers was found to be 18% of that owned by male farmers (FAO 2011). What underlies such gender inequalities? A key factor is women’s unequal bargaining power within families and communities, the subject of my 1997 paper ‘Bargaining and gender relations: within and beyond the household’ (Agarwal 1997). In the late 1980s and 1990s a range of critiques emerged of the unitary household models I had mentioned earlier, and bargaining models of the household were presented as alternatives. Bargaining models depict intra-household relations more realistically as relations of both cooperation and conflict, driven by both self-interest and altruism, with outcomes depending on a member’s relative bargaining power. The key question this raised was: what affects a person’s bargaining power? Most economists emphasised incomes. But, as I argue in my bargaining paper, bargaining power can also depend on other factors, some of which can be quantified, such as employment, ownership of private property, and access to public resources, while others are qualitative, such as social norms and perceptions. Women tend to be disadvantaged on most of these counts, and so have lower bargaining power than men within families, leading to further unequal outcomes. In fact, the paper conceptualises bargaining as interactively occurring in four arenas: the family, the community, the market and the State. Interventions in one arena can affect bargaining power in other arenas. For instance, if the government transfers land or cash to women rather than men, it enhances women’s bargaining power at home. Similarly, a husband who shares childcare can increase women’s bargaining power in the labour market. But cutting across all the arenas is ownership of immovable property such as land or a house.",10

Rajan,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Developing Asian economies have embraced openness to international trade and financial flows as a means of sustained growth. While they have benefitted from such a growth strategy, they have also been faced with significant volatility, largely due to ebbs and flows in capital flows. In particular, sharp surges and sudden stops in capital flows have been associated with episodes of severe financial crisis most notably in 1997–1998 (Asian financial crisis) as well as in 2007–2008 (global financial crisis) (Rajan et al. 2011). More recently, the post global financial crisis period has complicated macroeconomic management in developing Asian economies with the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy (Quantitative Easing) as well as the subsequent “taper tantrum,” when the Fed started a contemplating a gradual normalization of monetary policy (Sahay et al. 2014). While some policymakers and observers have responded to these concerns regarding capital flows by suggesting the need to impose selective capital controls or macro prudential regulations to moderate capital flows in general, others have suggested the need to pay more attention to the composition of capital flows. As the argument goes, foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and bank lending are much more prone to sharp inflows and sudden withdrawals unlike foreign direct investment (FDI) which is seen as relatively stable (Bosworth and Collins 1999; Dadush et al. 2000; Loungani and Razin 2001). This led to Hausmann and Fernández-Arias (2000) suggesting that FDI is viewed by several host countries as “good cholesterol,” as opposed to other types of capital flows like short-term debt that are “bad cholesterol” because of the unstable nature as it is motivated by speculative rather than long-term considerations. A first glance at the data suggests that there appears to be some basis for advancing such an argument regarding the relative stability of FDI. During the Asian Financial crisis bank flows were the primary drivers of the boom (in 1996) and the subsequent bust in 1997–1999, followed by portfolio flows. Just prior to the global financial crisis as Asia experienced a resurgence in net capital flows, once again the pre-crisis boom was due mainly to portfolio flows followed by bank flows, while the subsequent reversal post Lehman Brothers was due to these two types (Rajan et al. 2011). These two types of flows are therefore commonly referred to as “mobile capital” or “hot money” in contrast to FDI which remained fairly stable during the entire period. Similarly, in the most recent period of temper tantrum, while FDI stayed fairly constant, the other two components of capital flows saw a sudden albeit short-lasting reversal.Footnote 1
 Other studies have also highlighted the stabilizing properties of FDI relative to other forms of external financing (Felices et al. 2008; BIS 2009). This, along with the growth-enhancing benefits of FDI (employment, technology transfer, etc.) has led to a growing belief that the composition of capital flows matters more than its volume and policies should concomitantly focus on altering capital flows towards FDI. While this view has become conventional wisdom of sorts, it is not unambiguous. For instance, Fernández-Arias and Hausmann (2001) maintain that FDI tends to dominate capital inflows to countries with poor financial development, suggesting that FDI substitutes for foreign portfolio investments (FPI) and may be attracted because of a country’s weakness rather than strength. Another argument that could be made regarding this sharp distinction between mobile capital and FDI is that the type of FDI has changed over time. While it is often believed that FDI is of the Greenfield variety, a growing share of FDI globally appears to be in the form of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) (UNCTAD 2011).Footnote 2 This is especially true of developing economies in Asia. In fact, if we consider the trends of different types of FDI flows into Asian economies (Table 1), we see that there has been a significant jump in the ratio of M&A to FDI in developing Asia up until 2009, relative to decade of the 1990s. The ratio doubled from about 11–22% on average from 1990–1999 to 2000–2009, respectively.Footnote 3  It is useful to note that in some senses M&A flows are quite similar to FPI, with the only difference being proportion of share-holding. Particularly, both FPI and M&A involve foreign purchases of domestic equities. The only difference is that M&A in the form of FDI refers to a foreigner purchasing a stake of 10% and over while anything else is treated as FPI. This being the case, would we expect FDI primarily in the form of M&A to act very differently from FPI?Footnote 4 In fact, as Hattari and Rajan (2011) empirically establish, distance has a near equal inhibiting impact on FDI in the form of M&A and FPI flows, consistent with the fact that both financial transactions are almost similar to each other with the only difference being the thresholds of ownership. Thus, in many ways, this conventional wisdom regarding FDI being more stable than other forms of financing and using that as the rationale for encouraging FDI flows is rather curious. A potential concern is that policy measures designed to encourage FDI may involve not only a distortionary cost but also little gain in terms of enhanced financial stability if sufficient care is not taken to distinguish between the types of FDI, viz. Greenfield versus M&A (Bird and Rajan 2002). Given this background, this paper aims to revisit the issue of FDI and its two components, viz. Greenfield and M&A and how they affect economic growth and domestic investment for a panel of developing Asian economies. We contribute to the literature in two important ways. First, we add to the growing interest and recognition in the literature on the potentially different macroeconomic effects of Greenfield and M&A flows on growth and investment in developing economies. Second, we specifically focus on the Asian region which has increasingly seen a rising share of FDI flows in the form of M&A. By empirically estimating the macroeconomic impacts of the types of FDI through a systematic breakdown of aggregate FDI into its components we aim to shed light on the policy choices governing the type of FDI that has to be attracted in developing economies in Asia. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 begins with a brief examination of the relative trends in FDI inflows to developing Asia. Section 3 uses a simple analytical framework to explain the differential macroeconomic effects of Greenfield investments versus FDI in the form of M&A. Section 4 offers a discussion of the related empirical literature and highlights the gaps that exist on the related issue. Section 5 summarizes the data sources and definitions as well as furnishes the empirical specification to be estimated. Section 6 discusses the results including the robustness checks. Section 7 concludes the paper.",7

According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, country’s income per capita has grown + 8.8% a year on average between 1978 and 2008, that is, impressively more than in other emerging economies like India (+ 3.6%) or Brazil (+ 1.2%). Such a sustained growth has intertwined with the transition towards market economy, which is at the very basis of the country’s developmental strategy launched in the late-1970s and has benefitted from a key governmental focus on upgrading country’s industrial capabilities. The attainments are evident in the Chinese exportations of manufactured goods having reached, according to the UNCTAD statistics, 12.7% of the world total value in 2008 and 18.6% in 2015. China has grown a global manufacturing hub in many industries. A paramount example is the industry of electronic devices and components, in which the country’s Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) can be estimated around 2.5 since 2008 onwards, based on the UNCTAD statistics, meanwhile companies like Huawei, Lenovo and ZTE have gained a global leadership. The diffusion of domestic innovative activities is a substantial driver of this process, whose achievements build on a mix of imported and indigenous capabilities (Fu et al. 2016). The relative emphasis on the pair of these sources has strategically evolved over separate stages along the country’s industrialization–transition path: preparing for the market economy until the early-1990s, opening to the international economy before the World Trade Organization (WTO) membership in 2001, and then the socialist market economy (Frattini and Prodi 2013a; Naughton 2007). Imported and indigenous capabilities can be respectively considered as exogenous and endogenous “seeds” of innovative activities. Each stage-specific mix of these seeds has been crucial for the success of the Chinese way to economic restructuring and catching up with industrialization (Fu et al. 2016; Prodi et al. 2017). Nonetheless, the nature of the seeds should be expected a diverse effect on innovative activities, especially on them to embed locally. Literature largely considers embeddedness as one essential property of well-structured local innovative environments (Boschma 2005; Cooke 2005; Maskell and Malmberg 1999; Torre and Rallet 2005). This paper aims to explore how the mix of seeds along China’s development may have affected this property in the long-term. More precisely, the research question is whether, despite of an exceptional push on economic growth, more exogenous seeds can have somehow delayed innovative activities to gain embeddedness locally. On one hand, literature has reported the surge and diffusion of the innovative activities in China. On the other, it has focused on place-specific features of the local innovative environments (see Fan 2014 for a survey). This paper aims to contribute the literature giving original insights into between these two research lines. It designs an empirical strategy to measure and map countrywide the embeddedness of innovative activities at a prefectural level in China, so that the linkage with the nature of seeds can be discussed. In doing this, the paper is expected to serve development economists and practitioners, focusing on the primary and secondary effects of the exogenous seeding of innovative activities to promote industrial upgrading, that is, diffusion but delayed embedding. It is well-known in literature that attracting foreign investments to import “packaged” technologies may entail a sort of “truncated” technology transfer, i.e., the upgrading of indigenous capabilities “up to a certain level, but not beyond” (Lall 1992, p. 179). Efficiency in technology transfer depends indeed more on the capabilities to absorb and link with than to replicate and update the imported technologies (Lall 1992). Innovative activities persisting to be relevantly fostered by exogenous seeds even in regions where China’s catching up has been most successful and native global innovators reside today, it would be an important piece of evidence of a possible long-term effect produced by a very popular strategy to promote the diffusion of innovative activities in the developing countries. The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 briefly frames the Chinese developmental strategy after 1978, focusing on the industrialization–transition synchronism and the contextual diffusion of innovative activities along this path. Special attention is given to the policy devices implemented to seed this process, and uneven embeddedness is discussed as constitutive of the diffusion of innovative activities in the country. Section 3 moves to design an empirical strategy to measure embeddedness. It starts from the option of using patent applications as a proxy of innovative activities (Keller 2004) and from considering the investigation at a prefectural level as the most appropriate for the purpose of this paper. Patent counts by inventors’ and applicants’ location between 1981 and 2009 are combined together into three indicators entering a clustering procedure to rank innovative activities into separate level of embeddedness. This approach is very demanding detailed data. Such an extensive information on patent applications from China is not commonly available however. The data set used in this paper is an authors’ original rearrangement of the patent filings at the European Patent Office (EPO) collected in the OECD REGPAT database (as released in January 2014). The results are presented in Sect. 4. First, different groups of prefectural cities are mapped countrywide by level of embeddedness. Second, the linkage between these levels and the local seeds of innovative activities is qualitatively discussed in a sample of prefectural cities to give insights into the answer to the research question. Finally, Sect. 5 makes room for conclusive remarks and derives policy implications that are relevant to China and, more in general, to the developing countries whose industrial development has meaningfully relied on exogenous seeding or it continues doing so. According to the UNCTAD statistics, the stock of inward Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) exceeded the 50% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 20 countries in 2005 and the 100% in eight of them. The number of these countries then increased up to 49 and 17 respectively in 2015.",7

This change is due both to demographic evolution and to new retirement legislation. On the one hand, the size imbalance between ageing baby boomers and the smaller younger generations has led to an increasing share of older people in the workforce. On the other hand, from the early 2000s onwards, concerns have emerged about the economic sustainability of pension systems. Until the beginning of the new century, weak eligibility requirements for receiving an early retirement benefits were used both as a measure of social welfare for employment affected by firm or industry-wide crises and as a way to rejuvenate firms’ employment. Then, the age imbalance and increasing life expectancy led to the introduction of more restrictive retirement regulations. As stated by Hedge and Borman (2012) (pp. 663): ‘[F]or the most of the twentieth century, government and employer policies tended to be “pro-retirement”, encouraging workers to exit the labor force at a set age.’ Today, ‘[a]s the population… ages, there is an increasing pressure to encourage people to work past the traditional retirement age’. These tendencies are indeed common in many developed countries, which have imposed restrictions on early retirement plans (ERP) and increased the age of compulsory retirement, often while abandoning defined benefits (DB) in favour of defined contribution (DC) pension plans. In Italy, this process occurred through a series of reforms aimed at gradually achieving the long-term equilibrium of the pension system (Brugiavini and Peracchi 2012). The stepwise re-equilibration of the pension system drastically accelerated at the end of 2011, when, under the pressure of the Italian sovereign debt crisis, the government headed by Mario Monti enacted a new reform (Law 201/2011 ‘Fornero’, from the name of the Ministry of Labour). This quickened the adoption of the Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) systemFootnote 1 already in place for entrant workers, increased the compulsory retirement age and restricted access to ERPs. The debate on effects of the reforms is still on-going and involves several issues, from the sustainability of the pension system to intergenerational equity and the consequences for the labour market and firms’ productivity. But, while it is easy to assess the consequences on the long-term equilibrium of the pension system, less clear are the macroeconomic consequences on the labour market, productivity and growth. This paper, considering the effect of the ageing workforce on productivity, aims to contribute to the debate on the macroeconomic consequences of the pension reform. Despite the long-lasting slowdown of Italian productivity, few studies have focused on the effect of ageing on productivity in Italy. Whether workforce ageing affects productivity or not is a debated issue. In this study, we exploit the abrupt and unexpected change to the pension system to evaluate the effect on productivity growth of a sudden increase in the number of older workers locked into the workplace due to the reform. To achieve this aim, we use panel data drawn from Italian provinces. The variability of the provincial composition of the workforce can help us detect important phenomena. The most important contribution of this paper is to highlight the effect on productivity of compulsory retirement delays and ERP restrictions. In the past only the most productive workers did not exploit the opportunity for early retirement; the reform drastically reduced the possible effects of sorting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess empirically the role of the sorting mechanism in levelling differences in productivity between older and prime-age workers. In accordance with a wide range of literature, this paper shows that ageing is not in itself an impediment to productivity growth. However, productivity equalisation among age groups is sustained by the sorting process put in place through firms’ and individuals’ choices. As it will be explained below, the introduction of rigid retirement regulation, undoing the mechanism for sorting older workers according to their individual productivity, has made apparent the effect of an ageing workforce on productivity. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the literature on the effect of an ageing workforce. We define our research hypothesis in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we describe the data and methods before we present the results in Sect. 5 and offer conclusions in Sect. 6.",7

In the past decade, economists have started analyzing the importance of financial market improvements for income distribution, questioning if finance was good for the poor. In particular, the discussion focused on understanding whether financial sector developments might have helped reduce income inequality by offering diversification opportunities to a larger group of people (e.g. Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine 2009; Claessens and Perotti 2007). This paper documents the relevance, to the direct association between financial development and inequality reduction, of a dimension of access to financial markets that quantitative measures of financial market development cannot capture. It focuses, namely, on the ability to use financial instruments and to deal with financial market complexity that indicators of economic literacy proxy for. In doing do, the paper creates a bridge between the literature on the so-called “finance-inequality nexus” and those studies that stress the importance of economic literacy to financial market decisions. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it builds a dataset that allows exploiting both cross-sectional and time series information on inequality data. In this respect, it differs from earlier studies on the relationship between finance and inequality. Following Dollar and Kraay (2002) and Beck et al. (2007), indeed, existing papers focused on cross-sectional information mainly. The use of panel analyses was restricted to robustness checks based on uneven and across-countries overlapping sub-periods that did not allow studying the effect of common trends in the variables of interest. Second, this paper offers a broad analysis of the association between economic literacy, inequality, and financial development. Although the profession has recently recognized the potential effect of economic literacy as a source of unequal access to finance (Lusardi et al. 2017), the study of the impact of economic literacy on inequality is a field yet amenable to research. This paper documents that financial development is not robustly associated to a reduction in income inequality in specifications that include economic literacy as an explanatory variable, nor in panel regressions where time effects control for common trends in the variables of interest. In a sample of advanced and developing countries observed over the 1980–2007 period, the ability to use financial instruments and deal with financial market complexity, measured by indicators of economic-specific competences, instead, is significantly and robustly associated to the variation in income inequality. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 describes the dataset and the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents descriptive evidence from the 1980–2007 cross-section. Section 5 reports the main findings from sub-period panel regressions, discusses their robustness, and considers alternative indicators of competence. Section 6 concludes.",12

As a consequence, it is important to understand which factors affect the consumers’ perception of what is a good deal. Among these factors there are, for example, the type of goods (deals on packaged goods are perceived as more valuable than deals on other durables or soft goods), the number of items in a good bundle (deals on smaller bundle are perceived as more valuable) and the format of presentation of the deal (the percent-off format looks more attractive than the money-off format, especially when the percentage is high) (Krishna et al. 2002). The list of factors presented above does not include the cognitive skills, i.e. the ability to gain meaning and knowledge from experience and information. These abilities affect the evaluation process of a discount and they can vary drastically from one person to the other. Among these characteristics one is especially relevant in the context of the discount evaluation: the ability to comprehend, use and attach meaning to numbers (numeracy). This paper investigates the joint influence of two of the factors mentioned above: the presentation formats of the discount and numeracy. In particular, we discuss: (1) which is the effect of the joint presentation of formats which usually elicit very different degrees of attractiveness (money-off and percentage formats together) and (2) how numeracy interacts with the presentation formats, i.e. how the preferences for the different presentation formats change according to the numeric ability of the consumers.",1
35,1,Economia Politica,01 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-018-0094-6,Crisis in the European Monetary Union: A Core-Periphery Perspective,April 2018,Federico Bassi,Cédric Durand,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The US subprime crisis that hit the world economy 10 years ago was the crisis of a theoretical paradigm, which we call generally “neoliberalism”, which has been driving and legitimizing the process of world-trade globalization post Bretton Woods. The crisis of the European Monetary Union (EMU hereafter), misleadingly defined as a sovereign-debt crisis or a balance of payments crisis, was the consequence of the US subprime crisis—which transferred into Europe few years later because of an extremely fragilized banking system in a flawed monetary union—and the austerity policies that followed. The result of the crisis is a structural polarization among European countries, which undermines the whole integration process. This is one of the main lessons that we draw from “Crisis in the European Monetary Union: A Core-Periphery Perspective” (Celi et al. 2018), which attempts to explain what lies behind the decision of a set of politically, economically and socially heterogeneous countries, having in common a loose geographical proximity, to engage in a process of monetary integration, consisting of fully liberalizing goods and capital movements, establishing supranational authorities in charge of ensuring undistorted competition in a supposedly levelled playing field, and abandoning fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate sovereignty. It is also a detailed analysis, framed in a genuinely “Keynesian” theoretical perspective, of why European countries were not suited to embark in this process of Europeanization—which in authors’ definition corresponds to the European-wide application of neoliberal globalization—and how this reshaped the structural core-peripheries trade and industrial relationships. Structural divergences taking off in Europe in the last four to five decades are mostly responsible for the EMU crisis, because they implied a different ability to support the abandonment of demand management policies, thereby a different resilience to external shocks. Moreover, the Europeanization process itself is largely accountable for the deepening of these structural divergences and the emergence of a polarized Europe, characterized by an industrial and industrialising core (Germany), a less industrialized and de-industrializing south periphery (Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) and a rapidly catching-up eastern periphery (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland and Hungary), whose share in manufacturing employment is declining even though productivity gains thanks to FDI are impressive. To explain the EMU crisis, the authors rely on a core-periphery analysis of trade relationships, by calling into question economic and political choices made by peripheral elites while discussing about the European integration process. The first part of the book (chapters 1–3) is a detailed analysis of how the political debate evolved in European countries, particularly how Italian and French elites shifted from a prudent and progressive approach to integration—concerned by underdevelopment and financial fragility of European countries with respect to Germany—to an aggressive acceleration towards a fully-fledged monetary union—concerned now by the redeeming role of financial markets as referees and punishers of States’ fiscal profligacy. What stands out is a clear awareness by European elites of the risk of a premature liberalization of goods and financial markets for late-industrializing countries, even though political and economic developments swept away these concerns, by focusing on fiscal and financial rigour as prerequisites for sustained growth. It is worthwhile noting that this debate is now largely digested: when Mario Monti’s Government came to power in Italy, Italian people were told to be in a crisis because the “spread” with respect to German bonds skyrocketed, due to Government’s fiscal laxity and trade unions irresponsibility for (bashfully) opposing to structural reforms. A mix of historical events and theoretical developments, namely the oil crisis and the emergence of the monetarist theory, would explain this political shift. According to the authors (chapter 7.5), the role model played by Germany and the US, which stood out for their outperforming growth rates during the 1970s and 1980s, was crucial to convince European elites, deeply influenced by the new-coming monetarist theory, that German monetary rigour and US extensive liberalizations were the main explanatory variables of their economic success. Hence, a mix of “pragmatism and myopia” (chapter 9, p. 282) would explain the reason why European countries with completely different industrial and productive structures agreed upon fixed exchange rates agreements and capital markets liberalization. The EMU crisis is the consequence of the premature-liberalization and de-industrialization which accompanied the European south periphery (SP hereafter) throughout the process of European integration, which generated a long-lasting process of industrial desertification and financialization in these countries. One of the main strengths of the book is the ability to reconcile both the demand and the supply analysis of the crisis: from the demand side, increasing inequalities, financial bubbles and austerity policies are convincingly interrelated to explain the evolution of European trade surpluses and deficits. The vulnerability of southern exporters of quality goods due to the relative impoverishment of workers from the core is very well articulated. From the supply-side, the interplay between degree of industrialization, abandoning of publicly-driven industrial planning and internationalisation strategies of European firms is the main explanans of European competitive gaps, trade imbalances and SP financialization. From this perspective, the mainstream solutions proposed to solve the European crisis lose much of their theoretical ground: so long as competitive gaps do not rely on unit labour costs differentials, as the Optimum Currency Area (OCA) theory would argue, structural reforms aiming at increasing labour market flexibility and reducing labour costs in peripheral countries would not solve the supply-side deficiencies of the SP, which depends on a poorer industrial innovation and diversification performance. Moreover, structural reforms would contemporarily choke-off internal demand and thus generating a further divergence among European countries. In other words, there is no such degree of wage and price flexibility that can restore an appreciable and sustainable convergence path among European economies. The risk for the European SP is therefore to get “stuck in the middle” (chapter 8.6, p. 234): less price-competitive than emerging economies because of higher labour costs, and less quality-competitive than advanced economies because of a poorer innovative performance. This stands out as one of the most interesting arguments developed in the book: European polarization is the consequence of the abandonment of State-led industrial policies in SP, after substituting public interventionism with market-based competition as new industrial policy rule. Neoliberal emphasis on levelling playing fields, by eliminating tariffs, capital controls and government planning, revealed all the industrial and institutional differences among European countries, and opened the path to a “structures-based competition” (Lordon 2012), with countries’ socio-productive systems becoming the competitive field. German manufacturing success depends on many factors (chapters 2.2 and 6.4): the integration of the European eastern periphery within its value chain (benefiting of lower wages and favourable corporate taxes legislation); a successful outsourcing strategy consisting of keeping domestically high-value-added and technology-intensive stages of production; the differentiation of its productive structure through extensive innovations allowing to conquer growing markets for final goods, namely China and India; the specialization in high-quality high-price goods. However, the other toss of the coin of German manufacturing success is a massive increase in poverty and inequalities, especially in the tertiary sector. Germany’s wage moderation strategy, which has been accompanying the process of manufacturing restructuring since the mid-1990s, generated one of the mostly segmented labour markets in Europe: the share of working poor and poverty rates raised dramatically in the aftermath of the Hartz reform (chapter 5.2), especially in the tertiary sector. Hence, the German model is far from been extendable and reproducible at socially acceptable conditions. The solution that the authors propose to the European crisis relies on coordinated Government-led industrial policies in Europe (chapter 9). Industrial restructuring and diversification, rather than wage moderation and tertiarization, are the key words to get out of the crisis. This solution is far from been utopic: despite academic reluctance towards public industrial policies, these are still a crucial element of most countries’ development model, even though it is often implemented behind the curtain (Reinert 2004). US technological leadership is indeed the result of massive public investments by the federal government (Mazzucato 2013). Nevertheless, the European Commission does not seem to take this point sufficiently into account: The Investment Plan for Europe’s (Juncker plan) ambition contrasts with the modest budget allocated and with the binding conditionality required to get access to public funds (chapter 9.4). Moreover, labour market structural reforms seem to be still a priority in European countries political agenda, as the Italian Jobs Act and the French Loi Travail, with subsequent reforms, clearly show. The risk of keep fuelling industrial divergence and wage deflation is huge, including economic stagnation, industrial desertification and the explosion of social, economic and political conflicts, without effects on Government debt, as the large and increasing welfare costs in SP show (chapter 5.4). “Crisis in the European Monetary Union: A Core-Periphery Perspective” is a brilliant and original piece of literature, which provides an analysis of the European crisis through a lens that is often neglected in the mainstream literature. By going beyond the largely diffused narrative about European imbalances that focuses predominantly on factors’ and prices’ rigidities, the authors show that Europe’s disease relies on divergent industrial bases and innovation capabilities, with no degree of wage and price flexibility able to offset this polarization. Nevertheless, some tensions and oversights remain unresolved in the book. Because of the relevance of the core-periphery framework in the book, we regret the authors’ insufficient review of the dependency literature, which leads them to unfairly write that dependency theory “had the weakness of attributing underdevelopment only to external circumstances, thereby exonerating national actors from any responsibility” (p. 57). This is doing justice neither to the theoretical sophistication of this very diverse intellectual tradition, which explored at length the internal social dynamics of countries in dependent situation, nor to the political fight of many of the people that endorsed it (for a review see Palma 1978). What brings about this theoretical tradition echoes the objective of the authors to challenge the mainstream narrative, which blames dependent countries while neglecting the role played by peripheral and core countries’ elites, who establish and keep fuelling dependency relationship, by generating both inter- and intra-regional inequalities. More importantly, if the book makes a brilliant and convincing case upon the crucial role played by the abandonment of industrial policies resulting from European integration on regional productive polarization, it somehow overlooks the industrial consequences directly related to the monetary union. Understandably, the authors do not seem eager to engage with this difficult and controversial issue of the EMU. This embarrassment is also palpable in their ambiguous development about the target 2 mechanism and the nature of balance-of-payments crisis in chapters 4.2 and 4.3. But this issue looks like an elephant in the room and their ambiguity while acknowledging this leads them to downplay some key problems. For example, the importance of German wage deflation is not clear: while the role of wage restraint on German trade surplus is well acknowledged on the imports side—namely by affecting both the quantity and quality of households’ consumption, at the expense of the south periphery (chapter 5)—the role played through the exports side is less well stated. Chapter 2.3 is explicitly devoted to this topic, but mixes empirical arguments suggesting the non-significance of wage deflation in German exports with theoretical arguments suggesting a strong significance, without solving this apparent contradiction. In the conclusions, it is not clear whether the authors believe that the industrial policy measures suggested in chapter 9 can be undertaken within the EMU, although this seems also a crucial point. As a minor issue, although we take on board the emphasis on financialization and de-industrialisation as mutually reinforcing processes, we regret a somehow superficial analysis of financialization in chapter 3.2, when poorly justified indicators are used as evidence of this process (i.e. the dynamics of non-financial corporations’ total liabilities or equities held), while overlooking relevant indicators that might and ought to deserve a deeper analysis (i.e. the share of financial assets in non-financial corporations’ total assets). Overall, we believe that “Crisis in the European Monetary Union: A Core-Periphery Perspective” is a must-read for those who are interested to an alternative narrative about the causes and remedies of the European crisis. An analysis that does not focus on prices’ and factors’ rigidity to explain the European crisis and does not suggest structural reforms as a necessary and effective cure. It is a must-read also for those who seek to understand the relevance of Government-driven industrial policies for economic development and the ineffectiveness of market-based competition as a resources-allocating mechanism. Finally, it is a must-read for those who look for an accurate analysis of the economic and social consequences of the European neoliberal-agenda—based on capital market liberalization and austerity policies—among heterogeneous economic and social structures.",3

35,2,Economia Politica,24 July 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-017-0071-5,Do all imports matter for productivity? Intermediate inputs vs capital goods,August 2018,Mauro Caselli,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The international trade literature has dedicated great attention to the relationship between firm productivity and export entry, while the role of importing activities at the firm level has been confined to a handful of papers. Only recently, following the availability of more detailed firm-level datasets and the large increase of international trade in intermediate goods linked with the global fragmentation of production, the relationship between firm productivity and importing has received more attention Agostino et al. 2016. This recent work on imports, however, has not involved all importing activities. The focus has been primarily on imports of intermediate inputs, while imports of capital goods and their relationship with productivity have been left aside. This is partly due to lack of data, but it is also linked to the literature’s interest in offshoring and global value chains, phenomena that are more closely connected with imports of intermediate inputs Paul and Yasar 2009; Agostino et al. 2016. Yet, from a theoretical perspective, both types of imported goods could be related with productivity since both may be of higher quality than domestic available varieties and can embody more advanced technology. Thus, empirical work using a more disaggregated categorisation of imported goods and focusing on how each type of imports is related with productivity can shed further light on issues such as offshoring and the global fragmentation of production. Moreover, given the recent backlash against international trade in some countries due to public opinion’s fear of imports causing a loss of manufacturing jobs and the importance of productivity in the demand for labour, the question of how and which imports affect firms’ productivity becomes even more important to understand the effects of trade on the economy overall. This paper studies the relationship between imports of intermediate inputs, proxied by materials, and capital goods, proxied by machinery and equipment, and plants’ productivity. It addresses the issue of causality by distinguishing between potential self-selection into importing, i.e., more productive plants tend to import, and learning-by-importing, i.e., imports may enhance plants’ productivity. It uses detailed production and cost data from a panel of Mexican manufacturing plants between 1994 and 2003 and the methodology developed by Wooldridge (2009) and Petrin and Levinsohn (2012) to estimate total factor productivity (henceforth, productivity). This methodology takes into account the correlation between input use and unobserved productivity and, thus, corrects for the potential endogeneity of inputs in the production function estimation. Following De Loecker (2013), this methodology can also accomodate the fact that both exporting and importing activities may affect the productivity process and, thus, the estimates of the production function parameters. Moreover, given the potential interconnections between different types of imports and exports, this paper allows for complementarities between all three international trade activities, i.e. exporting, importing intermediate inputs and importing capital goods. The key findings are that there is some evidence of learning-by-importing. However, not all imports seem to matter for productivity. While starting importing machinery and equipment leads to an increase in productivity, the same does not occur when plants start importing materials. The paper also finds some support in favour of self-selection as more productive plants tend to become importers of machinery and equipment rather than materials. Finally, complementarities seem to play an important role too since plants that engage in all three international trade activities are the ones with the highest productivity levels. This paper makes several important empirical contributions in the trade literature. First, this paper is one of only two that distinguish explicitly importing capital goods and importing intermediate inputs and their relationship with productivity. The only other paper that makes such a distinction is Muendler (2004), which shows a small contribution of both foreign materials and investment goods on output for Brazil using the Olley and Pakes (1996) methodology to estimate productivity. The paper contributes to the wider literature looking at the effect of importing on productivity. While the importance of imported capital goods for growth and productivity has been highlighted in several studies, such as Eaton and Kortum (2001) and Csillag and Koren (2011), most papers that look at the effect of importing on firm productivity focus solely on intermediate inputs. One study that looks at how importing machinery affects firms’ output is Yasar (2013), who finds that firms with higher absorptive capacity gain significantly more from importing foreign capital. On the other hand, moving on to the papers that focus on intermediate inputs, Van Biesebroeck (2008) finds that productivity improvements do not happen through more imported inputs in Colombia and Zimbabwe. Similarly, Conti et al. (2014) show that importing does not permanently affect firms’ productivity growth in a panel of Italian manufacturing firms. Instead, Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008) find evidence that becoming an importer of foreign intermediates improves productivity for Chilean manufacturing plants, while Paul and Yasar (2009) find similar evidence for Turkish manufacturing plants via a specific outsourcing channel. Positive effects of importing on productivity are also found in Yu and Li (2014) using Chinese firm-level data and Agostino et al. (2016) using a cross-section of European industrial firms. Based on structural estimations, Halpern et al. (2015) show that importing all inputs can affect firm productivity in a sample of Hungarian firms by 22%, of which about half is attributed to an increase in the variety of intermediates used in production. The paper also furthers the literature focusing on firm heterogeneity in trade, and thus the potential self-selection into importing, by showing that firms also differ according to the type of importing activity that they undertake. Castellani et al. (2010) show that more productive firms in the Italian manufacturing sector tend to self-select into both importing and exporting. A similar result is found in Vogel and Wagner (2010) for German firms, Kasahara and Lapham (2013) for Chilean firms and Conti et al. (2014) using a different sample of Italian firms. Kugler and Verhoogen (2009) find not only that more-productive plants select into import markers, but also that they purchase higher-quality inputs. Moreover, these papers find that “two-way traders”, i.e., plants that export and import at the same time, tend to be the most productive, which suggests that there is some complementarity between these two international trade activities. Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2014), Castellani and Fassio (2016) and Agostino et al. (2016) also find evidence of complementarity between exporting and importing. This paper contributes to this literature by looking both at the question of self-selection of firms into different importing activities and at the potential complementarity between exporting, importing intermediate goods and importing capital goods. Moreover, this paper is able to separately identify self-selection into importing and learning-by-importing and, contrary to the results in Vogel and Wagner (2010), finds evidence of both in relation to imported machinery and equipment. The literature, developed by Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) and Ackerberg et al. (2015), using inputs to control for unobservables in production function estimations is particularly relevant for this paper. Unlike most of the previously mentioned papers looking at the effect of importing on productivity, this paper makes sure that all regressors included in the econometric analysis are also part of the underlying productivity process used in the production function estimation. This makes the methodology robust and consistent throughout. Moreover, that the production function estimator developed by Wooldridge (2009) and Petrin and Levinsohn (2012) is expanded to include time-invariant unobserved effects at the plant level. The paper is also related to the literature that studies the effect of import penetration and trade liberalisation in intermediate inputs on productivity. Amiti and Konings (2007) find that productivity increases following a reduction in inputs tariffs, especially for importing firms, during a trade reform in Indonesia. Similar results are found by Topalova and Khandelwal (2011) following the rapid and comprehensive trade reform in India. On the other hand, Altomonte et al. (2014) find that import penetration, both in the same industry and in up-stream industries, leads to an increase in firm productivity in a sample of Italian manufacturing firms. Besides learning-by-importing for capital goods, this paper also finds robust evidence of learning-by-exporting. This result directly links the paper to the literature on the effects of exports on productivity. De Loecker (2007) and De Loecker (2013) find evidence of an improvement in firms’ performance after entering export markets using different methodologies for a sample of Slovenian firms. Further evidence on learning-by-exporting is provided in the literature reviews by Silva et al. (2012) and Wagner (2012). Finally, this paper is related to the literature looking at more general effects of imports. Goldberg et al. (2010) find that a reduction in inputs tariffs increases access to new imported intermediate inputs, which in turn make it possible to introduce new products in the domestic market. Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2014) provide empirical evidence on several direct and indirect channels via which importing more varieties of intermediate inputs increases export scope. Caselli (2014) finds that, following the trade reforms of the 1980s, lower tariffs on machinery and equipment in Mexican manufacturing led to a reduction in the price of machinery and equipment. This, in turn, caused an increase in plant-level demand for skilled workers and, therefore, bid up their wages relative to unskilled workers, thus providing evidence in favour of trade-induced skill-biased technical change. Similar conclusions are reached by Csillag and Koren (2011), who find that workers exposed to imported machines earn higher wages than other machine operators at the same firm. At the aggregate level, Eaton and Kortum (2001) perform a structural estimation of a model of trade in capital goods and find that 25% of cross-country productivity differences can be attributed to variation in the relative price of machinery and equipment, about half of which they ascribe to barriers to trade in such capital goods. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and discusses plants’ characteristics with regards to exporting and importing. The methodology used to estimate productivity alongside some descriptive statistics of such estimates and some preliminary graphical analysis are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 shows the results of a more formal regression analysis on the determinants of productivity and how it is related with importing. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.",19

During this time (1990s), the work of Pissarides (1990, 2000) broke the dichotomy by developing a model in which the rate of technical progress could be shown as directly affecting the labour market’s tightness, as measured by the ratio of vacant jobs to the unemployment rate. According to this theory, high productivity growth increases the expected profits and provides incentives to create new jobs. This outcome has been termed the ‘capitalization effect’ of growth on employment. Later, Aghion and Howitt (1998) find that faster productivity growth, embodied in industrial innovations, generates job destruction rather than job creation, thereby reducing the value of posting vacancies; this was named the ‘creative destruction effect’. Using Pissarides and Aghion and Howitt, Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) show that the two effects (i.e., the ‘capitalization effect’ à la Pissarides and the ‘creative destruction effect’ à la Aghion and Howitt) depend on the type of technology, such that if the technology is disembodied, as in the Solow growth model, even old jobs take advantage of the technological change. In this case, the capitalisation effect is expected to prevail; however, if the technology is embodied, only new jobs can take advantage of technological progress, and old jobs will be destroyed. In the latter case, the creative destruction effect prevails over the capitalisation effect. More recently, Prat (2007) investigates the relationship between unemployment and disembodied technological change using a search-matching model in which firms operate in a stochastic environment. He finds that the effect of technological change on unemployment depends on the degree of uncertainty because unemployment can increase or decrease with the pace of innovation. Despite the importance of the above-mentioned theoretical contributions, there are not many empirical applications for the relationship between growth and employment, and the ones that exist do not produce straightforward results (Bean and Pissarides 1993; Caballero 1993). Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), analysing the rise of unemployment for a panel of 20 OECD countries over 5-year intervals from 1960–2000, conclude that the interaction between shocks and institutions are crucial in explaining trends in unemployment rates in heterogeneous countries. Staiger et al. (2001), using quarterly data for a panel of US states, identify a positive relationship between growth and employment. Investigating the relationship between the total factor productivity (from now on TFP) growth and employment for a panel of 15 industrial countries, Pissarides and Vallanti (2007) conclude that TFP growth has a negative impact on employment in the short term and a positive impact in the long term. Most empirical applications focus on the relationship between growth and employment at a cross-country or country level. However, these analyses neglect the role of regional disparities within countries. Empirical literature shows that regional disparities are larger when compared to cross-countries differences. For the case of the European Union, for instance, economic disparities are persistent despite the acceleration of European integration over the last few decades (Ladu 2010). Thus far, only Ladu (2012) offers a regional analysis, which is based on a panel of 83 regions in 10 European countries between 1976 and 2000. The author finds that when this relationship is investigated at a more disaggregated level (NUTS 2 European regions), the findings of Pissarides and Vallanti (2007) are not confirmed, and the effect of TFP on employment is not positive, even in the long term. Overall, those outcomes indicate that the final results are actually country-specific; therefore, it is crucial to investigate this relationship at a more disaggregated level to determine its implications for regional growth and related policy. A very recent paper by Calligaris et al. (2017), using micro data on Italian firms over the period 1993–2013, explains the productivity slowdown of Italy started in the 1990s and specially since 1995, with firm misallocation of resources within sectors. In other words, they find a within sector problem in the reallocation of factors in firms where technology grows faster. The misallocation is found particularly strong for large firms located in the Northwest regions of Italy. The results of Calligaris et al. (2017) give hints on the interpretation of the “productivity puzzle” in Italy and point out the importance of investigating those issues at more disaggregated level. Moreover, in a sub-national analysis, the effects of economies of agglomeration on employment should be accounted for because according to Glaeser et al. (1992), local employment dynamics may depend on various types of spillovers generated by the agglomeration of firms in the city or region. Therefore, regional and sub-regional analyses need to account for the spatial dynamics in the form of spatial spillovers and externalities because of agglomeration and territorial proximity. Hence, the purpose of the current work is to examine the dynamics of regional employment and productivity growth (measured by the TFP) in Italian regions to see whether job destruction or creation prevails. Specifically, following the approach of Pissarides and Vallanti (2007), the paper investigates the effect of national labour market reforms on regional employment and productivity dynamics in Italy between 1977 to 2003. Furthermore, the work extends the empirical model of Pissarides and Vallanti (2007), adding controls for spatial externalities in the form of specialisation and diversity externalities (Glaeser et al. 1992), as well as productivity spillovers (LeSage and Pace 2009; Elhorst 2010; Vega and Elhorst 2013). The latter measure whether the productivity and technology (TFP) of one region affects the employment of the neighbouring regions. The analysis follows three main steps: in the first step, the TFP for the country as a whole is estimated using the two-stage least squares estimation method (2SLS) and an IV procedure to avoid possible endogeneity issues (Marrocu and Paci 2012). In the second step, we adapt Pissarides and Vallanti’s (2007) model to derive the effect of productivity growth (measured by TFP) on employment. As in Mortensen and Pissarides (1998), Pissarides and Vallanti (2007) use a model in which the impact of TFP on job creation and job destruction depends on the type of technology, that is, whether the new technology is disembodied, as in the Solow growth model, or embodied in new jobs (Schumpeterian type). Finally, in the third step, the empirical model is extended to include various forms of spatial spillovers, such as specialisation and diversity externalities, as well as spatial productivity spillover. The paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 shows some national and regional trends on productivity and employment and provides descriptive statistics on the variables under investigation, as well as the national labour market reforms that occurred throughout the studied period. Section 3 illustrates the model and the methodology and is divided into three main sub-sections: the first one presents the estimation procedure for the measurements of the TFP (Sect. 3.1), the second one estimates the impact of the TFP on employment (Sect. 3.2) and the third one controls for different sources of spatial spillovers (Sect. 3.3). Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 illustrates the main findings and provides further developments.",4

There are several reasons for this. For example, in an inflation targeting economy, inflation expectations are considered to provide information about the credibility the central bank’s inflation target. Poorly anchored long-run inflation expectations can be interpreted as the inflation target having credibility problems.Footnote 1 One policy implication of this is that if the target is not explicitly stated—or expressed clearly enough—it should be made more transparent. In addition, inflation expectations play a key role as a determinant of future inflation in many widely employed models nowadays.Footnote 2 That survey expectations specifically can be useful is a claim that has received some additional support recently. Both Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) and Friedrich (2016) suggest that the “missing disinflation” in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008—see, for example, International Monetary Fund (2013) and Blanchard et al. (2015)—is a puzzle that can be solved by taking the appropriate (survey) inflation expectations into account. It is accordingly of general interest to further investigate if survey measures of inflation expectations provide useful information to analysts and forecasters who aim to understand and predict the evolution of inflation.Footnote 3
 In this paper, we aim to improve the understanding of how survey measures of inflation expectations relate to future inflation. More specifically, we assess the usefulness of survey measures of inflation expectations in Sweden from a forecast perspective. This is done by investigating whether inflation expectations Granger cause inflation. Inflation expectations are said to Granger cause inflation if they improve the forecast precision relative to a model which does not include inflation expectations. We make use of the mean-adjusted Bayesian VAR (BVAR) framework of Villani (2009) to conduct an out-of-sample forecast exercise using quarterly data from 1996 to 2016. Two benchmark models without inflation expectations are used for our analysis: (1) a univariate autoregressive model and (2) a trivariate BVAR model including inflation, the unemployment rate and the 3 month treasury bill rate. We accordingly study the forecast performance of four model sizes. This is done at forecast horizons from one up to twelve quarters—a reasonable focus given that the ability to predict inflation at short to medium term horizons is what matters to policy makers such as central banks. Methodologically, this study is close to other papers using out-of-sample forecast performance to assess Granger causality of various variables for inflation; see, for example Bachmeier et al. (2007), Gavin and Kliesen (2008), Berger and Österholm (2011) and Scheufele (2011). It is also related to studies which rely on VARs to investigate the relationship between survey measures of inflation expectations and inflation, such as Clark and Davig (2008) and Canova and Gambetti (2010). We make a number of contributions relative to the previous literature though. First, Sweden was one of the early adopters of inflation targeting when the policy was declared in 1993. It is of general interest to investigate the issue of Granger causality of survey measures of inflation expectations for inflation in this environment. Second, we provide evidence concerning which survey expectations actually have additional information value for Swedish inflation. Third, we conduct the analysis in a framework—the mean-adjusted BVAR of Villani (2009)—which has not previously been used to assess the Granger causality of survey measures of inflation expectations for inflation. Briefly mentioning our results, they indicate that while inflation expectations might Granger cause Swedish inflation, the quantitative improvement in forecast precision is often small enough to be empirically irrelevant. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the survey data on inflation expectations used for our analysis. The BVAR model and the concept of Granger causality are discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we present the results from our out-of-sample forecast exercise. We conduct a number of sensitivity analyses in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",3

This paper provides econometric estimates of the elasticity of personal income in Italy for the 2000–2012 period and examines some implications for the structure of personal income taxation. The paper begins with an introduction of the main features of the Mirrlees (1971, 1986) optimal taxation model. In later sections the estimates of the average personal income elasticity parameters are applied to the analysis of the welfare consequences of a modification of the structure of personal income taxation introduced by the Renzi-Padoan government: the “80 euro tax bonus”. The review of the tax model is based on the versions recently provided in Diamond (1998) and Saez (2001). The econometric application uses as main sources of data the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) and the OECD Tax Database. The paper describes how the SHIW data on personal income is combined with the tax data in the OECD Tax Database, in order to provide the dataset used in the econometric application. In addition, the paper provides an illustration of the main features of the system of personal income taxation in Italy for the 2000–2012 period and of the changes occurred during the sample period. The analysis focuses on the features of the system of taxation, that are more relevant for the econometric application. The personal income elasticity estimates are robust to different specifications of the set of conditioning variables in the regression model. Moreover, a difference in differences analysis, in correspondence of the two most important reforms of the system or personal income taxation during the sample period, confirms the results obtained in the regression analysis. Finally, the results obtained in estimation are consistent with some of the main findings of the recent econometric literature on the subject. The estimates of the personal income elasticity are more stable, the broader is the definition of the personal income variable. This result provides evidence, that in addition to pure labour supply effects, tax avoidance and income shifting effects are important determinants of the personal income elasticity. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the optimal tax model and describes the econometric regression model used for the estimation of the elasticity of personal income. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 describes the structure of personal income taxation in Italy and the main changes occurred during the 2000–2012 sample period. Section 5 presents the econometric estimates of the personal income elasticity. Section 6 describes the difference in differences estimates, obtained with reference to the two sub-samples 2000–2006 and 2004–2012. Section 7 presents the analysis of the welfare effects of the “80 euro tax bonus”. Some conclusions are drawn in Sect. 8.",
35,2,Economia Politica,16 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-018-0125-3,Immigrants’ employment and the business cycle in Spain: taking account of gender and origin,August 2018,Mercè Sala-Rios,Teresa Torres-Solé,Mariona Farré-Perdiguer,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"There is no doubt that since the end of the 1990s, immigration has become an important issue in the Spanish society and economy. From 2000 to 2005, the number of immigrants quadrupled, reaching in 2010 roughly 12% of the total population. In this year and due to the global economic crisis, a trend towards change was discernible, with the total number of immigrants reduced in both absolute and relative terms. At the beginning of 2016, immigrants comprised about 9.9% of the total population—two points below the pre-crisis levels. The highest proportion of immigrants comes from eastern European countries, South America, and Africa. At the same time, over the years, Spanish immigration has become more gender balanced among foreign-born females and males. A large percentage of the immigrant population are between 20 and 45 years old and play an active role in the labour market. They usually have activity and unemployment rates above those of natives. Data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) indicate that the immigrant activity rate was around 75% and that of natives around 60%. With respect to the unemployment rate, before the 2007 crisis, the rate for immigrants was around 12%, and that for natives was around 8%. During the core of the crisis, the figures increased to 30% and 21%, respectively. Moreover, more than 30% of immigrants are overqualified for the job they carry out (García 2009; Godenau et al. 2014).Footnote 1
 This framework provides the basis for an interesting analysis about how immigrants fare in the labour market and what is their linkage with the business cycle. Research findings on the impact of the business cycle on the immigrants’ labour force demonstrate that the issue is not straightforward. After World War II, the “buffer theory” became popular which argued that during expansion phases, immigrants were helpful to the growth and they had to leave or be sent back during economic downturns (Dobson et al. 2009). However, this special relationship between migratory flows and business cycles was left out because reality showed that economic contractions did not involve a significant decrease in migration rate. There are many factors that explain this circumstance. Among others, we highlight the globalisation of the immigration, the lack of legal status that makes it difficult to return, the economic conditions in the country of origin, the difficulty to move between the origin and destination and the fact that immigrants are not a homogeneous group and their reactions are different during an economic downturn (Bradatan and Kolloju 2015). Since the early 1970s, the international economy underwent important changes fostered by globalisation, the increasing privatisation processes and new technologies, among other key factors. These changes entailed replacing mass production with flexible specialisation. Post-Fordism became the dominant system and was accompanied by the decline of regulation and the rise of global markets. The new capitalism system brought about the deregulation of the labour market, but not people’s mobility. Portes and De Wind (2004) indicate that economic reasons demand that the borders be opened, whereas political and legal logic demand closing them. Globalisation has increased the complexity of migration flows and has raised new motivations related to personal self-realisation (King 2006). However, Massey (2007) points out that the immigrants are still vulnerable due to their class, race and gender. They are vulnerable, which is required by the labour market of the developed countries (Sassen 1988) and, in addition, most of them are concentrated in lower occupational categories in destination countries. This stage traps immigrants in the lower tiers of society, but at the same time, entails a special relationship between their employment and the business cycle fluctuations. Currently, there is a broad consensus in recognising that immigrants relative to natives show larger unemployment sensitivity to business cycles (Aydemir 2003; Orrenius and Zadodny 2009, 2010a, b; Dustmann et al. 2010; Mandelman and Zlate 2012; Prean and Mayr 2016; Clemens and Hart 2017). However, the core of the matter is far from being as simple as it might seem at first sight. This necessitates broadening the scope of research. For instance, it is necessary to analyse whether the response of the immigrants’ labour market supply to movements in economic activity depends on the gender and the origin of the immigrant labour force. We seek to explore this issue. The purpose of this paper is to provide an empirical overview of the relationship between the business cycle and the immigrant employment cycle in Spain, differentiating by gender and origin, during the period 1999–2017. The study focuses on three main goals. First, we identify and compare the phases of the female and male immigrant employment cycles and the phases of the business cycle by means of their turning points. This target also includes the analysis of the differences in the cyclical pattern between immigrants’ and natives’ employment. A well-established methodology is used to examine the intensity of the cycles’ synchronisation. Second, we wonder to what extent the crisis initiated in the middle of 2007 modified the cyclical fluctuations of immigrants’ employment and whether there are significant differences between female and male employment. Finally, we study whether immigrants’ origin plays a role in their employment fluctuations both pre- and during the crisis. We carry out a shift-share analysis to find out whether origin matters. Analyses of the differences between immigrants and natives in employment over the business cycle in Spain have already been conducted (Lacuesta and Puente 2010; De la Rica and Polonyankina 2013; Carrasco and García-Pérez 2015). However, no work has looked at distinctions between gender and place of origin. This paper fills this gap. Such distinctions become noteworthy points in our empirical analysis. In contrast to other studies in this field, what is lost with a holistic perspective is gained through more accurate results. Therefore, our work becomes more significant. In this sense, understanding how immigrants from different origins and different genders face business cycle fluctuations is a key issue, not only from a demographic point of view, but also for any policy recommendation. As this paper offers this information, we will be able to discuss whether the measures adopted by the Spanish government were shaped correctly to optimise the effect of economic growth and to minimise the effects of the downturns in immigrants’ employment. On the other hand, if we find that gender and origin matter, any well-defined model trying to estimate the interactions between immigrants’ employment and economic factors in Spain, should include variables to proxy both gender and origin. The overall conclusions are the following. First, the Spanish economy has more capacity for growth than creating immigrant employment, being more evident in the case of females. However, in contraction phases, females show higher resilience to losing their employment than do males. Second, immigrants are more sensitive to the GDP upturns than natives. Finally, the study also confirms that the origin of immigrants matters. We find that origin influences the immigrant employment fluctuations, in both the pre- and crisis periods. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in this study. Section 3 identifies and compares the cycle phases by means of their turning points. The section closes by exploring the cycles’ synchronisation. Section 4 discusses to what extent the 2007 crisis modified the cyclical fluctuations of immigrants’ employment and whether there are significant differences between females and males. In Sect. 5 we study whether the origin of immigrants matters. The conclusions are drawn in Sect. 6.",1

In this view, public and private overinvestments in education result in lower levels of returns due to the fact that the supply of highly qualified labour is outpacing its relative demand and thus causing a depreciation of college premiums. At a micro level, overeducation is interpreted as a source of inequality among peers, such as workers with the same educational levels but earning different wages once employed in differently demanding jobs (Frank 1978; Berg 1970). Duncan and Hoffman (1981) implement an extended version of the Mincerian equation in order to estimate separately the effects on wages of required, surplus or deficit years of schooling and kick-start the overeducation literature, a popular and much debated economic subfield lying in between labour economics and the economics of education. At the operational level, measuring overeducation consists in assessing the gap between the required and the attained years of schooling for each individual in a given sample. However, while it is quite easy to assess employees’ education with a specific additional question in the questionnaire, measuring what employers are effectively demanding has proved to be less simple, dividing the most of the contributions to this debate between supporters of workers’ self-assessment (WA) or job analysis (JA) measures. On the one side, WA measures can be severely biased by individuals’ characteristics and perceptions. On the other side, JA may neglect the potential influence of supply forces. We contribute to this debate by introducing a new measure for job requirements based on the classification of occupations proposed by Cattani et al. (2014) and assessing its validity with respect to Italian graduates. With respect to the existing literature, the new measure allows to fully exploit the information concerning the cognitive and skill content of the tasks associated to a particular job in a precise and up-to-date manner. Our purpose is to determine the incidence, determinants and impact on earnings of overeducation by using this new measure and iterate the same analysis utilizing an alternative measure based on workers’ self-assessment in order to compare the two different outcomes and to show the benefits of the new measure. The Italian context represents an interesting case study. In early 2000s Italy has experienced a sudden increase in the number of graduates due to the participation expansion in tertiary education. In addition, Italy has completed in this decade the implementation of the so-called “3 + 2” system.Footnote 2 This expansion combined with the dramatic recession that hit the country in the 2008–2012 period, has raised growing concerns on graduates’ overall employability and wage penalties associated with overeducation. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the most relevant measurement issues, Sects. 3 and 4 present the new measurement of overeducation adopted in the paper, Sects. 5 and 6 describe the estimation strategy along with the dataset, Sect. 7 contains some key descriptive statistics, Sect. 8 presents and discusses estimates of the determinants of overeducation and its impact on wages, Sect. 9 performs the robustness checks. Conclusions will follow.",4

Reasons behind the rise of service offshoring are the liberalization of trade, economic and regulatory reforms, technological advances in communication and digitalization, and the new commercialization of certain goods. Nowadays, an important proportion of exchanges of knowledge-intensive services corresponds to the offshoring of research, development and innovation (R&D&I) activities, which are decisive for the economic growth and development of countries. In this respect, the March 2005 OECD Forum on the Internationalization of R&D already recognized the internationalization of R&D as a crucial feature of globalization with a major impact on economic development and public policy. Globalization and the spread of information technologies have influenced the creation of innovation networks (Freeman 1991). For example, aerospace companies obtain some pieces from very specialized foreign providers; manufacturers of food and industrial ingredients buy research studies on dietary habits from external companies in order to meet the requirements of their overseas customers; cars integrate software from other companies to download maps, directions, or music (The Economist Intelligent Unit 2007). Technological sourcing and the delocalization of innovative activities is an important strategy for companies because it can offer the possibility to buy the best available technology (Baumol 2001; Grimpe and Kaiser 2010; Bertrand and Mol 2013). From a firm’s point of view, the internationalization of R&D activities implies substantial potential benefits: a more cost-efficient innovation process, better ability to learn about R&D conducted by other companies/institutions, a quicker road to commercialization, and a positive impact on the firm’s own innovation capacity (OECD 2008). In this analysis, large multinational enterprises (MNEs) are key actors because they benefit from knowledge generated in other countries by both domestic firms and foreign subsidiaries, which are in many instances worldwide centres of knowledge. In addition to MNEs, an important part of R&D offshoring is undertaken by independent-domestic firms with a very different decisional context. The internationalization of R&D&I is also part of the broader process of firms’ internationalization, which includes exporting activities or cooperative agreements with foreign suppliers, customers and even competitors. The recent economic crisis along with the intensified global competition has forced companies to accelerate the internationalization of R&D&I. As a consequence, from a public policy perspective, the globalization of R&D&I has led to the reformulation of national innovation and industrial policies, which have to coexist in global markets with policies developed by supra-national institutions. The purpose of this special issue is to provide new empirical evidence on the increasing phenomenon of globalization of R&D&I. The special issue has collected articles on trends in the internationalization of firms’ R&D&I strategies, as well as its implications on firms’ performance. There is a special focus on the role of Multinationals (MNEs) due to their internationalized structure.",1

Several studies have addressed the main drivers of cooperation strategies, both in theoretical and empirical terms. Contributions in Industrial Organisation literature (Kesteloot and Veugelers 1995; Cassiman and Veugelers 2002; Belderbos et al. 2004) have focused on the role played by spillovers and appropriability in R&D cooperation. This literature has also incorporated key insights from the resource-based view of the firm as well as from evolutionary economics. In particular, firms’ accumulation of technological assets and absorptive capacity (Mowery and Rosenberg 1989; Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990) are seen as a means to shift the balance between incoming and outgoing spillovers in R&D cooperation. Empirical research on this topic has been conducted, over the last 25 years, almost exclusively using evidence from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) firm-level datasets, from various EU countries. In fact, the CIS questionnaire asks specific questions on whether the respondent firm cooperates in R&D, and with which type of partner (other firms, suppliers, clients, universities or research organisations). Within this empirical framework, incoming and outgoing spillovers are usually measured elaborating CIS data derived from firms’ assessment of the importance of competitors, clients, suppliers and universities/research centres as sources of knowledge. As regards firms’ absorptive capacity, internal R&D expenditures/employees or R&D intensity are almost always the unique proxy for it. The richness of CIS data, across different waves and countries,Footnote 1 has allowed the development of several research questions to better assess different aspects of R&D cooperation including: the selection of the most appropriate R&D partner (Belderbos et al. 2004); the specificity of R&D cooperation for SMEs (Chun and Mun 2012); the university-industry cooperation (Veugelers and Cassiman 2005); or cross-country differences in the intensity of R&D cooperation (Srholec 2015). Within this literature, a specific attention has been devoted to the role played by multinational enterprises (MNEs). This is not surprising, as MNEs are key actors in the generation of knowledge spillovers (Blomström and Kokko 1998) and are responsible for a large portion of worldwide business R&D investments (Castellani et al. 2017). However, due to CIS data limitations, these empirical contributions are only able to compare subsidiaries of foreign MNEs with all domestic firms in a country (e.g. like in Srholec 2009) or with firms that are part of a domestic group (see for instance Belderbos et al. 2004, or Guimón and Salazar-Elena 2015). Thus, such works cannot capture differences in R&D cooperation between foreign and domestic MNEs operating in a specific country. Not being able to distinguish between foreign and domestic MNEs, extant empirical literature largely disregards a fundamental source of heterogeneity in R&D cooperation patterns. In fact, foreign and domestic MNEs face substantially different costs and risks when dealing with local counterparts, reflecting their different familiarity with, and experience of, local contexts. On the one hand, foreign MNEs are exposed to greater uncertainty concerning the structural characteristics of host economies and the behaviour of local firms and institutions, giving rise to higher transaction costs. On the other hand, foreign MNEs’ lack of experience of local contexts implies that it may take a long time and costly efforts to engage into an effective communication with local counterparts, thus hindering their capacity learn from, and transfer knowledge to, local firms and institutions. In other words, foreign MNEs will suffer what has been dubbed in international business literature as “liability of foreignness” (Zaheer 1995), whereas domestic MNEs, by definition, will not. In general, the higher the liability of foreignness the lower the propensity of MNEs to get involved in R&D cooperation with local firms and institutions. The aim of this paper is to fill in this gap in the empirical literature, by using novel evidence for the Italian case. We used data from a 10-years panel of respondents to the Italian R&D survey administered by the Italian Bureau of Statistics (ISTAT), including detailed information on R&D activities of firms. Data have been matched with information on the ownership structure of firms (namely from the Bureau van Dijk Aida database). The combined dataset will allow comparing foreign MNEs’ propensity to cooperate in R&D with that of both Italian MNEs and of Italian non-MNEs. It is expected that, while both foreign and domestic MNEs have a higher propensity to set up R&D cooperative agreements with international partners—reflecting their “superior technology” (Hymer 1960) and their “economies of common governance” (Dunning 1993)—there will be a substantial difference in the propensity of the two categories of MNEs in terms of R&D cooperation with local counterparts. Whereas the relative advantages of domestic MNEs in terms of R&D cooperation persist when dealing with local firms and institutions, this does not occur in the case of foreign MNEs. In fact, foreign firms’ multinationality advantages can be more than compensated by their “liabilities of foreignness” hence hindering their capacity to set up effective R&D cooperative linkages with local counterparts. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the literature on the main drivers of R&D cooperation overall and for MNEs in particular; Sect. 3 sketches the analytical framework adopted and derives the research questions we mean to answer with our empirical work; Sect. 4 presents the data used and the empirical strategy; Sect. 5 discusses the results and Sect. 6 concludes.",6

I shall analyse this transformation from the perspective of the different strategies of political economy implemented by the emerging leaders in different natural and social environments in the Near East, by looking at the relationship between these strategies, their social and economic functions in terms of benefit for the population, and the process though which a minority appropriated resources, resulting in increasing inequality. The political and economic prerogatives of the emerging leaders in different early societies and political systems, ranging from chieftainships to Early States, should be considered from a comparative perspective by observing the different degrees of the rulers’ capacity to interfere in the basic economic structures and production systems of the population. What emerges from this comparative analysis is that surpluses were produced for various reasons and purposes, and were used in different ways in differing types of societies, depending also on the political and economic role taken on by the elites (Earle 2015; Risch 2016; Bogaard 2017). Furthermore, the concept itself of ‘wealth’ and its social perception, eschewing all preconceptions conditioned by the contemporary notion of this economic category, varied considerably from one socio-economic context to another. Since the only documentary evidence we have for these very early periods are the remains of the material culture left behind by extinct communities, I will necessarily be referring to the archaeological evidence on which my reconstructive hypotheses are based.",8

The debate surrounding the introduction of the allowance of capital equity (ACE)-type tax was primarily focused on the possibility of improving the balance of firms’ capital finance and the equilibration between the different methods of financing, namely, equity and debt. Ultimately, in the 1990s, ACE was elaborated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Capital Taxes Group in order to balance the opportunity costs of debt and equity (IFS Capital Taxes Group 1991). The introduction of ACE was also proposed by different organizations, such as the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); they highlight the importance of implementing tax policies aimed at disincentivizing an excessive leverage ratio of corporations and consequently reducing systemic risk. In a study prepared for the European Commission, a group of experts (Various Authors 2008) suggested the introduction of an ACE mechanism among different alternative instruments. The IMF (2009) proposed the introduction of ACE as a mechanism to incentivize self-financing, and it had also previously been discussed by the IFS (1991). Now that ACE has been introduced in different countries, it is possible to analyze its effect on a more comprehensive range of firms’ performances. In particular, the present study may be framed in the context of an analysis of the effects of corporate taxes on investment. In 1998, Italy introduced a restricted version of an ACE, called dual income tax (DIT). This was part of a broad reform of business taxation that had the primary aim of selectively reducing the burden of taxation so as to correct the historical imbalance between equity and debt financing in the Italian tax system. Under the DIT scheme, a lower statutory rate is applied to the portion of profits representing the book value of new equity. For the beneficiary firms, the increase of capital (new capital subscription plus retained earnings) implied a structural reduction of the corporate tax burden. In 2000 and 2001, the book value was raised to 140% of the new equity stock, in order to rapidly meet the coverage of the entire capital stock. Beginning in 2001, several modifications to the original regime were introduced to restrain its effects, and it remained in place until 2004 when it was definitively abolished. The effect of the DIT on firms’ performances was analyzed by Balzano et al. (2011), via a structural equation model (SEM) and by utilizing the following manifest variables to explain a company’s performance: operating surplus, value added, investments in tangible/intangible assets, and turnover from exports. This empirical analysis showed that the DIT allowance positively affected firms’ performances, as defined on the basis of the specified factors. ACE was newly introduced in Italy in 2011, and it shares the main characteristic of the British ACE and some characteristics of the Italian DIT. According to the law compilers, the main aims of ACE were to boost Italy’s economic growth through a reduction of firms’ tax liabilities and to enhance the capital structure of Italian companies. The first target might be achieved by a reduction of investment costs, driven by a balancing of corporate financing and this, in turn, may lead to an improvement in investment tendency and productivity. The present paper aims to identify the effect of ACE on investment, following its reintroduction to the Italian tax system in 2011. The causal evaluation of the investment effects that resulted from the introduction of ACE was estimated via a difference-in-difference (DiD) model that contrasted the investment behavior of ACE beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows: the next section reviews existing studies that aimed to quantify the effects of ACE on firms’ behavior, particularly the investment tendency, Sect. 3 describes the reform of ACE in more detail, Sect. 4 describes the data, and Sect. 5 details the adopted methodology. Section 6 presents the results and economic interpretations, and conclusions are drawn in Sect. 7.",2
35,3,Economia Politica,01 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-018-0106-6,The network of migrants and international trade,December 2018,Rodolfo Metulini,Paolo Sgrignoli,Massimo Riccaboni,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the mid 1990s a growing body of research has investigated the relation between migration and international trade. Whereas the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model suggests that the movement of goods across borders can substitute for the movement of production factors such as labour, the most recent empirical works show that the two movements complement each other. In particular, a large body of literature finds that the presence of migrant communities enhances trade between their home countries and the new place of residence: this holds for different countries [e.g USA, Canada, Spain, Italy and France, see respectively (Gould 1994; Head and Ries 1998; Peri and Requena-Silvente 2010; Bratti et al. 2014; Briant et al. 2014)] and has recently been confirmed by a meta-analysis covering 48 different studies (Genc et al. 2012). As it often happens, empirical findings have percolated to economic theory, with recent models being able to accommodate the complementarity between migration and trade (Felbermayr et al. 2015). One of the main findings in the literature is that the pro-trade effect of migration is stronger in the case of differentiated goods, for which specific knowledge is particularly valuable (Rauch and Trindade 2002).Footnote 1
 Similar results have been replicated by a number of later works, using a variety of datasets and techniques. Peri and Requena-Silvente (2010), for instance, analysed the Spanish case and found that doubling the number of immigrants from a given country increases exports to the same destination by 10%. This effect is higher for firms selling differentiated products and for more distant countries (geographically or culturally). Aleksynska and Peri (2014) focused on the share of migrants involved in business activities rather than the total migrant population, and found a significant effect, even after controlling for the overall bilateral stock of migrants. 
Briant et al. (2014) used a fine geographical disaggregation based on French departments to investigate the effect of migration on trade in goods with different degrees of complexity, as well as across countries with various levels of institutional quality: regardless of the quality of institutions in the partner country, migration is more pertinent for complex goods, whereas it matters also for simple products only when the institutional quality of the source country is low. A similar substitution effect between migrants and institutions is found in Ehrhart et al. (2014), who focused on African countries. The core of the argument is that formal and informal links among co-ethnic migrants in other countries and at home facilitate trade by providing potential trading partners with access to valuable information. The pro-trade effect thus stems from the reduction of trade barriers and search costs associated with market transactions. Since these costs are likely to be larger for international trade due to distance, language and cultural differences, legal provisions and the like, ethnic networks end up being especially relevant in facilitating cross-border transactions. Most of the empirical literature shares a common strategy, based on the estimation of a log-linear gravity model where bilateral trade flows are regressed over standard explanatory variables (economic “mass” and distance), the stock of migrants from specific partner countries, and other controls aimed at capturing various types of trade costs (e.g. common language, colonial relationships). The two main strands of research that have emerged investigate the direct relation between trade and migration [i.e. the impact of migration from i to j on import/export flows between the same countries, see for instance Gould (1994) and Genc et al. (2012)], and the existence of an indirect effect. For example, Rauch and Trindade (2002) investigated the role of ethnic Chinese communities, whereas Felbermayr et al. (2010) extended the analysis to several other diasporas. In parallel to these developments in the trade-migration literature, the past decade has witnessed important advances in the theoretical foundations of the gravity model (Anderson 1979; Eaton and Kortum 2002; Anderson and van Wincoop 2003; Feenstra 2003; Helpman et al. 2008), as well as in its estimation methods (Glick and Rose 2002; Egger 2004; Head and Mayer 2014). The literature has suggested that special care is necessary in the empirical analysis to account for the interdependencies between trade flows which are inherent in the estimation of a general equilibrium model. In fact, Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) showed that bilateral export does not only depend on bilateral trade costs, the size of the trading economies and other dyad-specific characteristics, but also on multilateral trade resistance (MTR) i.e. the overall set of trade barriers that exporter and importer countries face. Several ways to account for MTR have been proposed: these involve the use of country-specific fixed effects (Feenstra 2003), export- and import-specific dummies (Anderson and van Wincoop 2004), measures of geographic remoteness (Helliwell 1998), origin and destination-specific spatial filters (Patuelli et al. 2016; Metulini et al. 2018) as well as more sophisticated methods (see Head and Mayer 2014 for an excellent survey). With regards to spatial econometric approaches, Behrens et al. (2012) claimed that a consistent estimation of the gravity equation can be obtained by adopting a spatial autoregressive moving average specification and using it as a proxy for MTR. The main approach to analyze the indirect effect of migration on trade, is to look at migration from a common source country i to countries j and h [see for instance the seminal contribution by Rauch and Trindade (2002)]. The empirical evidence shows that migration does have a positive effect on trade between j and h, on top of the direct effect on trade from i to j and from i to h. In this paper we take a different standpoint to investigate how migration reduces trade barriers through a “market familiarization effect”. We argue that trade from j to h can increase because of direct trade effects from j to h as well as indirect effects due to migration from j to i and from i to h. In our case country i is not a common source country, like in Rauch and Trindade (2002), but an intermediate country in the migration network. For instance Italians (i) are familiar with the Albanian trade opportunities, as there is a large Albanian community in Italy. When Italians migrate to France (h) they bring their knowledge with them, thus facilitating trade between Albania (j) and France (h). The empirical methodology is similar to that of Behrens et al. (2012): we estimate a spatial autoregressive model in a gravity setup to account for MTR. Instead of adopting a standard geographic metric based on proximity, we define a weight matrix in which neighbours are countries with strong migration ties. The main novelty of our approach is to use network analysis to identify significant migration links. Namely, the weight matrix is build upon the worldwide migration network that connects countries based on the share of fellow citizens of the same nationality they host. Our approach allows us to properly identify the indirect effect of migration by considering at the same time the interdependencies among trade flows that would otherwise lead to inconsistent estimates (Behrens et al. 2012). In a nutshell, this paper studies the indirect effect of migrants on trade due to ethnic communities abroad, combining network analysis and spatial econometrics. We define a weight matrix based on the migration network to properly assess the indirect effect of all ethnic communities by means of a single estimated coefficient, whereas the related literature generally estimates a coefficient for each ethnicity.Footnote 2
 The rest of the paper is structured as follows: our empirical strategy is laid down in Sect. 2, where we illustrate the rationale of our approach, the model specification, and the data we use. Section 3 discusses our main results, while Sect. 4 concludes.",6

Production prices have thus been often considered as those prices that make it possible to reproduce all commodities at the level of the entire system.Footnote 1 But, if we only simplify the price equations of a self-replacing system, we see that the reproducibility conditions break down, even though the system remains able to determine the same set of semi-positive prices which allow each industry to reintegrate the value of the means of production employed and to obtain a uniform rate of profit among them (which can be positive or zero). Consequently, a logical difference between the notion of production prices and that of self-reproducibility can be established. To this purpose, we will define a system as viable if it is possible to determine a set of production prices which puts each industry in the condition to reintegrate the value of the means of production employed and obtain a uniform (non-negative) rate of profit. Alternatively, we will define a system as self-replacing if the quantities produced by each industry are sufficient to repeat the production processes at least on an unchanged scale. It will be easy to verify that self-replacing systems are viable but not necessarily vice versa. The notion of viability comes thus to be characterized in the sphere of values; this view is more suitable for Sraffa’s approach, where quantities are determined separately from the relations involving commodity prices and distributive variables. In addition, it allows us to see that production prices can be computed also for systems which are not in self-replacing conditions. The possibility that a viable system is not in a self-replacing condition was merely hinted at by Sraffa in a footnote in the first chapter of Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities. Moreover, in his ‘reply’ to Roy Harrods’ review of the book (see Harrod 1961), Sraffa (1962) disproves a conclusion drawn by Harrod by modifying the numerical example provided in the first paragraph of the book, in such a way to make it a system with a negative net product for one commodity and a surplus for the other one (i.e. a non-self-replacing system). Far from being an exception, the case of non-self-replacing systems represents a typical situation of actual economies. Growing industries coexist alongside declining industries as a result of many factors: changes in the composition of final demand, technical progress, etc. These factors have been extensively analysed in the economic literature,Footnote 2 but further analysis is still needed to reconnect these situations with Sraffa’s price system. This is one purpose of the present paper, and will be developed in Sects. 2–4. In his book Sraffa carried out his analysis in two steps: he considered subsistence systems in Chapter I and surplus systems from Chapter II onward. These steps cannot be replicated in the same way here, because in this paper we distinguish between viable and self-replacing systems. A distinction will thus be made between systems with a null maximum rate of profit, R = 0, described in Sect. 2, and systems with a positive maximum rate of profit, R > 0, described in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 the cases of non-basic products and of joint production are briefly addressed. The analysis of non-self-replacing systems raises immediately a crucial question, which is common to all situations where output levels change systematically: how do we guarantee the persistency of production prices, a property that must be preserved in order to regarded them as centres of gravitation? This is quite a subtle issue on which the specialized literature is not unanimous, since it concerns the opportunity of introducing assumptions concerning returns. After a brief description of the various views, the assumption of constancy of technical coefficients with respect to changes in output levels will be appraised in light of Sraffa’s overall analysis. It will be here argued that this specification can be done without prejudice to the main purposes pursued by Sraffa. This is the second goal of the present paper, and will be dealt with in Sect. 5. Section 6 provides the concluding remarks.",4

Recent experimental evidence, however, is inconsistent with this framework. The main explanations hinge on the importance of internal motivations, based on the adherence to an internal moral standard, and on customs and social conformity, since deviant behaviors are often punished socially, over and above any legal punishment. The consequence is that people comply with a moral standard even if they suffer an expected monetary loss. In the case of tax evasion, the intrinsic and social motivation to pay taxes based on moral considerations and social pressure is called “Tax Morale” (Erard and Feinstein 1994; Frey 1997; Slemrod 2007) and it has been used to reconcile the predicted evasion rate by the Allingham and Sandmo (1972) and Yitzhaki (1974) models, based on expected penalties and risk aversion only, with the much smaller observed evasion rate (Andreoni and Jonathan 1998; Sandmo 2005). The founder of the Italian website evasori.info engaged in a very interesting experiment to spread awareness of tax evasion in Italy, in the hope to foster tax morale. In particular, this site allows the users to report, anonymously, their economic transactions with sellers that failed to issue a receipt to avoid paying taxes. The reports are then summarized by economic activity and geographic location. Russo (2013) shows that the number of tax evasion reports in a given area, scaled by the overall size of the illegal sector in the same area, is indeed a measure of tax morale at the local level. Basically the number of reports depends on the mass of individuals that consider evasion dishonest and on how forcefully and often they manifest their convictions, both of which are indicators of tax morale. In this paper I propose instead an analysis of the incentives behind the reports. An individual will report evasion if the utility from reporting is bigger than the cost. Since the cost of making a report is fixed, if the utility is an increasing function of the transaction amount, say because it is more satisfactory to report big evaders, then there is a threshold amount above which tax evasion will be reported. Stronger tax morale implies a higher utility from reporting, either because evasion is considered less morally acceptable or because it is more difficult to categorize it (Mazar et al. 2008). A higher utility from reporting, in turn, implies a smaller threshold above which tax evasion is reported. The result is a negative relationship between tax morale and the median reported amount. In other words, tax morale makes it more difficult to overlook tax evasion on small transactions. I propose an empirical test of this prediction. The empirical analysis features a regression of the median reported amount of the transactions with evasion on the measure of tax morale in Russo (2013), the number of reports per unit of irregular activity. The regression features province fixed effects, time dummies and economic activity fixed effects. Since the number of reports and the amount reported are jointly determined, I use an exogenous instrument to obtain consistent estimates. In particular, I use variation in population density to instrument tax morale. I find that a bigger number of reports per irregular activity, which indicates a stronger individual and social norm against evasion, is negatively associated with the median reported amount. To exclude that this negative regression coefficient is just the by-product of the evasion reporting process, I propose a Montecarlo exercise. The concern is that, within an economy, there are typically more transactions of small amount. Therefore observing more tax evasion reports, whose number is used to measure tax morale, might mechanically deliver a lower median reported value simply out of oversampling of small transactions. The simulation clearly shows how the empirical results are indeed consistent with the idea that the threshold below which tax evasion is considered acceptable decreases with the strength of the norm against evasion. This simulation allows me also to estimate the value of the threshold and the parameters of the function that summarizes its dependency on tax morale. The analysis of the individual motivations behind the tax evasion reports is important because it stresses that tax evasion on transactions of small amount is often overlooked, although less likely the stronger is the individual and social sanction of evasion. Therefore strengthening tax morale, by making petty evasion more salient, will help reducing its overall amount. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 briefly summarizes the related economic literature. Section 3 illustrates the conceptual framework. Section 4 describes the dataset. Section 5 summarizes the regression results. Section 6 proposes a montecarlo simulation of the evasion reporting process and an estimation of the threshold above which tax evasion is reported. Section 7 discusses the robustness of the empirical results. Section 8 concludes.",1

Precisely, by means of a structural VAR model (hereinafter, SVAR) we use labor productivity, real wage and unemployment to identify the structural shocks affecting their pattern in the long and short-run. We will label them as technology, markup and aggregate demand shocks, respectively. Then, the impulse responses of each variable to shocks provide the measure of their (relative) elasticity in explaining the behavior of labor market for six OECD countries, namely Italy, France, Spain, Germany, UK and USA. As it is well known, the theoretical relationship among labor productivity, real wages and unemployment is mixed. On the one hand, labor market models which rely on aggregate demand shocks predict procyclical real wages and unemployment (see e.g., Gamber and Joutz 1993). On the other hand, labor market models which rely on aggregate supply shocks predict that aggregate demand shocks have no long run impact on real wages and unemployment (Balmaseda et al. 2000; Blanchard and Johnson 2013; Blanchard and Galì 2007). These conflicting views are also fed by the mixed empirical evidence which suggest that the behavior of real wage and productivity is of little use for distinguishing among competing theories (Gordon 1995). However, to the extent that movements in these variables are produced by supply and demand shocks, the aim of this paper is to identify the structural shocks which impinge upon their dynamics. The identification of the structural shocks can be achieved by means of alternative methodologies (Enders 2014). Among these, we will follow the one provided by Blanchard and Quah (1989) and other authors (Gamber and Joutz 1993; Clarida and Galì 1994; Balmaseda et al. 2000; Gambetti and Pistoresi 2004; Saltari and Travaglini 2009). Precisely, the identification is achieved by imposing restrictions on the matrix of long-run multipliers of the estimated VAR model in order to interpret the reduced form innovations as structural shocks resulting from different sources. To distinguish among shocks, we will assume that only technology shock affects the stochastic component of labor productivity in the long-run. There is an extensive body of empirical literature that justifies this assumption (Galì 1999; Gamber and Joutz 1993). This literature is also consistent with a large class of theoretical models of labor market (Galì 1999; Blanchard et al. 1997; Saltari and Travaglini 2009; Saltari et al. 2010). Then, as in Gambetti and Pistoresi (2004), and in Blanchard and Johnson (2013), we will assume that the markup shocks will affect the real wages in the long-run. Finally, we identify the demand shocks by imposing the restriction that aggregate demand shocks do not affect the productivity in the long-run, but that aggregate demand shocks have no long-run impact on the growth of real wage (Gamber and Joutz 1993; Saltari et al. 2010; Calcagnini and Travaglini 2014). Using this identification’s scheme, we provide a simple interpretation of the observed jointly movements in productivity, real wage and unemployment. These movements are consistent with the dynamic properties of a standard Solow’s growth model where technology shocks affect labor productivity in the long-run, and where the long-run component of real wages is driven by productivity and markup shocks, but not from aggregate demand shocks. However, in our model the aggregate demand shocks have permanent effects on the level of unemployment in the long run. Similar results can also be obtained in an insider–outsider framework consistent with the hysteresis assumption (Blanchard and Summers 1986; Balmaseda et al. 2000). The added value of the present paper lies in three main features. First, our theoretical model provides new insights compared to Balmasseda et al. (2000), and Gambetti and Pistoresi (2004). Precisely, we propose an identification scheme ordered in labor productivity, real wage and unemployment. This ordering is derived from an AD-AS model capturing the main characteristics of the European economies. We show that technology shocks determine the growth rate of the economies through the variation of labor productivity. This is different from Balmasseda et al. (2000) which, using an implicit assumption of continuous equilibrium, employ the real wage to proxy the shocks in technology, for a group of OECD countries. Also, our set up is different from the AD-AS version of Gambetti and Pistoresi (2004) where the aggregate demand is not affected by technology shocks, and where a labor supply function shapes the firms’ behavior as in an insider–outsider model of labor market. Contrariwise, in our model the aggregate demand is (at least partially) affected by technology shocks. These shocks affect both the value of income (in effective units) and the “natural” level of unemployment. As it will become clear below, these assumptions are accepted by the data. As second point, we extend, on the empirical ground, the period of observation until the more recent years (from 1960 to 2017). The previous literature arrives at most at 1999. Our longer time horizon provides additional information about the heterogeneous impacts of the structural shocks beating the European labor markets. Importantly, the present analysis accounts for how the main European countries and USA react to the same structural shocks, and for how the asymmetric adjustments of any single economy shape costs and benefits of the shared policies. Lastly, our identification scheme is based upon the evidence that the level of unemployment is an I(1) process. The stationary tests confirm this empirical property for all countries under consideration, and provide further elements of novelty compared to the response functions analyzed in the previous papers and their policy implications. We get three main results. For all countries analyzed in the paper (Italy, France, Spain, Germany, UK and USA) the conditional correlations between productivity and real wage are positive for both supply and demand shocks. Then, the impulse responses show a persistent increase of both productivity and real wage to supply shocks. Finally, the level of unemployment shows a persistent decrease after a positive aggregate demand shock. This latter evidence provides a renewed perspective on the European policies designed to reduce unemployment. Indeed, it poses again the idea that Keynesian policies can have long-lasting effects on the labor market equilibrium, without depressing labor productivity and real wage in the long run. Therefore, our analysis revives the view of the unemployment productivity trade-off schedule (Gordon 1995) and of the possibility that countercyclical demand policies can decreases unemployment without crowding out productivity and real wages in the long run. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a simplified labor market model derived from a modified AD-AS framework. In Sect. 3, we discuss the implementation of the SVAR model, the statistical properties of the variables included in the analysis, and the dynamic features of the impulse response functions. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes with some policy implications.",4

At the same time, liquidity is an investment in short term assets alternative to other forms of resource allocation with important implications for corporate profitability, risk and financial soundness, and, more generally, for economic growth (Campello et al. 2012; Graham and Leary 2017; Denis 2011; Gryglewicz 2011). The literature has recognized a number of firm-specific characteristics that can explain corporate demand for cash (e.g.: Opler et al. 1999; Ferreira and Vilela 2004). These determinants are related to the most important motives for holding cash, like the presence of transaction costs, information asymmetry in credit markets, uncertainty and risk aversion. Even though liquidity management is not a new topic,Footnote 1 in recent years more academic work on the subject has been spurred by the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 and by the following sovereign debt crisis which have highlighted the relevance of liquidity and financial flexibility (Campello et al. 2011). However, the study of corporate cash holdings has been thoroughly analyzed, especially with regard to listed companies in the US. For these firms a substantial increase in cash holdings during the 2000s is well documented: the trend began before the global financial crisis and seems to be continuing (Almeida et al. 2014). Cash-rich firms have thus received considerable attention both in the business press and in academic research, spurring a debate on the motives behind the unprecedented accumulation of corporate cash and the economy-wide implications. In this paper we investigate how cash holdings of Italian firms has evolved from 2002 to 2015, thus encompassing the period heavily influenced by the sovereign debt crisis and by its negative impact on the real economy. We believe that Italy is a very interesting case study in corporate liquidity, on account of both structural and cyclical factors: financial markets are less developed in Italy than in the US, there is a high proportion of small non-listed firms, and in recent years the economic recession together with the credit market downturns have severely challenged the financial soundness of firms. To the best of our knowledge, the evidence for Italy for the years following 2007 is still scant. Corporate cash holdings in Italy has been analysed by Bigelli and Sánchez-Vidal (2012) for the years between 1996 and 2005 using a sample of about 17 thousands firms. Ferreira and Vilela (2004) and Calcagnini et al. (2009) have included data from Italian firms in a multi-country analysis on the determinants of corporate liquidity, mainly focusing on the comparison between different institutional settings. With respect to these studies, our research allows to provide more evidence in both the cross-section and longitudinal dimensions: our sample covers about 460,000 firms per year including many that are small and not listed, and it considers the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the years that follow. We first document a sharp increase in cash holdings (measured by the cash-to-asset ratio) from 2011 to 2015. This fact is not simply due to composition effects relating to the entrance and exit of firms, but rather it significantly holds also within firms present in the whole interval. Next, we perform an econometric analysis exploiting the longitudinal and multivariate nature of the dataset, assessing the role of cash determinants at the firm level and relating them to different reasons for holding cash, such as precautionary concerns, transaction costs, and the effects of information asymmetries in financial markets. Using our estimates, we then address the recent rise in the cash ratio by decomposing it into the contributing factors common to all firms, the cash determinants at firm level, and the changing composition of firms’ fixed factors. Our findings suggest that a major role was played by macro factors common to all firms, and a strong correlation emerges between these macro factors and the generalized decline in interest rates in the period. This relationship could be driven, among other possible links, by the lower opportunity cost of holding cash when interest rates are lower. Among firm-specific variables, in the first years of the rise a major contribution was associated to the fall in investments as firms reduced their capital expenditure by a sizeable amount and showed a higher propensity to cumulate cash when they refrain from investing; in the last years under analysis, a growing role was played by the improvement in cash flows and the enhanced deleveraging process. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we review extant literature on the determinants of cash holdings. Section 3 describes the sample and provides a descriptive analysis. In Sect. 4 we present our econometric model and estimates. Section 5 introduces into the analysis macro variables common across firms. In Sect. 6 we decompose the recent rise in the cash ratio into the firm-specific factors and macro variables. Section 7 concludes.",2

A prominent part of this literature is presented in endogenous growth theories such as “Schumpeterian” models, which suggest that an economy’s growth rate is increasing with an increase in Research and Development (R&D) productivity and is positively correlated with the increase in patents, rate of firms’ entry and exit and the introduction of new products (Aghion and Howitt 1998, p. 434). This is further supported by various empirical studies showing a positive relation between innovation and economic growth (see for instance: Capello and Lenzi 2014; Ulke 2004). Even when acquiring foreign technology, domestic innovational efforts (e.g.: R&D spending) are still regarded as essential for the sake of creating “absorptive capacity” allowing better use of available technology (Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990). Lack of in-house innovational endeavors hinders learning by doing in many developing countries (El-Elj 2012, p. 187). Romijn and Caniëls (2011) suggested that developing “domestic capabilities for creative innovation” which addresses local needs is required, especially now in a world faced by “unprecedented challenges” (e.g.: resource depletion, population pressure, etc.). But, if innovation plays a decisive role for economic growth, how could it be fostered? Intuition tells us that good policies and regulations are needed to realize this objective. These could range from providing tax incentives, to increasing public investment in education and training, to easing credit allocation for R&D, to many other possible alternatives. Yet, efficiently formulating and conducting such innovation-related policies and regulations necessitate on their turn the presence of good institutions. In terms of Good Governance terminologies, this would translate into high regulatory quality and government effectiveness. Nevertheless, such needed institutional capacities are often missing in different societies; and institutional development needs substantial resources and time (Enderwick 2005, pp. 119–120). This poses the need for finding another mechanism that could substitute and counteract such institutional deficiencies, a mechanism that would efficiently formulate and implement policies and regulations needed for fostering innovation. It is based on these concerns that intensive consultations stemming from closer State Business Relations (SBR) could be suggested to provide such a mechanism. It is suggested in the literature on SBR that they could be helpful in addressing business and government failures, building trust, fostering exchange of information between the government and businesspeople as well as helping in the formulation of better policies (see Sabry 2013, 2017b; Leftwich and te Velde 2010; Hausmann et al. 2008; Haggard et al. 1997 among others). All of these are relevant for efforts needed to foster innovation. In developing countries, often suffering from various institutional deficiencies, the need for state–business consultation seems to be even higher. There is the risk, however, that close SBR could encourage cronyism (see Sabry 2013, 2017a, b), where the benefit in terms of innovation and more generally economic improvement could be minimal and/or confined to few connected businesspersons. Cronyism is preferential treatment provided by officials to businesspersons (or others) who are socially (e.g.: old friends and associates) or politically connected to them, regardless to businesspersons’ qualifications (Begley et al. 2010; Mazumdar 2008). Cronyism is widely regarded as having negative economic consequences, for instance, because of distorting economic incentives and augmenting transaction costs. Yet, some scholars argue that cronyism, on the contrary, lower transaction costs, help in the circulation of better information, agreement enforcement, and cost reduction, and eventually lead to economic growth (Kang 2003). If such claims are true, cronyism could provide a mechanism for fostering innovation, even if it benefited only the few connected. Again, arguably, such a mechanism could be needed more when institutional deficiencies exist. This presents us with two alternatives for fostering innovation especially in societies suffering from institutional deficiencies. The first is formal state–business consultations. These are councils where representatives from the government and businesspeople (and sometimes others) convene, discuss issues of concern and formulate policies. Formal state–business consultation could refer to Social and Economic Councils, business forums and Public Private Dialogues (PPD).Footnote 1 The second alternative is cronyism, which is more likely induced by informal SBR (Sabry 2013, 2017b), or relations based on social (familial, tribal, etc.) and political (e.g.: common party membership) connections between state officials and businesspersons. When privileges—such as subsidies, credit allocations, and market domination—are provided for those socially and politically connected businesspersons, cronyism is the ultimate result. Arguably, if cronyism could truly facilitate information exchange, reduce transaction costs and act as a mechanism for consultation (even if it is benefiting the few), it could possibly then counteract institutional deficiencies that hinder formulating policies and regulations fostering innovation. Based on these considerations this paper is presented. It is trying to investigate whether formal state–business consultations (or simply PPD) and/or cronyism could counteract low institutional capacities and provide the needed mechanisms for fostering innovation. It is doing this with the help of a theoretical discussion followed by an empirical study based on an OLS multivariate panel econometric model. The novelty of this paper rests on trying to explore an important, yet under-researched, topic. There is insufficient research on how innovation is affected generally by SBR, and more specifically by either formal or informal forms of SBR. Empirical studies are even scarcer in this regard. These are questions that need to be explored in more depth, something that hardly exist in the present literature.",6

It is defined as an ongoing process that excludes individuals or groups from social, economic and cultural networks (Lee and Murie 1999), preventing them from participating fully in the normal activities of their community (Silver 1994). The Europe 2020 strategy includes the reduction of social exclusion among its focuses, emphasising the role of sustainable and inclusive growth (EC 2010). Several tools have been devised to tackle social exclusion, not only by governmental bodies, but also by the civil society and other actors (Kabeer 2006; Khan et al. 2015), whose role in ensuring a voice for the excluded has become preeminent over the last decades (O’Neil and Piron 2003; Popay et al. 2008). Policy responses have included legislative measures aimed at tackling discrimination at the national level, welfare measures in support of inclusion, and the establishment and promotion of inclusive institutions (Carter 2014). Anti-discrimination laws may make a relevant difference in some contexts, where excluded groups suffer formal discrimination, while formal prescriptions fail to discourage discriminatory behaviours, with particular regard to the access to the labour market (Buvinić et al. 2004; Tomasevski 2006). Social protection schemes represent a popular tool of the policy agenda (Alexander 2015): intended as a means for redistribution, they contribute to provide some degree of insurance against the financial implications of social risks, cushioning people against poverty and social exclusion (EC 2010). In developing countries, the new social assistance programmes aim to invest in the productivity and resilience of poor and vulnerable households with children, particularly those left outside of traditional programmes (Carroll 2011; Olivier 2011; Babajanian and Hagen-Zanker 2012; Browne 2015). Inclusive institutions are widely presented by international development agencies as a means to promote social inclusion and tackle inequality, since they ‘bestow equal rights and entitlements, and enable equal opportunities, voice and access to resources and services’ (Mcloughlin 2012; Carter 2014). In a broader perspective, all aspects of the welfare state, including pension systems and healthcare services may play a preventive role against social exclusion, although some specific functions such as unemployment benefits, housing and social assistance schemes are more directly targeted to alleviating poverty and social exclusion (Alexander 2015). Some governments in Latin America for instance, introduced conditional cash transfers to poor families, in order to improve schooling and access to healthcare services (Sojo et al. 2003; Khan et al. 2015). Such programmes aim to reduce vulnerability in the short run and to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty in the long run, by turning children from poor families into full and productive members of the society (Kabeer et al. 2010; Polat 2011, 2012; Mercado 2012). The sociological literature highlights the role of cultural goods in promoting tolerance and fostering social inclusion (Sandell 1998; Belfiore 2002; Coffee 2008; Kavanagh 2014). The effect of cultural consumption in this perspective is twofold: (1) it helps create relational ties, thus decreasing social exclusion directly and (2) it strengthens social conscience, building a more inclusive environment, that reduces social exclusion indirectly. Cultural consumption contributes to defining value structures and behaviours at the individual level (Katz-Gerro 2004; Lizardo 2006; Turel et al. 2010): for example, attendance to classical music concerts is associated with lower smoking levels (Pampel 2006). More broadly, cultural consumption participates in shaping cultural and social identity (DiMaggio and Useem 1978; Katz-Gerro 2002; Alexander 2003; Van Eijck and Van Oosterhout 2005). The consumption of cultural items such as classical music concerts, opera and musicals, has been shown to increases political engagement, social participation and awareness of societal issues (Leung and Kier 2008; Curtis 2011; Lizardo and Skiles 2015). In a similar fashion, museum visits reinforce the sense of belonging to a certain community and strengthen social identity, fostering tolerance and fighting prejudice (Sandell 1998; Janes 2011), while attending theatre shows may induce citizens to develop a stronger social culture (Castiglione and Infante 2016). Overall, the arts are recognised as a factor that promotes social inclusion by improving the community’s performance in terms of health, crime, employment and education (Belfiore 2002). Alongside academic studies, the UK government recognised the positive role of cultural consumption, as reported by the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU 2001): ‘Arts and sport, cultural and recreational activity, can contribute to neighbourhood renewal and make a real difference to health, crime, employment and education in deprived communities’. Public expenditure on cultural goods is therefore justified by the indirect social advantages it produces (Vestheim 1994). This seemingly unchallenged consensus finds wide support in the theoretical literature. To our knowledge however, the idea that cultural consumption reduces social exclusion has never been proved empirically. The present work tests this argument, proposing the Cultural Consumption Index (CCI) that assesses the size of cultural consumption in a certain region, and measuring whether it affects social exclusion in a spatial framework. We use local level (NUTS-2) data on the Regions of Italy, over the 2004–2014 timespan, looking for spatial clusters in social exclusion. Our contribution aims to shed some light on the robustness of these clusters when cultural consumption is accounted for.

A systematic review,April 2019,Jasmine Mondolo,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In recent decades, pervasive processes of modernisation, globalisation and technological progress have made the world economies increasingly dynamic and interconnected, and have fostered the development of multinational firms. One of the main measures of these companies’ activity is represented by foreign direct investments (FDI), defined by the OECD as investments in a foreign company in which the investor owns at least 10% of the ordinary shares, undertaken with the objective of establishing a “lasting interest” in the host country, a long-term relationship and a significant influence on the management of the firm (OECD 2008). In the last 20 years, research in international business and international economics has been paying increasing attention to the effects of FDI on the host economies. For instance, domestic firms can benefit from the knowledge transfer deriving from the creation of links with foreign companies, and come into contact with different and sometimes more advanced technologies and managerial practices (Blomström and Kokko 1998). FDI also foster competition, which motivates firms to innovate and become more productive (Blomström and Kokko 1998; Spencer 2008). On the other hand, this increased competition may lead to the exit of local businesses and to their gradual replacement, so FDI can have negative crowding-out effects too (Amoroso and Müller 2017). Another strand of the literature has focused instead on host countries’ determinants of inward FDI. These include factors such as infrastructure, human capital, economic stability and production costs, which are associated with the location aspect of the OLI paradigm,Footnote 1 as well as market size, market growth, the economy’s openness, and factor endowments, which are mainly investigated by the so-called New Trade Theory (Assunção et al. 2013). Another group of FDI determinants, the relevance of which has been highlighted since the late 1990s, reflects the quality and effectiveness of a country’s institutions. Growing awareness of the relevance of FDI, of institutions, and of their interaction clearly emerges from the sizable number of studies that deal with these topics. To give an example, as at June 2017 Scopus has indexed 488 papers belonging to the subareas Economics, Econometrics and Finance, Business, Management and Accounting and Social Sciences published between 1994 (the first year available) and 2016, with titles, abstracts and/or keywords containing both the terms “FDI” and “institutions”. Figure 1 shows the rising trend of the peer-reviewed works investigating these subjects. Source: articles from the Scopus (Elsevier) database Number of articles concerning FDI and institutions indexed in Scopus between 1994 and 2016. Most researchers analysing institutions have focused on the formal ones (e.g. property rights, rule of law, civil liberties and political stability), especially in the transition economies, which have changed dramatically over a short period of time. From this vast literature it emerged that formal institutions generally have a relevant role in affecting multinationals’ investment decisions. In particular, higher levels of such institutional factors as political stability, democracy, and rule of law tend to attract FDI, while others, such as corruption and poor governance, typically deter it. The results of these single studies are supported by the more robust and general findings of Bailey (2016), who conducted a meta-analysis based on a sample of 97 primary studies on this issue. In the meantime, informal institutions, which are typically not codified, and are harder to observe and measure, have been attracting more attention, especially since the beginning of the twenty-first century. In particular, several empirical works have found a significant effect of informal institutions on inward FDI, and on other relevant economic variables. This topic is still little explored, however, especially as concerns the relationship between FDI and formal institutions. The concept of informal institutions is also rather elusive and the literature adopts different interpretations and classifications. The available studies on informal institutions are consequently very heterogeneous and generally focus on just one or a few types, making it difficult for the reader to obtain a clear and satisfactory overview of this interesting but puzzling subject. In the light of these considerations, the three main purposes of this work are as follows: to shed more light on a puzzling, elusive concept—informal institutions—also by drawing comparisons with related constructs (Sect. 2); to overview the main types of informal institution and their effects on FDI inflows (Sects. 2 and 3); to explore the heterogeneity across empirical studies on the effects of informal institutions on FDI inflows in order to see how, and to what extent, informal institutions affect a multinational firm’s decision to invest in a given country. This is done by means of a simple meta-analysis, which—to the best of the author’s knowledge—is the first to be conducted on this issue (sections from 3 to 6). The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 contains an overview of the informal institutions framework, with a brief analysis of the main types forming the object of study; Sect. 3 is devoted to a literature review of recent empirical studies on the influence of informal institutions on inward FDI; Sect. 4 illustrates the empirical strategy and the data; Sect. 5 presents and discusses the empirical findings; and Sect. 6 concludes.",7
36,1,Economia Politica,04 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-018-0112-8,Deindustrialization and the technological intensity of manufacturing subsystems in the European Union,April 2019,Alessandro Sarra,Claudio Di Berardino,Davide Quaglione,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The structural dynamics of the most developed countries has long since been characterized by gradual downsizing of the manufacturing sector, in terms of both employment and value added, as well as by a generalized increase in the weight of the service sector. For many years the literature in the field of service economics considered this evolution as a typical feature of mature economies. It was perceived to be closely related to the diffusion of well-being among citizens and to the preservation of the competitive advantage against emerging countries in international markets, thanks to the integration of services into the production of high-quality, high-technology tradable goods. The 2008 crisis, however, resulted in a steep intensification of this trend in the more fragile European economies. Such evidence triggered a broad debate on the role that the manufacturing sector plays in supporting economic growth and generating welfare (Romano and Traù 2017) and on the risks associated with its decline (Cirillo and Guarascio 2015; Simonazzi et al. 2013; Stöllinger et al. 2013). The centrality of the manufacturing sector has been reaffirmed in a number of influential contributions highlighting that it represents the main source of innovation, technological progress, and productivity growth; it is responsible for a relevant share of the demand for services in general; and it helps to sustain value-added exports, providing a fundamental carrier function for non-tradable services (Helper et al. 2012; Nordås and Kim 2013; Pisano and Shih 2009). Moreover, in the long run, the contraction of manufacturing activities can determine a loss of technical knowledge, industrial capabilities, supplier networks, and so on—the so-called “industrial commons”—which can strongly limit the ability of firms to enter new markets and embrace production based on new technologies (Stöllinger et al. 2013). It is mainly for these reasons that the preservation of a thriving manufacturing sector has also finally been perceived as an imperative (Chang 2006; Rodrik 2012) in the European Union and that, after at least two decades of neglect, industrial policy has regained academic attention (Mazzucato et al. 2015; Pianta 2014; Stöllinger et al. 2013; Wade 2012) and re-entered the political agenda (European Commission 2012). The scarlet thread running through this debate is that the horizontal approach followed since the early 1990s has proved to be ineffective in preserving broad, widespread, and diversified manufacturing sectors within the Member States, especially in relation to the challenges posed by the 2008 crisis. A well-established strand of research has evidenced the many structural imbalances that have emerged during the last two decades, threatening the competitiveness of the European economy and even compromising regional convergence (Simonazzi 2015; Stöllinger et al. 2013). Rising pressure from emerging economies, technologically better equipped than in the past, affected the European countries unevenly, causing more problems for the lagging economies than for the more developed ones; the generalized fall of the investments in research that followed the 2008 crisis and that was mainly concentrated in the weaker economies put at risk the ability of the European latecomers to reach, and remain on, the technological frontier; a gradual process of polarization due to a number of interrelated (macroeconomic as well as microeconomic) causes led to the formation of a German-centred core with a strong competitive position on medium- and high-technology production and a quickly degrading southern periphery (Cirillo and Guarascio 2015; Simonazzi 2015; Simonazzi et al. 2013; Stöllinger et al. 2013); and a widespread process of offshoring affected the European industrial systems to different degrees according to the technological level of their leading sectors (medium- and low-technology manufacturing suffered more) and had uneven impacts on the qualitative composition of the domestic employment (Bramucci et al. 2017). With these developments in mind, a rapidly growing strand of literature suggested the adoption, at the European Union level, of “structural policies” (Cimoli et al. 2015; Crafts 2010; Landesmann 2015; Pack and Saggi 2006)—industrial policies aimed at actively influencing the sectoral, technological, and geographical structure of the production system (Warwick 2013)—to rebalance the unfavourable structural dynamics triggered by the manufacturing crisis (Mazzucato 2015; Pianta 2014; Walz 2015). An accurate analysis of the process of structural change that occurred in the European Union’s economic system, and in particular in the manufacturing sector within it, can therefore be of great help in defining the actual features of the industrial policy problem. According to the framework just presented, some empirical questions emerge as being especially relevant. How intense has the deindustrialization that occurred in the European Union really been? Which technological levels of the manufacturing sector have suffered the most? How has deindustrialization affected the European core countries (EU15) and the lagging latecomers (EU12)?Footnote 1 Concerning the first empirical question, a strand of theoretical and empirical studies has long noted that it is not possible to give an accurate answer unless a methodology that allows the clarification of the effects of the internal reorganization of the economic system is adopted (Ciriaci and Palma 2016; Momigliano and Siniscalco 1986; Montresor and Vittucci Marzetti 2007, 2011; Sarra 2009). A simple decrease in the employment (or in the value-added) share of the manufacturing sector and a parallel increase in the service sector, in fact, cannot be taken per se as conclusive evidence of deindustrialization/tertiarization, as it could largely reflect the competitive strategies of the manufacturers and the changes in the internal division of labour required by their implementation (Bryson and Daniels 2010; Falk and Peng 2013; Schettkat and Yocarini 2006; Schmenner 2009). The literature on the strategic relationships between industry and services has provided many examples in this regard: the increasing fragmentation of the national manufacturing value chain, with gradual outsourcing of service activities from the manufacturing core (Baines et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2016; Kowalkowski et al. 2013; Kwak and Kim 2016; Montresor and Vittucci Marzetti 2007; Pilat and Wölfl 2005; Stehrer et al. 2015); the increasing demand for innovative input services; and the diffusion of commercial strategies aimed at differentiating products through the addition of ancillary services to the companies’ market offer (Dachs et al. 2014; Nordås and Kim 2013; Stöllinger et al. 2013). Under all these circumstances, while the employment share of the manufacturing sector decreases, the share of manufactured goods in the final output of the economy does not necessarily follow, nor does the total employment needed in the system to perform all the activities of the manufacturing value chain necessarily decrease. In fact, the loss of direct employment by the manufacturing sector can even correspond to the strengthening of its competitiveness and to a larger share of the value of final manufactured goods in the GDP if the increased use of input services enables firms to charge higher price‒cost mark-ups (Stöllinger et al. 2013). As long as the risky consequences of deindustrialization evidenced by the literature (the loss of industrial commons above all) mainly depend on the total amount of activity triggered in the economic system by the manufacturing value chain and not on the way in which it is organized, the economic system might not even be substantially affected. For these reasons, the actual extent of the deindustrialization cannot be inferred by the simple observation of the employment shares of manufacturing and services; rather, attention must be paid to how much real deindustrialization lies beneath the dynamics of those shares. Input‒output analysis (I–O hereinafter) provides a methodology to deal with this question, avoiding much of the lousiness typical of other traditional approaches. First, it allows researchers to measure how much of the (increasing) employment in services has fed the intermediate demand from the economic system in general and the manufacturing sector in particular. This avoids some of the typical inaccuracies of the literature on business services (De Backer et al. 2015; Pilat and Wölfl 2005), which has identified intermediate services based on their “prevailing destination” and not on their actual use (Momigliano and Siniscalco 1986; Montresor and Vittucci Marzetti 2007, 2011; Sarra 2009). Second, as will be clarified in the following (Sects. 2 and 3), it offers the opportunity to obtain a measure of the deindustrialization process that is not affected by changes in the internal organization of the economic system in the sense specified above. Through the so-called “subsystem approach”, the circular representation of the economy typical of I–O tables, in which each sector is linked to the others by selling/purchasing relations, can be transformed into an ideal one, made of not-intersecting, vertically integrated productive processes that use only labour as an external input to produce only the output destined to satisfy the final demand (namely the sum of consumption, investments, public purchases, and net exports; see Pasinetti 1973, 1983). In this way, a much more precise measure of the actual extent of deindustrialization can be obtained: both the share of the labour inputs of the manufacturing subsystem in the total labour inputs of the economy and the share of the final manufactured goods in the GDP provide a measure of the relevance of manufacturing in the economic system, and deindustrialization will be signalled by a reduction in either or both of them. This representation is not affected by any change in the selling/purchasing relationship between manufacturing and services. Moreover, it allows researchers to evaluate the adjustments in terms of labour inputs caused in the economic system by any variation in technology (general and sector specific) and in the composition of the final demand for manufactured goods. Finally, since the internal organization is not relevant, this representation allows comparisons among different economic systems. As for the second empirical question, it should be noted that how deindustrialization actually affected the technological structure of the manufacturing sector is not an easy question to answer due to a number of concomitant developments that have had complex and sometimes conflicting impacts. To mention only the most striking one, the European Union directed its financial effort to promoting an innovation-friendly environment that should have benefited mainly high-technology industries, but private investments in research consistently fell after the 2008 crisis, so the aggregate results were uncertain (Stöllinger et al. 2013). Intra-European offshoring—mainly from Germany and Italy towards, respectively, Northern and Southern Eastern European countries—contributed to consolidating the industrial structure of the lagging EU12 countries but at different technological levels, thus strengthening the internal structural imbalances in the European Union (Simonazzi 2015; Simonazzi et al. 2013; Stöllinger et al. 2013). Finally, the low-technology branches of the manufacturing sector suffered more from the external pressures coming from developing countries, but they also increased their service intensity more than the high-technology ones (Nordås and Kim 2013). They therefore appeared to be more influenced by the competitiveness-driven reshaping of the division of labour within the manufacturing value chain. Part of their generalized contraction in terms of employment or value added could depend on this kind of internal reorganization and not on actual deindustrialization. It is quite evident that all these processes of structural change, taken together, describe an extensive internal reorganization of the European manufacturing sector, the final effects of which on the different technological levels can be assessed better within a subsystem approach, which can thus produce useful information for more selective industrial (innovation) policies. As regards the third empirical question, deindustrialization was for a long time considered as a typical step in the evolution of more developed countries, destined to be transformed naturally in their maturity into highly knowledge-intensive service economies. Many authors have pointed out that an increasing final demand for services, mainly those destined to meet consumers’ ever-more-sophisticated needs, often follows the growth of the per capita income and is strictly connected to the improvement of households’ living standards (Cuadrado-Roura 2013; Gregory and Russo 2006; Schettkat 2007). In addition, stylized facts suggest that the process of economic development itself implies an inverted-U-shaped relationship between the share of employment in manufacturing and the per capita income (Kim and Lee 2014; Palma 2005; Rowthorn and Wells 1987). Therefore, one would expect deindustrialization to be much more intense in the EU15 countries than in the lagging Eastern EU12 ones. Recently, a number of empirical contributions have shown that this relationship is not stable over time but continuously collapsing (Palma 2005, 2014), to the point that even some developing countries seem to follow a similar pattern, turning into “service economies” without having developed a modern, technologically competitive industrial system (Akarçay Gürbüz 2011; Cruz 2015). Given the traditionally lower growth rates of productivity in the service sector (Beaudry et al. 2005; Fernandez and Palazuelos 2012; Maroto-Sánchez 2012; Nordhaus 2008; Van Ark et al. 2008, 2013), the effects on future economic growth can easily be detrimental. This “premature deindustrialization” (Rodrik 2016) seems to be due to countries opening to international trade too early, which tends to cause a loss of variety in the manufacturing base and focalization on the labour-intensive stages of the global value chains. The result is that it becomes much more difficult to develop the set of industrial commons necessary to participate fully in innovation processes and high-technology new markets (Romano and Traù 2017). The process described in the literature about early deindustrialization appears to be quite similar to the one that Eastern European countries have been experimenting with since they entered the European Union. From such a perspective, the formation of a German-centred core, as described in the literature (Cirillo and Guarascio 2015; Simonazzi 2015; Simonazzi et al. 2013; Stöllinger et al. 2013), is both an opportunity and a risk. For this reason, it is particularly relevant to assess whether and how deindustrialization is affecting EU12 countries and how the technological levels of their manufacturing sectors are involved. More sector-specific industrial policies of the kind often proposed in the literature, aimed at actively supporting the consolidation of new markets and affirming new technological development paths (Mazzucato et al. 2015; Pianta 2014), should take into account this kind of regional specificity. If the benefit associated with the participation in the German-centred core implies excessive shrinking of the manufacturing base of EU12 countries, their potential effectiveness will be greatly compromised. Using data from the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) and the subsystem approach, this study provides new empirical evidence on the transformation of the production structure in the European Union (EU27) over the years 1995–2011. There are two main novelties of this work. First, the deindustrialization hypothesis is investigated by measuring the change in the hours worked and in the composition of the final output, distinguishing different technological intensities of the internal branches of manufacturing according to the OECD’s classification (OECD 2003), a revised Pavitt taxonomy (Bogliacino and Pianta 2016), and Peneder’s synthetic taxonomy (Peneder 2010). Second, the study compares two sets of European countries (EU15 and EU12) characterized by significant differences in terms of their development stage, the structure of the economy, their sectoral labour productivity levels, and the role of the capital-intensive sectors (Kallioras and Petrakos 2010; Sassi 2011). No scientific contribution has so far focused on the analysis of the deindustrialization trend in the former socialist economies recently annexed to the EU. The paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the theoretical background of the analysis of structural dynamics; the methodology adopted is presented in the third section; the fourth section provides evidence of the evolution of final and intermediate uses of services; the results related to the evolution of the manufacturing subsystem as a whole are described in the fifth section; in the sixth section, the analysis of each manufacturing subsystem, disaggregated according to the two taxonomies adopted, is presented; and the seventh section discusses the results obtained against the background provided by the literature on structural change and industrial policy in the European Union.",18

Evidence from patent citations,July 2019,Antonio Navas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"During the last few decades, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been increasing in importance not only for developed countries but also for developing economies. In the 1990s, around 30% of FDI inflows were going to developing economies (China, South East Asian economies, and during the late 1990s, South America) (Markusen 1995). In 2011, nearly half of FDI inflows went to developing economies (UNCTAD 2012). This phenomenon has arisen due to the use by governments in developing countries of different fiscal incentives in order to attract FDI from more advanced economies. These policy strategies can be justified from an economic point of view if foreign direct investment generates potential positive externalities in the host country (Alfaro 2017). For that reason, an extensive literature on the effects of FDI in the host country has primarily focused on trying to find empirical evidence in favour of those externalities. This paper focusses on exploring to what extent FDI generates positive technological spillovers in the host-country. The paper relies on the use of a relatively novel approach within the FDI literature to measure technological spillovers: patent citations. Unlike other papers in this literature, we focus on the case of FDI coming from a developed economy into developing economies. The advantage in the use of patent citations to measure technological spillovers relies on the fact that it potentially captures a pure transfer of technological knowledge between multinational firms and host-country firms.Footnote 1 Although the effects on total factor productivity (TFP) are also relevant, and the extensive body of work in this area should be seen as complementary to the current paper, it is important to separate the impacts of FDI on TFP (where some of which may not necessarily come as a result of a positive externality) from this measure of technological diffusion which is arguably closer to the concept of an externality. As argued above, this distinction will inform better policymakers regarding the economic justification of policies designed to attract FDI. In addition, this measure avoids traditional well-known problems in the literature that arise because of the imperfect competitive nature of the industries in which multinational firms operate and the fact that the entry of multinational firms alters by definition the industry’s market structure affecting the measurement of the TFP (Katayama et al. 2003). The current paper focuses on US multinational corporations and on a sample of eight countries, which represents the major recipients of US FDI investments over the sample period 1983–2000. In addition, these countries have been selected because they represented the major recipients of US investments in two specific geographical areas, South East Asia and South America. It is well known that during the 1970s and 1980s these geographical regions were experiencing divergent patterns of growth and development (Krugman 2015). While several studies have pointed out the potential role played by multinational firms in the convergence process of the South East Asian economies with the developed world, to the best of my knowledge, there have been very few attempts to provide quantitative evidence regarding this.Footnote 2 This paper aims to fill this gap by offering new evidence on the potential role played by US corporations in the process of technology diffusion in South East Asian economies, contributing to the phenomenon of catching-up as experienced by these economies in the last decades.Footnote 3 Our paper finds preliminary evidence supporting a technology diffusion process from multinationals to firms in the host-country. However, this process may take time. By distinguishing between the different types of the patent’s assignee we find that, when looking at a broader measure of host-country innovativeness that considers all patents assigned to host-country inventors, an increase in FDI increases the number of citations made by these patents to US patents. These results are robust to the inclusion of patents as a control variable and time and year fixed effects. We find however that only FDI from lags 3, 8 and 9 years are statistically significant suggesting that this process of technology diffusion may take at least 3 years. The results become smaller as we move towards a more restrictive type of assignee. Excluding from our measure of citations, those citing patents assigned to American corporations, the diffusion lag becomes larger suggesting that the process of technology diffusion may go first from the headquarters towards the foreign affiliates and from the foreign affiliates to the rest of the firms in the economy, as one in principle might expect. For the case in which we include patents assigned to non-American corporations only, the results suggest that it may take at least 8 years for this technology diffusion to happen. Section 2 presents a review of the current literature on both the existence of technological spillovers coming from FDI and the use of patent citations as a measure of technological flows. Section 3 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the use of patent citations as a measure of technological flows and discusses the data used. Section 4 discusses the econometric model and the results and Sect. 5 concludes.",6
36,2,Economia Politica,26 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-018-0110-x,An empirical analysis of the impact of trade credit on bank debt restructuring,July 2019,Antonio Fabio Forgione,Carlo Migliardo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A firm’s financial distress continues to be relevant from the standpoints of economics, corporate finance, and accounting.Footnote 1 In this regard, an emerging body of literature has focused on the relationship between trade credit and corporate distress. The expected effect of this association is not univocally defined: some studies highlight that trade credit should reduce the likelihood of firm financial distress; on the contrary, other empirical works show that a high level of trade credit is likely associated with firm bankruptcy. So far, this literature has mostly consisted of two main strands. The first strand of literature argues that trade credit mitigates the risk of corporate default through two channels (Jaffee and Stiglitz 1990; Petersen and Rajan 1997; Biais and Gollier 1997; Burkart and Ellingsen 2004; Danielson and Scott 2004). On the one hand, thanks to the longstanding relationship between corporate customers and suppliers, trade credit attenuates the asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders; constrained firms worthy of credit (such as small firms during monetary restrictions or firms without relationships with banks) can overwhelm the credit rationing and carry on their business. On the other hand, trade credit allows for an efficient diffusion of information in the form of risk-sharing arrangements that eliminate elements of moral hazard and, in turn, mitigate the risk of corporate default.Footnote 2 In addition, Wilner (2000) and Cuñat (2007) analyzed the role of long-term bilateral relationships among companies in order to explain the role of debt renegotiation for firms in financial distress. Although payables are generally more expensive than other sources of financing, Wilner (2000) found that firms turn extensively to trade credit. Trade creditors, by granting larger concessions in renegotiations, assist their customers in financial distress more than the credit market does. He attributed this larger availability to the dependence of customers on the supplier. That is, the stronger the long-term relationship that the supplier has established with its corporate customer, the greater the value (a kind of sunk cost) of the business relationship to be preserved. In this regard, Hudson (1987) stressed that because trade credit constitutes the greater part of a small firm’s liabilities, trade creditors influence the failure of small firms more than bondholders do. In addition, payables can be a substitute for bank lending during recessions and, in some cases, it can be the only source of financing, given credit rationing constraints (Choi and Kim 2005; Love and Zaidi 2010; Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga 2013).Footnote 3 The second strand of literature has shown that trade credit increases the likelihood of firm failure. Indeed, trade credit rises, in both quantity and cost, with illiquidity, jeopardizing profits up to the point at which the trade debtor reaches financial distress (Molina and Preve 2012). In addition, Jorion and Zhang (2009) analyzed default clustering that occurred via counterparty effects, finding an increased distress risk in the year following debtor failure. Subsequently, Bastos and Pindado (2013), Boissay and Gropp (2013), Lou and Wang (2013), and Jacobson and Von Schedvin (2015) have found evidence of a credit contagion in the supply chain, where debtor failures lead to creditor failures. In sum, this strand of literature focused on the propagation mechanism of trade debtor failure induced at an aggregate level, without considering the channel through which the cascade effect propagated from trade debtor distress to financial debt. This paper constitutes an attempt to contribute to the above debate in the literature in four ways. Firstly, our data allows us to consider a particular category of financial distress, such as bank debt restructuring. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to attempt to investigate the relationship between trade credit and bank debts. Secondly, it aims to capture the signaling mechanism of trade credit, in order to relate it to the corporate financial distress (in a wide sense). This mechanism could also be used to mitigate cluster failure. Thirdly, our research tries to contribute to the above debate on the distribution of information among all debt holders. Finally, although the literature discusses the role of trade credit for financial distress, to the best of our knowledge, no earlier study has related creditworthiness to trade credit features in detail (i.e., amount, maturity, and delay on payments in terms of duration and percentage) at firm level. Overall, our analysis, founded on a large and representative dataset on the Italian economy, provides evidence that trade credit profiles, such as the amount and the delay, are related to the probability that firms implement bank debt restructuring. A large recur to payables is positively associated with the likelihood of financial distress. Equally, a delay in trade credit payment is negatively correlated with the suppliers’ financial stability. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 highlights the role of trade credit for the Italian industry. The methodology and variables are presented in Sect. 3, while Sect. 4 describes the data and summary statistics. Section 5 reports the empirical results, and Sect. 6 provides validation of the predictive power of the model. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",5

In particular, it becomes more important for European countries as they have to accomplish Europe 2020 strategy that sets economic objectives concerning the level of employment (75% of population between 20 and 64 age must be at work) with well-defined targets on greenhouse gas emission reduction (20% lower GHGs emissions compared to the level of 1990), renewable energy source use (20% energy from renewable energy) and energy efficiency (20% increase in energy efficiency) (EU 2017). Generally, the main sectors responsible for energy consumption and CO2 emissions are industrial activities and households’ consumption (Cellura et al. 2012). In EU-27 emissions from industrial activities contribute to almost 80% of the GHG emissions in the atmosphere.Footnote 1 The Italian economy has been trying to cope with European targets for emission reductions and energy intensity for a long time,Footnote 2 but it has not reached the expected levels yet (Annicchiarico et al. 2014) and (Ali et al. 2018). Accordingly, by 2010 the Italian economy was more dependent on imported energy supply (83.7%) compared to EU-27 average (52.7%). However, more recently, Italian economy dependence on imported energy has reduced to 76.4% by 2015 (World Bank 2018). Additionally, the share of renewable energy sources is close to EU average but the level of CO2 emissions and the energy efficiencies need to be improved to attain the respective national targets (European Comnmission 2018). All this implies more urgent environmental policy interventions and execution for Italian economy as also suggested by Annicchiarico et al. (2014). All this debate can be directed to a need for quantifying energy requirements and GHGs emissions from various sectors of Italian economy. This may be helpful to set policies for economic growth with more efficient usage of energy and with lesser emissions of GHGs to the environment. The input–output approach can be a powerful macroeconomic disaggregated instrument that not only can evaluate the linkages among the economic and environmental aspects because of its capacity to integrate monetary and physical data but can also help in decomposing net economic impacts into different structural effects (Lenzen 2003; Moran et al. 2016; Sheng et al. 2016). One of the popular decomposition methods in scholarly literature is SDA (structural decomposition) (Sun 1998; Wiedmann 2009; Butnara and Llop 2011; Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013; Brizga et al. 2014), etc. SDA got popularities because SDA extends the static I–O features to be examinable over a period of time. SDA also became a less data extensive tool for analysis compared to econometric estimations. Additionally, the use of I–O tables account for all inputs, production and thus the issue related to environment, natural resources usages, pollution, resource depletion become more visible (Rose and Casler 1996). An interesting decomposition singular value decomposition (SVD) extracted from (Lancaster and Tismenetsky 1985) is based on I–O framework. SVD can be employed to convert unit increase worth of addition in total output production into the corresponding equivalent emissions (CO2) using Leontief inverse matrix from I–O framework (Ali et al. 2017). The integration of CO2 quantification with decomposition techniques [both singular value decompositions (SVD) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA)], can be of more help to investigate CO2 impacts in different sub-sectors and it can be more helpful for reducing GHGs emissions. Therefore, the current study has a number of objectives. First, it is developing input–output based theoretical model to quantify the CO2 emissions for Italian economy. Secondly, this theoretical model is combined with decomposition models (SVD and SDA) in order to decompose the CO2 emissions. Finally, using 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2009 years input–output and carbon dioxide emission (environmental accounts of WIOD) data sets for Italian economy, and using theoretical models developed, we are decomposing overall CO2 emission over a period of 14 years. The major contribution, and also the novelty of the study, is the development of theoretical model by combining input–output process with SVD and SDA decomposition simultaneously and its applications to Italian economy during 14-years. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 is literature review. Section 3 provides a brief description of the methodology of decomposition based on the SVD. It also provides the theoretical background of the methodology of decomposition analysis and especially of the environmental specification of the SDA. Section 4 deals with the results of the SVD and SDA analysis of CO2 emissions in Italy. The final section draws some concluding remarks and suggestions.",4

Especially developing countries have deeply suffered the lack of adequate infrastructures that would have limited the related damages (Loayza et al. 2009; Lei and Wang 2014). Recent history of some earthquakes and tsunamis showed us how tragic the effects of these natural disasters have been in poor countries. Both their increasing number and intensity is also a consequence of climate change, a major challenge that has raised concerns from several institutions at different levels (Mazzanti and Musolesi 2017; Costantini et al. 2018). Even in those cases where a natural disaster does not cause victims, the weak economic structure of countries at an early stage of development may be dramatically involved. Natural disasters regularly affect some developing countries and their economies. Among these, floods are one of the main problems. The Ministry of Water and Environment of the Republic of Uganda (2015) assessed that adaptation costs related to both climate change and the related effects of droughts and floods will be worth USD 60–76 million in 2025, and USD 347–621 million in 2050. In cooperation with international organizations, governments of developing countries have increasingly implemented programmes to mitigate the impact of natural disasters like floods. Most of them directly involve local population in order to improve responsiveness and resilience. In contexts where lack of infrastructure heavily affects the impact of natural disasters, the adaptive capacity of local communities may be a key factor for fast recover (UNEP 2012). This paper aims to assess how local economies of developing countries react to floods, and if certain adaptive capacity can be found. We focus on micro firms, which are particularly significant for developing countries. Dougherty-Choux et al. (2015) report that they cover around 80% of total employment across Sub Saharan Africa. They also include home-based enterprises, as small-scale retail firms typically run by women from home (Gough 2010). In particular, we examine the behaviour of small retail shops located in some cities of Uganda. Small activities generate a non negligible share of the country’s GDP worth 12% (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2016). Missing or non-adequate prevention of natural disasters may cause shops to shut down, and sometimes exit from the market. But as already mentioned, there may be an adaptive capacity of local population to respond to frequent events. To study this, we consider areas of Uganda where floods have happened regularly, taking the declared number of times a shop closed because of floods as a measure of their impact. We evaluate how a higher number of floods are significantly associated with both business turnover and the stock value of a shop’s goods. We control for both manager and shop-related characteristics. As expected results show that floods are likely to negatively affect shops’ business. Interestingly their impact is likely to decrease with the frequency of events, thus depicting a sort of adaptation as this phenomenon occurs frequently. We also find that individual characteristics of the shop manager matter. Encouraging some forms of networks between enterprises in the form of selecting suppliers from different cities may be significant too. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the few papers investigating the effects of recurrent natural events like floods on the performance of micro business, using a quantitative model. Some of the previous works explored the issue qualitatively, whereas others investigated the impact of single events. Indeed, a strength point of our paper is the uniqueness of the dataset from a direct survey on micro shop managers in Uganda. We surveyed shops from 13 cities including both the most urbanised areas, and secondary cities and villages. Though primary data sources have become frequent in the development economics literature, the wide spatial distribution of firms across different cities and villages is the main value of our dataset. Thanks to this we aim to provide broader evidence on the topic under investigation, as opposed to those studies based on either data from a single city, or a more spatially limited context. The analysis of the impact of natural events in developing countries has been extensively explored (Navrud et al. 2012; Arouri et al. 2015) from different approaches. However this study does not attempt to directly contribute to the debate on topics like natural hazard prevention, disaster risk management, or climate change effects. Also, we won’t debate on the relationship between infrastructure investment and development (Lobo and Rantisi 1999; Fedderke et al. 2006; Romp and De Haan 2007; Calderòn and Servèn 2010). Indeed investment is crucial in order to prevent the negative effects of climate change. But here we provide only indirect evidence on how important infrastructures are, in the sense of assessing the likely effects of their lack on the business. Our focus is rather on how the private sector, and in particular micro retail shops and their managers, may respond to natural disasters like floods in developing countries (Biagini and Miller 2013; Trabacchi and Stadelmann 2013; Doocy et al. 2013; Pauw 2015; Fankhauser 2016). The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we illustrate the conceptual background. Then the following section describes the dataset and the model. After results presentation we discuss policy implications.",6

Furthermore, an important and related research stream, known as the ‘Oswald hypothesis’ (Oswald 1996, 1999; Blanchflower and Oswald 2013), reports that an increase in homeownership rate leads to a future increase in unemployment rate.Footnote 1 According to Heller and Stephenson (2015), the ‘Oswald hypothesis’ omits any potential role for entrepreneurship, and the research on entrepreneurship neglects any potential labour market rigidities arising from homeownership.Footnote 2 Actually, this is not exactly true. Besides the well-studied effect on (un)employment operating through home moving and housing costs,Footnote 3 Blanchflower and Oswald (2013) suggest that higher homeownership rates are also associated with fewer new businesses. Homeowners care more than renters about the region they live in, hence, in regions with a high homeownership rate there may be a negative impact on new businesses (negative housing market externalities) due to the so-called ‘Not In My Back Yard’ (NIMBY) effect, namely, planning laws and land development laws enforced by local governments (Fischel 2001; Konecny and Stroukal 2015). In general, however, very few works within the related literature have explicitly investigated the link between homeownership and new business startups (Bracke et al. 2014). Indeed, a theoretical underpinning that is capable of explaining the complex interplay between the housing and labour markets is still missing (Blanchflower and Oswald 2013; Laamanen 2013). Following the ‘Oswald hypothesis’, this theoretical paper combines research on entrepreneurship and labour market outcomes with research on homeownership and unemployment. The connection between homeownership and entrepreneurship is policy-relevant, as homeownership and entrepreneurship are both encouraged and are also related to economic outcomes, firstly, with respect to the unemployment rate. Furthermore, entrepreneurship and new businesses are associated with innovation and economic growth. Thus, the question of whether or not policies that promote homeownership also encourage entrepreneurial activities (and vice versa) is very important. Nevertheless, the body of literature that links housing tenure and professional choices has neglected the crucial link between homeownership and entrepreneurship [very few exceptions are the works by Bracke et al. (2014) and Harding and Rosenthal (2013)]. Consequently, this topic could become a major research area for the next decade or so. Actually, the present paper is closely related to the work by Bracke et al. (2014). Nevertheless, the theoretical framework and the main result are both different. Basically, their work provides a theoretical explanation as to why mortgage debt diminishes the likelihood that homeowners will start a new business, while the present paper obtains a more general result for the relation among homeownership, job creation and new businesses. In order to investigate the relation between homeownership and entrepreneurship, the present paper uses an extended version of the search-and-matching model, where there is search activity in both the labour market and the housing market (in the model there are both job seekers and home seekers). As a novelty in the matching literature, from the demand side of the labour market, this paper distinguishes between the value of an existing or incumbent firm (namely, a firm that is waiting for a new employee) and the value of a new business (a firm that is going to open the first vacancy). Furthermore, this work also distinguishes two key channels through which homeownership affects the creation of jobs and new enterprises. The first channel works by means of search intensity, namely, the effort made in searching for a job. In this case, as suggested by the ‘Oswald hypothesis’, the effect of homeownership rates on labour market outcomes is negative, i.e., there is a positive relationship between homeownership and unemployment rates. As will become more clear later in this paper, this result does not depend on the higher moving costs for owners. Rather, it is due to the effect of housing tenure choice on search intensity in the labour market, namely, a kind of housing market externality, since owner-occupancy is the best housing tenure choice and employed workers have a greater chance of buying a home. Intuitively, the income of the employed (namely, the wage) is always higher than the income of the unemployed. Hence, ceteris paribus, employed workers have a greater chance of buying a home than the unemployed. It follows that: (1) home seekers are merely employed tenants; (2) unemployed tenants generate a greater effort in searching for a job than do unemployed homeowners, since for them there is an additional gain from becoming employed, namely, the possibility of becoming homeowners. As a result, the larger the share of homeowners in the market, the smaller the aggregate search intensity. Eventually, the number of jobs and the aggregate probability of finding a job are lower and, thus, the unemployment rate is higher. The second channel, instead, considers the effect of homeownership on new businesses. In this case, the effect of homeownership rates on labour market outcomes may be positive, i.e., there could be a positive relationship between homeownership and job creation. This effect crucially depends on the so-called “intrinsic preference for homeownership”, namely, individuals are willing to pay more to own a particular set of housing characteristics, such as a house, rather than paying rent (see Linneman and Voith 1991; Heston and Nakamura 2009). Precisely, we will show that the larger the benefit of being a homeowner, the higher the revenue and thus the profit of a new enterprise. Homeowners, on average, have greater total wealth than renters (Beracha et al. 2017) and more economic resources (such as housing capital gains) imply more profit opportunities. Accordingly, homeowners have more opportunities of starting a business than tenants.Footnote 4 This theoretical result is consistent with the empirical finding that housing capital gains encourage transitions into self-employment (Harding and Rosenthal 2013). Actually, the “intrinsic preference for homeownership” justifies the key assumption of the theoretical model, that the best housing tenure choice is owner-occupancy. Finally, we extend the analysis in order to take into account the important distinction between outright homeownership and homeownership with mortgage payments. This extension of the model yields the further result that homeowners with mortgage payments have worse opportunities, than outright homeowners, to become entrepreneurs. Indeed, as noted by Bracke et al. (2014), homeownership with mortgage payments is associated with fewer new businesses. Precisely, they report the importance of financial constraints. Very likely, a homeowner with mortgage payments will prioritise the payment of the loan rather than start a business; whereas, an outright homeowner has a warranty (the house) that facilitates access to credit (the house is indeed both a consumer good and an investment asset). In summary, the intrinsic preference for homeownership fosters the establishment of new enterprises, although homeownership does not encourage the development of existing enterprises (the total number of jobs is lower in an economy where the homeownership rate is higher). Furthermore, outright homeowners have better opportunities than tenants to become an entrepreneur, while homeowners with mortgage payments have worse opportunities than outright homeowners to start a new business. Eventually, therefore, the main finding of this paper is that outright homeownership encourages the establishment of new small businesses. Hence, we also find a close link between outright homeownership and entrepreneurship, since there is a strong association between entrepreneurship and small businesses (Sahut and Peris-Ortiz 2014). Indeed, small enterprises constitute one of the broadest fields of entrepreneurial activity (Blackburn and Kovalainen 2009). The results that homeownership negatively affects the aggregate probability of finding a job by means of a lower search intensity, while the intrinsic preference for homeownership encourages the creation of new small firms by means of higher economic resources are obtained without any particular restriction. Thus, the developed model is very general and potentially applicable to any country. Notwithstanding, the model seems particularly suitable for studying the Italian economy. The Italian homeownership rate is in fact very high. According to Eurostat, more than 70% of Italian households live in their own owned-house, which is one percentage higher than the averages of the Eurozone (66.6%) and the European Union (70%). Also, in a market where the homeownership rate is high (as in Italy), the unemployment rate is higher (this finding is consistent with both the theoretical model and the Italian case). Finally, the Italian production structure is almost completely characterised by the presence of small- and medium-sized enterprises. In the proposed model, a higher rate of new small firms is compatible with a higher homeownership rate. Furthermore, as regards the diffusion of small and medium enterprises in Italy, another key feature is the fairly good turnover rate, namely, births and deaths of many new small enterprises in a short time period (see, e.g., Bagnasco and Storti 2008). From a theoretical point of view, this is consistent with both a fairly good job destruction rate and a fairly good probability of filling a job vacancy. Indeed, if job creation is poor, the number of unemployed workers is larger and thus the probability of filling a job vacancy is higher. Eventually, we carried out a simple dynamic panel analysis in Italy that gives preliminary support to the main prediction of the theoretical model, namely, outright homeownership fosters the creation of new small businesses. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The next section presents an extended search-and-matching model where homeownership affects the creation of jobs and new enterprises through the search intensity and the intrinsic preference for homeownership; while Sect. 3 performs an empirical analysis in Italy for testing the main prediction of the theoretical model. Finally, Sect. 4 discusses the results.",1

The demand for energy and its allied services stem from meeting social and developmental needs, and this situation is growing. Expected economic growth is connected with the expanded application of energy, and it is anticipated that nations will continue to raise their demands for energy, especially for fossil fuels, over the coming years. But the world’s growing of energy consumption is also a big problem, because most of that energy comes from hydrocarbons (fossil fuels), which emit greenhouse gases and drive climate change. There is concern that human activities are affecting the heat/energy-exchange balance between Earth, the atmosphere, and space, and inducing global climate change, often termed “global warming.” Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and other trace greenhouse gases. If these gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere at current rates, most scientists believe significant global warming would occur through intensification of Earth’s natural heat-trapping “greenhouse effect.” Possible impacts might be seen as both positive and negative, depending on regional or national variations (Maranga et al. 2010). With increasing concern over the environmental challenges of GHGs, the participants to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) have held several conferences since 1992 to determine what steps could be taken so as to regulate for the concerns of GHGs and hence climate change. The first notable result of the UNFCCC conference was the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, which elicited commitments from many advanced countries to limit their emission of GHGs. In the Kyoto Protocol agreement, advanced countries were tasked to limit their combined greenhouse gas emissions of 5.2% compared 1990 level. The regional block countries were given national targets: European Union was tasked to reduce emissions by 8% and some others. USA was tasked to reduce emissions by 7% while Japan was to reduce emissions by 6%. Australia was allowed to increased emissions by 8%. Iceland just like Australia was permitted to increase GHG emissions to 10% (UNFCCC 2015). Following the Kyoto Protocol is the Doha Agreement of 2012 and many countries joined the Paris COP (Conference of the Parties) to the UNFCCC in 2015, which was the twenty-first conference of the UNFCCC. The parties at the Paris Protocol agreed to work on the modalities of reducing climate change, the idea of which depicted a general agreement of the represented participants of the 196 parties that attended the conference. The key outcome was the establishment of the goal to reduce warming of the earth to less than 2 °C related to pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC 2015). Accomplishing this objective requires a drastic reduction in the amount of GHGs over the coming few decades. Therefore, the success of reducing the world CO2 emissions heavily depends on two parts, the commitment of major emitters and the type and efficiency of energy use. The ten countries considered world leading economies and the largest CO2 emitters include: China, USA, UK, Canada, Germany, India, Iran, Japan Russia and Korea Republic. The total average GDP of the highest CO2 emitting countries is more than 75% of the global GDP since 1991, and the average GDP growth rate is 3.39% as compared to the world average GDP growth rate of 2.7%, during 1990–2014. The countries are also the largest energy consumers and emitters of CO2 worldwide. The average CO2 emissions of these countries are more than 75% of the global CO2 emissions during 1990–2014. The annual CO2 per capita emissions of these countries are 5.7 t CO2, which is nearly 1.5 times higher than the average global per capita emissions (Climate Change Performance Index 2016). Figure 1 displays the total CO2 emissions (in metric tons) of these countries. Total CO2 emissions (metric tons) from fossil fuels of the 10 highest CO2 emitting countries (World Development Indicators 2016) The figure further shows that China surpasses USA in terms of total CO2 emissions from 2005. India and Russia are next in the list of the highest CO2 emitting countries. In 2014, the largest emitting countries, which together account for two-thirds of total global emissions, were: China (with a 29% share in the global total), the United States (14%), India (7%), the Russian Federation (5%) and Japan (3.5%). The 2014 changes within the group of ten highest emitters of CO2, together accounting for 75% of total global emissions, varied widely, but, overall, these countries saw a decrease of 0.5% in CO2 emissions in 2014 (Jos et al. 2016). However, renewable energy sources have surfaced as a relevant component in the global energy consumption mix that could help in reducing GHG emissions due to its ability to emit less or no carbon. Given the outgrowth of renewable energy in the deliberations of a sustainable energy future, it is essential to understand the dynamic role of this clean energy alongside efficient fossil fuel energy consumption in carbon reduction and climate change mitigation strategies. These are the aspects this study seeks to address. Global primary energy consumption increased in 2014 by 1.0%, which was similar to 2013 but well below the 10-year average of 1.9%, even though fossil fuel prices fell in 2014 in all regions. In 2014, coal consumption decreased, globally, by 1.8%, while global oil and natural gas consumption increased by 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. These shifts in fossil fuel consumption also affected the fuel mix. The largest decreases in coal consumption were seen in the United States and China, partly counterbalanced by increases in India and Indonesia. For oil consumption, the largest increases were in China, India and United States. The global increase in the use of natural gas was mainly due to increased consumption in the United States and the European Union, with smaller increases seen in Iran and China (Jos et al. 2016). The production of nuclear energy increased by 1.3% and hydroelectricity by 1.0%; resulting in respective shares of 10.7% and 16.4% in total global power generation, and 4.4% and 6.8% in global primary energy consumption. In 2014, significant increases of 15.2% were observed in other renewable electricity sources, notably wind and solar energy. With double-digit growth for the 12th year in a row, these now provide almost 6.7% of global power generation, close to a doubling over the past 5 years (3.5% in 2010). Their share in 2014 increased to 2.8% of total global primary energy consumption, also doubling their share since 2010 (Jos et al. 2016). In fact, renewable technologies, such as wind and solar energy, geothermal have seen considerable progress, and these technologies could facilitate a zero-carbon energy future (Kebede et al. 2010; Daly and Farley 2011; Kamal 2013). In addition to the renewable and non-renewable energy variable, another factor that has attracted the attention of researchers in the environment-growth-energy nexus is financial development. Evidence abounds that global economies have witnessed a tremendous rate of economic growth and a high level of financial development over the last 25 years (Ma and Jalil 2008; Jalil et al. 2010). However, this rapid growth in economic activity and financial sector development has been accompanied by environmental degradation. Despite its importance, the relationship between CO2 emission, financial development, energy consumption and economic growth has not received much attention in the case of highest leading CO2 emissions emitters. Although several studies such as Wang et al. (2014); Omri (2013); Cowan et al. (2014); Alkhanthan (2013); Shahbaz et al. (2013); Saboori and Sulaiman (2013); Mudakkar et al. (2013); Alizna et al. (2014); Sbia et al. (2014); Salahuddin and Gown (2014); Sebri and Ben-Salha (2014) have recently focused on the issue based on country specific and panel data at the provincial, regional and global level, such studies have ignored the importance of financial development. However, the role of financial development in the context of economic growth and its effect on the environment is quite important for several reasons: Jalil and Feridun (2011), for example, report that after controlling for per capita real income growth, financial development is negatively correlated with CO2 emissions in China’s case. This suggests that financial development has led to a reduction in environmental pollution. Frankel and Romer (1999) have pointed out that the financial development in a country may attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and higher degrees of research and development (R&D). This, in turn can, increase the level of economic growth, and hence, affect the dynamics of environmental performance. Similarly, Birdsall and Wheeler (1993) and Frankel and Rose (2002) have argued that the developing countries may have access, through financial development, to new, environmental-friendly technology. The recent literature also documented evidence of the linkages between financial development and FDI inflows. For example Ang (2008) pointed out that financial deepening in Malaysia leads to higher FDI inflows. Similarly, it has been found that financial liberalization plays a positive role in innovative (R&D) activity in the case of Korea (Ang 2010) and India (Madsen et al. 2010). Furthermore, Tamazian and Rao (2010) document evidence that the increase in FDI inflows and R&D activities reduce environmental pollution. On the other hand, Jensen (1996) notes that financial development may lead to increased industrial activities, which, in turn, may lead to industrial pollution. It is against this backdrop that the present article investigates the relationship between financial development and renewable energy on environmental pollution among the ten leading CO2 emitting countries. Therefore, the current study looks at the role of financial development as another contributing factor, alongside renewable energy, in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. The new trend in the theory of energy and environmental economics is to decompose the impacts of renewable and non-renewable energy use patterns, not only as they pertain to economic growth but to greenhouse gases and climate change, which is the major issue this study seeks to address. The present study, as a contribution to the trend of the theoretical and empirical frameworks on energy-environment linkages, differs from the previous work in several respects. First, a number of the existing studies (Lean and Smyth 2010; Arouri et al. 2012; Farhani and Ben Rejeb 2012; Hamit-Haggar 2012; Al-Mulali and Sab 2012; Al-Mulali et al. 2013; Ozcan 2013; Xue et al. 2014; Kivyiro and Arminen 2014) focus on the use of aggregated energy consumption without considering the intermittent role of each type of energy consumption in reducing the incidence of CO2 emissions and climate change. Second, the available literature has paid attention to panel analyses of several country groups such as the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries; Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries; BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa); Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Turkey (PIGST); the European Union (EU); and the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). The countries that have been indexed as economies with the highest CO2 emissions have not been examined in the energy-growth-environment literature. Specifically, this study is the most all-encompassing study on disaggregated energy use, covering the leading ten economies globally with the highest CO2 emission. The ten countries’ episodes, as economies with the leading emitters of CO2, make them of particular interest. Third, it is evident that quite a number of the studies that have investigated the environment-growth-energy-financial development theory used traditional panel estimation techniques, such as the Im-Pesaran-Shin and the Levin-Lin-Chu non-stationary tests, or the Johansen co-integration tests which do not account for the dependency of the units across the groups in the estimations. Ignoring the absence of independence across units and heterogeneity across the panel can cause the existence errors in forecasting and could lead to bias results. Therefore, the current study fills the literature gap by employing heterogeneous panel estimation techniques with cross-section dependence episodes, as economies with the leading emitters of CO2; make them of particular interest, such as by using cross sectional dependence unit root tests and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). The application of such methods minimizes the inherent problems in cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity, providing consistent and robust empirical estimates. Several basic policy questions remain. First, is fossil fuels energy consumption the principal cause of CO2 emissions and other traced GHGs? Second, assuming the unpredictability of the strength, timing, speed, and regional effects of possible climate change, what role does renewable energy play in reducing GHG emissions? Finally, what role does financial development exhibit in reducing GHG emissions? To help answer these questions, the study examine whether the process of burning fossil fuels energy is the principal cause of CO2 emissions and other traced GHGs that cause climate change. The study also assesses the role of renewable energy use in reducing GHG emissions. Lastly, the paper seeks to determine whether financial development plays a role in reducing the incidence of GHG emissions. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects of energy mix and financial development on GHG emissions reduction. Study uses annual data from 1990 to 2014 on the highest CO2 emitting countries and employed several robust panel econometric techniques. For instance, the cointegration among the variables is explored using the Fisher-type Johansen panel co-integration test while the long-run emission elasticities are estimated using the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) method, and finally the short-run dynamic causal relationship is examined using the heterogeneous panel causality test otherwise known as the Dumitrescu and Hurlin Granger causality test. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Following the introduction in Sect. 1 is Sect. 2 which reviews the existing literature; Sect. 3 sets forth the methodology and analytical framework; Sect. 4 explains the estimation strategy and data analysis; Sect. 5 discusses the empirical results; and Sect. 6 summarizes the conclusions that emerge from the study with policy implications.",15

This means that those in higher socio-economic groups are more likely to be exposed to the arts in their schools or social networks. Cultural and arts classes in-school increase later cultural consumption persistently (Kracman 1996; Kraaykamp 2003). Nagel et al. (2010) assert that such courses have a minor, albeit significant, effect compared with the influence of family and education. Income is another important factor, yet the empirical literature indicates that education plays a far greater determining role (Borgonovi 2004; O’Hagan 1996; Seaman 2006). In fact, socio-economic status may have a positive initial impact on consumption of the arts. Moreover, preferences for the arts are reinforced by ongoing consumption experiences (Lunn and Kelly 2008). There are four ways by which theatre demand can be examined: through aggregate attendance at theatres over time; through attendance at individual theatres at a point in time and/or over a small number of different time periods; through surveys of recorded individual preferences for theatre; and through reported attendance at theatre in general by each consumer. This paper uses very large and rich data sets for Italy, a country about which little is written in scientific economics journals in relation to participation in the arts (exceptions are Favaro and Frateschi 2007; Frateschi and Lazzaro 2008; Castiglione and Infante 2016). Favaro and Frateschi (2007) analysed the patterns of cultural choice in the musical domain in Italy, using survey data for one of the years used here, namely 2000. Frateschi and Lazzaro (2008) used the first two Multi-purpose Surveys of Italian Households carried out by ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics) to estimate the mutual influence of a partner’s educational and cultural background on consumption at three kinds of cultural venues: museums, theatres and opera houses/concert halls. Castiglione and Infante (2016) identify the principal determinants of demand for theatre in Italy, and test whether Italian theatregoers’ behaviour is consistent with the theory of rational addiction. The data come from two sources: ISTAT and SIAE (Italian Society of Authors and Publishers), that include socio-demographic and socio-economic indicators, proxies for time availability and indicators of patterns of consumption in other arts activities. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the various likely key determinants of theatre attendance at the level of the individual, drawing on some key published literature to date. This provides then the basis for the theoretical model being tested. Section 3 provides a discussion of the econometric model applied and of the data used to test these models. Section 4 presents the empirical results, with commentary, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",4

Italy is one of the countries that has been suffering more from that vicious circle. The dominant view is that the Italian crisis ultimately depends on its high public debt. The argument is that high public debt has to be repaid via taxation, and that (current or expected) taxation reduces consumption and therefore domestic demand. Moreover, it is stressed that high public debt depends on high public expenditure and that this ‘crowds out’ private investment, with negative effects on economic growth (see Giavazzi and Pagano 1990, 1996; Alesina and Perotti 1995, 1997; Alesina and Ardagna 1998, 2010). Consequently, the suggested policy prescriptions consist of the reduction of public spending—insofar as this strategy is supposed to stimulate both private consumption and investment—and the implementation of “structural reforms”, mainly via labour market deregulation. Moreover, it is also maintained that the Italian recession ultimately depends on ‘institutional weakness’, such as too much bureaucracy, corruption and low duration of governments (Macchiati 2016).Footnote 1 This paper aims at providing a different interpretation of the Italian economic stagnation, based on a Kaldorian theoretical framework. In particular, it will be argued that the constant decline of aggregate demand and labour productivity, which started in the 1990s, can be interpreted as a vicious circle of cumulative causation involving perverse interactions between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. It is well known that Kaldor refers to the positive relation between output growth and labour productivity in the manufacturing industry, with causality running from the former to the latter,Footnote 2 due to the increase in firm size, the increase in worker specialization and the presence of increasing returns to scale.Footnote 3 In other words, he develops his theory of economic growth based on the ‘accelerator’ effect. Kaldor named this effect “the Verdoorn Law”, in his Cambridge Inaugural Lecture in 1966. It is also known as the Kaldor–Verdoorn Law or Kaldor’s Second Growth Law: … the growth of real incomes was not determined by the growth of ‘factor supplies’ because, on account of increasing returns, higher rates of production growth were invariably associated with higher rates of growth of productivity” (Kaldor 1989, p. 87). And: “the growth of productivity will be greater the more technological change is ‘activated’ through new investment” (Kaldor 1989, p. 28). The last quote represents what the author calls the “technical production function”. The revised version of Kaldor’s Second Law proposed here (and tested in Sect. 4) is based on the role of the credit channel in affecting the relationship between aggregate demand and labour productivity. Two factors motivate the choice of considering the role of banking policy in exploring the nexus between the path of aggregate demand and that of labour productivity. First, on the empirical ground, bank credit is the most important source of financing for most Italian firms. This, in turn, depends on the fact that the Italian production system is mainly populated by small firms, which operate in ‘mature’ productive sectorsFootnote 4 and are more dependent on bank credit than big companies. Second, on the theoretical side, it is argued that a reduction in credit supply limits the possibility of investing for firms that will react by cutting labour demand. As a result, the increase of unemployment reduces wages and, for a given propensity to consume, also private consumption. Moreover, a reduction of credit supply contributes to reduce aggregate demand via the reduction of private investments, which, in turn, generates a drop in labour productivity. We provide evidence of a decline of aggregate demand spilling over into labour productivity. In the first part of our analysis we provide a reconstruction of the first phase of the Italian stagnation started in the early 1990s; in the second part we investigate empirically, for the period 2002–2015, the Kaldor–Verdoorn law—also labelled Kaldor’s second Law.Footnote 5 We contribute to the literature by enriching the Kaldorian framework with credit supply. There are two main reasons that spur us to use an augmented version of Kaldor’s second Law. First, Kaldor supported an endogenous money view and, although he did not explicitly address this topic in formulating this Law, it seems legitimate to consider the role of the banking sector in affecting the path of labour productivity, thus unifying two fundamental aspects of Kaldor’s work. Second, the augmented second Kaldor Law appears very useful for interpreting the Italian economic stagnation, insofar as the Italian economy is populated by small firms with low internal funds, dependent on the banking sector for financing their investments. The joint contribution of credit supply, labour productivity, consumption and investment is assessed empirically using the vector autoregression (VAR) methodology. The analysis covers the period starting from the euro changeover, while, in the specification including credit supply, the estimation starts from 2003, in order to use the bank lending survey, which started to be released in that year. Our empirical analysis shows that higher output, investment and/or private consumption increase labour productivity. In a richer model with credit supply, we confirm the latter evidence and we highlight the role played by credit supply in the transmission of shocks from demand to labour productivity. We do not claim to have established a clear-cut one-dimensional direction of causality since the VAR evidence confirms that the transmission channel also works from labour productivity to demand. Our results show that a Kaldorian interpretation of the relationship between aggregate demand and labour productivity is equally plausible. The exposition is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a reconstruction of the key factors behind the Italian economic stagnation. Section 3 focuses on Kaldor’s Second Law, providing a revision of its standard formulation, where credit supply plays a crucial role in affecting the path of labour productivity. Section 4 estimates the model using VAR models, Sect. 5 concludes and, finally, an appendix reports some diagnostic tests.",8
36,3,Economia Politica,02 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-017-0089-8,Estimating urban food waste at the local level: are good practices in food consumption persistent?,October 2019,Massimiliano Cerciello,Massimiliano Agovino,Antonio Garofalo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Food waste has recently been recognised as one of the key risk factors for the global environment, as well as an obstacle to long-term economic growth (Sobal and Nelson 2003; Lipinski et al. 2013; Parry et al. 2015). The food sector alone accounts for about one third of the greenhouse emissions in the EU (Garnett 2011), posing a relevant threat with respect to global warming. In the recent years, the UN estimated that about one-third of the total world production of food was lost or wasted (Gustavsson et al. 2011; Buzby and Hyman 2012; Thyberg and Tonjes 2016). Food waste represents a twofold problem: on the one hand, it entails a sub-optimal use of natural resources, fostering economic inefficiency and resource depletion; on the other hand, it generates costs related to waste disposal (Morone et al. 2016). All these points urge for the adoption of food waste reduction strategies, which have become a priority for many national governments and international organisations (Pearson et al. 2013; Platt et al. 2014; Priefer et al. 2016). In the EU, food waste is conceptually defined as any edible or inedible part of food that is removed from the supply chain and eventually disposed (Östergren et al. 2014). Over the last decade, several measures have been undertaken by public actors, aimed at promoting and spreading virtuous behaviours in order to reduce food waste (FAO 2014a). Most governmental actions in this field mainly resorted to fiscal instruments—either taxes or subsidiesFootnote 1 (Mazzoni 2013; Katare et al. 2017; Kravitz 2015). Other somewhat popular instruments included regulation, impositions of standards and mandatory labels, communication campaigns and educational programmes (OECD 2008). Awareness is the point on which soft governmental measures have been focusing over the last two decades, through educational campaigns and programmes targeting consumers (Priefer et al. 2016). Such programmes are meant to help consumers make correct shopping decisions as well as handle, prepare and store food efficiently (Porpino et al. 2015). The most famous campaign is the UK’s ‘Love Food, Hate Waste’, launched in 2007 (Quested et al. 2011). Over 5 years, it contributed to reduce food waste in Britain by 21%. Other similar initiatives have followed in France, Germany, Denmark, Catalonia and Portugal. The environmental literature has shown a positive relation between economic development and environmental awareness (Franzen and Meyer 2010). In spite of an increasing degree of awareness however, attitudes are likely to turn into behaviours only under certain specific conditions, e.g. when such behaviours are not especially costly (Diekmann and Preisendörfer 2003). Much has been learnt about these strategies and at present there is wide consensus in the literature on the fact that the food waste phenomenon must be tackled on both sides of the market: all along the production chain, producers and retailers need to share information and responsibility, working together towards to goal of a lower waste level (Pfaltzgraff et al. 2013; Göbel et al. 2015); on the other hand the determinants of consumer behaviours need to be fully disentangled to devise effective policy instruments to guide their choices (Griffin et al. 2009; Jörissen et al. 2015). Consumers are of vital importance not only due to their purchase and consumption decisions, but also for their general perception of food, which in turn influences heavily the industry standards (Rutten et al. 2013; Aschemann-Witzel et al. 2015). Along with public policy agendas, the public opinion has grown more and more concerned about devising strategies to reduce food waste (Quested et al. 2013a, b; Monier et al., 2011), meaning consumers themselves have become more aware of the urge to tackle the problem (Neff et al. 2015). Despite the lack of a universal definition, food waste may be roughly quantified at 1.3 billion tons per year (Monier et al. 2011), of which 88–89 million tons per year are produced in the EU-27 (BCFN 2012; Stenmarck et al. 2016). The European average is estimated at about 180 kg per capita a year (Monier et al. 2011; O’Connor 2013), although much variation is attested among the EU countries (see Fig. 1). While the Netherlands generated almost 600 kg per capita in 2010,—i.e. more than three times the EU average—Malta and Greece kept their levels below 61 kg per capita, which means they produced less than one-third of the EU average. Italy fared well enough, producing less than 150 kg per capita (BCFN 2012) and ranking in the lower half of the distribution. Source: our elaborations on data provided by the BCFN (2012) Food waste in 2010 in the EU countries (kg/capita) Significant within-country variation is reported in the Peninsula, where Southern regions feature lower consumption and waste levels (Mazzanti et al. 2008). The South differs in many regards from Northern and Central regions, namely in terms of both economic performance and cultural traits (Putnam et al. 1994; Tabellini 2010; Guiso et al. 2008). Both factors may contribute to explain the different levels of food waste. We focus on cultural traits, which shape pro-environmental behaviours (Crociata et al. 2016). Individual pro-environmental behaviours are often shared by social groups: in a survey at the individual level on recycling behaviours, virtuous citizen reported that 95% of their friends and neighbours were virtuous as well (Oskamp et al. 1991). Citizens surrounded by virtuous neighbours feel part of a positive mechanism when they adopt pro-environmental behaviours, whereas citizens surrounded by anti-environmental behaviours only perceive the costs of virtuous behaviours (Carlson 2001). However strict the governmental measures, individual incentives towards pro-environmental behaviours are more affected by what is considered a social standard than by the law (Bilz and Nadler 2014). In other words, in some cases cultural traits can be more binding than formal constraints (Guiso et al. 2016). Intuitively, the formation of cultural traits relies on interactions among individuals and on transaction costs, whose extent is related to geographical proximity (Fazio and Lavecchia 2013). Common values and beliefs gradually arise in the local communities that constitute disaggregated administrative units—e.g. municipalities or provinces—before nations. It is then reasonable to expect some degree of stickiness and spatial correlation in consumption practices, including food waste. This work investigates the role of temporal and spatial patterns in the virtuous and negative consumption practices that underlie food waste. We wonder to what extent pro-environmental behaviours are spatially related and persistent over time. We compute the local Moran transition probability matrix (LMTPM) for Italian provinces to highlight the role of neighbours. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 provides an unambiguous operational definition of urban food waste (UFW), in line with the recent EU standards, and shows how we calculate UFW levels for the Italian provinces. In addition, it outlines the methodological instruments we employ, drawn from the spatial econometrics literature. In particular, it presents the LMTPM, which allows us to investigate the presence of spatial dependence patterns in consumer behaviours. Section 3 presents our results, highlighting spatiotemporal persistence patterns. Section 4 discusses our findings in the light of the recent literature and outlines the policy implications of this work. Section 5 offers our concluding remarks and some cues for further research.",14

The crisis has also challenged the financing methods of social security systems, raising growing concerns on their effectiveness and on their redistributive capacity (Afonso and Allegre 2011; Piachaud 2013; D’Addio 2015). Social spending plays a fundamental role in protecting human rights, in combating poverty and inequality, as well as in providing insurance against exogenous shocks (Townsend 2009). Moreover, it supports individuals throughout their life cycle, especially during phases of macroeconomic recession, facilitating job mobility and matching, supporting the formation of human capital and paving the way for economic stability (Furia et al. 2016). The austerity measures progressively introduced by EU countries from 2008 however had relevant repercussions on social spending. Austerity in this perspective contributes to reducing the costs of the economic crisis at the expense of labour and social security (Blyth 2013). The current scenario calls again into question a long-standing debate, i.e. whether an extensive Welfare State (WS) and sustained economic growth are incompatible goals; in other words, whether it is necessary to reduce the first in order to stimulate the second (Atkinson 1995). The relationship between WS and economic growth has been studied along two main paradigms, namely Keynesian and Neoliberal models, offering opposing views. While Keynesians argue that welfare creates a real demand in macroeconomic systems, Neoliberals in contrast state that the social policy is a cost that stifles growth. During the last 40 years some scholars have argued that the WS makes economies less productive and competitive, hampering economic growth through distortions in economic activities and disincentives in the labour market (Phelps 1996; Mares 2010). Unemployment benefits for instance provide disincentives to labour supply, since they guarantee an income for unemployed workers and increase their reservation wage. More generally, Welfare State Expenditure (WSE) generates a cost for the production system, which translates into an increase in labour costs, thus reducing competitiveness in globalised markets and boosting public debt (Prosperetti 2013). By contrast, the recent literature has highlighted the positive behavioural effects related to unemployment benefits, that incentivise investments in human capital during temporary unemployment spells (Estevez-Abe et al. 2001). That is, WSE may generate economic externalities that outweigh the potential distortions they produce (Lindert 2004a). A stream of the economic literature has stressed the positive effect of WSE on capital accumulation (Barro 1990). Social spending as a whole for example promotes the accumulation of social capital by improving civic trust levels (Kumlin and Rothstein 2005), while expenditure on health and education increases investment in human capital (Piachaud 2013). These arguments indicate that public expenditure may be productive and that a well-designed welfare system potentially increases fairness and efficiency, contributing to economic stability (Fouarge 2003). These approaches share some common features with the concept of social investment proposed in the theoretical literature (Esping-Andersen 2002), according to which WSE can be considered both as a prerequisite for competitiveness and as a resource that provides and preserves human and social capital. The relationship between public expenditure, economic performance and social objectives is then more complex than the simple welfare-growth trade-off hypothesis illustrated above (Gough 1996; Hall and Soskice 2001; Begg et al. 2003; Acocella et al. 2004; Castles 2004; Lindert 2004a, b). The empirical literature has been investigating the impact of the WSE on growth, obtaining different and sometimes conflicting results, with no definite conclusion on the direction of the effect (see Simoes et al. 2014 for a theoretical and empirical literature review). We try to overcome the trade-off between WSE and economic growth, departing from the consideration that the total amount of spending provides little information on the substantive effect of WSE on growth, since it fails to capture WSE composition (Esping-Andersen 1990). In this view, the aggregate spending approach seems to be less inappropriate for understanding the WSE-growth nexus and deriving meaningful and useful policy implications. Our main hypothesis is that different dimensions of WSE are likely to have different effects on growth. This article seeks to extend the disaggregated expenditure approach with two main contributions to the empirical literature: first, based on the recent literature, we distinguish among four spending categories and we expand these categories, analysing six social expenditure items (see Castles 2009; Kuitto 2011). To do so, we resort to data drawn from European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS, provided by Eurostat), considering separately cash transfers and benefits in kind for each item during the 1995–2013 timespan for the EU15 countries. Second, we use PVAR techniques, allowing for bidirectional effects, to assess the effect of WSE on economic growth. In other words, we investigate endogenous the interactions between economic growth and single social expenditure items in order to address the research hypothesis. Our econometric strategy allows to evaluate the impulse and time persistence that each single function (item) of WSE generates on growth. To the best of our knowledge, this type of disaggregation has never been applied. The article is divided into six sections: Sect. 2 presents the rationale of the study, providing some relevant literature. Section 3 describes and discusses the econometric approach used in the analysis. Section 4 introduces our dataset. Section 5 outlines and discusses the results, providing some robustness checks. Section 6 offers our final considerations and concluding remarks.",4

Our goal is to propose and test a time-varying expectations formation mechanism (EFM) aimed to explain the central tendency of lay forecasters’ short-run inflation expectations across disparate price dynamics. From the empirical standpoint, we use median expectations for US inflation as gathered by the University of Michigan survey of Consumers (UMC).Footnote 1 We focus on median expectations (henceforth, the “consensus”) because the central tendency of the general public’s expectations is paramount for both macroeconomic models and policies. We focus on price expectations for their key role in economics as well as because US inflation dynamics have recently been both potentially very informative and puzzling. For instance, it seems interesting to learn the possible change in the way people form expectations before and throughout the great moderation (GM) period and/or in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. As per the puzzling behavior of inflation dynamics, Friedrich (2016) has investigated the “twin puzzle” of higher-than-expected inflation despite economic slack from 2009 to 2011 and weakening inflation despite economic recovery starting in 2012. Inserting survey-based inflation expectations in a Phillips curve for 1995–2013, Friedrich finds that these measures of inflation expectations account for the twin puzzle. Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) suggest that the 2009–2011 missing deflation can be explained by the rise of household inflation expectations induced by rising oil prices.Footnote 2 Though these works correctly stress the role of expectations in inflation dynamics (cf., also, Leduc and Sill 2013), they left unexplored several aspects of the EFM. This said, the evidence that consumers’ inflation expectations impinge on actual inflation offers another motivation for this paper. From the theoretical standpoint, we make three main assumptions. First, we claim that the consensus on one-step ahead expectations (\(\pi_{t + 12}^{e}\)) is biased toward overestimation.Footnote 3 This is because of the stylized fact that most agents earn fixed-incomes such as wages and pensions.Footnote 4 The median forecaster, accordingly, forms expectations to reduce the probability of incurring in negative forecast errors (\(\pi_{t + 12}^{e} - \pi_{{{\text{t}} + 1 2}}\)). The idea behind this assumption is not new and it is well established but, as far as we know, never used as we do here. Shiller found evidence that, among the general public, the largest concern with inflation was that it lowers people’s standard of living (Shiller 1997). Similar findings are reported by other authors (Shafir et al. 1997; Akerlof et al. 2000). This view is also coherent with the stylized fact that wage/pension indexation systems are more widespread in higher inflation periods/countries (Hendricks and Kahn 1985; Holland 1995; Whitehouse 2009). Though a minor issue, even overestimation may be costly so that forecasters must somewhat mediate between under and overestimation. This leads to the second assumption. Second, we hypothesize that the EFM used for predicting \(\pi_{t + 12}^{e}\) is a time-varying combination of current inflation (πt), expected long-run inflation (\(\pi_{LR}^{e}\)), and uncertainty (\(\sigma_{t}^{2}\)). Assuming that inflation expectations are based on inflation is natural and common in the literature (see, e.g., Evans and Honkapohja 2001). We insert the long-run expected inflation in the EFM because short-run expectations could be(come) anchored to some reference level of inflation (Bernanke 2010). A flexible model should allow this (testable) case, especially in light of the let-the-data-speak approach that we follow in this paper. Uncertainty enters the EFM because of the assumed bias toward overestimation—higher uncertainty may induce higher forecasting errors. It is important to note that we expect uncertainty significantly enters the EFM only when it increases the probability of making negative forecast errors. The assumption of a time-varying weighting scheme is due to the sensitivity of fixed-income agents to inflation patterns. Since the 70s, indeed, the US has been recording “tremendous changes in inflation dynamics” (p. 1, Stock and Watson 2010). Third, as per estimation methods we posit that lay forecasters do not use “optimization procedures”. In so doing we follow strands of the literature such as Simon’s bounded rationality (Simon 1957) and Shiller’s irrational exuberance (Shiller 2000). We are also in line with Kirman (2006, p. 271), which argued that “individuals are not optimizers, they are adaptive and only behave “as if” they optimize”, and Fuster et al. (2010) which claimed that in forming expectations “agents unconsciously combine many insights”. Though possibly sub-optimal, predictions are neither random nor aimless. In the present paper, specifically, lay forecasters follow the informal logic described in Sect. 2, naively combining the parameters of the EFM to avoid underestimation. In their informal calibration efforts, agents may occasionally end up with predictions congruent with optimal forecasting rules. Some parametrizations of the proposed EFM, in fact, are compatible with both cost-minimizing and sub-optimal forecasting rules (Sect. 2.1). The contextual presence of rational (cost-minimizing) and sub-optimal behavior in the EFM is a common trait in the existing literature. If Muth-rationality is still the workhorse of macroeconomic models, evidence of departures from it is now well-established (Evans and Honkapohja 2001). In this sense, our approach is also in line with—though more general than—that of “natural expectations”, whereas forecasts are modeled as lying in between rational and naïve expectations (Fuster et al. 2010). This paper complements other strands of the research on expectations, too. The potential emergence of disparate EFMs brings our approach close to the body of work emphasizing the possibility that agents switch across different forecasting models (Brock and Hommes 1997). A difference is that in the present paper the switch is not triggered by models’ predictive abilityFootnote 5 but, rather, by the will to reduce the probability of underestimations that we posit to be dependent on the inflation context. Capistrán (2008) discusses the possibility of optimally biased expectations and studies the change in the shape parameter of an asymmetric loss function over some sub-samples. However, he imposes optimally biased expectations and deals with professional forecasters. Trehan (2015) compares the predictive ability of different forecasting models with the Michigan survey’s inflation expectations over time, but the author uses symmetric metrics. To the extent that consumers have motives to distort their forecasts, biased expectations are not an indication of poor predictive skill. In our setting, rationally cautious expectations may emerge. And, indeed, they show up (Sect. 4). The proposed EFM fits well with the UMC data. In addition, the evidence confirms that the EFM changes over time and, in particular, that it varies according to the theorized modus operandi. Moreover, the proposed behavioral model can explain some puzzling events recently witnessed by the US inflation. The missing disinflation, e.g., seems to be linked to a calibration mainly based on \(\pi_{LR}^{e}\) (that was greater than current inflation) and on uncertainty. In the following months, short run expectations were still determined by long term expectations, but with a smaller weight. Moreover, the effect of uncertainty shrunk. This may have hampered the reflation predicted by standard models. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed expectations formation mechanism, Sect. 3 the data, and Sect. 4 collects the empirical results. Concluding remarks and two Appendices close the paper.",

Is it more convenient to become a doctor or save years of study and become only a paramedic? Will future developments in artificial intelligence make redundant many jobs in the health-care sector? What happens if the government deregulates the access to medical schools? If current entry restrictions are levied, how many students will flow in these schools and how competitive will be the medical profession in the future? Questions like these are likely to cross the minds of those that are involved in the educational decisions of the young. Making a good investment at this stage is decisive for the performance in the labor market and, more in general, for life-long welfare (Mincer 1974). Crucial as they are, educational investments exhibit two key features. The first is the uncertainty regarding their returns as individuals are imperfectly informed on the opportunities ensuing from any available choice. The second is the interdependency with the investments made by other agents. The opportunities associated with any choice depend not only on future developments in technology and institutions but also on the number of other individuals making the same choice. Typically, a profession becomes congested and returns decline if too many individuals decide to enter. In the present contribution we first formally describe the educational decision of a rational agent in a context featuring uncertainty and interdependency. Second, on a normative ground, we investigate whether the diffusion of public forecasts on the prospect of professions turns out to be beneficial or detrimental for social welfare. The normative issue is connected to the fact that, in many advanced countries, public resources are devoted to the production of forecasts on labour demand over the short and the medium run. In the EU, for instance, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) devotes great attention and resources to the skill forecast activity. Similarly, in Italy, the Union of the Chambers of Commerce surveys every year a large sample of firm leaders to forecast prospective labour demand in a range of finely defined professions (Indagine Unioncamere-Excelsior). Clearly, the purpose of these activities is that of providing useful indications not only for policymakers and educational agencies but also for individuals. However, from the evidence available, individuals do not seem to pay much attention to freely available and potentially useful labour market information. In fact, subjective assessments concerning the returns of education are remarkably heterogeneous. For instance, Betts (1996) highlights that the average absolute error when estimating educational returns is as high as 20%. Similar results are offered by Dominitz and Masky (1996) and Brunello et al. (2004). In this respect, we will show that our model provides a possible explanation for such an high dispersion in individual estimates, an explanation that relies on the interdependency in agents’ education choices. However, treating individuals so as to elicit their attention towards freely available information on the returns to education induces revisions in subjective assessments and in educational decisions (Wiswal and Zafar 2013). This confirms us on the fact that individuals do use public information to refine their estimates. In a seminal paper, Morris and Shin (2002) argue that public information of better quality does not necessarily improve social welfare if individual decisions are interdependent, since public information may exacerbate coordination failures that are responsible of suboptimal decisions. This poses a question which is central to our contribution. In fact, we address the issue as to whether is it possible that the diffusion of forecasts turns out to be detrimental for the welfare of individuals and of the society as a whole. In the context of education, a more precise public information may harm social welfare along two channels. First, individual decisions may become excessively reactive to public news. Think, for instance, of a public agency that prospects an expansion in the demand for a given profession. An excessive reaction causes a congestion as too many individuals decide to enter. Second, an improvement in the quality of public information may crowd out the acquisition of private information in a context where such acquisition is already too low. Nonetheless, public information of better quality does reduce uncertainty and, along this way, it turns out to be beneficial. Inspired by these remarks—and borrowing the framework developed in Angeletos and Pavan (2007) and Colombo et al. (2014)—in this paper we study educational decisions by using an economic environment that captures many traits of real world decisions. In the model, a continuum of agents invest in education with uncertain returns in terms of future wages. From the perspective of a single agent, wages are uncertain as they depend upon a stochastic fundamental as well as on the amount of educational investments made by all other agents. Exogenous technological uncertainty is therefore complemented by endogenous uncertainty ensuing from the behavior of the others. Agents observe two signals on the fundamental. One signal is public in the sense that it is common knowledge that all agents observe such a signal. The other signal is private. As a consequence of observing private signals, the expectation over the fundamental—and over the wage—is heterogeneous across agents. The precision of the public signal is exogenous to agents while the precision of the private signal depends on the amount of time and intellectual resources devoted by agents to the selection and processing of relevant information. In fact, when it comes to decide for an educational track, individuals attempt to form a personal judgement on labour market opportunities. Usually, they do so by searching and elaborating pieces of information believed to be relevant. The model exhibits two points of strength. First, it allows a rigorous analysis of educational decisions in an environment characterized by uncertainty and interdependence. In this respect, we find that agents behave strategically in mapping signals to decisions. In the mapping, agents assign to signals a weight that depends not only on their informativeness but also on their ability to induce a positive or negative correlation between the individual and the aggregate decisions. More in detail, since large educational investments by other agents cause congestion and reduce the return from her own investment, an agent has an incentive to contain the correlation between her investment and that of the others. The agent does so by assigning to her private signal a weight that exceeds the pure Bayesian one. The private signal is over-weighted because it represents not only a piece of information but also a device which allows the agent to disconnect her investment from that of the others. A second point of strength is the usage of the model to study the welfare impact of changes in the quality of public information. Morris and Shin (2002) pioneer the topic by showing that more public information can be harmful for welfare in an environment where agents are endowed with a fixed amount of private information and have a concern to coordinate. Angeletos and Pavan (2007) extend this analysis to more general economies keeping private information exogenous, while Colombo et al. (2014) endogenise the acquisition of private information. Our concern is that of unveiling the implications of this approach for the policy relevant issue of efficient skill acquisition. For this reason, following Colombo et al. (2014), we adopt a second best approach assuming that the market distortion are substantial and cannot be corrected by means of Pigouvian tax or subsidies. Accordingly, along our analysis, what the planner handles is the provision of public information. We compute the comparative statics following a change in the precision of the public signal; in passing, we show that the intuitions provided by Angeletos and Pavan (2007) remain valid in our second-best economy. The main result of this exercise is that the social value of public information depends on the distortions of the labour market and on the shape of the information acquisition costs. We find that an increase in the quality of public information turns out to be welfare improving, unless the distortions on the labour market are particularly strong. An explicit objective stated in the EU ‘New Skill Agenda’—launched in June 2016—is that of improving information and understanding of trends and patterns in demands for skills and jobs. While our findings are supportive of the policies advocated in this agenda our model provides a rationale for an effort in the dissemination of such a knowledge to the wide public. The article is composed of three more sections. In Sect. 2 we build the model and derive the equilibrium. In Sect. 3 we analyze the welfare properties of the model and compute the effects of an increase in the precision of the public signal. Finally, in Sect. 4 we conclude with some remarks on the policy implications of our results.",4
37,1,Economia Politica,04 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-020-00174-9,The impact of environmental policy on location patterns in the waste management industry,April 2020,Aleksandra Falkowska,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Is there a trade-off between environmental policy stringency and competitiveness? This question has been often asked in the context of two vigorously debated hypotheses: the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) and the Porter Hypothesis (PH). The former can be traced back to the 1970s, when researchers developed first theoretical models showing that stringent environmental regulations could impair a country’s competitiveness in the world markets (Pethig 1976; Siebert 1977). The latter was formulated by Porter (1991) and postulates that properly designed environmental policy leads to innovations which may, in turn, enhance firms’ international competitiveness. There are numerous publications that provide some support for both hypotheses, but the evidence is mixed. Most researchers confirm rather a pollution haven effectFootnote 1 than the PHH (Smarzynska and Wei 2001; Eskeland and Harrison 2003; Cole 2004; Kellogg et al. 2007; Mulatu et al. 2010). The research on the PH finds the connection between strict regulations and increased innovations but the hypothesis is usually confirmed only in its ”weak” version (Brunnermeier and Cohen 2003; Popp 2006; Lanoie et al. 2011; Rammer and Rexhauser 2011).Footnote 2 The PHH and the PH can be viewed either as competing or as complementary hypotheses. Both make predictions about the impact of environmental regulations on industry competitiveness, but these predictions seem to contradict each other. However, confirming the PHH is not necessarily equivalent to disproving the PH. It can happen, for example, when a country has a stringent, but inflexible environmental policy. Most studies choose to test just one of the two hypotheses, there is, however, also a call for an integrated approach (D’Agostino 2015). The waste management industry (WMI) is suitable for testing the PH and the PHH simultaneously. It is important to notice that both the PHH and the PH are based on the comparative advantage framework. Therefore, if environment is incorporated in the analysis as one of the production factors, then it is possible to show the effect of environmental regulation on factor prices and allocation. In fact, McGuire (1982) developed a theoretical model explaining how an introduction of stricter environmental controls affects the polluting sector and the clean sector of a country. If disposal and recovery sectors are considered polluting and clean respectively, it can be argued that strengthening environmental regulations causes factors’ marginal productivities in the disposal sector to decrease. This leads to an outflow of capital and labor into the less polluting sector until the marginal productivities are equalized again. The disposal sector shrinks and the recovery sector becomes larger. If free trade is assumed, the heterogeneity of the WMI makes it conceivable that some firms, faced with stricter regulations, will follow the PH and increase their market share, while others will go out of business unable to cope with competition from countries having lax regulations. In other words, different levels of regulatory stringency across countries may generate specialization. This is consistent with how Grossman and Krueger (1991) view the relationship between free trade and the environment. They argue that trade liberalization affects the environment in three ways. There are scale, technology, and composition effects. A composition effect brings about greater specialization among countries, and thus can create pollution havens. It occurs when the differences in the stringency level of environmental regulations become an important source of comparative advantage. The present study considers three treatment options: landfilling (the dirtiest), incineration, as well as recycling (the cleanest) and it adopts the extended version of the Heckscher–Ohlin framework (with environment as one of the production factors). This approach allows for the formulation of the following hypotheses:  Countries characterized by relatively lax environmental controls tend to have a comparative advantage in waste disposal services. Countries with stringent environmental regulations tend to have a comparative advantage in waste recovery services (comprising recycling and incineration). Both hypotheses are based on the idea of comparative advantage, but the first one can be associated with the PHH while the other one with the PH.Footnote 3 There are real-world examples suggesting that some countries have developed a comparative advantage in recycling because of advanced technology they possess, whereas other countries seem to have a comparative advantage in landfilling. For instance, as of 2017, no waste management firm in Poland has the technology required to recover metals from spent catalysts, used in chemical processes. Consequently, Anwil SA, one of the largest fertilizers, plastics, and chemicals producers in the CEECs region, faces the choice of either paying for the disposal of its spent catalysts in a hazardous waste landfill in Poland or to being paid for the material by a foreign-based company which has access to the technology necessary for the recovery of valuable metals. Even though the export of hazardous waste is very expensive (transportation costs, lengthy bureaucratic procedures, etc.) the firm still finds it profitable to sell the spent catalysts to a Dutch company instead of disposing of them domestically.Footnote 4 Trade in the opposite direction usually occurs because of the differences in price for waste management services. In the 1990s there was some controversy in the media over the issue of dumping used tyres from Western Europe in Eastern European landfills (van Beukering 2001). The disposal fees in Eastern Europe were much lower than those in the West, as were the environmental protection standards. It must be noted here that trade in all hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste intended for disposal is restricted and that this fact violates the assumption of free trade: a key element of the theoretical framework adopted for this study. The restrictions, in force, make it difficult for countries to specialize in waste disposal services. By investigating location patterns under these conditions it is possible to test whether the EU policies have been successful in preventing the creation of pollution havens. If there is no pollution haven effect, it may mean that either the environmental regulations are efficient, or too strict, or that they are not necessary at all. If, however, a pollution haven effect is present, despite strict regulations, the restrictions can be seen as justified.Footnote 5 In such a case it is very likely that a pollution haven effect would be stronger in the absence of restrictions. It should be emphasized that the restrictions (mostly costly bureaucratic procedures) do not prohibit trade (although there are rare exceptions), but simply make it more expensive. Therefore, the differences in disposal fees among countries have to be far greater for the trade to occur and for the pollution haven effect to be revealed. In this study the waste management sector is treated as an industry, which is affected by environmental regulations, in such a way that it uses different technologies and approaches depending on the stringency level of said regulations. This feature of the WMI makes it possible to test both hypotheses empirically by investigating the location patterns of various treatment options. The major limitation of previous research is the fact that it tests the PHH without making any distinction between waste destined for recovery and that destined for final disposal.Footnote 6 Without making this distinction, analyzing trade in waste results at most in revealing a moderate or small pollution haven effect.Footnote 7 Generally, existing studies make it clear that developed countries are net importers of hazardous waste (Baggs 2009; Kellenberg and Levinson 2014). Moreover, Baggs (2009) suggests that if there were no distance costs, the trade in toxic waste would more than double with the largest increase in shipments to OECD nations.Footnote 8 Most papers investigating the impact of environmental policies on the WMI focus on the PHH. One recent piece of research, however, confirms the ”weak” version of the PH by showing that the number of innovations in the waste management sector tends to increase as a country’s environmental policy becomes more stringent (Cecere and Corrocher 2016). In addition to the research on trade flows, there is one study on location decisions of waste management firms. Stafford (2000) analyzed location patterns of the hazardous waste management industry in the United States and confirmed a pollution haven effect. The present paper is the first attempt the author is aware of, to investigate WMI location patterns in an international setting. This study also contributes to the literature by comparing two measures of regulatory stringency. The first, basic index, abbreviated as SER (Stringency of Environmental Regulations), has been inspired by the available literature (Kheder and Zugravu 2012), while the second measure, a proxy for regulatory stringency (PRS), has been constructed by the author. The detailed description of both measures, and the reasons for their selection can be found in Sect. 4. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the background information on the waste management sector in the EU. Section 3 outlines the empirical model. Section 4 presents the measures of environmental stringency. Section 5 describes the dataset. Section 6 reports and discusses the empirical results. The last section concludes the paper.",3

This is despite the ‘no one left behind’ ethical imperative of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (a United Nations policy framework adopted in 2015 listing 17 Sustainable Development Goals to mobilise efforts to end all forms of poverty and to fight inequalities). In fact, in most countries income inequality is related to territorial urban-rural imbalances, which still hinder development (OECD 2018a, b), with the spatial dimension of inequality representing a key concern in major policy discourse, at both the international (Kanbur 2015) and subnational levels (Rodríguez-Pose 2018). In particular, all over the world rural and remote regions suffer from specific structural weaknesses such as a population drain, a reduction in economic activity, a disaggregation of the fabric of society and increasing costs in terms of land management (Barca et al. 2014). When only considering developed economies, although counter-urbanisation processes have partially balanced the above negative trends making the overall situation more scattered (Dematteis 1986; OECD 2009, 2018b), several rural and remote areas still suffer from severe drawbacks (Copus et al. 2015). In the European Union (EU), since the late 1970s the so-called ‘great inversion’ has caused job losses, declining labour-force participation and declining per capita income in many rural regions and small-to-medium-sized metropolitan areas which were once quite prosperous. Thus, the contrast with large metropolitan areas, which are very dynamic in terms of income and employment creation and which have represented the targets of most growth policies (Rodríguez-Pose 2018), has become sharper and sharper (Iammarino et al. 2018). In the words of Rodríguez-Pose (2018), rural areas have become “places that do not matter.” This also affects national government choices, as they are expected to pay a heavy economic (and social) price, also in terms of “political danger” (Barca et al. 2014; Iammarino et al. 2018; Rodríguez-Pose 2018). In particular, remote and rural areas directly affect national levels of income poverty and income inequality. In 2014, 27% of the EU’s rural population were at risk of poverty and social exclusion compared to only 24% of those living in urban areas. However, these figures vary considerably among EU member states: rural poverty levels are higher in southern and eastern Europe, where poverty is associated with rural isolation (Bishop et al. 2006; Bertolini et al. 2008; Copus et al. 2015). This topic has recently become a source of interest, and not only regarding the EU. Although Dijkstra et al. (2015) claim that some EU rural and intermediate regions displayed more resilience to the recent economic crisis, empirical studies suggest rural areas increase national income inequality in China (Chotikapanich et al. 2007) and Australia (NRHA 2014)—two very diverse countries. In the EU, one of its most expensive policies (i.e. the Common Agricultural Policy, or CAP) tackles this issue. In fact, the CAP supports not only farmers’ incomes but also rural development (Shucksmith et al. 2005) through the EU Rural Development Policy 2014–2020 (EU Regulation No 1305/2013), which is co-funded by the EU and member states. The Rural Development Policy promotes social inclusion and poverty reduction through its priority of “promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas,” which targets wider rural economic development. Even in its envisaged post-2020 reform of the CAP, the European Commission confirms that “the CAP, and in particular the Rural Development Policy, has an important role to play to promote rural jobs and growth” (European Commission 2017, p. 21). Reinforcing what had already been established in the 2014–2020 regime, it stresses that the CAP, and the Rural Development Policy in particular, is expected to pursue greater subsidiarity in order to better take local conditions and needs into account and fully mobilise the rural potential. With regard to poverty and income inequality in the EU, Italy represents an interesting case study. Besides the well-known North–South socioeconomic divide, the urban-rural one can also affect inequality (Bertolini et al. 2008). Remote and other rural municipalities suffer from a lower availability of essential services (e.g. education, health and mobility), and, according to well-known circular and cumulative causation (Myrdal 1957), backwash effects have fuelled greater marginalisation over time (Barca et al. 2014). Thus, a specific national strategy, namely the National Strategy for Inner Areas (henceforth, SNAI, its Italian acronym), was launched in 2012 (Barca et al. 2014). Focusing on the Italian case, and employing a municipality-level dataset retrieved from administrative sources (for the years 2012–2015), this paper aims to assess whether and to what extent rural and remote areas affect national income inequality. To answer this question, the paper introduces two main novelties. First, it considers urban-rural divides using the enriched classification proposed by the SNAI, which distinguishes six types of areas (from urban poles to ultra-peripheral areas). This makes it possible to overcome more conventional urban-rural dichotomies (Pagliacci 2017). Moreover, this classification, which is grounded on the availability of essential services rather than on population density, highlights ‘inner areas.’ These are municipalities located at a considerable distance from major urban poles and hence suffer from a limited provision of essential services. This approach is expected to give greater room for policymaker interventions. A second innovation of this paper is that it performs an econometric analysis using the unconditional quantile regression method originally proposed by Firpo et al. (2009) to evaluate how distributional statistics of income inequality change with marginal variations in explanatory variables (i.e. rural area dummies and covariates). This method involves running a regression of the recentered influence function (RIF) of the unconditional distributional statistic on the explanatory variables (Firpo et al. 2009). Using this methodology, the paper proves that inner areas have a significant (and robust) effect on gross income distribution at the national level, leading to a reduction in mean and median gross income and to an increase in the Gini index. Therefore, the presence of inner areas represents a further source of income inequality across Italy. In addition to geographical features, also socioeconomic ones and political choices (e.g. regarding infrastructure endowment or incentives for municipalities to merge and pool their provision of services) affect it. It should be understood that we refrain from interpreting the estimates as a causal effect of inner areas on distributional statistics in Italy. Nevertheless, just like Choe and Van Kerm (2018) with regard to the effect of foreign workers on wage inequality in Luxembourg, we consider our results provide an interesting insight (even if indirectly) into how inner areas contribute to the shape of overall gross income distribution. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 sets the scene by discussing the main concepts adopted and the theoretical background. Section 3 addresses the available data. Section 4 then presents the results and Sect. 5 concludes.",5

A regional analysis of Italian NEETs,April 2020,Iacopo Odoardi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The social and economic problem of young people who do not work and are not involved in educational and training courses concerns many advanced economies. During the prolonged post-2007 crisis recession, the NEET phenomenon strongly increased (Scarpetta et al. 2010; Signorelli and Choudhry 2015), influenced by both high unemployment (particularly for young people) and the difficulty in obtaining returns from education, further hampering the investment in human capital. In Italy, the latter two aspects seem to play a strong and negative role, increasing the likelihood of young people becoming NEETs. During the Great Recession, the youthFootnote 1 unemployment rate reached a peak of 42.7% in 2014, while some regions in the poorest part of the country—the so-called Mezzogiorno (southern area)—registered a rate over 55% (Istat data). At the same time, Italy is known for being a developed economy with a development path characterized by a lack of attention to innovation and scientific research (Nuvolari and Vasta 2015), reflecting a model of specialization similar to that in emerging markets (European Union 2013). In recent years, this condition has implied a minimal contribution of human capital to the national economy (Di Liberto 2008; Odoardi and Muratore 2019b) due to the inability to exploit the returns from education. The low importance attributed to advanced education contributed to a school dropout rate of 13.8% in 2016 (European average of 10.7%) and a share of young peopleFootnote 2 with tertiary education of only 26.2% (European average of 39.2%, Eurostat data). Our study aims to extend a specific aspect of the influence of family background (e.g., Gorard 2010; Alfieri et al. 2015) on the state of inactivity with respect to education and work affecting young people. We wonder whether parents’ education can play a role in fostering the educational and professional integration of new generations, thereby countering the growing NEET phenomenon, and in limiting the long-term socioeconomic risks that this phenomenon entails. In particular, we focus on the level of education of the adult population, and we analyze its influence in reducing the inactivity of young Italians, especially those at risk of being NEET during the Great Recession. Our research question is as follows: Does the strengthening of the household educational level have a daunting effect on the population of young NEETs in Italy? Our idea is based on Bynner et al. (2000) and Bynner and Parsons (2002), who suggest that parents’ educational level and the interest in children’s education have an influence on a young person’s probability of being a NEET, and Gaspani (2019) found that cultural resources at the household level favor strategies oriented beyond those presently used to counteract the NEET condition. The mechanism that we hypothesize exists in the analyzed context is similar to other mechanisms known in the literature. Gary S. Becker (1975) suggested a relationship in the US between parental education and wealth and the level of children’s human capital. For example, in addition to being able to pay for better schools, highly educated parents are more capable of managing the educational choices of their children, thus creating at the household level the pro-active conditions for effective learning that are found in the school environment (De Graaf et al. 2000). Similarly, highly educated parents tend to induce a more appreciative attitude toward cultural attendance (Sullivan 2001) and toward pushing children to acquire skills related to school performance (Gouzouasis et al. 2007). Our idea is as follows. Similarly to highly educated parents, a highly educated society can encourage the continuation of schooling of young people and favor the attainment of skills and abilities that are useful for finding a good job. In contrast, a lack of awareness of the importance of education and experience (e.g., suggesting a correct training path) could lead to discouraging investment in human capital between generations, difficulties in access to the labor market and, at a time of economic recession, to reinforcing the NEET phenomenon. In fact, the role that a society or a family attributes to education has a relevant impact similar to the effect of the parents’ education acting through the parental interest and involvement in their children’s education (Darton and Strelitz 2003). Studies on the serious NEET problem in advanced countries examine numerous factors, such as problems in the transition to adulthood (Reiter and Schlimbach 2015), the role of individual personality attributes in view of significant socioeconomic changes (Rahman 2007), the structural changes that have imposed new lifestyles on young people (Furlong 2008), government responsibilities (Maguire 2013), education systems and social disparities (Quintano et al. 2018), and proposing methods or definitions to estimate and identify the young people involved (e.g., Bălan 2015; Maguire 2015; Batini et al. 2017). The role of socioeconomic family background and parents’ education are also known and tested in the literature (Bynner and Parsons 2002), as in studies on Italy that consider families’ characteristics (e.g., Alfieri et al. 2015). In this framework, the influence of parents’ overall participation in decisions related to young people’s education and careers is tested (Rennison et al. 2005 for the UK). In this article, we introduce a focus on two different age groups, referring to the adult population and young people framed in the context of NEET, and we hypothesize that skills and experiences related to Italian parents’ educational level have an effect on the precarious condition of their children—mainly influencing schooling decisions, educational opportunities and efficient job-search advising—in the broader research field of family status influence. We focus on Italy because of the country’s low social mobility (Di Pietro and Urwin 2003) and because there exists a sort of transmission of work occasions between generations (Mocetti 2007). Therefore, we expect a similar causal effect to also be verified for NEET status because, for example, few Italian students have parents with an advanced educational qualification but those who have highly educated parents are more likely to achieve a higher level of education (OECD 2017a). Furthermore, the focus on the role played by the adult population—representing one of the possible family supports for young people in precarious working conditions—begins with many scholars’ observations of certain causes aggravating the NEET phenomenon: the effects of the recession on the labor market (Bruno et al. 2014), a lack of specific legislative attention (Cuzzocrea 2014), and poverty conditions, in addition to educational, health and social problems (Nardi et al. 2013). All these aspects are linked to the role of the “auxiliary welfare” of the family in the Italian context to different extents (e.g., Cuzzocrea 2014). This condition suggests that the family deserves special attention in studies on NEET, but while the effect of economic status and persistent inequalities are known (Di Pietro and Urwin 2003), less attention has been paid to the “transmission of human capital” among generations (e.g., the model of Becker and Tomes 1979) in the specific case of young NEETs. Through panel data analysis, we compare the effects of the regional educational levels related to the adult population and other control variables in influencing the NEET rate and controlling for spatial effects in the 2007–2016 period. In the panel data analysis, we also consider the possibility of observing an endogeneity problem between the NEET rate and the proxy variables for education. Our analysis is based on regional data with the aim of considering the local-level educational and labor market characteristics that have a strong influence on the NEET phenomenon (Bacher et al. 2017). Furthermore, in the analysis of the NEET rate, the economic literature suggests comparing it to the youth unemployment rate (YUR) (Bruno et al. 2014) because the juvenile condition had deteriorated considerably during the Great Recession (Bell and Blanchflower 2011). However, although the YUR is an aspect connected to the NEET definition (see Sect. 2.3), a contribution of our work is also the comparison of the analysis considering the rate of early school leavers, which is another side of the NEET phenomenon. This double comparison (with YUR and school dropout rates) can contribute to an understanding of the NEET phenomenon that has seriously affected many advanced economies since the 1980s, causing what can be defined as a new status for young people, in addition to being students or not and workers or not (Inui 2005), thereby representing a nontransitory but dramatically lasting condition for many subjects (Social Exclusion Unit 1999). These analyses can respond to the shortcomings in the literature in three ways. First, YUR is usually analyzed alongside the NEET rate, while we believe that the parallel analysis of school dropout issues can provide further information. Second, we know that there are difficulties in defining, grouping and identifying young people at risk (e.g., Yates and Payne 2006), and comparisons of the analysis with two well-known phenomena can suggest differences and similarities on which to base policy interventions. Third, we include among the possible causes of the NEET status some regressors that are more attentive to social aspects (e.g., young people who do not leave the family home) and to the actual conditions and opportunities for training/work (e.g., the diffusion of ICTs at the household level, which should contribute opportunities to train from home and the creation of new businesses), thus avoiding labeling young people inactive due to their unwillingness to study and work (Serracant 2014), especially in the more severe years of the Great Recession. The paper is arranged as follows. In Sect. 2, we present a consideration of the increasing relevant NEET phenomenon and its characteristics in Italy and other countries. In Sect. 3, we explain the econometric models used in the analysis. The variables used in the analysis and suggested by the economic literature are presented in Sect. 4. The results and tests follow. In the concluding section, we propose some policy implications.",9

It refers to the systematic search for genes, whole organisms and valuable natural compounds in wild or domesticated ecological niches that can be utilized by botanical, phytomedical, pharmaceutical, agricultural and enzymes industrial production. These sectors heavily rely on biological material as raw input for their market products (Rausser and Small 2000; Yamaura et al. 2017); as a matter of example, it is worth highlighting that the proportion of global sales value derived from biological resources in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and agricultural seeds industries were respectively equal, in 2010, to 6.1%, 35% and 100%Footnote 1. In particular, the agricultural seeds sector is continuously searching for genetic material embedded in local and traditional crops landraces in order to extrapolate genetic traits useful to produce modern varieties resistant to climatic extreme events, pests, diseases and, in general, capable to show superior yield potential (Cassman 1999; Shiferaw et al. 2014). Such landraces are the outcome of an evolutionary selection process driven by both local agroecological characteristics and farmers’ subsistence requirements (Altieri 1999). The heterogeneity of this selection makes local varieties incredibly adaptable to degraded and poor soils, water scarcity, droughts and biotic/abiotic stresses. This implies the urgency of motivating marginalized and cash constrained farmers, especially in developing countries, to maintain a diversified portfolio of traditional varieties as a strategic asset to face agricultural shocks and climate change (Bellon 2004; Mercer and Perales 2010). Exploiting the ecological services provided by the crop diversification, farmers would not only minimize agricultural risks (Di Falco and Perrings 2005; Di Falco and Chavas 2009; Bezabih and Sarr 2012), but would also directly act as “custodians” of local agricultural genetic stock (Panayotou 1994) and, indirectly, as unrewarded suppliers of the genetic inputs for the bioprospecting activity (Pascual and Perrings 2007). Such conservation behaviour would indeed benefit the bioprospecting firms, offering them a very rich stock of traits from which to select the most promising ones in terms of quality and expected returns (Weitzman 1998; Goeschl and Swanson 2002; Baumgärtner et al. 2008; Narloch et al. 2011). While it is true that conservation efforts have led to the collection of seeds in ex-situ gene banks, recently a growing interest mounted in on-farm conservation of local landraces in specific and valuable agroecological niches. These two strategies are different in terms of conservation objectives, because while the on-farm conservation aims to preserve processes that make local landraces resilient to changing agroclimatic conditions, thanks to the selection made by farmers, the ex-situ conservation through gene banks aims to conserve the outcome, at a given poin in time, of these processes (the genes). Thus, in the latter case the stock of genetic material is definite and cannot be replenished with new genotypes (Bellon and Van Etten 2014). This is why a bioprospecting firm (and the society in general) should be interested in understanding whether their output can impact on on-farm conservation. It is not a case that the diffusion of modern varieties has been recognized as one of the main causes of the narrowing cultivation of traditional varieties and, in turn, of local on-farm genetic erosion (Harlan and Wet 1972; Altieri 1999; Brush et al. 1992; Pascual and Perrings 2007). Though it has been argued that under proper conditions of full information about future risk, simplified agroecosystems could provide a higher genetic distance than diversified farmland (Brock and Xepapadeas 2003; Gollin and Evenson 2003), the genetic erosion is due to the fact that the new varieties refer to a reduced set of few major cash crop species and are genetically standardized and uniform (Artuso 2002; Perrings et al. 2006). Within this context, the second report on the State of the World’s Plant and Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture highlights that, since the beginning of the Green Revolution, the number of the worldwide consumed crop varieties has gradually decreased and, currently, only four crops satisfy 60% of the human food energy requirement (FAO 2010). This calls for more attention on the incentives for local farmers to devote land to traditional agriculture (Alam and Van Quyen 2018). While it is debated how infrastructural and informational barriers, as well as agroecological conditions, impact on modern varieties’ ability to boost the marginalized farmers’ livelihoodFootnote 2, it is true that subsidies to their adoption and agricultural modernization reduce the financial incentives to cultivate local landraces; this also happens because the option value related to the genetic diversity conservation and the adaptive selection process is not fully internalized by the markets (Narloch et al. 2011; Krishna et al. 2013). These market failures are linked, more generally, to the common pool resources features of local varieties grown in small rural communities or spread across regions (Polski 2005). As a result, farmers cannot fully appropriate of the diversity value they supply, so that less genetic resources are conserved, as compared to the socially optimal level (Weitzman 2000; Heal et al. 2004; Pallante et al. 2016). The free access to these resources is also a crucial driver of the so-called “biopiracy” by multinational bioprospecting firms (Koopman 2005; Bellon et al. 2015) that, conditional to patenting, can also operate as monopolists on the new varieties’ market (Qaim and Janvry 2003; Ramaswami et al. 2012). In summary, the bioprospecting industry invests in the development of the modern agricultural varieties by free-riding on the exploitation of the on-farm genetic diversity, but the increasing diffusion of new varieties on farmers’s cultivated land is an indirect channel that undermines the conservation and evolution of genetic resources, thereby depriving the industry (and society) of a potential stock from which to feed future varieties development or gene banks (Bellon 2004; Kijima et al. 2011). On the basis of these considerations, the advancements of bioprospecting regulation, and specifically the adoption of the Nagoya Protocol (Protocol from now on) by the Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010, is very welcome. The Protocol establishes a legal framework for the access to genetic resources and for an equitable sharing of all the commercial benefits arising from bioprospecting. In light of the Protocol, the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources should flow back to the owner and provider of those resources, so as to internalize the positive externalities provided. Benefit sharing may be monetary or non-monetary. Monetary benefits include up-front or milestone payments as well as royaltiesFootnote 3. As examples of national legislations applying monetary benefits sharing we can cite, among others, the well known Costa Rican Biodiversity Law that regulates the use of genetic resources growing in indigenous territories, requiring that an access fee and up to 10% of royalties are paid to the local owner. Another interesting case is the regulation in force in Panama, that covers also domesticated genetic resources whose origin is recognized to be in the national territory. In addition to an access contract, the user must guarantee the provider with a free prior informed consent and a benefit sharing agreement binding to the payment of no less than 1% of the net sales (Caprera et al. 2014). India published an official guideline for access and benefit sharing in 2014 (Kohli and Bhutani 2015) introducing a benefit sharing ranging from 0.1 to 5% of the annual gross ex-factory sale of the new developed product. Non-monetary benefits include sharing of results of R&D, institutional capacity building, joint ownership in Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) and technology transferFootnote 4. The latter is the most used type of non-monetary benefit sharing representing, for instance, 34% of all the projects funded under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGR). Moreover, 28% of this share consists of transfers of modern seeds to local communities, and 14% is related to improving knowledge and agronomic techniques for utilizing the new modern varieties (Galluzzi et al. 2014). Over the past decades, the economic analysis has focused on the actual value of commercial R&D based on genetic resources in the bioprospecting industryFootnote 5, while only more recently the attention of scholars has turned to the impact of benefit sharing rules on biodiversity conservation, R&D investments decisions and the optimal contracts between providers and usersFootnote 6. We add to the existing literature by developing a theoretical multi stage game where the effects of benefit sharing mechanisms on the agricultural genetic diversity conservation are analysed in a context where the bioprospecting output, i.e. the modern variety, also represents a feedback threat to conservation. Two economic and ecological trade-offs may arise. On one hand, the farmer provides genetic resources, a valuable input to the bioprospecting firm and, once the access to resources is granted, can decide to purchase and utilize the modern variety developed by the firm or to keep cultivating the local landraces. In the former case, however, genetic diversity conservation effort is reduced. The second trade-off arises according to the bioprospecting firm’s incentives. An increase in R&D investments, improving the quality of the new variety, increases profits. On the other hand, the improvement in quality decreases land allocated by the local farmer to traditional agriculture and, implicitly, reduces the conservation effort, with a potential negative impact on future bioprospecting. To the best of our knowledge, these trade offs have not been stressed in the existing theoretical literature. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence exists to support our research motivations and findings. Indeed, Swanson and Goeschl (2000) illustrated that, during the time span 1960–1990, with an increasing diffusion of improved species protected by plant-breeder rights, crop diversity has declined in developing countries. Also, a comprehensive study undertaken for the USDA has underlined that crop genetic diversity declined with reductions in total numbers of varieties and concentration of area planted in a few favored varieties (Rubenstein et al. 2005). The benefit sharing mechanisms defined in the Nagoya protocol are intended to avoid cases of biopiracy and replicate a plant breeder rights system, with the aim to replenish the exclusivity, transferability and enforceability of an efficient property rights regime. Nevertheless, in the case of conservation of genetic diversity, if the corrective policy intervention does not account for the private incentives of farmers when a more profitable variety is released on the market, the result in terms of conservation could be counterintuitive. Our analysis allows us to shed light on policy relevant questions related to the different available benefit sharing mechanisms in terms of their impact on on-farm local diversity when the output of the bioprospecting activity is in competition with agricultural genetic diversity itself, as well as on the bioprospecting firm’s decision on R&D investment, when the firm itself accounts for the economic-ecological trade-off related to conservation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we present the structure of the model while in Sect. 3 results are illustrated. Section 4 presents a comparison of the different policy scenarios and Sect. 5 discusses results and concludes.",1

Among economic sectors affected by CC, agriculture is the most susceptible as climate heavily has an impact on crop production trends, yields variability and the availability of areas suitable for cultivation. Many environmentally and economically vulnerable countries will cope with a rapid increase in warming at the surface. Among them, European countries have recorded a warming of about 1 °C since the last century. Rising temperature well above the global average has extended the length of spring and summer periods and has determined heat waves and dry spells, lengthening the growing season and increasing new cropping opportunities (Iglesias et al. 2009; Lionello et al. 2014). In northern Europe, the intensity of rainfalls has also increased with more frequent floods, while in southern Europe, rainfalls have decreased substantially, and drought periods are more frequent than in the past. CC effects thus represent a challenge that European agriculture has to face in the immediate future. The potentially negative impacts in terms of loss in crop agricultural yields in the southern regions of Europe are counterbalanced by the potentially positive impacts in the northern part of Europe (Olesen and Bindi 2002; Maracchi et al. 2005; Lavalle et al. 2009). Among the southern more vulnerable European countries, Italy represents a good case study to analyse for the impacts of climate variability on the agricultural sector. Italy’s vulnerability may be mainly due to its geographical location, as well as heterogeneity in climatic conditions with heat-waves dominance and with high variability and uneven distribution of rainfalls. Further, the northern and southern areas have been developed following unequal paths which increase the heterogeneity among regions (Olper et al. 2019). Moreover, even though all the countries in southern Europe will suffer for the negative impacts of CC, Italy will lose the most in terms of welfare losses because of the higher value of agricultural production (Van Passel et al. 2017; Bozzola et al. 2018; Chavas et al. 2019). In the period 2000–2009, Italy showed a lower mean annual rainfall of about 2.8 mm and a higher mean annual temperature of about 0.7 °C than the benchmark normal period 1970–2000. In this context, European policy support programs such as the EU Adaptation StrategyFootnote 1 should be finalized to induce the adaptation of measures which allow facing CC negative effects in the rural areas. The aim of this work is to analyse the economic impacts of climate variabilityFootnote 2 on the Italian agricultural sector at the regional scale. In particular, we have investigated the Italian regions’ efficiency in terms of crop yields during the period 2000–2009 when the negative effects of climate variability were increasing. Using the stochastic frontier approach (SFA) to estimate the production function and the inefficiency model of the Italian regions, we may separate the effects of production inputs such as labour and physical capital from the inefficiency meteorological factors—rainfall and minimum temperature—described as external causes of climate risks, among others, in agriculture. After having computed the technical efficiency scores, we may rank the twenty Italian regions. According to Farrell (1957)’s output-oriented technical efficiency definition, regions’ technical efficiency should be described as the distance of actual output from the maximum possible output (frontier). Such inefficiency may arise for different reasons, for instance, climate variability. Measuring how close a region’s production is to the region’s optimal production on the same bundle of inputs is at the base of computing technical efficiency scores (Kumbhakar and Lovell 2000; Kumbhakar et al. 2015). Adopting this output-oriented view, an economy is technically efficient when it reaches the maximum level of output given inputs and technology. To analyse the impact of CC on agriculture, the agronomic (or crop) model and the Ricardian model are the most widely used. While the Ricardian model estimates the long-run relationship between agricultural land values and climate (Mendelsohn et al. 1994), the agronomic model is based on crop production and on biophysical features that determine plant growth and yields (Di Falco et al. 2012). The Ricardian model has the advantage of incorporating the long-term productivity of land on asset value and taking into account the adaptive behaviour of farmers. However, since unmeasured characteristics may influence land value, this approach may be biased by the omitted variables issue as well as the possibility of mixing climate with other factors. The agronomic model, instead, has the advantage of assessing the impacts of CC on agricultural yields and productivity, by distinguishing them from the determinants of agricultural output. Even though it has the disadvantage of not considering all the adaptive responses of farmers to CC (Deschênes and Greenstone 2007; Di Falco et al. 2012). Since the agronomic model has the advantage of studying a technological relationship, which is the object of this analysis, without assuming profit maximization, cost minimization, or another economic behaviour for all the farmers, we may model a production behaviour. The underlying assumption that all the production activities of farmers are on the frontier of the feasible production set is relaxed and farmers may produce within the feasible production set. This means that they may be below the maximum frontier due to their choices. How far they are from the frontier is measured by technical inefficiency values. In the SFA approach, this frontier is assumed to be stochastic in order to capture exogenous shocks beyond the control of farmers. Following the agronomic literature, we focus on the technical efficiency of Italian regions in the agricultural sector, which, to the best of our knowledge, none has already analysed. Many studies predicting large damages have investigated the economic effects of CC on agricultural sector in different areas of the world such as USA (Adams 1989; Kaiser et al. 1993; Adams et al. 1995; Easterling et al. 1993; Brown and Rosenberg 1999; Schlenker et al. 2005; Elbakidze 2006; Deschênes and Greenstone 2007), Asia (Chang 2002; Xiong et al. 2010; Tasnim et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2017; Khanal et al. 2018), Africa and Latin American (Jones and Thorton 2003; Walker and Schulze 2008; Di Falco et al. 2012; Gao and Mills 2018) and only a few studies have analysed the European agriculture (Batts et al. 1997; Cuculeanu et al. 1999; Ghaffari et al. 2002; Christensen and Christensen 2002; Olesen and Bindi 2002; Sweeney et al. 2003; Lang 2007; Quiroga and Iglesias 2009; Ciscar et al. 2011; Shrestha et al. 2013) or the Mediterranean area (Giupponi and Shechter 2003). As regards Italy, two are the analyses that address the relationship between climatic conditions and agricultural variables, but none is based on the SFA. In the context of the Ricardian model, with data coming from the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN/RICA), Bozzola et al. (2018) apply an OLS model and find that farm net revenues are very sensitive to seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation while the annual temperature does not have any effects and the annual precipitation is significant only at the regional level. Using data on crop yields from seven Italian provinces of the Italian National Institute of Agricultural Economics (INEA) and applying a quantile autoregression model, Chavas et al. (2019) find that weather effects are asymmetric meaning that adverse weather conditions have significant and persistent effects on agricultural productivity. Our analysis may be considered as a contribution to fill the gap regarding the relationship between climate variability, efficiency and crop yields in Italy. The intention of our analysis is twofold. First, this study addresses the lack of a technical efficiency analysis for the impact of climate variability on the agricultural sector. Using the SFA, a maximum production frontier and an inefficiency model could be estimated in a one-step procedure. Second, the dataset collected at the regional level for the period spanning from 2000 to 2009 is based on published and unpublished official statistics produced by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), which has the advantage of guaranteeing high-quality standards.Footnote 3 To examine the effects of climate variability on the efficiency of the agricultural harvested crop, we consider two annual meteorological factors—the deviation of rainfall and minimum temperature from the climate normal period 1971–2000 mean value—and four seasonal rainfall and minimum temperature moving average values. According to our results, annual and seasonal rainfall variables are the relevant climate variability conditions affecting efficiency and hence crop yields, while only seasonal minimum temperature variables have an effect on regional efficiency and crop yields. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we briefly analyse the climate variability effects and threats for the Italian agricultural sector. In Sect. 3, we focus on data sources for climate variability and regional agricultural measures. In Sect. 4, we present our empirical model and in the following section (Sect. 5), our main results are discussed. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6.",7

To what extent will they share Research and Development (R&D) knowledge? How much link formation is welfare improving in presence of absorptive capacity and quality spillovers? In this paper we address these questions by using a theoretical model to shed light on the relationship between strategic R&D investment and networks of collaborations aimed at sharing R&D knowledge. More specifically, we consider a two-stage model with \(N\ge 2\) firms symmetrically distributed on the Salop-type circle (1979), a popular alternative of Hotelling’s linear city model. In the first stage, a network of alliances among firms is posited. In the second stage, firms choose prices, product quality and process innovation aimed at reducing production costs. In this context we also assume absorptive capacity which is the firm’s ability to recognize and assimilate knowledge from competing firms by means of R&D investment. Since absorptive capacity depends greatly on firm-related technological knowledge, investments in R&D are therefore central to the firm strategy. The demand side corresponds to the one in the traditional Hotelling set-up, but the circular city model allows us to focus the analysis on the symmetric equilibrium in which all firms charge the same price, product and process R&D efforts. In this way, the model is able to capture knowledge spillovers driving the voluntary exchange of information among vertically and horizontally differentiated firms being the result of direct interactions (links) with each other for specific business objectives. However, even with symmetry, each firm’s strategic behaviour varies depending on whether the collaborating firm is a neighbour or not. This interesting implication stems from the fact that the demand for a generic firm i directly depends on its neighbour strategies. We also assume that cooperation between firms aimed at both lowering their own marginal costs of production (process innovation) and sharing product quality investments (product innovation) (see Lambertini and Mantovani 2009). This paper contributes to the growing strand of literature dealing with R&D agreements among vertically and horizontally differentiated firms. The growing interest for these issues basically reflects the policy relevance of these questions, namely how networks of collaborations among firms are capable of turning R&D investments into productivity and welfare improvements. Indeed, in recent years a rapidly growing strand of theoretical and empirical literature has been focusing on R&D agreements among vertically and horizontally differentiated firm.Footnote 1 However, the empirical literature related to the theoretical underpinnings developed in the paper suffers from the lack of a shared and official source of information, namely the available information is scanty and mostly made up of case studies. So we might rely on case studies or databases that only partially cover our research topic. Broadly speaking, the available evidence, though fragmentary, supports most of our theoretical conclusions. Our key findings are as follows. First, quality effort (product innovation) decreases with the number of connections whereas increases in presence of process innovation. As a result, cooperating firms set a lower product quality to limit partner advantages at their expenses. Nonetheless, absorptive capacity induces firms to increase their own effort in process innovation as the number of cooperative links increases. This effect, however, is mitigated by a lower spillover rate, meaning that higher spillovers will generate a higher incentive for collaboration and for undertaking R&D investments. Nonetheless it is worth noticing that with product innovation the opposite is true, that is higher spillovers generate a lower incentive to collaborate. Jaffe (1986) finds that the incentive to cooperate is greater in sectors where spillover is larger. Large-spillover industries, typically, are telecommunications, chemicals and electronics. Vonortas (1994) finds significantly more joint ventures in large- and medium-spillover industries reporting that telecommunications and computer software ranked first both in number of research joint ventures and in membership. More recently, Lopez (2008), using Spanish data on manufacturing firms, has found that larger spillover and more effective strategic methods of appropriating the returns from innovation make R&D cooperation more probable. To be sure, these empirical works show some general tendencies, but the variety of results nevertheless confirm that to evaluate R&D cooperation it is important to include the effects of spillovers and possibile free-riding issues that may come from it. Indeed, the variety of spillovers that a cooperation may give rise to, renders a case-by-case approach desiderable. As an example, in cooperating for developing a new computer, the partners may easily assess the contribution of each member according to the particular component to develop, so that free-riding problems may be limited. On the contrary, in a network to develop a new vaccine it is harder to assess each member know-how and contribution, so that free-riding issues are more probable. Second, quality-improving networks are denser relative to those driven by process innovation. In this case, firms could increase their product quality simply forming agreements, without bearing the inherent costs. Hence, firms will reduce their effort and increase cooperation agreements, giving rise to denser networks. Among others, Tomasello et al. (2016) study the evolution of R&D networks and the process of alliances formation in several manufacturing sectors over 24-year period (1986–2009). They show that the dynamics of R&D networks has been characterised by two distinctive phases: a rise phase (from 1986 to 1997) where alliances gave rise to dense network structures and a fall phase (from 1998 to 2009) where networks become more sparse and fragmented. However, in both phases, network size is higher in high-tech industries, such as Pharmaceuticals, Computer software and electronic components, which are characterised by the constant need to generate new products. Differently, medium-tech and low-tech industries like Aircrafts and parts and Motor vehicles are mostly involved in process innovation and exhibit a lower level of R&D agreements. Figure 1 shows the evolution of network size (number of edges) for five industrial sectors characterised by different technological content. Source: Tomasello et al. 2016 Network size for sectoral R&D networks Third, link formation is welfare improving if both absorptive capacity and quality spillovers are sufficiently small. Put it different, an increasing number of connections lowers product quality but this effect is lessened by small spillovers which induce firms to increase quality and then consumer surplus. The model allows us to draw some rather strong conclusions relative to welfare which support the view that all the types of R&D collaboration can be welfare-improving for appropriate choices of degree of spillover and product differentiation. Fourth, we find a general tendency to under-connection relative to social welfare when link formation is driven by process innovation; on the contrary, we observe that networks of alliances tend to be over-connected as compared to the social optimum if quality-improving alliances prevail. This result is a consequence of how innovation induces firms to balance benefits and risks associated to networking. On the one hand, process innovation makes firms able to learn from partners becoming more competitive. As a consequence, firms are induced to reduce both connections and their own effort with the aim to limit competition and increase profits. On the other hand, in presence of product innovation networks there is a high risk of free riding, namely firms can increase their own product quality without investing in quality. Therefore, firms will tend to limit their quality effort and to increase the number of cooperative links, giving rise to over-connected networks. Given these results, every policy aimed at stimulating quality-improving and cost-reducing strategic alliances should be able to address the possible trade-off arising from the presence of product and process innovation. In this context, policy-makers should carefully strike a balance between two opposing forces: on the one hand, policies leading to enhance process innovation networks may be self-defeating, namely they could create incentives to reduce connections as a result of firm ability to learn from others; on the other hand, policies promoting investments in product quality should also prevent opportunistic (free-riding) behaviours. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the related literature. In Sect. 3 we introduce the model. In Sects. 4 and 5 we present and discuss the main results. In Sect. 6 we consider some variants of the model. Section 7 concludes.",2

In every country, regardless of the level of development, they represent over 95% of the entire universe of private firms and account for a significant proportion of total employment and job creation (WTO 2016; Criscuolo et al. 2014; de Kok et al. 2013). Given their small size, however, SMEs are more vulnerable to barriers that may prevent their growth prospects, mainly on international markets where SMEs face several liabilities due to smallness and inexperience, as compared to their larger counterparts. In particular, they face stronger financial constraints to invest in activities related to internationalization, are more affected by the uncertainty surrounding foreign markets and have weaker competences to carry out international activities successfully (Wright et al. 2007; Esteve-Perez and Rodriguez 2013; Paul et al. 2017). Despite that, it has been demonstrated that although small firms are less likely to become and survive as exporters, if they do survive they grow faster than large firms since they have the capacity to enter and exit markets more rapidly than large firms (Wagner 2007, 2012; Verwaal and Donkers 2002). These considerations explain why facilitating the participation of SMEs in international trade has been and still is an important policy objective. Indeed, several governments at local, national and international level pursue active policies aimed at developing mechanisms that build and provide SMEs with the necessary resources to compete successfully in international markets (Esteve-Perez and Rodriguez 2013). These policies, often referred to as export promotion policies (EPPs), include a wide range of activities, like training on export procedures, the provision of information on market opportunities and counselling services, the organization of trade missions, international fairs, and meetings with potential customers (Lederman et al. 2010; OECD 2009). While Government intervention may be widely justified—as it will be explained in details below—it is important to ascertain whether these programs provide support effectively. This paper aims at disentangling this issue. In particular, we assess the potential impact of the EPPs implemented by the public authorities of Lombardy—one of the richest Region in Italy and one of the four motors of Europe—on the export performance of firms using those export promotion services. Then, we shed light on how EPPs work by exploring in details what dimensions of export performance respond better to these programs, which support services are more strongly related to export success, and, lastly, which firms benefit the most. Following the recent and growing literature on EPPs evaluation at firm level (Van Biesebroeck et al. 2015, 2016; Cadot et al. 2015; Volpe and Carballo 2008, 2010a, b, c, 2012; Volpe, Carballo and Garcia 2012; Broocks and Van Biesebroeck 2017; Munch and Schaur 2018; Cruz 2014),Footnote 1 we apply an ex-ante matching fixed-effect differences-in-differences estimator to identify the causal impact of EPPs on firms’ export performance. In this context, credible identification is a challenge, since one is forced to address self-selection of firms into EPPs. Compared to the existing literature, we have some advantages in dealing with this issue. First, we have detailed longitudinal administrative data on the EPPs implemented in Lombardy and on beneficiary firms during the period from 2010 to 2014. Program data include the enrolment status, as well as information on the type, the number and the value of the services received each year by every firm. The peculiar structure of this administrative archive allows us to identify assisted and not assisted firms. The latter constitute a proper control group because they likely follow the same unobserved self-selection process into the program as the supported firms. Secondly, since we observe variation in EPPs across firms and over time, we can implement a regression-based identification strategy with a rigorous set of fixed-effects, and thus properly correct for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. These two advantages combined together, ensure that the estimates can be interpreted as causal effects of EPPs on firms’ export performance. In addition, we have information on whether SMEs participated in other public programmes, not necessarily implemented at regional level and focused on export promotion, which may have a direct or an indirect impact on firms’ export performance.Footnote 2 Therefore, we can study whether receiving alternative public subsidies magnifies or dumps the effect of EPPs. We contribute to the existing literature in several ways. First, we strengthen the existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of EPPs in a developed and open economy like Italy, which is today still scant.Footnote 3 We find a positive and significant effect of EPPs, since assisted firms have higher export propensity and export intensity relative to their non-assisted counterparts. Second, we examine the varying effects of different kinds of EPPs and find that the estimated effects are larger for services classified as “promotional”, like participation in international trade fairs and exhibitions, than for “technical assistance and counselling” activities or “information and knowledge specific provision” services, like participation in economic mission abroad. Third, and more importantly, we explore the contingencies that mitigate or magnify the effects of EPPs and demonstrate that the joint use of all the above-mentioned services is more effective in promoting exports than individual ones, and that firms with export experience show the highest increase in export activities. Estimated effects are also larger for micro and small-sized firms rather than for medium-sized ones. Lastly, we estimate the effects of EPPs on two dimensions of export performance and find that while promotional support activities are able to increase both the export propensity and the export intensity of assisted firms, other EPPs only affect the export propensity, encouraging new firms to become exporters. These findings are relevant from an economic policy perspective too, since they represent a valuable input in improving the design of the existing policies and in driving the allocation of resources to different EPPs. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the related literature. Section 3 describes the research setting and the EPPs implemented in Lombardy. Section 4 presents the measuring framework and the identifying assumptions, as well as some descriptive statistics on assisted and control firms, and EPPs whose potential effects are discussed in light of the theoretical literature. Section 5 is devoted to estimation results, while Sect. 6 discusses the effectiveness of EPPs at aggregated level. Section 7 concludes and indicates potential caveats and future lines of research.",7

For purposes of this study, it is defined as the knowledge, skills, competencies, and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social, and economic well-being. Gender, family, education, and social class are usually found in the literature among background characteristics that can constrain human capital accumulation, thus likely to provoke poor labour market performances. Nevertheless, place of birth and type of work are two of the variables that deeply affect future labour market prospects. The influence of location on inequality of permanent employment outcomes replicates the discussion between the comparison of territorial factors and personal ones. This phenomenon is observed everywhere. Chetty et al. (2014) clearly show the sharp variation of intergenerational mobility across areas in the US. Neighbourhoods have substantial causal effects on children’s long-term outcomes, even conditional on parental income (Chetty et al. 2018). There are some characteristics of regional labour markets that make being either unemployed or a temporary worker more serious. Therefore, it is critical to estimate whether permanent employment chances and economic dynamism differ between regions. This study exploits a unique institutional setting in Italy to design a difference-in-discontinuity regression model. It contributes to this line of research by estimating the existence of disparities across regions in the effect on permanent employment rates of changes in the 2012 Fornero reform at the age cutoff of 30 years above which job entries as vocational apprentices are not possible. To perform this analysis, the study relies on a very rich administrative dataset, by the Italian Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, CICO (the so-called Comunicazioni Obbligatorie). Focusing on Italy is interesting because Legislative Decree no. 167/2011 introduced a common nationwide institutional setting that fixed the rules governing the vocational apprenticeship labour contract. Despite this common legislative setting, regional disparities persist and become greater following the introduction of law no. 92/2012. The law increased the commitment to training provisions and enforcement of the permanent contract nature of vocational apprenticeships. Vocational apprenticeships are classified as permanent labour contracts in Italy. The focus is on vocational apprenticeships as a labour contract committed to the provision of on-the-job training. The role of apprenticeships as part of the vocational education and training system, an alternative to a more academic education track, is omitted. This study uses exogenous variations generated by the Fornero labour market reform in permanent employment rates around the cutoff of 30 years of age that is related to the apprenticeship labour contract only. This is because law no. 92/2012 explicitly targeted apprenticeships as the main port-of-entry into permanent employment. An adequate mentoring scheme was introduced to strengthen the vocational training component of the job. This rule was augmented by penalties placed on firms that failed to maintain on a permanent basis at least 30% of those hired as apprentices three years prior. While the difference at the age threshold may appear as mechanical, there are no reasons to expect such a difference-in-discontinuity regarding impact on permanent employment. Since this variation around the cutoff of 30 years of age is randomised, it is independent of any covariate in the regression model, including the indicator of the location of work. Existence of disparities are then estimated across Italian regions of the permanent employment probability gains of cohorts treated by the labour market reform around the age cutoff. By estimating whether there are regional differences, this study illustrates how the regional labour markets evolve in response to a nation-wide reform. Moreover, it presents evidence on regional inequalities of permanent employment outcomes. In fact, geographic variations in the difference-in-discontinuity impact on permanent employment is exogenously assigned to the individuals on the basis of their region of birth. This is because at the baseline those who work in the same region where they were born benefit from the positive effect on permanent employment rates generated by the Fornero reform at the age cutoff. That is to say, individuals with similar observable (and hopefully unobservable) characteristics, born in a Southern Italian region, would counterfactually have had a higher permanent employment probability if they would have been born, grown up, and worked in a Northern Italian region. Regional disparities in different economic outcomes are widely studied in the literature (Taylor and Bradley 1997; Amendola et al. 2006; Signorini 2008; Carmignani and Giacomelli 2009; Checchi and Peragine 2010; Righi et al. 2019). Some of these outcomes are related to the functioning of labour markets. This study verifies whether regional permanent employment patterns are related to differences in the use of vocational apprenticeship as the primary port-of-entry into permanent employment. This analysis differs from the few existing studies using data at regional level, e.g. (Brunello and De Paola 2008; Muehlemann and Wolter 2008; Bellmann et al. 2010), in three crucial aspects. First, exploiting a randomised variation, this study overcomes a major problem when analysing regional differences in labour market outcomes: the region of work is not exogenous. Employers can decide where to locate their economic activity. Employees can migrate if there are not adequate employment opportunities in the region where they were born. Second, the main outcome is the individual’s permanent employment probability and how it is related to the apprenticeship probability rather than the training decision of the firm. Third, there is no study that verifies whether there are regional disparities in the medium-run effect on permanent employment of the initial human capital investment. By looking at the dynamics, this study provides important evidence to support the main argument. The probability that a job match, created by a vocational apprenticeship contract, persists over time is higher than the same probability of other job matches created without the same commitment to the human capital investment. The existence of dynamic treatment effects reinforces further the credibility of the identification strategy because, although apprenticeships are open-ended contracts, the monetary costs to terminate the contract are lower than those incurred by the firm in case of a permanent contract that does not enforce human capital accumulation. Law no. 92/2012 did not directly intervene on this issue. Consequently, there is no reason to observe a mechanical difference-in-discontinuity impact in the medium-run. Difference in permanent employment rates generated by the Fornero reform at the age threshold differ across Italian regions in both the short- and medium-run. Moreover, medium-run gains are possible even in absence of any impact at the baseline. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the institutional setting. Section 3 illustrates the identification strategy while Sect. 4 describes the data. Results are reported in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

The same preferences under different electoral systems could result in different types of parliaments and therefore, different economic policies and economic outcomes. This paper develops an endogenous growth model where electoral systems play an important role in explaining economic outcomes. The economic model is a three-sector (i.e. three-class) dynastic model with limited altruism where the engine of endogenous growth is public investment (a la Barro 1990). Our political model makes the choice of public investment endogenous, which is something that previous literature on endogenous growth did not, to our knowledge. Two types of electoral systems are allowed: a first-past-the-post majoritarian electoral (M) system and a proportional representation (PR) system. Each of these systems will determine, through pre-electoral and parliamentary games, an equilibrium public policy. The equilibrium public policies (rules) will lead to different growth equilibria. To our knowledge this is the first theoretical attempt to understand how electoral systems affect economic growth. The paper establishes a link between the literature on the effects of different electoral systems on public policy (e.g. Funk and Gathmann 2013; Persson et al. 2007; Persson and Tabellini 2004) and the literature on public policy and growth (e.g. Barro 1990; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992). The main conclusion of this paper is that per se PR and M systems do not necessarily imply different economic growth. This result could explain why some previous works fail to find differences in growth performance across electoral systems (e.g. Persson 2005). Our model predicts the following ranking in terms of economic growth (from higher to lower): (i) PR in a society with a plurality of the rich class; (ii) M systems and PR in a society with plurality of the middle class; and finally (iii) PR in a society with plurality of the poor class. In what follows, Sect. 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 develops the model. Section 4 provides the main results. Section 5 considers an alternative default policy. Finally, in Sect. 6 conclusions are presented.",

37,3,Economia Politica,21 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-020-00191-8,An exploratory study of populism: the municipality-level predictors of electoral outcomes in Italy,October 2020,Eugenio Levi,Fabrizio Patriarca,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a group of rising stars on the world’s political stage who do not object to being called populist. Among them, the US President Donald Trump, the former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the President of the French National Rally Marine Le Pen, the Spanish vice Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. What they have in common is that they all use an anti-elite rhetoric and exploit the decline of traditional players in the political arena.Footnote 1 However, the more we move towards an empirical observation, the more populism appears as a multi-faceted phenomenon that is very hard to define. We can find both left-oriented and right-oriented populists, socially conservative and socially liberal, pro-taxes and against taxes, pro-environment and environmentally-neutral populists, and so on (see Kaltwasser et al. 2017, for a full account on different populist parties). Therefore, understanding the underlying factors of the so-called rise of populism in mature democracies is still an open issue and a difficult one. Many papers in political science and political economy have addressed the question by testing different theories on populism. These theories encompass a clash between ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ of globalization, resentment over inequalities, a ‘cultural backlash’, expressive or protest vote, decay in the quality of politicians. Our approach is different. Because the phenomenon is so multi-faceted, we think an exploratory analysis can shed some light into populism and its consequences on the political landscape. Therefore, our first step is to look at the localisation of electoral populist success. We go ‘from the particular to the general’ to test the predictive power of theories on populism: data-driven methods over a comprehensive set of local characteristics are used to find the municipality-level predictors of populism. Moreover, the decline of traditional parties is not often studied alongside the emergence of populist parties. However, these two phenomena are not just two sides of the same coin. What is needed is to understand whether populist parties are simply capturing an electorate on the run from corresponding ‘establishment’ parties on the traditional political spectrum – a sort of ‘revolving doors’ effect -, or whether there is more a sort of ‘re-grouping’ effect, that is, whether populist parties are building up an electorate of their own that does not overlap with the corresponding left/right traditional parties’ electorate and changing in this way the political landscape altogether. As a second step, we use the best subset of predictors to predict what would be the electoral outcome of Italian parties in France, Spain and the United Kingdom and then confront with the real electoral outcomes of these countries. This is relevant to understand if our predictors capture some underlying features of populism and if our discussion on populism is valid outside of Italy too. Our case study is the 2018 general election in Italy that was held on the 4th of March of that year. In these elections, not only the populist parties boosted their votes, going from 25.55 to 32% for Five-Stars Movement (M5S) and from 4.08 to 17% for Lega, but they were then able to form a coalition government together. Italy is a key member of the European Union—one of the biggest economies and a founding member. It is also the main country whose future is at stake in the European political debate, and is indeed considered historically as a forerunner of European political turmoil, as it was for the rise of Fascism in the 1920s. In Italy there are two distinct and more relevant parties which can be classified as populist, the Five-Stars Movement (left-oriented) and Lega (right-oriented), and two main ‘establishment’ parties, the Democratic Party (left-oriented) and Forza Italia (right-oriented). This permits us to compare the drivers of populism along two axes: heterogeneity in populisms and populism vs. establishment. We use a dataset of 36 predictors at municipality level over a total of 7908 observations. Municipalities range from very small towns, with only a few hundred inhabitants, to very large cities, like Rome, Milan and Naples that have a population that ranges between 1 and 3 million. These predictors cover a wide range of socio-economic characteristics and can be grouped in 4 categories: socio-demographic measures that capture the social environment; variables capturing the presence of immigrants of different ethnicities;Footnote 2 measures capturing the economic structure of the municipality; and variables describing quality of life and welfare based on measures on population density and public services. The methodology follows a recent paper by Becker et al. (2017) on Brexit. We use a machine-learning method based on BIC to select which predictors best explain the share of votes for populist and traditional parties in each category of characteristics, then we run a final round over these selected variables to identify the best overall models. In this way, we identify the key features for the electoral base of each of the four main Italian parties in 2018 and their dynamics relative to the previous election. It is to note that the beta coefficients of our final regressions cannot be interpreted in relation to internal validity, but they are useful for prediction as they have better out-of-sample model fit than usual OLS models. We exploit this to predict the electoral base of all the 4 parties in France, Spain and the UK at province level and use correlations to analyse the models’ potential to explain the results of the 2017 French Presidential election, the 2019 Spanish Parliamentary elections and the 2014 UK European elections. We also carry a supplementary analysis for Italy at the regional level, as municipality characteristics highly overlap with regional ones. From our results, the populists’ electoral bases have different dimensions from the ones traditionally marking the divide between left- and right- wing. Such new dimensions are not common to M5S and Lega, and neither a new divide nor similarities emerge, providing evidence for a ‘re-grouping’ effect. Besides, two different and clear patterns emerge. Lega is mainly characterized along economic dimensions, including those concerning inequalities and globalization, having an advantage in industrial and commercial areas, in poorer municipalities and with an electorate of lower education level. The distribution of M5S’s electoral base reflects much more the effect of a generational conflict (over 65 vs. the rest), with many features indicating a detachment from the institutional setting—lower quality of public services, higher rates of crime and unemployment. Along these unique and parallel dimensions, they both increase their support, while the traditional divide vanishes since the crisis of the two traditional parties Democratic Party and Forza Italia concerns exactly the core of their electoral base. All variables related to immigration, surprisingly, are not relevant enough to make it to the last model for any of the parties we have considered. The results on France, Spain and the UK strongly confirm that our model is able to catch some underlying common features of the ongoing reshaping of the political arena in Western Europe. Overall, our paper suggests further interpretations of populism and new directions for research. We want to stress that we do not provide a causal interpretation to our results and that we do not directly investigate political attitudes of the voters. With our analysis, we cannot provide definitive evidence in support of any theory on populism. In particular, we deal with the demand side of populism only, as we do not provide any specific argument as to why populists insist on specific narrative cleavages or on the political economy of their policy choices. Even taking these limitations into account, our paper still derives interesting propositions to be tested in future research. This paper fits into an emerging literature on populism in political economy. In particular, Rodrik (2018) provides an interesting theoretical framework and a valid literature review over the rise of populism. He claims that globalization explains most of the votes for populist parties while salient political cleavages—income or culture—determine the political orientation of the chosen populist party—left-oriented or right-oriented, respectively. There are some empirical papers that support this theory. Between them, Autor et al. (2016) stress that penetration of imports from China is a decisive factor to explain the increasing polarization in US politics between Democrats and Republicans. The outcome of the Brexit referendum and votes for populist far-right parties across Europe were explained across the same lines by Colantone and Stanig (2018a, b, 2019), by Becker et al. (2017) and by Alabrese et al. (2019). A few papers explore more in general the correlation between economic insecurity and populist votes independently of the political left/right orientation of the parties. Using 2002–2014 European Social Survey data, Guiso et al. (2017) find that an index based on the principal component of recent unemployment, income distress, and having low-skills while working in the low-tech manufacturing industry underlies populism across Europe. Algan et al. (2017) find the same evidence in connection with the variations in unemployment, which in their data seems to go in tandem with trust (or lack thereof) towards national and European institutions. Bloise et al. (2019) also point to economic factors and inequalities while looking at support for both populist parties in Italy at regional level. Lastly, another source of economic insecurity is the recent rise in automation in production processes and there is evidence that it affects support for nationalistic populist parties (Anelli et al. 2019). Some economists and political scientists claim that culture matters more than economic outcomes in explaining the rise of populism. A recent paper by Algan et al. (2018) finds that economic characteristics do not explain well neither the left/right divide nor the heterogeneity in populisms in the context of the 2017 French presidential elections. Subjective opinions like life satisfaction and trust seem to matter more, however lack of trust underlies support for right-wing populism only. Norris and Inglehart (2019) put forward a ‘cultural backlash’ theory, according to which populism is a separate dimension than left or right and votes for populist parties come from old and white people reacting to the affirmation of progressive cultural values within society. Gougou and Persico (2017) provide evidence in this direction by showing that a cultural dimension must be added to the economic one to explain French politics. In the political sciences other interesting explanations are put forward. For example, Cramer’s (2016) field study showed how in rural Wisconsin support for Donald Trump was generated by resentment over policies that favoured ethnic minorities in big cities. In this sense, resentment derives from a feeling of detachment from traditional political messages: people in low population density areas just feel abandoned. This is consistent with a theoretical model and some evidence from the US provided by Di Tella and Rotemberg (2018) that shows how people living in rural areas and low educated people in urban areas may choose an incompetent leader over a competent one because of betrayal aversion. Using survey data, several other papers in political science find that a cultural reaction to progressive values, economic resentment and political disenchantment all seem to matter in explaining the emergence of populism across different countries regardless of the political orientation of the party (Mudde 2007, Akkermann et al. 2014, Spruyt et al. 2016, Inglehart and Norris 2016, Burgoon et al. 2019, Margalit 2019) and more specifically on far-right populism (Arzheimer and Carter 2006; Oesch 2008; Arzheimer 2009, 2016). The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents the methodology, Sect. 2 gives a detailed overview of the data, specifying what it represents in political terms, Sect. 3 gives the results, Sect. 4 has our analysis on the other European countries, and Sect. 5 discusses and concludes.",3

In fact, in December 2016 Italy had the highest number of recognized certifications (DOP,Footnote 1 IGP,Footnote 2 and STGFootnote 3) in the UE-28, with 291 top-quality gastronomic specialties and 83,695 certified economic operators (ISTAT 2018a, p. 2). In 2017, the whole agricultural sector generated an added value of about 31.54 billion euros, with a relative weight of 17.11% on the Eu-28 agricultural value added, which places Italy at the top of the European ranking (ISTAT 2018b, p. 13). Nonetheless, since the 1970s, the agri-food sector has suffered from serious structural problems that have limited its potential and a healthy development. These concern the progressive loss of agricultural groundFootnote 4 (Bernetti et al. 2013; Boncinelli et al. 2014) and the rise of the environmental organized crime (Coldiretti-Eurispes 2015, 2017; CIA (Italian National Confederation of Farmers) 2014; Legambiente 1999–2017). The latter issue represents the nucleus of the analysis we propose. The theme of economic costs produced by the Mafia has been widely developed in the literature,Footnote 5 but it is not possible to affirm the same for the “Agromafia” business, on which attention has begun to focus only over the last few years and in a piecemeal manner (Canali 2012; Cusatelli and Giacalone 2015). In fact, these authors have just carried out a qualitative analysis of some issues related to Agromafia, such as counterfeitingFootnote 6 and main environmental crimes,Footnote 7 without thoroughly addressing their economic implications and costs.Footnote 8 So, most of the information currently available is due to the annual documents published by public associations for the environmental defense and free market competition, such as CIA (Italian National Confederation of Farmers), Coldiretti-Eurispes, Legambiente and Sos-Impresa. Based on these specific documents, we can define Agromafia as all the economic transactions concerning financial assets, services, and activities linked to the agri-food sector and characterized by Mafia-like methods. In 2016, about 33,045 administrative offenses and more than 7,000 criminal offenses have occurred within the agri-food sector. Furthermore, the Agromafia’s added value would have amounted to 21.8 billion eurosFootnote 9 and about 25% of the overall investments in Italian agriculture sector were carried out by organized crime (Coldiretti-Eurispes 2017). In the same period, the judiciary authorities decreed the appropriation of 1,038 facilities, 83.64 million kg of foods, and 44,440 packages. And the damage to the sector is very consistent considering that about 350,000 farmers (33% of the total) are victimized every year by organized crime activities (CIA (Italian National Confederation of Farmers) 2014). Specifically, the eco-criminal activities span a number of categories: (1) usury and extortionsFootnote 10; (2) exploitation of manual laborFootnote 11; (3) imposition of raw materials and packagingFootnote 12; (4) transport management throughout the agri-food supply chainFootnote 13; (5) damage to cropsFootnote 14; (6) livestock rustling and clandestine slaughterFootnote 15; (7) theft of materials and equipmentFootnote 16; (8) counterfeiting and contraband of foods; (9) frauds against the European Union for contributions unlawfully received by Mafia’s firmsFootnote 17; and (10 crimes against forests and green areas, such as arson and illegal dumping of toxic wastes (Canali 2012; Coldiretti-Eurispes 2017; DIA 2016; Legambiente 2017a). These illegal activities usually affect the whole agri-food supply chain, from production to retail, and concern all the main Italian MafiasFootnote 18 (Coldiretti-Eurispes 2015, p. 53; DNA 2017, p. 805, 865). In particular, Mafias tend to create monopoly situations, distorting “usual” competition and pushing honest business out of the market (Coldiretti-Eurispes 2017; Legambiente 2017a). This is a key point because of the crucial nature and weight of the agri-food sector in Italian economy and, in particular, in southern regions (Thomas 2002; Carbone and Henke 2012), which are traditionally more affected by organized crime (Calderoni 2011; Pinotti 2015). In fact, Mafias tend to create monopolies, by distorting “usual” competition and pushing honest firms out of the market (Coldiretti-Eurispes 2017; Legambiente 2017a). Thus, the main research question of the paper is analyzing the economic impact of the organized crime in the agri-food sector. We’ll test the statistical significance of the link between the Agromafia’s main crimes and food and non-alcoholic drinks consumer price index (CPI) in Italy. Specifically, we’ll use a cross-sectional OLS approach for 20 Italian regions and 80 Italian provinces, in the 1998–2016 period. At regional level, as a proxy for Agromafia’s activities we’ll build an ad hoc eco-criminal pressure index, by using aggregated annually data provided from Legambiente; while, at province level we’ll adopt a dual strategy. First of all, we’ll implement the following eight proxies for Agromafia’s activities: extortions, counterfeiting of brands and industrial goods, forest fires, contraband, all types of fire, money laundering, suspicious money transfers, and a synthetic money laundering index obtained by the standardization of the previous two variables; secondly, we’ll build a synthetic eco-criminal pressure index for each province by just using the first four types of crime, that we consider the most relevant. The analysis will show that Mafia’s environmental crimes can seriously affect the CPI both at regional and province level, mainly against southern area. In particular, the ten top-ranked provinces for eco-crimes—that belong almost exclusively to the southern regions—have an average food CPI about 12% higher than that of the ten bottom-ranked provinces, that belong entirely to the northern regions. By contrast, in the center-north of Italy money laundering offences seems to reduce food consumer prices through the reinvestment of illicit proceeds in firms with strong cost advantages. We are cognizant of the potential problems with such a limited sample and with these types of crime, which are usually subject to under-reporting and under-recording bias; however, this specific kind of analysis represents the first real attempt in the literature. Furthermore, it provides two original eco-criminal index both at regional and province level, that allow to map Agromafia’s infiltration. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: (1) in Sect. 2 we propose a detailed description of the main Agromafia’s crimes and their possible link with food and non-alcoholic drinks CPI dynamics in Italian regions; (2) in Sect. 3 we try to take a closer look to the main literature that paper relates; (3) in Sect. 4 we describe data and empirical methodology; (4) in Sect. 5 we build an eco-criminal pressure index for each province; (5) in Sect. 6 we present the main empirical findings; and (6) finally, in Sect. 7 we summarize the results and discuss about the policy implications.",

Reciprocity between children and their elderly parents in Europe,October 2020,Fernanda Mazzotta,Lavinia Parisi,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Studies on intergenerational resource transfers between elderly parents and their adult children have concentrated their attention on three currencies of transfers: space (co-residence), money (gifts, financial support) and time (time-help, caregiving). This paper focuses on the latter two (i.e., money and timeFootnote 1); in particular, it documents the determinants of adult children’s financial and time transfers to their elderly parents by simultaneously considering the effect of transfers of money and time from parents to their children (i.e., the same unobserved characteristics may affect the probabilities of giving and receiving transfers of both money and time). We emphasize the effect of reciprocity in shaping giving behaviour. A number of hypotheses have been advanced concerning the motivation for transfers within families, and consequently, different theoretical models have been analysed (Lillard and Willis 1997; Silverstein et al. 2002; Raut and Tran 2005). In particular, two types of models can be underlined: the first is based on the fact that transfers can occur as a kind of savings in old age or borrowing during youth or as a form of exchange (Lillard and Willis 1997). In this case, the two-way transfers reflect two different aspects that conceptualize support from children: a return on an investment made earlier by the parents and an insurance policy in which earlier transfers to children are returned to needy parents (Silverstein et al. 2002). The second type of model, is based on the fact that transfers are motivated by two-sided altruism, and parents and children are altruistic and benevolent towards each other. It is difficult to empirically distinguish between transfers that reflect efficient contracting or exchange among family members and transfers that arise because of altruism. In particular, our data provide little information on children and do not register the amount of money and time transferred after 2006. For this reason, we consider any exchange or two-side transfer as reciprocity, without exploring the underlying motives. Here, reciprocity is considered a behavioural trait rather than a feature of preferences. That is, this paper investigates whether individuals show reciprocal responses rather than whether they have reciprocity motives. We are aware that analysing reciprocity motives should be important in terms of the effectiveness of redistributive public policies; in fact, economic models of reciprocity and altruistic behaviour highlight some important policy considerations. They have shown that public programmes that command intergenerational transfers, such as social security and debt-financed fiscal policy, have different levels of effectiveness when intergenerational relationships operate under principles of altruistic reciprocity: altruistic children will make up the difference with private voluntary contributions to their parents, keeping the total transfer constant (Barro 1974; Becker 1974). The empirical literature has found evidence of both altruism (Raut and Tran 2005) and exchange motives (Cox 1987).Footnote 2 The dynamic of care is receiving more attention from activists, researchers and policy actors now than it received 20 or even 10 years ago.Footnote 3 One of the reasons is that health care (HC) and long-term care (LTC) spending is a first-order policy issue for most governments in OECD countries given that such spending is putting pressure on public budgets. The ratio of HC and LTC expenditure to GDP has been steadily rising for several decades. This gradual increase has been due to several factors. First, the share of older people in the population is growing faster than that of any other age group as a result of both longer life spans and a lower birth rate, increasing both the demand for care and the elderly dependency ratioFootnote 4 in most industrialized countries (Bettio and Verashchagina 2012). Additionally, a higher share of elderly citizens translates into worse health conditions (Schwarzkopf et al. 2012), reducing the provision of informal care supplied within the family and once again increasing the demand for care. Second, as HC spending improves the probability of survival at old age, it can also boost LTC spending (Bettio and Verashchagina 2012; de la Maisonneuve and Martin 2013). Although the need for both formal and informal care is likely to increase due to the ageing population (Gray 2005), fiscal austerity, imposed after the financial crisis, has resulted in a contraction of the public budget at central and local levels (Fernández et al. 2016), causing a reduction in LTC provision. In this context, provisions of informal care may be very important due to its effect on LTC and HC as a whole: informal care may be viewed as a substitute for public and formal care, thus reducing the probability that elderly parents will enter a nursing home (Charles and Sevak 2005) and decreasing the fiscal cost of public LTC expenditure programmes.Footnote 5 On the other hand, the provision of care by adult children may also have a negative impact on adult labour market participation and career prospects, especially for women (Bolin et al. 2008; Mazzotta et al. 2019a, b). The supply of informal care is likely to decrease for two reasons: first, women, who are over-represented as primary caregivers, are more active in the labour market (Pickard et al. 2000); second, the increase in distance between residential family members (Spiess and Schneider 2002). All these economic, social and structural changes call the current institutions into question and make clear that governments are facing an immense task in ensuring that in the future, elderly individuals will be cared for. The growing proportion of the elderly population may also increase the demand for monetary resources that the younger generation must shoulder, calling on researchers to focus their attention on financial transfers from middle-aged adult children to their elderly parents. Typically, private financial transfers flow from old persons to young ones (for instance, from parents to children). Several studies have argued that this type of support from the family is important in determining capital accumulation for younger generations (Gale and Scholz 1994; Ermisch 2003; Altonji et al. 2012) as a form of insurance against income shocks (Altonji et al. 1997) and that it also facilitates the creation of cohesion and solidarity among family members (Chen et al. 2016). However, it has become increasingly common for adult children to provide financial transfers to their elderly parents for the acquisition of market services instead of providing them directly; in particular, if they have high opportunity costs, adult children prefer to substitute time transfers with financial transfers (Sarasa and Billingsley 2008). When analysing resource transfers it is important to understand whether the child/parent relationship may be modelled as a behavioural response to perceived kindness, also defined as reciprocity. Reciprocity governs intergenerational exchange such that the more parents gave in the past and/or give in the present, the more support they receive from their children (Sarasa and Billingsley 2008). Analysing reciprocity is by no means an easy task since decisions on the intergenerational transfer of money and time are likely to be jointly determined. If financial support is given as a consequence of the amount of informal care received or that will be received, then potential caregivers may base their decision to look after their parents on their expectations of a future reward or financial transfer received in the past. Furthermore, the choices of both parents and children may be influenced by unobserved characteristics, such as generosity. Several studies have analysed reciprocity among family members (Cox 1987; Koh 2002; Sarasa and Billingsley 2008; Brugiavini et al. 2013; Jiménez-Martín and Vilaplana Prieto 2015); however, there are several gaps that we aim to fill. None of these studies simultaneously considered the intergenerational transfers of money and time from children to parents, which can be closely related: unobserved characteristics, such as generosity or kindness, may affect the probabilities of giving both resource transfers. Thus, first, using a multivariate probit model, we simultaneously estimate the probability that children will give informal care to their parents and the probability that children will give financial transfers to them. This simultaneous estimation may also allow us to examine the interdependence between transfers, i.e., whether they are complements or substitutes. Second, using recent and long panel data (i.e., from 2004 to 2015), in contrast to Leopold and Raab (2011), we consider not only concurrent reciprocity (i.e., transfers made in the same year) but also intertemporal or long-term reciprocity (i.e., child-to-parent transfers in 2015 in relation to parent-to-child transfers made 2, 4, 9 or 11 years prior). Considering intertemporal transfers is a crucial enhancement with respect to other studies, especially when considering time-help; parents who receive informal care in the present may be unable to reciprocate in the present but could have given to their children (in terms of babysitting) in the past. The analysis of this paper is based on data drawn from five waves (2004, 2006, 2011, 2013 and 2015) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (henceforth SHARE) and covers 10 EU member states (Austria, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Belgium). The evidence for reciprocity is different depending on whether transfers of time or money are examined. In particular, we do not find evidence of reciprocity for time transfers (informal care provided to parents), except in the case of sons, for which, a positive link between informal care given to parents and current financial transfers received from parents emerges. In contrast, we find a positive effect of parent-to-child transfers (both time and money) on the probability of child-to-parent financial transfers. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 1 presents our literature review on resource transfers and it is followed by a discussion of the sample and data analysed in Sect. 2. Section 3 establishes the econometric strategy. Section 4 discusses the findings, and finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",2

From 1960 to 2017 the share of population over 65 years old is more than tripled in Japan (from 6 to 27%) while many other western countries have registered significant boosts: Italy + 14%, the US + 6%, the UK + 7% (World Bank 2017). This change in the population composition is mainly due to the increase in the life expectancy and the reduction of fertility rates. In the last years, the growth of the old population, coupled with the decrease of the active population, is exerting a continuous pressure on the public finance sustainability (Fougère and Mérette 1999; Meier and Werding 2010) which has been put to the test by the financial and sovereign debt crisis. Since demographic, economic, social and political characteristics of a country are directly linked to the establishment of its pension scheme, which should evolve accordingly (Guardiancich 2012), many countries are now challenged by the need to reform their pension schemes in order to improve the sustainability of their financial system trying to address also fairness concerns. For example, Italy experienced in the 50s the spark of a socioeconomic boom which has been coupled with an expansive phase of the pension system where the audience of the entitled increased as well as the monetary benefits. The increase in the public expenditure was associated to a steady growth in the debt-to-GDP ratio. At the beginning of 90s, Italy started to register higher levels of public debt and a decrease in the active population which prompted the Italian governments to implement a series of pension reforms with the aim to stabilize the debt evolution. From 1992 to 2011, Italy have registered six reform attempts which have cut the  public expenditure devoted to the pension system increasing the retirement age thresholds and/or shrinking the monetary benefits.Footnote 1 Our paper aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between changes in the retirement age threshold, pension system sustainability and public debt trajectory. This investigation is not trivial since the relevant literature evidences controversial opinions. For example, Galasso (2008) and Godinez-Olivares et al. (2016) show that increasing the retirement age reduces the pension system deficit empowering its sustainability, yet this measure seems to be efficient only in the short run (Magnani 2011; Miyazaki 2014). The main approach used to analyse the overall efficiency of postponing the labour market exit is the “standard overlapping generation” method (Blanchard 1985; Aglietta et al. 2007; Bielecki et al. 2015; Pamp 2015), based on the representative and fully rational agent assumption. In other words, in order to calculate the equilibrium of the model, this method assumes that agents have extremely strong computing abilities and wide-spread knowledge about the law of motion of the interest variables, which include the expectations of all the other agents and the systemic dynamics. However, during the last decades a growing literature has investigated the drawbacks of the rational expectations and the representative agents assumption.Footnote 2 Indeed, Johansen (1977) showed how, in systems characterized by complexity, uncertainty and heterogeneity, heuristics challenge the rational optimization as the ultimate logical basis for behavioural modelling.Footnote 3 To overcome the limitations of the “standard overlapping generation” method, we have developed an agent-based model (ABM) introducing heterogeneous agents whose characteristics and behaviour enable to enhance the realism of the analysis (Delli Gatti et al. 2011). ABMs develop a computational approach representing the economic system as an evolving environment, where autonomous interacting agents behave according to present or evolving rules of thumb (Tesfatsion 2000). Agents may represent individuals, firms, groups of individuals, policy makers or even countries, depending on the problem that is being treated. There is no optimum to reach, no exact solution to obtain, but, thanks to agent-based modelling we are able to study a complex socio-economic system characterised by different degrees of organisation and to interpret the interaction between agents who can have complex and non-linear behaviours. Hence, we can describe the dynamics emerging in the system, which do not coincide with the representative agent behaviour but arise from the interactions among heterogeneous agents (Bonabeau 2002). In the analysis of the pension system sustainability, heterogeneity is crucial for the system evolution because, for example, small idiosyncratic shocks on the wage level affect differently the individual choice of consumption and the households’ savings according to their own wealth (Mazzocchetti et al. 2018). Consequently, these individual shocks change the wealth distribution of the taxpayer population affecting the total amount of tax revenues collected by government. Moreover, according to Helbing (2012), the agent-based modelling is a useful approach to test policies and to better understand the responsiveness of a complex system to small or big changes in parameters or rules of behaviour, allowing to describe the phase transitions. This analysis follows the same research branch of Chen and Murata (2010) and Dolls et al. (2017) that have been investigating the effects of pension reforms both at macro-level and micro-level considering the role of the evolution of the ageing population on system sustainability. In line with Lychkina and Morozova (2015) and Kiraly and Simonovits (2019), we model dynamic savings and tax expenditure which evolve according to the changing population characteristics and heterogeneous behaviours driven by simple rules. Moreover, analysing the endogenous change that pension reforms induce in the agents’ attitude towards consumption, savings and labour, we assess whether different pension scheme reforms may improve the system sustainability and lead to a more equal distribution of wealth within the population (Karam et al. 2010). In our model, we assume a mandatory and earnings-based Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pension system where active workers finance the current pension welfare of the pensioners. The ABM allows us to investigate how debt stabilization policy, as for example the implementation of a property tax, can affect the wealth distribution taking into account reaction of the micro-scale agents resulting in emergent outcomes at the macro-scale level. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the main features of the theoretical model, Sect. 3 comments the simulation results exploring some scenarios related to different pension reforms and Sect. 4 presents the concluding remarks.",6

Sanchis-Llopis,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A substantial part of the literature emphasizes the roles that trade policy and firms’ exposure to international trade (whether the firm imports or exports) play as determinants of total factor productivity (TFP). However, most of the empirical studies analyse these elements separately or partially. This paper strengthens the understanding of the impact of international trade on firm-level TFP by studying how trade policy changes along with firms’ trade status affect TFP dynamics. In particular, we aim to disentangle the effect on firms’ productivity of changes in import tariffs of final goods (output tariffs) from the effect of changes in tariffs on imported intermediate goods (input tariffs). In this analysis we explicitly consider the influence of trade status (whether the firm exports, imports intermediate inputs or both) on firm productivity and whether firms’ trade status conditions the impact of trade policy on firms’ productivity. More specifically, our research sheds light on the effect of trade policy on the micro dynamics of productivity in a large developing economy, namely Brazil,Footnote 1 where the industrial productivity has been low and stagnating in the 2000s (OECD 2015). Brazil constitutes an interesting case to study since although tariffs have dropped, its average tariff for manufacturing imports is more than twice the level of Colombia, or other BRICS countries, and more than six times higher than that in the United States. This makes Brazil’s industry more shielded from international competition. In addition, trade barriers on imports of intermediate inputs limit Brazil’s benefits from global value chains, since almost 90 percent of the value added of Brazil’s exports is domestically produced (OECD 2015). Further, in contrast to other papers, we analyse a period of slow trade liberalization since between 2000–2007 Brazilian import tariffs declined less in comparison to the previous decade. In what follows, we review the most recent literature on the relationship between trade status, trading policy and productivity. Then, we present more in detail our empirical strategy and the main contributions of this paper to the analysis of how trade activities together with trade policy changes have an impact on firms’ TFP. Regarding the relationship between firms’ exposure to international trade and productivity, several contributions in the literature study the role of participating in international trade through exports or imports, but not both simultaneously. For example, Van Biesebroeck (2005), De Loecker (2007, 2013) and De Loecker and Warzyniski (2012) only consider the role of the exporting status in the evolution of TFP; and, Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008) and Halpern et al. (2015) only analyse the role of importing inputs. The literature that considers the impact of both exporting and importing on TFP is scarce (see, for example, Tomiura 2007; Bernard et al. 2009; Haller 2012; Kasahara and Lapham 2013; and, Caselli 2018). Empirical evidence indicates that exports and imports are correlated (Máñez et al. 2020). Thus, considering only one of the two activities, but not the other, could be problematic. We consider firms’ export and import activities to be correlated both directly and indirectly. Direct cross-effects of importing on the probability of exporting may occur through various channels. First, if importing intermediates results in lower input costs, and this cost reduction is at least partially transmitted to prices, this could enhance firms’ international competitiveness. Second, importing could allow firms to access a broader range of inputs, technology embedded in intermediate inputs, or higher quality inputs, which could contribute to upgrading the quality of the firms' existing product portfolio and/or facilitate the introduction of new products (Caselli 2018). All this can open up new opportunities for firms in export markets (Goldberg et al. 2010; Fernandes and Paunov 2013; Bas and Strauss-Kahn 2015; Fieler et al. 2018; and, Feng et al. 2016). Third, the experience in international markets obtained by importing intermediates can reduce the sunk costs that importing firms need to face to start exporting. Direct effects of exporting on the probability of importing may also accrue through various channels. First, knowledge about international markets gained by exporting may reduce the sunk costs that exporting firms may face to start importing. Second, greater competition in international markets can encourage exporting firms to import intermediate inputs if they are cheaper abroad. Finally, if preference for quality is more intense in international markets than in the domestic market and importing intermediates allows exporting firms to upgrade the quality of their products, exporting firms will be more likely to import intermediate inputs. As for indirect effects of importing on the probability of exporting and vice versa, they are related, on the one hand, to the productivity enhancing effects that international trade literature attributes to both activities; and, on the other hand, to a process of selection of the most productive firms both into exporting and importing. Regarding the effects of trade policy on firms’ TFP, Ferreira and Rossi (2003), Schor (2004), Fernandes (2007), and Lisboa et al. (2010) analyse the impact of trade policy on productivity. Yet, there are few studies that explore both trade policy and firms’ trade status as coexistent determinants of productivity (Muendler, 2004, and Amiti and Konings, 2007, are exceptions).Footnote 2 This paper aims at contributing to this last group of studies. At this point, we consider it is worth describing some aspects of the empirical strategy we follow to study how international trade activities together with trade policy changes have an impact on firms’ TFP. First, we estimate empirical models that disentangle the effects on firm-level productivity of changes in import tariffs on firms’ final goods (output tariffs) from the effects of changes in tariffs on imported intermediate goods (input tariffs). We expect these two effects to work through distinct channels. Trade liberalization through reductions in output tariffs may increase import competition in domestic markets and exert pressure on firms to improve efficiency. In contrast, reductions in input tariffs ease firms’ access to a wider range of potentially higher quality inputs with incorporated foreign technology, that can contribute to improve firms’ TFP. To the extent that tariff reforms reduce both output and input tariffs for a given firm, estimates of the effect of one without the other might yield misleading results about the channel through which such policy reforms determine microeconomic productivity. Second, in the relationship between firms’ trade status and TFP we explicitly distinguish whether the firm is an exporter and/or the firm imports intermediate inputs. Thus, we estimate models considering these two trade activities. Although this is not the main aim of this paper, we will also examine the direct effects of import and export statuses on TFP.Footnote 3 That is, exporters may exhibit efficiency gains from economies of scale, knowledge flows from foreign customers, and from increased competition in export markets forcing them to become more efficient. Likewise, importers of intermediate goods may benefit from the diffusion and adoption of new technologies, and knowledge embodied in imported inputs. Third, we investigate the interaction between trade policy and firms’ trade status, which can have additional effects on TFP. For example, a reduction in output tariffs may add greater competition in the domestic market to the existing competition for firms in export markets. Therefore, this greater competitive pressure may encourage improvements in the productivity of domestic firms to avoid losing market share. Also, input tariffs effects on productivity could be larger for firms that relied on imported inputs prior to a change in tariffs. Hence, there are reasons to expect that trade policy effects on TFP can be different depending on firms’ trade exposure. Fourth, our methodological approach extends Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) control-function approaches to estimate firm-level TFP in two ways. On the one hand, we allow for different demands of intermediate materials for firms with different trade status (non-traders, only exporters, only importers and two-way traders). On the other hand, we specify an endogenous Markov process for the law of motion of productivity in which past trading experience may affect current productivity (following De Loecker 2007, 2013 for exports; and, Kasahara and Rodrigue 2008, and Kasahara and Lapham 2013, for imports). With these TFP estimates at hand we analyse the effects of trade policy and firms’ trade status on productivity. Similarly to Amiti and Konings (2007), we regress our TFP estimates against trade policy measures (input and output tariffs), trade status variables and their interactions.Footnote 4 Finally, it is necessary to recall that our study sheds light on the micro dynamics of productivity of Brazil (a large developing economy). While most of the existing evidence comes from high-income economies, there are fewer related papers on developing economies or emerging markets, including Indonesia (Amiti and Konings 2007), Colombia (Fernandes 2007), Chile (Kasahara and Rodrigue 2008, and Kasahara and Lapham 2013), India (Topalova and Khandelwal 2011) and Mexico (Luong 2011). Ferreira and Rossi (2003), Schor (2004), Muendler (2004) and Lisboa et al. (2010) use data from a period of strong trade liberalization in Brazil. Ferreira and Rossi (2003), show that after declining over the 1980s, total factor productivity increased at an average annual rate of 2.65% from 1991 to 1997. Using data from 1986–1998, Schor (2004) finds positive effects of import-tariff reductions (either output or input tariffs) on TFP and Muendler (2004) obtains a negligible impact of the use of foreign inputs on TFP but a positive effect of foreign competition (as measured by larger import penetration and lower output tariffs). Finally, Lisboa et al. (2010), who analyse the impact of input and output tariffs on productivity, find that the reduction in input tariffs was the main factor behind productivity growth for Brazilian firms in the period they analyse (1988–1998).Footnote 5 The present paper differs from the aforementioned papers using Brazilian data in two noteworthy aspects. First, as mentioned, we explore the interaction between trade policy and firms’ trade status as determinants of firm-level TFP. Second, we use data for Brazilian firms in manufacturing and mining sectors during 2000–2008, when the process of trade liberalization in Brazil slowed down in comparison to the years mentioned in the previous studies. As discussed further below, Brazilian import tariffs declined slowly since 2000 up to 2007 (compared to the previous decade). All in all, we aim at enhancing the evidence on the relationship between import tariffs, firms’ trading status and the dynamics of firm-level productivity in Brazil during a period of relatively low trade liberalization, which will lead us to conclude that even modest changes in tariffs can have an effect on firms’ TFP. The evidence in this paper suggests that reductions in both output and input tariffs are associated with improvements in firms’ productivity. Lower output tariffs may increase productivity by increasing import competition, as firms might be forced to improve their efficiency. Lower input tariffs may increase productivity by increasing, for instance, access to a wider range of foreign inputs, to higher quality inputs, or to foreign technology incorporated in imported inputs (Bustos 2011). From our preferred specification, we obtain that a reduction of output tariffs by 10 percentage points is associated with a 0.16 percent increase in firm-level TFP. However, in the previous decade of stronger liberalization in Brazil, analysed by Ferreira and Rossi (2003), Muendler (2004) and Schor (2004), the estimated increases associated to output tariffs were 0.56, 6.13 and 0.95 percent, respectively. Regarding input tariffs, we find that a 10 percentage-points fall is associated with a 0.58 percent increase in TFP. Schor (2004) found that this 10 percentage-points fall in input tariffs was associated with a 1.53 percent increase in TFP. Further, Lisboa et al. (2010) also studied the period of intense liberalization. They found that the reduction in input tariffs was the main factor responsible for the productivity growth of Brazilian firms, given that when they included both input and output tariffs, the impact of output tariffs became statistically insignificant. Additionally, past import status has a positive impact on current productivity ranging from 12.0 to 14.7 percent, and the effect of past export status ranges from 10.3 to 15.4 percent. These numbers are in line with Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), who find that the increase in firms’ productivity from importing inputs ranges from 12.9 to 22.0 percent for Chilean firms, and with Halpern et al. (2015) for Hungary, who find that importing inputs increases firms’ productivity by 22.0 percent. The results reported above confirm that there have been within-firm productivity improvements in Brazil arising from the trade liberalization in the 2000s, although these are modest as compared to what has been reported in the literature for the previous decade when tariffs fell substantially. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the effects on TFP operate mainly through the intermediate input channel, since the effect of the reduction in input tariffs is substantially larger than that associated with a reduction in output tariffs (this result is in line with Lisboa et al. 2010). Furthermore, we obtain that the effect on TFP of input tariffs reductions spreads among all firms, which could be consistent with the existence of spillovers from input importers to non-importers of inputs. Domestic producers of inputs, when facing competition from foreign producers, are very likely forced to increase the quality/variety of their products with a potential benefit in the productivity of their domestic clients. However, since we cannot really test this hypothesis, this explanation may coexist with an alternative. In particular, it could also happen that some firms are purchasing products from abroad indirectly through wholesalers.Footnote 6 Finally, our analysis further suggests that it is important to control for the effects of changes in the real effective exchange rate on importers and exporters incentives for efficiency, as reductions in tariffs can concur with real appreciations of the domestic currency (as occurred in Brazil during the analysed period). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains key features of the estimation strategy and the production function estimation method. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 discusses results and some robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.",1

Bower-Bir,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At a stop in Roanoke, VA during the 2012 presidential campaign, President Obama delivered his now infamous “you didn’t build that” remark (Gardner 2012). Profitable businesses, the president contended, rely on transportation, communication, and education infrastructures built and maintained by people unassociated or indirectly associated with the benefiting organization. Successful businesspeople, moreover, owe some of their success to teachers, parents, and others who motivated, inspired, and (sometimes financially) supported them. In their “We Built It”-themed National Convention, the Romney campaign and conservative media outlets attacked the President’s insinuation that economic elites could not claim credit for their accomplishments.Footnote 1 Who, exactly, built ‘it’ is an empirical question, and I will not here add to the already vast literature that can speak to the disagreement.Footnote 2 More interesting is the underlying moral point on which the Obama and Romney campaigns tacitly agreed: That there is an intimate connection between deserving a specific economic situation and being personally responsible for that situation. To admit that the economically well-off are not the sole authors of their success would suggest to both President Obama and Governor Romney that America’s wealthy cannot lay moral claim to the full accounting of their riches. This logic presumably applies down the socioeconomic ladder. Were the economic lot of Americans generally subject to capricious, impersonal forces for which an individual could not logically be held accountable, then—by Obama and Romney’s implicit argument—those Americans would not deserve whatever economic station they inhabit. The directional arc linking personal responsibility to economic deservingness may seem unavoidable, and many philosophers argue as much (e.g., Pojman 1997; Rachels 1978; Rawls 1971). Others protest (e.g., Cupit 1999; Feldman  1995a). Either way, morality as it is envisioned by professional thinkers is apt to differ from morality as it is commonly understood and practiced. Americans (and everyone besides) have a long history of denying people economic advancement because of qualities over which they have limited or no control, and they often do so with the same moral certitude that accompanies the familiar rhetoric surrounding hard work and its responsibility-laden ilk (e.g., O’Flaherty 2015; Ross 1982; Rotem and Demel 1996). Prominent conservative Christians argue that, while women are as economically capable as men, their Biblically-ordained submission to God and family means they lack a moral claim to workplace participation (e.g., Horton 1982, Jepsen 1988; see Sherkat 2000). And despite strategic wrangling over which and how many kin will be heirs, farmers across the country and throughout its history steadfastly maintain that only family members can be the “rightful owner[s]” and inheritors of a farmstead (Rogers and Salamon 1983, 545). Conservative Christians do not think humans control their sex, nor do farmers think they choose their parents, yet members of these groups cite those attributes—separate from, and often paramount to, considerations of practicality and financial self-interest—as reasons to deserve jobs, land, and the economic benefits they reap.Footnote 3 Desert is an emergent phenomenon that, like all social institutions, varies across professions, religions, states, and other communities. Even bedrock dimensions like personal responsibility, which seemingly cut across different definitions of desert, are open to variation (Binmore 2011; Bower-Bir 2014). Determining whether and to what degree different communities within a population differ in their definitions of economic desert is of direct interest to philosophers, as well as economic, social, and cognitive scientists. Moral philosophers are not agreed on responsibility’s association with desert, with many of their ranks arguing against the usual linkage (e.g., Cupit 1996, 1999; Feldman 1995b; Feldman  1996). This debate has gone largely unnoticed in economics and psychology, where researchers not only assume responsibility’s intimacy with desert, but they assume the everyday people they study are similarly convinced of that intimacy (Greenberg 2011; Jost and Kay 2010; Wagstaff 1994). Consider, for example, the common effort-luck dichotomy on which many economists ground their measures of whether survey respondents consider an outcome deserved—the result of personal toil and sacrificed utility—and on which they base their tax, welfare, and redistribution policy prescriptions (e.g., Alesina and Giuliano  2011, and citations therein; more on this later). These researchers suggest that this distinction gets to the heart of justice, and they impose that philosophical bias on their subjects by applying a moral label like “deserved” to subject responses where none was present, and most—along with myriad social psychologists, neuroscientists, etc.—eschew that critical label altogether. Instead, they favor, confuse, and conflate related but distinct terms including “just” and “fair” (Greenberg 2011, 271), “just” and “altruistic” (e.g., Decety et al. 2015), and “fair” and “equitable” (e.g., Starmans et al. 2017).Footnote 4 All of this in the face of ample evidence from sub-fields and neighboring disciplines that desert and its related concepts take on local flavors, and are thus unlikely to be captured in a universal measure (Westermarck 1906; Young 1995; Elster  1992; Binmore 2011). Rather than take the relationship for granted and ascribe belief in it to entire peoples, I use a national survey to determine whether and to what degree different segments of the American population consider personal responsibility a key ingredient of economic desert. I find that Americans generally want peoples’ economic standing to be determined by factors over which individuals (think they) exercise control. This desire is apparent across Americans of all backgrounds, but it is expressed with varying levels of conviction and with a handful of exceptions, two of which stand out. First, there is widespread disagreement over which determinants of economic standing people control. Respondents are split on whether and to what degree individuals are responsible for their intelligence, creativity, health, and educational pedigree. Despite this schism, respondents are predominantly comfortable with the first two influencing people’s economic wellbeing, but disagree over the role that the latter two should play. Second, neoliberals—for whom economic growth is a paramount concern—are much more likely to assign personal responsibility a deflated role in their definitions of economic desert. The more staunchly neoliberal a respondent, the more closely she associates economic desert with marketability and productivity, which may mean an expanded moral role for factors over which we have little or no control. In the course of my analysis, I try to avoid the two missteps I mentioned earlier. First, I am careful not to imbue moral significance to data where none necessarily exists. All relevant survey questions have an explicit normative or utopian component. Second, I take pains to explain why desert, specifically, should be of interest to economic, social, brain, and policy scientists. In addition to its academic relevance, understanding how different people define economic deservingness has real-world import. If you believe that someone (including yourself) is enjoying undeserved economic resources, or is going without resources she deserves, then there exist moral grounds to redistribute those resources. Moreover, the importance you attach to personal responsibility will influence you preferred means of redistribution—whether they allow third party intervention, for example (Bower-Bir 2018). In short, American definitions of economic desert hold personal responsibility in a more or less central position, with a few telling deviations. Before exploring Americans’ economic attitudes toward responsibility, I first define and outline the conceptual relationship between it and desert.",1
38,1,Economia Politica,03 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-020-00194-5,The impact of attractiveness on job opportunities in Italy: a gender field experiment,April 2021,Giovanni Busetta,Fabio Fiorillo,Giulio Palomba,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In this paper we aim to shed light on the profile of discrimination in the Italian labour market. In particular, we deal with gender discrimination, focusing on how it is shaped by not being Italian or being a physically attractive candidate. For this purpose, we carry out an empirical analysis using a database created ad hoc by sending fictitious curricula vitae (hereafter CVs) to real job openings. In particular, we have sent the same resume with the same skills several times to all the job postings displayed online between September 2011 and august 2012, changing the attached photo or attaching no photo at all; we also sent CVs of Italian candidates with photo in order to calculate the impact of attractiveness for Italian candidates. In addition, our sample includes CVs of Italian and immigrants candidates without photos. This feature allows us to determine the impact of being immigrants compared to being Italian, regardless of the impact of attractiveness. It is worth to note that the scale of our experiment is larger than that of similar analyses. The focus of our research is twofold: on the one hand, we consider the differences in the skills of the individuals who are employed and, on the other hand, we analyse the reasons why job recruiters perceive the various candidates differently. Consequently, we will try to answer the following questions: do employers discriminate against women and men more if they are not attractive or if they are foreigners? How does gender-based discrimination interact with that based on attractiveness or nationality in different kind of jobs? In comparison to previous papers on discrimination in the labour market based on field experiments (for a complete review, see Rich 2014; Baert 2017; Neumark 2018), we build a large database which is unique in several respects. Indeed, we analyse the marginal impact of discrimination on the basis of the joint effect of gender and attractiveness and also that of gender and not being a native Italian. Moreover, while other articles basically analyse only the main characteristics of the job (e.g. hard work or front office), we also collected data on the types of work (managers, technicians, sales, etc.). In this way, we can study the impact of discriminatory variables such as gender, physical appearance and nationality on each type of work. This kind of investigation is uncommon in Italy (Patacchini et al. 2015). Actually, several scholars study gender inequality and gender discrimination in Italy, analysing the gender pay gap with non experimental tools (see, for example, Naticchioni and Ricci 2012; Mussida and Lucarelli 2014), while literature on this topic generally focuses on attractiveness and racial discrimination against the differential salaries (Campos-Soria and Ropero-Garcia 2016). In our paper, we identify the gender gap with the difference in callback rates, since we have sent fictitious CVs to companies that require work. This allows us to study the gender gap in opportunities and not in wages. One criticism is that several analyses on the influence of attractiveness and nativeness on the creation of a gender gap during the hiring process consist of small samples of students who answered hypothetical questions about hiring decisions. Instead our analysis is based on a much larger sample of real job openings posted by actual employers. The underlying idea is thereby to evaluate whether attractiveness and nativeness interact with gender gap according to the different kind of job. A second criticism revealed by most of the experimental studies concerns the impossibility for researchers to control for employee qualifications and skills. Conversely, the design of our experiment gives us complete control and observability over candidate backgrounds: since all the applications should fulfill employer requirements, for each job offer, we sent CVs of applicants who are identical in terms of education, work experience, language and computer skills, but they are associated to different names, nationality, sex and pictures (or lack thereof). Our experiment has never been conducted before in Italy. We chose this country mainly because it is considered one of the main fashion countries in the world where physical appearance has always been considered very important. Moreover, Schwab (2019) in the Global Competitiveness Report 2019 mentions that Italy is ranked 62th out of 141 countries, in terms of “Female participation in the labour force”. It represents an improvement with respect to 2015 (93rd out of 144), but the issue of gender discrimination in Italy still exists. Therefore our investigation may be helpful in explaining the low participation of women in the Italian labour force market. Some contributions confirm that, historically, Italy represents a country in which beauty and attractiveness have always played a relevant role, as underlined by Gundle (1997, 1999): “Feminine beauty has been more discussed, appreciated, represented in art and associated with national, cultural identity in Italy than in any other country”. Finally, in Italy immigration represents a relative recent phenomenon which drove the country from an emigration to a new immigration nation (Bauer et al. 2000). According to ISTAT (2017), in 2016 immigrants were more than five million, reaching 8.3% of the Italian resident population. This makes Italy a perfect country to also study the impact of not being Italian native (from now on we will use the word “native”) on the gender gap. In fact, our results show a huge gender gap in Italian labour market that increases when gender interacts with not being natives or with a lack of attractiveness, especially when the job requires a high qualification. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the main literature on the topic, while in Sect. 3 we describe the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 focuses on the statistical methodology we applied and Sect. 5 presents the main empirical results. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",3

Controversies and policy lessons,April 2021,Ronny Mazzocchi,Roberto Tamborini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"""In the first decade of the euro’s existence, many euro-area countries witnessed a build-up of macroeconomic imbalances. These vulnerabilities proved to be highly damaging once the financial crisis set in. The ongoing unwinding of the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances is a protracted process and the adjustment is proving to be particularly painful in terms of growth and employment"" (European Commission 2010, p. 7). The crucial role of macroeconomic imbalances is generally acknowledged by the consensus narrative of the European crisis that followed the Great Recession (e.g. Kuenzel and Ruscher 2013, Gros 2013, Sinn 2014, Baldwin and Giavazzi 2015, Beatrice and Sondermann 2018). Macroeconomic imbalances came as somewhat of a surprise to policymakers, who had generally expected that European integration would reduce divergences between Member States (Acocella 2016). In particular, the Maastricht criteria emphasised nominal convergence (defined in terms of nominal variables such as interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, government deficits and debt). In contrast, real convergence (defined in terms of convergence of real GDP per capita levels, convergence of unemployment rates, and so on) was left to market forces, and did not involve the control of criteria or indicators. However, the facts invalidated this strategy. The build-up of imbalances prompted new EU initiatives that culminated with the so-called “Six Pack” adoption in 2011 and the establishment of the European Semester as a procedure to improve policy coordination in the EU beyond fiscal matters, thus encompassing also structural issues. The package includes the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) to be enacted by the Commission. Like the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), the MIP consists of three components: surveillance (guided by the scoreboard of 11 indicators), preventive arm (alert and policy prescriptions in the face of mounting imbalances), and corrective arm (mandatory corrective actions and eventually sanctions). The MIP is intended to prevent imbalances within Member States, as well as across them. The two dimensions are unified under the overarching aim of sparing other Member States from the fall-out from unsustainable national policies (see Moschella 2014 for an assessment)-Footnote 1 Within the MIP framework a prominent role is assigned to current account imbalances (CAI). The MIP provision is that policy actions are particularly needed in member states showing persistently large current-account deficits and competitiveness losses, whilst in Member States that accumulate large current-account surpluses, policies should aim to identify and implement measures that help strengthen their domestic demand and growth potential. The threshold associated with the CAI are not symmetrical, and Member States are required to follow consistent adjustment programmes in the presence of a CA surplus of 6% of GDP or of a deficit of 4% of GDP. This is because in the MIP framework a current-account surplus is not expected to be a clear and present danger for stability. Nevertheless, large current account surpluses can bear vulnerabilities, especially in cases of a sudden collapse of world trade (as experienced by Germany, among others, in 2008), and may point to imbalances within a country, which might lead to spill-overs that require correction (e.g. through structural reforms). Although the MIP scoreboard consists of a wide range of indicators, the CAI provision seems stated unconditionally; that is to say, CAI are to be corrected independently of the constellation of other indicators that surround them and may interact with them. To the extent that CAI are related to competitiveness issues, the MIP intersects with the Euro Plus Pact, another package of warning indicators and recommendations prompted by the crisis and approved in March 2011. Although the widening of macroeconomic imbalances in the Euro Area (EA) prior to the crisis is a matter of fact, and the consensus narrative contains elements of truth, the conception and implementation of the MIP remains controversial, as testified by the recent report of the European Court of Auditors (2018).With regard to CAI in particular, alternative views have been put forward on mainly three issues: (i) their relevance, (ii) their causes and connection with the crisis, and (iii) their policy implications. The aim of this paper is to examine the above-mentioned controversial points about the causes, meaning and consequences of CAI in the EA, and discuss the alternative policy prescriptions that emerge.",1

Some of the existing studies take academic spinoffs or university incubators, Industrial Liaison Offices (ILO) and Technology Transfer Offices (TTO) as the unit of analysis (Lafuente and Berbegal-Mirabent 2017; Baglieri et al. 2018; O’Kane 2018; Rasmussen and Wright 2015; Ruokonen et al. 2008; Maine and Garnsey 2007; Zedtwitz and Grimaldi 2006; Feldman and Klofsten 2010 to cite only some). Instead, other studies have focused on single researchers. Indeed, academics' background and motivations are crucial for igniting knowledge transfer (Landry et al. 2010; Aldridge and Audretsch 2011; Kalar and Antoncic 2016; Filippetti and Savona 2017) and for determining the choice to activate one specific transfer channel instead of another (Gümüsay and Bohné 2018; Rizzo 2015; Walter et al. 2016, and so on). At the same time, being involved in knowledge transfer activities determines some consequences for researchers. Many scholars have investigated whether and how such involvement affects researchers’ publication productivity, quality, and direction. The evidence on such effects is mixed and varies according to the type of transfer activity considered. On the one hand, some studies suggest that being directly involved in entrepreneurial activities brain drains not-for-profit research (Czarnitzki and Toole 2010), even if this finding is not universal (Abramo et al. 2012; see also Larsen 2011, for a review of the contrasting evidence on this topic). On the other hand, some research highlights that knowledge transfer activities such as patenting boost publication rates and quality (Azoulay et al. 2009; Breschi et al. 2008; Van Looy et al. 2006), especially when such transfer activities are not intensive (Crespi et al. 2011), although such an effect might depend upon the field of specialization (Breschi et al. 2008). Similar positive impacts have also been observed for co-publication with firms (Godin and Gingras 2000). In addition to the diverse impacts on pure research, different knowledge transfer activities might also be substitutive or complementary. Indeed, these activities are heterogeneous in many regards: the effort required, the ""readiness-to-use"" of the transferred knowledge, and its affinity—and possible economies—with other academic and nonacademic tasks. To the best of our knowledge, the interdependence among academic knowledge transfer activities has been mostly neglected by the existing literature. One exception is Barbieri et al. (2018), who show that establishing spinoffs, in addition to exerting a negative effect on the publishing of purely academic research, also significantly reduces co-publishing with firms, which is an alternative knowledge transfer vehicle. Despite this gap in the literature, identifying interdependence among knowledge transfer channels might be particularly relevant for policy design. Suppose policy initiatives aim to increase the overall technology transfer to the economy. In that case, they must take into account that the promotion of one specific activity can result in a further incentive to or a brake on the implementation of others. Overall, this might either augment or decrease the general effects of technology transfer to the economic environment, either boosting or jeopardizing the policy effort. Our analysis deepens the study of the relations among various forms of knowledge transfer. Our focus is on the effects that creating a spinoff has on other scholars' collaborations with firms. More specifically, this paper studies the spinoff effects on researchers' attitudes towards (i) noncommercial knowledge transfer activities such as publishing with firms and (ii) commercial knowledge transfer activities such as patenting with firms. The novelty of the contribution lies in investigating whether such effects are heterogeneous according to the researchers' experience in collaborating with firms in the pre-spinoff period. In other words, we analyze whether the use of knowledge transfer channels after the spinoff varies according to whether the academic entrepreneur had previously collaborated with firms or not. This potential heterogeneity is relevant in many regards, particularly for the results of policies aimed at fostering academic entrepreneurship and innovation at large. Policy evaluation studies have noted that the effects of policies can vary profoundly depending on the characteristics of the recipients, being them territories (Barbieri et al. 2020; Cypher and Dietz 2009), social groups (Belaid and Ridde 2015), or individuals (Dubois et al. 2020). In line with this perspective, previous research has highlighted that a single one-size-fits-all policy to encourage university–industry collaborations cannot be effective (Filippetti and Savona 2017) and, more specifically, that the heterogeneity in the effects of academic entrepreneurship policies must be taken into account (Han 2020). Conversely, in the Italian context, the existing national and university-level regulations on academic entrepreneurship tend to disregard the individual features characterizing the researcher who decides to establish a new spinoff. The regulations of those universities reporting the highest number of spinoffs in the countryFootnote 1 mainly ground the evaluation of a spinoff's feasibility on the growth and success prospects of the newly established firm. Few universities include an assessment of the compatibility of the spinoff activities with the academic founder’s teaching and research tasks and different institutions (e.g., the department, the specializing school, the Ph.D. tutor, and so on) are in charge of the authorization depending on whether the academic has a permanent position or not. Apart from this, there seems to be no pre-established procedure for evaluating the researcher's profile, either in terms of his/her previous experience with the industry or in relation to the effects of the spinoff on the other forms of knowledge transfer that he/she usually carries out. Instead, we maintain that shedding more light on the extent to which individual pre-spinoff heterogeneity can affect post-spinoff industry–university collaboration can provide useful insights into the need to design differentiated policies and on the direction that these policies should take. The intuition driving our investigation is as follows. The existing literature on the influence of individual characteristics on engagement in knowledge transfer activities, notably founding a spinoff, has highlighted the importance of prior collaboration with industry (Krabel and Mueller 2009). Such previous contacts would help the academic develop an entrepreneurial attitude and managerial skills (Ortín-Ángel and Vendrell-Herrero 2014), allowing him/her to acquire knowledge, gather information about the market, and accumulate the social capital of linkages with market actors (Landry et al. 2006, 2010). Additionally, some forms of university–industry collaborations critically increase academics' likelihood of exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities, strengthening their capacity to bring new inventions to the market (D'Este et al. 2012). In other words, having previously collaborated with firms makes academics more entrepreneurially ""mature"" and can affect the spinoff's success (Ortín-Ángel and Vendrell-Herrero 2014). We claim that this might also impact the technology transfer channels that academic entrepreneurs activate after a spinoff is established. For academics who have collaborated with firms in the past, the spinoff acts as an intermediary favoring the transformation of scientific knowledge into productive knowledge (Fontes 2005). From this perspective, a spinoff might incentivize co-patenting activities while crowding out other forms of research collaboration, such as co-publications. Conversely, for those who have never cooperated with firms, a spinoff might be their first opportunity to explore the market and build new networks. Therefore, it might create unique occasions for academics to connect with other firms; such collaborations might involve fewer risks and be more exploratory in form, such as co-publishing. Simultaneously, the lack of information about the market may induce academic entrepreneurs with no previous co-publication experience with firms to compete with other firms in inventions that are more easily marketed, reducing their propensity to co-patent. To empirically test this intuition, we build upon the unique dataset used by Barbieri et al. (2018). This dataset includes information covering (i) all Italian academic entrepreneurs who founded a spinoff in the time period 2000–2007 and (ii) a control group of similar colleagues who were not involved in any spinoff. To analyze the different behaviors of academic entrepreneurs with respect to their previous experience in co-publishing, we rely on propensity score matching (PSM) and subgroup analysis, which allows us to address (i) the possible biases arising from researchers' self-selection into spinoffs and (ii) the moderating effects of pre-spinoff collaborations with firms (Green and Stuart 2014). The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and presents a conceptual and interpretive framework. This framework supports the hypotheses to be tested by the empirical analysis, which are also presented in this section. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the data used in the study and illustrates the methodology used. The results are presented in Sect. 4 and are tested for robustness in Sect. 5. Section 6 offers a discussion and interpretation of the results, while Sect. 7 highlights some policy implications stemming from the study and then concludes.",3

38,1,Economia Politica,10 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-021-00220-0,The back of the coin in resilience: on the characteristics of advantaged low-achieving students,April 2021,Oscar David Marcenaro-Gutierrez,Luis Alejandro Lopez-Agudo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a wide body of evidence which indicates that the socio-economic status of the population influences many economic and social outcomes as e.g. well-being, income, education or health (Perrons and Plomien 2010). Particularly, in the field of education, it was found that a higher socio-economic background has a positive and long lasting relationship with better academic performance and, hence, adult life and transition to the labour market (Hanushek et al. 2003; Dolton and Marcenaro 2005; Kutner et al. 2007; Hanushek and Woessmann 2011; Ritchie and Bates 2013; MEFP 2018; among others). Due to this worldwide and highly relevant influence that socio-economic background has on students’ academic performance, there is a widespread concern about resilience and social mobility. Following MEFP (2018), which analyses the main figures on resilience for the country under analysis in the current research, i.e. Spain, resilience and social mobility present low rates, to the extent that 55% of those children whose parents did not finish compulsory secondary education reached that same level of education in 2015 (compared to 37% in the OECD); on the other hand, for the same year, 24.4% of children whose parents did not finish compulsory secondary education reached third level studies, compared to 21% in the OECD. The relevance of this resilience subject spreads further from Spain to almost all countries and has made many governments across the world to focus their attention on reducing inequalities (Duncan and Hoffman 1981; Brune and Garrett 2005), making a high economic effort on this objective (Mayer and Lopoo 2008). This has also reached the policies proposed by many supranational organizations. For instance, the United States passed the Title I, part A in 1965, followed by the “No Child Left Behind Act” in 2001 and, in 2015, the “Every Student Succeeds Act”. These programs were aimed at distributing public funding to schools and school districts with high rates of socio-economically disadvantaged students. The European Union also stablished a package of policy interventions in the “Horizon 2020” and in the Lisbon Agenda for the design of policies focused on increasing the rate of the population aged 30–34 with completed tertiary education from 31% to at least 40% in 2020. Other policy packages as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations was intended at providing access to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university, to all the population by 2030. The relevance of resilience has also been highlighted by authors such as Chandler (2014), who indicated that “resilience is now the top priority for the sustainable development and international development aid agenda” (p. 1) or by Bernard (2004) “the development of human resiliency is none other than the process of healthy human development” (p. 9). Because of these reasons, analysing the influence of socio-economic status on educational outcomes has become of special relevance in the education field. Concretely, the profile of the “resilient student” has been defined in the literature as that student who, coming from a very low socio-economic status household, can overcome this situation and perform relatively better than the rest of students. To the extent that becoming a resilient student means fostering social mobility, the characteristics that define these students have become a topic of special interest. Basically, the literature has indicated that both individual and school climate factors (also called protective factors) may influence the likelihood of students to become resilient (Abelev 2009). In this sense, authors as Borman and Overman (2004) analysed resilience in mathematics for United States students from 1st to 7th grade and highlighted that resilient students presented a great engagement in academic activities, an internal locus of control, efficaciousness in mathematics, a more positive outlook towards school and higher self-esteem, also indicating that a supporting school community was essential. Other authors such as Agasisti and Longobardi (2014a, b) analysed resilient students in 10th grade (using PISA 2009 data) and found that individual characteristics, together with school factors (i.e. extracurricular activities and school leadership) and school climate helped students from low socio-economic status to become resilient. Regarding to research works focused only on individual characteristics, Martin and Marsh (2006) analysed resilience for 5th and 6th grade students and found that confidence (self-efficacy), planning, control, low anxiety and commitment (i.e. persistence) were relevant factors, while Krovetz (2007) analysed the characteristics of resilient students and found that they present high levels of motivation and confidence. Cassidy (2015) also indicated that students’ academic self-efficacy was also a relevant determinant of students’ resilience. Focusing on school climate and environment, Thomsen (2002) highlighted the relevance of mitigating risk factors in the school environment to foster students’ resilience. These factors were explored by many authors as e.g. Finn and Rock (1997), who studied resilient students in the United States from 8 to 12th grade and found that school engagement was an important component for academic resilience. Other authors as Gordon (2001) found that an environment that supports students’ social ability, students’ self-social control and general extracurricular activities improved resilience. Morales (2010) indicated, for K-12 United States students, that personal relationships with academic mentors, a general broadening of horizons through exposure to various peoples and cultures and the facilitation of an increased sense of academic self-esteem would foster resilience. Similarly, Cordero et al. (2015) analysed resilient students in Spain and found that teachers played a relevant part in helping these students to overcome the difficulties that they can be facing due to their lower socio-economic status compared to their peers. As it can be appreciated, the defining characteristics of these resilient students have been, to some extent, delimited in the literature; nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is an almost inexistent literature on the characteristics of students who are in the opposite side of the coin, i.e. students from a high socio-economic background who perform poorer compared to the rest of students, which are denoted in the literature as advantaged low-achieving students (Gordon 2001; Cheung 2017). The analysis of these students is as relevant as the analysis of resilient students, to the extent that they represent a different problem in the education system, as highlighted by authors such as Cheung (2017): “it is equally important to conduct research to find out why some adolescents from ESCS-advantaged families have not cherished the opportunities and potentials so as to attain high in academic studies. It may be that some of these youths for some reasons have slackened or even abandoned their studies despite opportunities and potentials bestowed upon them due to their advantaged home background” (p. 967). This, joined to the scarce literature on this issue, would motivate the analysis of advantaged low-achievers’ profile in the present study. Concretely, Cheung (2017) used PISA 2012 data for Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea, and defined the profile of these advantaged low-achievers in mathematics; they found that this profile may vary depending on the country: for Shangai, they found that students with lower familiarity with mathematical concepts and lower mathematics self-efficacy were more likely to be advantaged low-achievers; in Singapore, males, as well as students with fewer years of kindergarten education, were more likely to be advantaged low-achievers; in Hong Kong, students living in single families were more likely to present this profile; for Korea, lower mathematical concepts, lower mathematics self-efficacy and lower mathematics self-concept defined this profile; for Taiwan, immigrant students were found to be more likely of being advantaged low-achievers. Therefore, to the extent that this profile may change depending on the country, the present research intends to delve into the characteristics that define this particular group of students for the case of Spain. However, due to the scarce amount of previous research works on this issue, there is not a comprehensive list of variables which may define these students, so we make use of certain characteristics that configure the profile of resilient students and check whether they are also applicable for advantaged low-achieving students or not (but, maybe, with an opposite influence). Then, our research question is: 
What are the characteristics that define advantaged low-achieving students?
 The analysis of this issue for Spain is relevant to the extent that, in spite of being ranked in the 22nd position in terms of average socio-economic status in PISA 2015, Spanish students were ranked in the 25th position in reading, 32nd position in mathematics and 30th position in science (OECD 2016). Concretely, within Spain, the present study is focused on the Spanish region of Andalusia. This is the most populated region of Spain (8.4 million people in 2018), which also presents low results in international large-scale assessment tests. In this sense, in PISA 2015 (OECD 2016) Andalusian students obtained 479 points in reading (compared to 496 for Spain and 487 for the OECD), 466 in mathematics (486 for Spain and 478 for the OECD) and 473 in science (493 for Spain and 488 for the OECD).Footnote 1 This means that Andalusian students are around half a year of schooling behind the average Spanish student. In terms of grade retention, Andalusia also presents a high percentage of repeater students: in PISA 2015 Andalusia had a grade retention rate of 38%, while that for Spain was 31% and 13% for the OECD (OECD 2016). Furthermore, within Spain, Andalusia was ranked as the penultimate Spanish region in terms of reading and mathematics academic performance and the last one in science academic performance in PISA 2015 (MECD 2016). In addition, Andalusian dropout rates from compulsory education were 24.9% in 2015, compared to 20% in Spain (IECA 2020). Thus, these figures of the Spanish education system and, specifically, of Andalusia, support the interest on analysing this issue for this region. According to Cordero et al. (2011), these differences in PISA scores between Andalusia and other Spanish regions might due to the fact that, since 1980, the education system in Spain followed a decentralisation process to the regional governments (a process started by 5 out of a total of 19 Spanish regions: Andalusia, Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and Navarre), until being totally decentralised in the late 1990s (Crespo-Cebada et al. 2014); these regional governments are responsible for deciding, independently of the central government, the amount of resources devoted to education and the admission criteria for schools (Escardíbul and Villarroya 2009). Cordero et al. (2011) also indicated that Andalusia has one of the least efficient education systems within Spain, an inefficiency which seemed to mostly depend on student characteristics (Lara-Porras et al. 2019), as school quality seemed quite uniform in all Spanish regions. In fact, authors such as Ciccone and Garcia-Fontes (2009) indicated that this lower efficiency might be due to a higher proportion of parents with less than primary education level in Andalusia, compared to the other Spanish regions. Other authors such as Gil (2014) or Lopez et al. (2019) indicated that Andalusian schools seem to have an issue of low funding and low expense per student, which should be corrected by the central or regional governments. Then, the present research work intends to contribute to this scarce literature by providing an insight into the characteristics which may define an advantaged low-achieving student for this Andalusian context. This study is novel in two ways: first, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that advantaged low-achievers’ profile has been explored for Spain. Second, the use of census and longitudinal data, a rarity for Spain in terms of education data, together with a rich set of variables, let us get closer to a more precise profile for these students in secondary education. The rest of this research work is structured as follows: first, we present the data and methodology employed. Then, the main results are described, finishing with their discussion and conclusions.",1

Productivity growth has been persistently anemic and has lagged that of the euro area—see Anderson and Raissi (2018), Andrle et al. (2018), Bugamelli and Lotti (2018) and the references therein. Held back by long-standing rigidities, the economy failed to take advantage of euro accession to modernize its institutions or adapt to a changing global trade and technological landscape. Pellegrino and Zingales (2017) attribute the weak productivity growth in Italy to the lack of meritocracy in the selection and rewarding of managers, and the inability of firms to take full advantage of the information and communication technology revolution. Akcigit et al. (2018) argue that political connections adversely affected firm dynamics, innovation, and creative destruction in Italy, weighing on the economic growth. Moreover, wage growth outpaced productivity growth, contributing to high structural unemployment; see Kangur (2018). Easy access to finance pre-crisis boosted demand, but the double-dip recession earlier this decade and the subsequent tightening of credit conditions set Italy back further; see Doerr et al. (2018), and Mohaddes et al. (2017). Implementing structural reforms are, thus, of greatest importance. High public debt and an inadequate composition of fiscal policy have also contributed to Italy’s underperformance. Public debt, above 130% of GDP and the second highest in Europe, has been a perennial source of vulnerability— see Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) and Chudik et al. (2013, 2017) who consider the consequences of high and rising public debt on economic growth. Italy has run primary fiscal surpluses that on average were higher than its euro area peers, but these were insufficient to lower debt and secure stability. The quality of fiscal policy has also insufficiently supported inclusive growth. The burden of high taxes has fallen on labor, public investment has been squeezed, and social benefits have centered on generous pensions. Aiming for an adequate primary surplus to reduce debt, underpinned by high quality pro-growth and inclusive measures, is thus also important. This paper contributes to the debate by identifying growth-friendly and inclusive options for achieving fiscal balance that could potentially put Italy’s public debt on a firm downward path. Firstly, it discusses public spending trends and composition. An analysis of spending over the past two decades reveals that: (1) in the decade following euro accession, spending grew faster than potential output, owing in large part to the rapid growth of pensions; (2) since the global financial crisis, spending has been broadly controlled, mainly through a freeze on hiring and wages and cuts in capital spending. Pension spending though has continued to rise; (3) despite the recent spending control, the pre-crisis spending excesses have not been reversed; and (4) achieving sizable and durable expenditure savings may require lowering the large pension spending. Improving the efficiency of health spending in some geographical areas could also lead to some savings. Secondly, the paper analyzes the Italian pension system. Over half of current primary spending is social benefit expenditure, which is dominated by pension spending. At around 16% of GDP, pension spending in Italy is the second highest in the euro area after Greece. The Italian authorities have legislated several reforms in the past. However, before the full effect of these reforms is evident over the very long run, fiscal pressures are likely to persist and weigh on Italy’s goal of achieving and maintaining a balanced budget. The second part of this paper finds that: (1) despite past reforms, there remain generous parts of the system where Italy is an outlier, pointing to areas of potential savings; and (2) pension projections rest on optimistic assumptions of (a) employment, specifically that Italy will go from having among the highest to very low unemployment rates; and (b) Italy will maintain much higher real GDP growth rates for decades to come than has been its experience and policy settings. Relaxing these assumptions implies a notable rise in projected spending over the coming decades until the full benefits of past reforms become evident. Thirdly, drawing lessons from the literature and cross-country experience, it discusses options for revenue rebalancing in Italy. The tax system is characterized by a high tax wedge, a relatively narrow tax base, and significant tax arrears. A fiscal devaluation strategy—a shift from taxing productive factors to taxing consumption and property—reveals the scope to (1) decrease the tax wedge significantly; (2) reduce value-added tax gaps (both compliance and policy), by harmonizing the reduced VAT rates and improving the tax collection performance; (3) rationalize tax expenditures; and (4) raise revenues by re-introducing a modern property tax on primary residences. Fourthly, it simulates, using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model, the impact of a growth-friendly and inclusive mix of spending and revenue measures along a gradual fiscal consolidation path that puts Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward trajectory—see Kumhof et al. (2010) and Anderson et al. (2013) for modeling details. The model simulations show that a revenue-neutral and less distortionary tax reform, alongside current spending cuts and capital spending increases, can generate sizable output gains and a sustainably lower public debt ratio over the medium to long term. Short-term output costs of this fiscal package, if implemented credibly, are likely limited. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses Italy’s public spending trends and composition. Section 3 analyzes the pension system and identifies certain areas that can be improved. Section 4 considers some options for revenue rebalancing. Section 5 conducts a simulation exercise to assess the macroeconomic effects of a growth-friendly mix of spending and revenue measures. Section 6 concludes.",2

It can be regarded as the New Keynesian response to the natural rate of unemployment (NRU) devised by Friedman and the monetarists (which, in turn, was a criticism of the neo-Keynesian interpretation of the Phillips curve). While the NRU is based on the assumption of perfect competition, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is based on the assumption of imperfect markets, in the same wat as the (equivalent) concept of Imperfect Competition Equilibrium (ICE) rate of unemployment identified by the WS-PS model. However, several criticisms have been evoked against this model (Blanchard & Summers, 1988; Sterdyniack, 1998, Laurent & Zajdela, 1999; Piluso, 2010; Lavoie, 2014). In our opinion, it is necessary to reformulate the model by reintroducing some of Keynes’ most fundamental teachings on the theory of unemployment. First of all, we need to reaffirm the hypothesis of an asymmetry between employers and employees (Cartelier, 1996; Glustoff, 1968; Piluso, 2011), thus restoring the role of the principle of effective demand in determining the level of employment. We aim to show that the equilibrium unemployment rate as determined in the traditional WS-PS model is only one case among many others, including the more general model presented here which incorporates the possibility of equilibria in Keynesian involuntary unemployment. The originality of our article is that it gives an account of Classic unemployment and Keynesian unemployment without making the assumption of fixed prices as in the literature of the 1960s and 1970s (Barro & Grossman, 1971; Clower, 1965). Layard’s WS-PS model is certainly a flexible price model, but, as discussed here, it cannot account for truly Keynesian unemployment. Therefore, the theoretical challenge here is to account for Keynesian and classical unemployment in the same model (which is impossible with the traditional WS-PS model) in the absence of a fixed price assumption (unlike the Barro and Grossman model). First, we justify our approach to the reformulation of the WS-PS model by highlighting some of the criticisms that have been made against this model. Secondly, we explain our methodology for introducing involuntary unemployment following the teachings of Keynes in General Theory. In a third step, we outline the structure of the model. Finally, in a fourth section, we highlight the properties of the model.",

To the extent that technology is no longer considered an exogenous factor, we admit that the business cycle can also affect R&D investment. A relevant question is whether this impact will be positive or negative. From a theoretical point of view, during recessions, the allocation of firms’ resources would tend to be more efficient (opportunity cost effect), concentrated on activities that generate higher returns in terms of long-term productivity. Therefore, if a company increases R&D expenditures to strengthen its competitiveness, the effect on its productivity should be positive. However, this cost opportunity effect might be compensated in the context of an imperfect capital market with financial constraints (Aghion et al. 2010). Most of the empirical literature is consistent with this second argument. In times of recession, R&D investment behaves counter-cyclically in firms that have enough resources to fund it, while the opposite happens if companies have difficulties accessing external financing (Aghion et al. 2012; Bovha-Padilla et al. 2009; López-García et al. 2013). From this perspective, the role of public funding could be decisive as long as it mitigates the negative effect of financial constraints during the crisis. Notice that firms’ financial constraints are also important for agencies that award aid, as the main justification for public intervention is the presence of R&D-related market failures, which are associated with: (1) the incomplete appropriability of technological results due to knowledge spillovers and the existing gap between private and public return, and (2) the cost of capital when the innovation financer and the investor are not the same agents. In this sense, both the conditions and the effects of public support can be affected by the business cycle. Therefore, an additional and key question is whether the impact of public aid differs over the business cycle and is less or more effective in adverse economic conditions. Before the recent financial crisis, the hypothesis of full crowding out of private R&D was rejected in most previous empirical analyses (Becker 2015; David et al. 2000; Dimos and Pugh2016; García-Quevedo 2004; Zúñiga-Vicente et al. 2014). The scarce studies that analyse the effects of public support during the crisis focus mainly on public subsidies and offer heterogeneous results. Hud and Hussinger (2015) find a crowding out effect during the year 2009 for German firms. Aristei et al. (2017) reject both full and partial crowding out using firm-level data from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. However, they do not find evidence of additionality in any of the countries. For Spanish firms, Busom and Vélez-Ospina (2020) find that the effect of public support depends on the stage of the cycle, the duration of the support and the type of outcome indicator. The objective of the present study is to contribute to this literature by analysing the effect of one specific instrument of direct public support: selective loans for firms’ R&D projects.Footnote 1 The impact of this instrument may be different from the impact of subsidies during recessions at least for two reasons. First, the reimbursable character of loans makes them less attractive than subsidies for firms with high-risk projects because companies may have problems paying the principal back in the case of project failure. These problems could be even higher during recessions if the economic situation makes it more difficult for firms to profit from technological outcomes. Therefore, firms might show a lower propensity to apply for public loans in downturns than in upturns. Secondly, loans are also expected to impose more discipline on awarded firms than subsidies because loan programs usually imply more monitoring of project development by public agencies, which results in more efficiency that turns in a higher generation of innovations (Huergo and Trenado 2010). This monitoring may increase in downturns because public aid for R&D must compete in public budgets with other public spending items and, consequently, policy makers are expected to develop a more efficient implementation of R&D support. For our objective, we use information provided by the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI). This organism is the main public agency in Spain that grants financial aid of its own to companies for the execution of R&D projects. We combine information about firms supported through CDTI programmes for the periods 2002–2005 (years of expansion) and 2010–2012 (years of recession) with data provided by the Spanish Institute of Statistics (INE) about non-supported firms from the Spanish Technological Innovation Survey (the Spanish version of the CIS). Although the main objectives of CDTI loan programmes have remained constant during the last few decades, funding conditions and requirements on guarantees have partially changed between the two periods considered for our analysis. These changes basically consist of improving funding conditions while at the same time asking for more real guarantees in the years of recession. Therefore, one additional contribution of our paper is that we examine whether these changes in the design of the support programme made to face the economic crisis favour the maintenance of innovation results during the downturn. In our analysis, we focus on the effect of public loans not only on R&D expenditures, but also on a wide set of innovation inputs and outputs. Impact assessment is conducted using “matching” techniques. Our results suggest that public support has a positive effect on the resources devoted to R&D activities regardless of the phase of the cycle. However, although there is output additionality through the business cycle, the effect on technological outputs differs: during the expansion (crisis) period, firms are more likely to obtain process (product) innovations. One distinguishing feature of our results is that they have been interpreted in coherence with the evolution of the instrument and taking into account the objectives of the policy makers. Therefore, conclusions could be applied to the design of public programmes, especially in recession periods. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature.

Nevertheless, macro models in this tradition still face some important theoretical puzzles. Among them, the emergence of Harrodian instability (H-I) is certainly one of the most relevant. H-I, as originally stated in Harrod (1939), arise when moving from a static Keynesian model with exogenous investment rates to a dynamic framework in which investments have a capacity-creating effect. The main intuition is that firms, in response to a demand shock, will increase (or decrease) their investment rates in order to adjust their capital stock to the new level of demand. However, as investments are a key component of aggregated demand, this will further amplify the initial shock, driving the economy away from the equilibrium. This paper studies the emergence of H-I in the so-called neo-Kaleckian (N-K) model (Rowthorn 1981; Dutt 1984) and presents a novel approach to deal with instability adopting an agent-based methodology. More specifically, we build a simple agent-based version of the N-K model with decentralized investment decisions.Footnote 1 Agents are assumed to modify their expectations about future demand in an adaptive way and heterogeneity is introduced by idiosyncratic shocks. In such context, we address some important questions concerning: (i) the impact of heterogeneity, learning and adaptation upon the stability properties of the model; (ii) the nature of growth, whether it is still demand-driven or not; (iii) the presence of macroeconomic paradoxes (i.e. the paradox of thrift and the paradox of costs); (iv) the characteristics of the process governing the evolution of aggregate capacity utilization. Solving the instability problem would entail greater consistency of the model allowing researchers to make more robust inference and policy analyses. This is why many works have been focusing on H-I (cf. the literature review in Sect. 2.2). As a matter of fact, the common approach to deal with H-I so far relies on modifications of the aggregate investment function (see e.g., Lavoie 1995; Allain 2015). Many of those efforts, however, have been criticized from different angles and there is still an open debate on how to consistently cope with H-I (Hein et al. 2011, 2012). At the same time, no systematic efforts have been made to adopt a more granular perspective and to investigate the role of heterogeneous expectations. Here we try to fill this gap by relying on parsimonious agent-based microfoundations of expectation dynamics and investment decisions.Footnote 2 The agent-based approach is well suited to our purposes. This is because of the great flexibility of agent-based models (ABMs) which entails the possibility to study coordination problems among agents exhibiting different degrees of rationality. More generally, ABMs describe the economy as a complex evolving system whose aggregate dynamics emerges as a result of decentralized interactions among boundedly rational, heterogeneous agents.Footnote 3 These features are directly related to the problem of H-I. In fact, as it will be argued (cf. Sect. 2.1), H-I emerges as a coordination failure when firms use adaptive expectations to forecast future demand growth. In particular, H-I originates from entrepreneurs inability to internalize demand externalities associated with new investments.Footnote 4 Simulation results reveal some interesting patterns. As a first exercise, we simulate our economy removing heterogeneity and show that results are symmetrical to the aggregate N-K model, i.e. H-I emerges when firms are allowed to adapt their expectations. Then, we introduce idiosyncratic random prediction errors to demand expectations. In this second scenario aggregate dynamics becomes stable. The evolution of national capacity utilization, consistently with the empirical evidence (Nikiforos 2016), is described by an I(1) process which do not exhibit any strong deterministic trending behaviour.Footnote 5 At the same time, the economy is shown to preserve all the features found in Keynesian growth models, including the endogeneity of utilization rates and the presence of the paradoxes of thrift and costs. Since prediction errors are transitory, expectations are still linked to the evolution of demand, thus, avoiding the possibility of systematic forecasting mistakes. Differently from the baseline N-K model, expectations will tend to gravitate around the trend value of demand. However, our results suggest that purely mechanical adaptive adjustments cannot be sustained in the model whereas some idiosyncratic biases are needed in order to get a stable macrodynamics. In a complex environment characterized by strong interactions among agents (i.e. demand externalities in our specific case), departures from more rational behaviours appear to curb unstable tendencies. The intuition underlying these results is rather simple: when heterogeneity is introduced, optimistic firms will coexist with pessimistic ones. Investment decisions cease to be symmetrical and uni-directional. As a consequence, in response to a shock, entrepreneurs will not coordinate anymore towards ever-rising (-decreasing) investment levels. Considered the simple nature of the model, the main contribution of this work remains methodological rather than descriptive. We stress the crucial role played by heterogeneity and individual biases in stabilizing the system as they can break self-reinforcing patterns of bad coordination. More efforts should be devoted to the implementation of these features in post-Keynesian models. Finally, well in tune with the works of Keynes himself, they also show the importance of complexity-based microfoundations which are able generate intriguing macroeconomic phenomena as emergent properties of the system. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discusses H-I in the standard N-K model and presents an overview of the existing literature; Sect. 3 introduces the model; results and sensitivity tests are reported in Sect. 4; finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Sanchez Carrera,Giuseppe Travaglini,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Total factor productivity (TFP) is the exogenous residual that results from the decomposition of GDP growth (Solow 1957). TFP is generally interpreted as a proxy for technological advancement and productivity, as it also captures the efficiency with which labor and capital are used in production to generate products (Romer 1990). The seminal articles by Prescott (1998) and Edmund (2001) highlight the role of TFP in explaining the income dynamics of countries, as well as differences in international trade, social capital and R&D. Prescott (1998) pointed out, the standard theory of economic growth first needs to analyze the determinants of TFP to also become a theory of international income differences. However, despite its great relevance from a theoretical point of view, there is still no widely shared theory about TFP. The main motivation of the paper is to deepen our understanding of the factors driving TFP in the long run. We focus on a panel of five major European economies, i.e. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK. We attempt to explain their TFP patterns over the period 1983–2017. By establishing a link among capital misallocation, scale effects and labor misallocation, we show that real prices and labor regulation may have permanent, and sometime adverse effects, on the evolution of TFP in the long run. This is the main contribution of the paper since traditionally the research efforts on TFP have been directed toward technological factors thus leaving out the role of prices. We get two main results. First, the interest rate, the elasticity of saving, the real compensation and the real exchange rate have a positive impact on TFP. Second, the incidence of temporary employment (a proxy of labor market flexibility) has a negative effect on TFP in the long run. Finally, for robustness, we run a panel VECM to check for causalities among variables. Notably, from our empirical analysis emerges a strong and positive long-run relationship between TFP and real prices. In addition, we derive some intriguing policy implications for the main European economies. Eurozone has shown, over the last 10 years, a marked asymmetry in the pattern and size of economic growth, which appear to be unsustainable in the long run. The identification of common policies for exchange rate, labour cost, regulation, monetary policy, and their possible diversity among countries, can instead allow to reassemble the European puzzle. In fact, equipping any single countries, like those studied in this paper, and their overall set, with coordinated policies— differentiated or shared—is crucial to strengthen the European economic structure, also in the light of the current COVID-19 health emergency. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present a comprehensive review of the literature. Section 2 introduces our database and some stylized facts. In Sects. 3 and 4 we run the empirical model and focus on the main results and policy implications. Finally Sect. 5 concludes with some policy implications.",6

38,2,Economia Politica,15 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-020-00188-3,Media bias against women in music: an empirical analysis of Italian music magazines,July 2021,Andrea Mangani,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Cameron (2003) demonstrated that women are underrepresented in the musical arts, as also emerges in a number of studies on the participation of female artists in a variety of musical fields (classical music, jazz, rock and pop). The economic and socio-psychological literature has discussed the major reasons for such a disparity in relation to music as well as to other forms of artistic expression (Cowen 1996). Some professionals in the music industry argue that genetic differences make women less suited than men to musical composition or execution. Although this hypothesis does not go beyond sparse, personal opinions, biological differences are the source of another reason for the disparity, that is, the maternal and family role of women. Women tend to devote more time to their children than men do, which then reduces the probability of gaining success as a composer, artist or orchestra leader (Cameron 2015). Discrimination is the third and probably the most debated reason for the quantitative disproportion between men and women in the music business. Gender discrimination can arise at different stages of a professional career. First, the training opportunities are unequal. Starting from an equal potential, women and men do not have access to the same psychological and economic “support” to develop their skills (Cowen 1996). In addition, gender discrimination can affect the relationships between female musicians and colleagues, employers, listeners and consumers. For example, consumers (men or women) might appreciate the music performed by men more than music by women (consumer discrimination). Several studies have analyzed the empirical significance of these forms of gender discrimination (Milestone and Meyer 2012). Unequal opportunities and consumers’ perception seem to prevail over other explanations of discrimination, although there is no established consensus regarding the main reason for the gender disparity in music (Cameron 2003). Whatever the prevalent reason for the under-representation of women in music, the actual disparity can trigger a vicious circle (as in many other industries; Chichilnisky 2008). Many women (and their families) interested in undertaking a musical career may perceive a kind of hostility within the music business, and thus may decide to consider other fields in order to attain professional gratification (O’Brian 2002). This would further reduce the percentage of women involved in the music business (Pendle and Boyd 2005). A negative attitude of the mass media towards women in music can reinforce this vicious circle. In fact, the mass media play a crucial role in shaping consumers’ perception of female participation in the music industry. The mass media are the primary source of information regarding the release of a new record or live performance. On the one hand, media reviews and reports can influence those who already have a gender prejudice (consumers, listeners, etc.); on the other, a negative review can affect those women who are considering the pros and cons of a musical career. If the mass media confirm the (inferior) public status of women pursuing a career in music, the barriers to entry in the music markets will be reinforced for female artists. Of course, a negative gender media bias can be involuntary. Gender discrimination has historical, economic and socio-cultural roots whose strength affects the individual’s unconscious, which may be reflected in a journalist’s work. This paper studies the potential media bias against women in music from a quantitative and qualitative point of view.Footnote 1 The empirical analysis of 2022 journalists’ reviews published in two Italian music magazines regarding 1928 international albums released between 2003 and 2015 estimates the influence of gender characteristics on the extent and attitude of the reviews. The analysis takes into account the musical genre, the gender composition of the bands, the personal characteristics of the artists (experience, nationality), the type of magazine that published the reviews, and the sex of the journalists who wrote the reviews. The main result is that gender affects the length and the quality of the reviews, but the magnitude of the effect is not strong. Another interesting finding is that female journalists tend to disfavor “female” albums more than male journalists. This paper is related to that branch of the sociology of music that explores the role and image of women in the most popular forms of contemporary music. Several scholars have shown that the association between masculinity and pop-rock music is produced and maintained by institutions, practices and discourses (Walser 1993; Whiteley 1997). This association has important consequences on the division of labor within the music industry (Negus 1992; Frith and McRobbie 2006). “Objective” asymmetries have a significant impact on the behaviour of the audience and the artists, both in the “mainstream” and “independent” music industries (Leonard 2007). The gender disparity is then reflected in the specialized press, especially when it deals with technical issues (Frith and McRobbie 2006). On the one hand, the artists do not neglect nor underestimate how the mass media perceive their music, and some musicians deliberately try to combat the conventional chauvinist approach of media outlets (Negus 1998). On the other, the entry of women into the music industry is affected by a number of institutional conditions that tend to perpetuate the masculinity within the entire industry. This situation was described in the late 1970s and is still evident today (Hawkins 2017). Although sociologists have conducted most research in these issues, this paper addresses different audiences within the academic community of economists. First, many economic scholars have shown great interest in media bias, especially when it has economic causes and/or consequences. Media economics is an established field of research, and media bias is among the most debated issues in the field. Second, this paper is related to all economic studies regarding labor-market discrimination. In particular, the paper joins all the studies that explore what can generate gender disparity and gender discrimination within a market. Although this paper does not investigate any specific labor market, it assumes that media gender bias can affect gender disparities within several industries. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the data sources, the sample construction and the descriptive statistics. Section 3 shows the results of the main empirical analysis, in quantitative and qualitative terms. The last section discusses the limitations of the paper and considers future work.",

According to a survey by European Commission (2017), more than 70% of Europeans believe that ‘robots and artificial intelligence steal peoples’s jobs’. Even though the topic of job displacement following technological progress is anything but new in economics (Keynes 1930; Leontief 1952)Footnote 1 and these concerns have not materialized so far in the long run (Bessen et al. 2020), there are worries that things could be different this time as the next waves of automation will occur at unprecedented rates on comparable scales (Dobbs et al. 2015; Frey and Osborne 2017).Footnote 2 From a theoretical point of view, however, the impact of robots on employment is not clear a priori as it involves forces moving in opposite directions (Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018): if, on the one hand, robot technology is first-order labour-saving in certain tasks, on the other hand it can enhance productivity, reduce prices and thereby increase demand. In addition, demand-enhancing effects may extend to other connected markets for goods and services (Dosi et al. 2019; Barbieri et al. 2019); the introduction of robots may also increase the demand for complementary non-automatable tasks (Autor 2015) or even create new tasks (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019).Footnote 3 Whether the net effect of robots on employment is positive, neutral or negative is thus essentially an empirical issue. In this paper this question is addressed for the case of Italy following approaches used in two previous researches that focused on the US (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2020) and on Germany (Dauth et al. 2018), finding contrasting results. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) find that the displacement effect prevails as commuting zones more exposed to robots end up with worse outcomes, in terms of both employment and wages. Conversely, Dauth et al. (2018) find no effect on overall employment in Germany since the negative effect emerging in manufacturing turns out to be fully compensated by the positive effect in other sectors. Against this background, Italy is an interesting case to enrich the evidence available as the use of robots in this country is neither negligible nor new. Indeed, Italy has been steadily ranked second after Germany among European countries since the early 1990s for operational stock of robots (IFR 2018). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to address the long-term impact of robots on employment specifically for Italy. Previously, Italy was included in some cross-country studies (Chiacchio et al. 2018; Graetz and Michaels 2018) but, as suggested by the contrasting evidence found by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) and Dauth et al. (2018), the employment effect of robots might be country-specific (Gentili et al. 2020). Following the approach developed by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020), the first part of the analysis adopts a local-level perspective to assess whether local labour markets (LLM) experienced different employment dynamics between 1991 and 2016 depending on their different exposure to robots. This perspective takes into account that the impact of robots is uneven within a country (OECD 2018): since industries are not uniformly localized and as they differ in how much they can automatize production, the impact of robot diffusion could be asymmetric not only across sectors but also across regions, with significant policy implications for the labour market, income distribution and regional economies.Footnote 4 Moreover, the local-level analysis allows spillover and indirect general equilibrium effects to be embedded, thus being informative about the ultimate net effect. The LLM exposure to robots is measured by exploiting heterogeneity in robot use across industries and heterogeneity in the initial industry distribution of local employment: specifically, the exposure is given by a weighted average of the robot diffusion by industry with weights equal to the initial share of each industry in the local employment. The estimation strategy takes into account that the variation in the number of robots may be endogenous to demand shocks also affecting employment, and that it can be correlated with concurrent trends that may impact employment evolution or its distribution across industries. In particular, these issues are tackled by taking advantage of information on robot use in other advanced European countries to construct instrumental variables. This is aimed at capturing supply-side and technological factors, while purging from demand and place-specific factors. In addition, following Dauth et al. (2018), two important macro trends occurring in the period—such as the increasing trade with China and Eastern Europe (Autor et al. 2013) and the diffusion of ICT technology—are controlled for, as well as the initial differences in the stage of the structural change process relating to the diminishing long-term trend in the employment share of manufacturing (Wren 2013). From this analysis, no evidence emerges of a systematic and statistically significant impact of higher robot exposure on overall employment growth, nor on the change in the employment to population ratio. When employment is split between manufacturing and other sectors, the coefficient for manufacturing employment is negative, but its statistical significance is not strong, especially when the concurrent trade and ICT shocks are controlled for. For non-manufacturing employment the effect is largely insignificant. In this part of the analysis, this study also provides a methodological contribution with respect to Dauth et al. (2018) through a thorough investigation of the identification strategy based on the shift and share design, as advocated by the recent literature on the validity of this technique (Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. 2020; Borusyak et al. 2020) and similarly to what done by Caselli et al. (2020) in a study about the effects of globalization and robotization on electoral outcomes. This kind of analysis—which allows to open the “black-box” of the shift and share design—is particularly worth carrying out in this context as the use of robots is concentrated in a small number of sectors. It is shown that the shift (the growth components) is highly relevant for identification and that a high Rotemberg weight is associated to the automotive sector.Footnote 5 Using different approaches and several model specifications, evidence is provided that the baseline results are not crucially due to specific effects of this industry. The second part of the analysis provides a contribution with respect to Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020), by exploiting longitudinally linked worker-level data from matched employer–employee administrative datasets. This information is particularly useful to assess the impact of robots at the individual level, both for incumbents and for new workers. So far the available evidence based on administrative matched employer–employee data is relatively scant, though after Dauth et al. (2018) the use of this kind of data has been growing fast (Bessen et al. 2019; Aghion et al. 2020; Acemoglu et al. 2020). At first, the focus is on incumbent workers (i.e.: workers that were initially employed) in manufacturing and on their employment outcomes in terms of cumulated days worked, cumulated earnings and average wages in the following 23 years. Compared with the local level approach, which cannot say anything about adjustment at the individual level, this approach allows to track how career patterns respond to robot exposure. In this case, the identification exploits industry heterogeneity in robot exposure, after netting out confounding effects relating to observable characteristics of workers, firms and geographical areas. Heterogeneous effects with respect to gender, age, area, initial earnings and occupation are also explored. The results show that workers in industries with higher robot exposure ended up being employed for longer, although the effect is small from an economic point of view. This translates into higher cumulated earnings, while the effect on average wages is not statistically different from zero. These positive impacts are driven by outcomes at the original firm, for which the positive effect also extends to wages, though its size is not economically high.Footnote 6 Conditional on leaving the original employer, the employment effect is negative (though modest) and a positive wage effect only emerges for workers remaining in the original industry. An interpretation of these results could be based on the existence of firm-specific complementarities between workers’ on-the-job experience/knowledge and the implementation of robots in the process of production, so that being in a sector that is more exposed to robots may positively affect the duration of the relationship with the same firm.Footnote 7 The third part of the analysis deals with the issue of how robot exposure has affected the inflows of new workers. Worker-level data and the LLM-level approach are combined to construct a measure of the likelihood of entering a sector at the LLM level, and study how it changed between 1993 and 2016. The results show that relative inflows have been systematically lower in areas and industries more exposed to robots. This suggests that an employment effect of robots could have worked through a contribution to the redistribution of the new labour force across sectors. As robot exposure is higher in manufacturing, these findings are reconciled with the evidence of a relatively more negative effect on manufacturing employment found in the first part. Based on these estimates, robot exposure could account for about one fifth of the decrease in the manufacturing share of new workers’ inflows. All in all, this evidence draws a picture for Italy more similar to Germany than to the US, since the results are more in line with the less pessimistic ones in Dauth et al. (2018), rather than with the displacement effects found by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020). This could also be related to the higher similarity of the Italian economy to Germany rather than the US, in terms of institutional settings (with a higher employment protection), economic structure (with a relatively higher weight of manufacturing) and sectoral distribution of robots (as described in Sect. 4). These results are also in line with the (non-causal) evidence recently provided by Klenert et al. (2020) of a non-negative relationship between robots and employment in 14 European countries (including Italy).Footnote 8 While this evidence is not necessarily informative for the upcoming years, especially if the use of robots undergoes an acceleration, it is at least reassuring as regards its impact so far. Besides Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) and Dauth et al. (2018), this paper relates to other studies based on robot data provided by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) in a cross-country framework. Graetz and Michaels (2018), while focusing mainly on the effect of robots on productivity, found that robot density had no significant effect on aggregate hours worked and a negative effect only for the low-skilled workers.Footnote 9 Chiacchio et al. (2018), based on regional data from six European countries including Italy, estimate a negative effect of robots on the employment rate, while no significant effect is found for wages; the estimated magnitude of the impact is lower than in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) and the authors connect this attenuation to the higher employment protection in Europe. As in Graetz and Michaels (2018), the analysis stops in 2007, also because of structural breaks due to sector reclassifications. Like Dauth et al. (2018), the present paper extends the analysed period up until recent years, as advocated by Barbieri et al. (2019), by adopting a cross-walk for industry classifications that remains consistent both internally and with the IFR industry categories. Evidence for recent years at international level is provided by Chen and Nabar (2018) and Carbonero et al. (2018). Chen and Nabar (2018) find a negative relationship between robots and employment from 2010 to 2014 for advanced countries that experienced higher output losses during the economic crisis. Conversely, Carbonero et al. (2018) find a more negative impact for emerging economies, associated with a reduction in off-shoring for advanced countries. Using industry-state-year observations in the US, Borjas and Freeman (2019) compare the employment and wage effects of robots with those of immigration flows. Though measuring robot exposure differently from Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020), they confirm a negative impact of robots on US employment.Footnote 10 As IFR data are aggregated at industry and national level, a recent stream of literature has looked at other sources in order to find information on robot use at the firm level, as advocated by Raj and Seamans (2019). In particular, firm-level data have been taken from survey data (Koch et al. 2019; Bessen et al. 2019), fiscal and administrative data (Acemoglu et al. 2020) or they were derived from proxies such as imports (Dixon et al. 2019; Bonfiglioli et al. 2020) or electricity consumption for motor power (Aghion et al. 2020). The results are mixed: Bonfiglioli et al. (2020) and Bessen et al. (2019) find negative effects on firm employment once the spurious positive correlation induced by demand effects is netted out. On the other hand, Dixon et al. (2019) for Canada and Koch et al. (2019) for Spain find a positive impact for firms introducing robots. Koch et al. (2019) also find a negative effect on competing non-adopting firms; Acemoglu et al. (2020) for France obtain similarly contrasting results between adopters and non-adopters but with prevailing negative effects, a finding in contrast with the net positive effect found for the same country by Aghion et al. (2020). Concerning France, a positive effect of automation on employment is also detected by Domini et al. (2020), based on firm-level data on imports of automation-intensive capital goods by manufacturing firms. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: in Sect. 2 the empirical strategy is presented and discussed; Sect. 3 describes the data and how they are implemented into the analysis; Sect. 4 provides a descriptive analysis about robots in Italy, also in comparison with other countries; results are presented in Sect. 5, which is organized in three subsections for the analysis of local employment, incumbent workers and entrant shares, respectively. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",11

Most efforts at the intersection of these two strands of work try to identify a one-way direction of causation. Most studies provide in-depth analysis of the relationships between either export and innovation or innovation and export and tend to overlook their dual and bidirectional causality, that is innovation is both the cause and the consequence of exports. This paper applies the Schumpeterian creative response framework to understand the determinants of their spiraling relationship. The empirical evidence confirms a positive effect of exports on the capability to introduce and adopt timely innovations: (i) entry into international markets has a positive demand-pull effect (Rivera Batiz & Romer, 1991; Woerter & Roper, 2010); (ii) the share of sales earmarked for export is a reliable measure of the intensity of rivalry (Aghion et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2017); and (iii) learning opportunities in international product markets arise from interactions with advanced rivals and sophisticated users and customers (Andersson & Lööf, 2009; Fassio, 2018). Active engagement in international product markets has positive effects on innovation capability and rates of adoption of new technologies. However, there is also empirical evidence confirming that compared with non-exporters, exporters achieve higher performance (Cassiman et al., 2010; Dosi et al., 2015; Greenaway & Kneller, 2007; Guarascio & Pianta, 2017; Wagner, 2007). The ability to export is based on better productivity and efficiency. There is ample evidence of a causal relationship between productivity and the share of sales going to international product markets. Firms better able to introduce and adopt suitable innovations and increase their productivity are able to achieve a larger share of the international product market. The literature and the empirical evidence would seem to accommodate two possible causal relationships. Some claim that innovation promotes, while others maintain that exports promote innovation. These scholars often reduce endogeneity problems by identifying specific settings but this does not provide a thorough understanding of these complex, bi-directional phenomena. This paper attempts to redress this. Both of the approaches proposed in the literature and the supporting empirical evidence can be integrated within a single Schumpeterian frame which predicts a two-way, typically bidirectional relationship between exports and innovation, which includes the characteristics of a spiraling loop aligned along a sequence (Guarascio et al., 2015). The Schumpeterian creative response approach allows the exploration of the systemic microeconomic determinants of this dynamic and spiraling characteristic, in which the endogeneity of each variable is part of a self-supporting sequence. Firms involved in endogenous technological change intentionally switch their technologies, which promotes broad dynamic processes that can fuel self-supporting feedback spirals between innovation and performance (Audretsch et al., 2019; Link & Siegel, 2007). The Schumpeterian legacy provides the basic tools required to understand how these loops operate. According to Schumpeter (1947), firms exposed to unexpected changes in their product and factor markets may try to cope by introducing and adopting technological changes. Their adoption then triggers new waves of changes to product and factor markets, but also to the system of knowledge interactions which provide access to, and enable use of, the stocks of technological knowledge that triggered the creative response. In a global economy, this creative response includes the international product markets. Provided the firm can undertake the levels of innovation required to increase the rate of technological change, exporting allows for increased productivity. In turn, countries with high levels of productivity achieve improved export performance. Integrating the Schumpeterian creative response with the dynamics of international exporting captures the sequential and endogenous relationship between exports and innovation. If the context is conducive, each is the consequence of the other. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and formulates our hypotheses predicting a two-way loop systemic relationship between innovation and export within a Schumpeterian creative response framework. Section 3 presents the empirical test using evidence for the manufacturing industries of 13 OECD countries over 21 years from 1995 to 2015. Section 4 summarizes the results and stresses the idea of a Schumpeterian loop to explain the interdependent dynamics of exports, innovation and productivity.",2

Perhaps it is not only a watershed but also a point of no return. At the Eurozone level, the problems of insufficient performance on the demand side, which were clearly apparent even before the Covid-19 crisis, have been joined by problems of inefficiency on the supply side, hence by problems of coordination between demand and supply. Moreover, on considering the economic effects of the prolonged duration of the pandemic and the level of public expenditure planned in the USA, it cannot be excluded that the fiscal expansions provided until now in Europe could prove insufficient. What is at stake in this new Covid and post-Covid scenario is twofold. On the one hand, the gaps opened by the fall in income due to repeated waves and subsequent lockdowns must be filled. On the other hand, filling those gaps cannot always leverage on re-establishment of the ‘old normal’: the issue emerges of the investments required by a deep re-infrastructuring of the EU economy, since the restart of production to close the gaps will entail structural changes as well as redefinition of the relationships among sectors (Baldwin & Evenett, 2020; Bamber et al., 2020; Fornaro & Wolf, 2020; Gereffi, 2020). The Covid crisis has been generated by a symmetrical and completely exogenous shock; but it has had, and will continue to have, largely asymmetrical effects. This is particularly relevant in the EU and in the Eurozone, where integration mechanisms have never included the common financing of public debts in the name of a strict fiscal policy discipline and of a rigid notion of convergence (see Table 1). Since the inception of the euro, this has meant the exclusion of any mutualisation and transfer mechanism intended to absorb asymmetric shocks. The exceptional nature of the present situation and its likelihood of being a point of no return have highlighted the need for new ways to finance a fiscal manoeuvre unprecedented in scale and scope. Hence policy views that were unthinkable before the emergency became commonly shared. In countries in which the circuit with the central bank and treasury is already in operation, the shift to the ‘new normal’ has been smoother. For the Eurozone, it has implied more dramatic changes: in short, suspension of the ‘old normal’. Undoubtedly, the debate on public debt and its financing, as well as on the role that sovereign debts can play within economies and financial markets, has begun to be revisited. Once again, the shift has been more dramatic in the EU context, where the previous public debt crisis was tackled with few and only temporary deviations from the procedures dictated by financial orthodoxy. Nowadays, orthodox approach is considered insufficient and dangerous by many economists (Baldwin & Di Mauro, 2020; Blanchard & Brancaccio, 2019; Blanchard & Leigh, 2013; Cerniglia & Saraceno, 2020; De Grauwe, 2013; Fatás & Summers, 2018). It is precisely those deviations, their amplification and their ‘institutionalization’ that are now at stake. We are in a situation in which some radical decisions, taken first by the ECB, and then also by the European Commission (EC), seem to evidence not only the technical feasibility of a reform, but also the political will to change some central aspects of political and monetary union. In this perspective, an institution intended to efficiently perform the common management of the Eurozone debt would prove not only fundamental for the future of the Eurozone, but also, as we shall show, would have proved fundamental since its inception. Let us start with a quick update on the situation. The European response to the Covid-19 shock has taken various forms, but in all cases, it has shown an increasingly decisive orientation of the EU institutions (in particular the Commission, but also the ECB) towards a progressive extension of the scale and scope of the instruments put in place. As regards the European Commission, the process began with suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact and an initial aid package of around 540 billion euros. It comprised: (i) the possibility for Member States to obtain loans from the European Stability Mechanism for a maximum amount of about 2% GDP in 2019, with light conditionality, for health-related expenditure; (ii) enhancement of the ability of the European Investment Bank to grant loans to businesses of up to 200 billion euros; and (iii) the activation of the SURE (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) programme for 100 billion euros. Concerning the financing of these new tools, a debate has arisen in which some economists and practitioners have proposed the issue of sovereign perpetuities (Giavazzi & Tabellini, 2020; Soros, 2020). In the wake of this debate, proposals have also been made by Member States, like the Spanish one, for instance (Reuters, 2020). Eventually, the European Council formulated a proposal to establish a Recovery Fund (also called NextGenerationEU) of 750 billion euros. After the negotiations in July 2020, the fund provided for the disbursement of 390 billion euros in subsidies and 360 billion euros in loans. Subsequently, specific programmes under the long-term budget for 2021–2027 were reinforced by 15 billion euros. Even if we are already in the phase in which the money will begin to be disbursed, the Recovery Fund, notwithstanding two important innovations, still involves a ‘great unknown’. The innovations are (i) that it will be directly financed by the markets through the issue of common bonds directly backed by the EU budget; and (ii) that it will involve some kind of mutualisation, since the disbursements of subsidies to individual countries will not respect their contribution to the establishment of the fund and to the European budget. The ‘great unknown’ is the temporary vs. definitive nature of the operations envisaged by the fund, and therefore the temporary vs. definitive nature of the instruments provided to finance it. What we know for now is that the common bonds issued to finance the NGEU will have different maturities, and that the commitment is to repay them in full by 2058, with instalments starting from 2028 (ECB, 2020c). In this regard, the European Gordian knot is still untied. Despite this uncertainty, the demand expressed by the markets for those common bonds has been very high since the first issuances (EC, 2020). This is proof that the potential demand for European safe assets is very high, and that these common bonds are already considered as European safe assets. Therefore, there are good economic and institutional reasons to methodically approach the question of the possible rollover of the common debt, and to provide innovative operational solutions. Issues relating to the safe asset, with or without mutualization, and its potential rollover, are also closely linked to considerations concerning the possible synergy between fiscal and monetary policy. Because the expansions of public deficits required by a pandemic will not be reabsorbed quickly, the expansion of public spending will probably become a permanent element of the post Covid-19 scenario. Hence, the problem arises of optimizing the management of fiscal spaces at the level of the entire EU and of the Eurozone. This scenario raises the issue of mutualisation and of moral hazard, at least as regards fiscal policy within a monetary union (Arnold et al., 2018; Batini et al., 2020; Beetsma et al., 2018; Berger et al., 2019). This is crucial because, depending on how it is resolved, the issue will affect the overall expansion of the fiscal space in the EU. Furthermore, if the issuing of common bonds were to become permanent and were financed with common tax revenues, a problem would arise concerning the European debt ratio with respect to outstanding and future national debts. As regards monetary policy, given the growing amount of cumulated public debts, it is likely that the ECB will stably assume an active role, with all that this entails in terms of the interpretation of its statutory mandate. To date, the ECB has strengthened the targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and activated targeted long-term refinancing operations linked to the pandemic emergency (PELTRO) at subsidized rates.Footnote 1 As for the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will continue its purchases with a total envelope of € 1,850 billion. Here too an important novelty emerges: unlike the PSPP, the PEPP involves an abandonment of the capital key rule. This abandonment was declared non-permanent, but at the same time it proved to be a necessary condition for the governance of spreads on financial markets. Also in this case, therefore, there is a problem concerning future orientations. Depending on how the issue is resolved, the potential of monetary policy and the conditions of debt sustainability for Member States, and indirectly also for the common debt, will change (ECB, 2020a, 2021). In any case, the mix of fiscal expansion (increased debts) recorded to date, combined with the monetary support for its financing (ECB role) highlights a structural problem that gripped the Eurozone even before the pandemic, and especially after the sovereign debt crisis: that is, the problem of a European safe asset (a “safe Eurobond”) able to support the stability of financial markets in times of turmoil (Beck et al., 2011; Bonnevay, 2010; Bruegel, 2020; Brunnermeier et al., 2011, 2017; De Grauwe & Moesen, 2009; Delpla & von Weizsacker, 2010, 2011; Dosi et al., 2018; Giudice et al., 2019; Gros & Micossi, 2009; Hellwig & Philippon, 2011; Juncker & Tremonti, 2010; Leandro & Zettelmeyer, 2018a; Monti, 2010; Ubide, 2015).Footnote 2 At stake are the nature of both common bonds and the issuer thereof, as well as the structural conditions of their financeability. Some important steps have already been taken in the direction of new tools and perspectives for EU integration, so that one may speak of “tools of a surrogated federalism” (Saraceno, 2020). However, as far as public debt is concerned, a structural solution continues to be needed. This solution must deal not only with the possible issue of common European bonds, but also with the common management of the national debts accumulated so far, since they will not decrease for a long time yet, alongside the likely growing quota of common debt. Absent an outright federalist solution, the institution that could take on this task, issuing in return a full-fledged European safe asset, could be what we call here a ‘European Debt Agency’. As we shall show in more depth later, this project is compatible with many of the proposals that are under the policymakers’ scrutiny. In particular, it will be able to take over from them in the medium term by absorbing any one-off issue of common bonds. By sketching the essential features of a new institution, our paper intends to address all these issues, offering a structural solution and a methodological perspective for European integration on a collaborative, not competitive, basis. The paper is divided into five sections. The foregoing Sect. 1 has introduced the topic. The Sect. 2 briefly surveys the literature on safe assets and Eurobonds. The Sect. 3 describes our proposal in its institutional and technical details. The Sect. 4 deals with simulations, while the Sect. 5 is devoted to conclusions.",3
38,3,Economia Politica,30 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-021-00226-8,Immigration diversity and regional economic growth,October 2021,Claudio Di Berardino,Dario D’Ingiullo,Alfredo Cartone,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A recent stream of literature has presented compelling evidence of the significant role played by externally sourced knowledge on economic growth (Frankel & Romer, 1999; Keller, 2004; Prescott, 1998). A wealth of literature, in fact, is focused on the process of international knowledge diffusion, analysing the set of factors that affect the capability of a country to grow (Castellacci & Natera, 2013). Among the factors that influence the spread of knowledge across the globe, migration emerges as a crucial mechanism to promote knowledge diffusion by means of indirect channels of interaction (Andersen & Dalgaard, 2011; Bahar & Rapoport, 2018; Kang & Kim, 2018), together with more formal channels such as the cross-border flows of goods (international trade) and capital (FDI).Footnote 1 Migrants, becoming embedded at the local level of the receiving areas, represent natural carriers of tacit knowledge that can promote development in the host regions through their own set of intangible assets (D’Ambrosio et al., 2019; Parrilli et al., 2019). Migration flows, favoured by demographic elements and by socio-economic and institutional factors, have reached a significant dimension and enabled large-scale diffusion. Despite the fact that international immigration is at the forefront of economic and political debates, its impact on the host economy is still an open‐ended issue. The overall contribution of immigration to the growth of the host regions, besides being related to the share of immigrants over the resident population, could depend on other characteristics of these flows. Additional insights into the size effect of migration may be obtained by analysing the diversity of immigrants. Population heterogeneity is increasing in all advanced countries due to international immigration. It has been documented that the characteristics of immigration in terms of diversity could represent an element able to affect growth dynamics in the destinations (Alesina et al., 2003, 2016; Collier, 2001; Easterly & Levine, 1997; Ottaviano & Peri, 2006). Diversity can have a positive effect on output growth if a more diverse working-age population is associated with wider skills that in turn enable the production of a greater variety of goods and services (Alesina & La Ferrara, 2005). However, a more diverse population can also have detrimental effects on output growth if it is associated with increased social conflict and a reduction in the quality and quantity of public goods provision (Ager & Brückner, 2013). The present paper aims to contribute to the economic literature by providing an analysis of the peculiar features of international immigration towards the Italian provinces. We present an empirical assessment of the economic effects of immigration, distinguishing both the size (or share of immigrants) and the variety (or diversity of immigrants). The Italian context represents an interesting case study due to: (i) the wide number of origin countries of immigrants (not limited to few defined trajectories, often related to the colonial past), (ii) the higher territorial heterogeneity, (iii) the wide size of the involved phenomena, and (iv) the rapid increase of these flows. Among European countries, Italy has registered one of the widest increases in the stock of immigrants, which has risen five times since 1998 (Caritas Italiana, 2019). The increase in the number of new immigrants during the period 2007–2016 was equal to 2,023,317 (Istat, 2017). Migrants play an important role in Italy by offsetting the effects of negative demographic trends such as workforce ageing and decline, as well as more general depopulation. This is even more visible in the economy. According to the annual report on foreigners in the Italian labour market elaborated by the Italian Ministry of Labour (2018), “over the last few years, the foreign component in the labour market has become key in the Italian economy, not only because of the importance that foreign workers have had and continue to have in the performance of specific tasks, but also by virtue of the compensatory effect they have determined: […] up until 2015 [both] the EU and non-EU labour force have been able to offset the contraction of employment that affected the Italian component” (Italian Ministry of Labour, 2018, pp. 2–3). Furthermore, the high territorial heterogeneity which is present within the country could represent a further crucial factor for investigating the effects of international migration on economic growth. International knowledge diffusion, in fact, is a complex process involving the absorptive capacity of the receiving places, which is shaped by their level of development and their set of socio-economic and institutional characteristics (i.e., their level of education and social networking, see Castellacci & Natera, 2013; Williams, 2007; Williams & Baláž, 2014). Our empirical approach follows two conceptual steps. We first estimate the impact of the share and diversity of immigration on economic growth. Second, we investigate whether the economic effects of these two dimensions of international immigration differ across Centre-North and South provinces, areas characterised by different levels of development. Our contribution to the literature debate is therefore twofold. First, we find that the share of total immigrants plays a positive role for the regional economic growth. However, the diversity of immigration can also affect the growth dynamics, helping to explain the intra-national territorial disparities. The main findings seem to reveal that increases in birthplace fractionalisation significantly fostered output per capita, which is consistent with the argument that a greater diversity of the population increases output per capita by widening the variety of workers' skills and the variety of goods and services produced. Second, once we break down the set of host provinces on the basis of their level of development, only the Central-Northern provinces are those that benefit from the diversity of immigration. In contrast, for low-income provinces of the South of Italy, the most significant growth-enhancing effect is associated only with the share of foreign-born individuals. This suggests that diversity can be beneficial (or at least less detrimental) at higher levels of regional development (Alesina & La Ferrara, 2005). One potential explanation for this effect is that the beneficial consequences on the economic growth of the regions associated with the skills complementarities seem to occur only when the production processes are sufficiently diversified, as in Central-Northern provinces. The remainder of the paper is organised as follow. Section 2 provides the literature background. In Sects. 3 and 4, the descriptive analysis, the econometric model, and the results are presented. Section 5 concludes the paper.",3

However, the effect of GHGs on Earth might lead to an increase in temperatures of 3 \(^{\circ }\)C by 2050 (United Nations Climate Change Secretariat 2015), leading to catastrophic climatic changes globally. This also might lead to a reduction in economic output in developed and developing countries, and annual GDP growth might decrease by 2–4\(\%\) by 2040 and by 10\(\%\) by 2100. Therefore, a common global agenda is to reduce emission levels in both developed and developing countries without hampering economic progress (EEA 2019; Energy and Resources Institute 2019; UNDP 2021; UNEP 2011; UN 2020). Some policies developed in this regard involve funding technology transfer to the developing world and increasing the use of renewable energies (IEA 2018). Sustainable development and human development interconnections have developed a fruitful broad view on development strategies. The re-appearance of the Kuznets legacy, with the rise of the ‘Environmental Kuznets curve’ hypothesis, in the 90’s, interconnected environmental sustainability, development and inequality issues. In 1995, Grossman and Krueger (Grossman and Krueger 1995) extends the theory originally postulated by Simon KuznetsFootnote 1 and extents it to environmental degradation, assuming an inverted-U relationship between economic growth and the environment. In the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC),Footnote 2 the initial increase in per capita GDP is due to the shift of the workforce from agriculture to industry and causes an increase in pollution. Assuming that after a certain threshold of per capita income all basic needs are being met, contextually to a new shift to the services sector, a demand for environmental quality emerges and develops so that the supply side of the economy must adapt by introducing cleaner technologies. Technology is central also in the theoretical work of Brock and Scott Taylor (2010), which update Solow model of economic growth to incorporate technological progress in abatement. Within this framework, the relationship between climate change and economic development has been well studied (Grossman and Alan 1991; Grossman and Krueger 1995; Holtz-Eakin and Selden 1995; Carson 2010), and some extensive reviews can be found in (Borghesi 2000; Brock and Scott Taylor 2010; Uchiyama 2016). Additionally, the relationship between growth and emissions, including innovation, has been extensively used in the policy-making literature especially for developed countries (e.g. the Stern Review (Dietz 2011)). Researchers often assume that countries are similar when dealing with unobservable heterogeneity. From an econometric point of view, many methodologies have been developed from simple time-series methodologies to very complex ones using GAMS (Generalized Additive Models), Bayesian and heterogeneous estimators to tackle cross-sectional dependence (Musolesi et al. 2010; Mazzanti and Musolesi 2013, 2017). All of these works have shown the presence of strong forms of heterogeneity in developed countries.Footnote 3 This paper adopts a panel data model to account for this crucial heterogeneity. In our panel data model, cross-sectional units form a number of groups; within these groups, the slope coefficients are similar, but they vary across groups, and both the number of groups and individual group membership are unknown. This mode of determining the number of groups and group membership provides a new perspective on the EKC literature, with interesting insights for development and policy analyses. To analyse heterogeneity, we apply a recent classification method, the C-Lasso method, developed by (Su et al. 2016 [SSP (2016) hereafter] and Huang et al. 2020b [HJS (2020b) hereafter]). The methodology is pretty novel, as it provides a consistent estimator for unknown group structures and delivers oracle-efficient estimates for the coefficients of each group. We use data from 34 countries in our sample for a period of 1971–2015, and we conclude with two groups, revealing marked heterogeneity. Some diversified developmental patterns are evident from the data. Specifically, the effect of renewable energy consumption on gross domestic product is positive for one group and negative for the other. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review, Sect. 3 explains the panel structure model and C-lasso technique provided by SSP (2016), which are used for accounting for latent group structure across different countries within the time period 1971–2015, and Sect. 4 describes the data and the model employed. Section 5 provides the results and Sect. 6 concludes.",

They create competing divisions to which they delegate decisions about operative issues like production, and then they use a central office to audit the divisions and to make decisions about strategic issues like R&D (see Fligstein 1985). The most influential theories of the multidivisional form look inside the firm and say that this form allows the management to control the firm’s units better than a more centralized one (see, among others, Chandler 1990 and Williamson 1975). More recent theories look at how firms interact in the market, and claim that the multidivisional firm has a strategic advantage over the rivals. By creating one more division the firm induces its divisions to produce more in aggregate and its rivals’ divisions to produce less. The firm will sell its products at a lower price, but since it will also steal business from its rivals, it will make a larger profit. We find this effect in Corchón (1991), Polasky (1992), and in Corchón and Gonzalez-Maestre (2000). They assume that firms can create divisions at no cost, and show that each firm wants to create one division more than its rivals. The main implication is that firms tend to make a zero profit, because they tend to create an infinite number of divisions.Footnote 1 These theories interpret divisionalization, as well as similar practices like franchising and divestiture, as devices through which firms commit to be aggressive in the final market. Nonetheless, they ignore that firms make decisions also about other strategic issues besides the number of divisions. These issues may affect the firms’ returns to an additional division, and hence the firm’s decision to adopt the multidivisional form. In this paper I too assume that firms can create divisions at no cost, but I also allow them to do R&D so as to reduce their divisions’ marginal cost. I model R&D as a binary variable, and I assume that by doing R&D a firm obtains a drastic innovation, such that if the rival does no R&D then the rival’s divisions will exit the market. Then a firm that chooses how many divisions to create deals with the combined effect that one more division has on competition in the final market, through entry and business stealing, and on competition for that market, through R&D. I show that the simple option to do R&D makes the incentive to create a division fall, and that this effect can be strong enough that the firms give up the multidivisional form. I examine a three-stage game in which (i) two firms choose how many divisions they create, (ii) then they also choose whether to do R&D, and (iii) using the technology that results from R&D, the firms’ divisions compete in the market. I provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium such that (a) each firm creates the same finite number of divisions, and (b) in specific subgames, which I call the kernel states of the game, the firms make pure decisions about R&D (in the remainder of this section I will call a Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium with those properties simply an equilibrium). For every positive integer \( n^{*}\) I also provide conditions for a unique equilibrium in which each firm creates \(n^{*}\) divisions, and I determine the firms’ strategies. The main point is that in equilibrium each firm threatens that if the other deviates from \(n^{*}\) it will do R&D in such a way to foreclose the market. Even though “threatens” brings to mind repeated-games considerations, the result depends only on payoff-relevant elements. Underlying the threat is a two-way relationship between market structure and innovation, which is the central property of the model. First, when one firm (the innovative firm) does R&D while the other (the laggard firm) does no R&D, the innovative firm has the highest returns to R&D. By doing R&D it wins the market and hence makes aggregate profit increase, while by doing R&D the laggard firm catches up and makes aggregate profit decrease. This generates continuation equilibria in which only one firm does R&D. Second, when the laggard firm creates one more division, the innovative firm’s returns to R&D increase, because the innovative firm’s profit remains the same while the status quo worsens. At the same time, the laggard firm’s returns decrease, because more divisions have no effect on the laggard firm’s status quo, while they make aggregate profit decrease. This explains why a firm’s threat against an upward deviation can be credible. Whether the firms can use R&D as a threat depends on returns, which in turn depend on the cost of R&D and on the number of divisions itself. There are two types of equilibrium, and an interval for the cost of R&D outside which there is no equilibrium, and within which either one or the other type exists. The right-end-point of this interval is the cost above which a firm replies to one more division by doing no R&D, and hence above which the firms have no credible threat. The left-end-point is the infimum of the possible costs of R&D. So the equilibrium-interval contains all the costs for which R&D is viable. For costs outside the interval, R&D is not an issue, only the business stealing effect of divisionalization is at work, and each firm tries to displace the other in the final market by creating one more division. For costs within the interval and \(n^{*}\) divisions per firm, R&D is a credible threat, and business stealing plays no role because a change in the number of a firm’s divisions tilts the market in favour of the rival. For high such costs there is an equilibrium with no divisionalization, in which the firms do no R&D and each brings to the market only one division. For costs so high to support this equilibrium the firms have no threat against a downward deviation, and this implies that \( n^{*}=1\). For smaller costs there is an equilibrium with foreclosure, in which each firm creates the same number of divisions, this number is possibly larger than one, but only one firm does R&D and then brings its divisions to the market. Here the returns to R&D must be such that firms can enforce a threat against both an upward and a downward deviation, and this implies that in equilibrium only one firm does R&D. There is no equilibrium in which both firms do R&D. The model predicts a non monotone relationship between the cost of R&D and the number of divisions. As the cost of research decreases the industry switches from a configuration with no R&D and many little divisions that make zero profit to one with still no R&D but only two divisions, and finally to one with a dominant firm that does R&D and sets the number of divisions so as to prevent a rival’s deviation. An empirical implication is that we should observe a proliferation of divisions only in industries with very low returns to R&D. The literature on strategic divisionalization belongs to the more general literature on strategic managerial incentives and delegation in oligopoly, which includes the seminal papers by Vickers (1985), by Sklivas (1987), and by Fershtman and Judd (1987). Papers in this literature provide many examples of parent firms that promote competition between their divisions. See for instance the discussion in Creane and Davidson (2004). Kalnins (2004) considers the lodging industry in Texas and estimates the effect of encroachment, the practice through which a franchisor locates a new selling unit close to its existing franchisees. Thomadsen (2005) considers the fast food industry in California, and provides estimates that suggest that mergers between McDonald’s outlets might increase price significantly. I shall return to the empirical evidence for strategic divisionalization and to the empirical implications of the model in the Conclusions. This paper’s result that firms may create a finite number of divisions departs from the ones I have reviewed earlier, and contributes to explain what determines the extent of divisionalization. Also in Baye et al. (1996) and in Ziss (1998) firms create a finite number of divisions, in Baye et al. because they pay a cost of divisionalization, in Ziss because thy sell differentiated products. My result is closer to the ones in Saggi and Vettas (2002), who study how the firms’ decision about the number of their franchisees interacts with the decision about the royalty at which they will license the good. In equilibrium each firm chooses only one franchisee, and it uses the royalty rate to expand production. A remarkable difference with these papers is that here the game can have an equilibrium in which each firm creates only one division, but at the same time no firm does R&D, a situation that both in Baye et al. (1996) and in Ziss (1998) generates infinitely many divisions. So, what determines the number of divisions is the prospect itself of future R&D, and unlike in Saggi and Vettas (2002) firms give up divisionalization not because they prefer R&D as a commitment device to produce more, but because off equilibrium they will use R&D to foreclose the market. That the game has an equilibrium with divisionalization and foreclosure may recall the result in Schwartz and Thompson (1986), who note that an incumbent firm that faces a sequence of potential entrants can set the number of divisions so as to foreclose the market, and show that by doing so the incumbent makes a profit larger than when it accommodates entry. Unlike in that paper, here the firms foreclose the market by doing R&D. It is the mutual threat against a deviation, and precisely the returns to R&D required to sustain the threat, that determines the number of divisions. As I have said earlier, what supports my result is a two-way relationship between the number of divisions and the firms’ incentive to do R&D. While many papers have studied how market structure affects innovation,Footnote 2 how innovation affects market structure, and more generally how it affects firm-diversity, has been studied only by a few, including Mills and Smith (1996), Amir and Wooders (1999, 2000), Tesoriere (2008a, b), and Amir et al. (2011). This paper contributes to this strand of the literature by developing a model of endogenous market structure in which R&D generates asymmetries between otherwise identical firms. It is closer to Amir et al., which consider the case of low demand and obtain the same drastic effect of innovation as in this paper. I obtain this effect under the simplifying assumption that firms make a discrete decision about R&D. Amir et al. show that we can conceive this assumption as the reduced form of a typical model of continuous R&D, in which R&D has only mildly decreasing returns and these returns are negative at zero. Then a firm’s payoff is a convex function of R&D, and in equilibrium each firm will do either full or no R&D. They note that these types of equilibria match the empirical observations that in many industries only a few firms do R&D (see Eurostat 2007, quoted in Amir et al. 2011, and Miravete and Pernías 2006), and that the firms that do R&D often have the same budget over a long period of time (see Hall et al. 2005 and Khanna and Iansiti 1997). This paper recognizes that competition can have different effects on innovation. The positive effect on the innovative firm is similar to the replacement effect we find in Arrow (1962), which suggests that a competitive firm has an incentive to license an innovation that is larger than a monopolist’s because its status quo is worse. The negative effect on the laggard firm is similar to the efficiency effect in Gilbert and Newbery (1982), which suggest that in the market for inventions a monopolist will preempt a potential entrant, because entry makes aggregate profit decrease. These two effects determine the mechanism that Aghion et al. (2005) invoke to explain the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation they find in panel data. They also match the empirical evidence we find in Lee (2009), who uses firm-data on R&D intensity from the World Bank and finds that in response to more competition the firms with high level of technological competence do more R&D while the ones with low technological competence do less R&D. I will proceed as follows. I will describe the model in Sect. 2 , then study the game in Sects. 3, 4, and 5, and characterize the equilibrium and discuss some extensions in Sect. 6. I will conclude in Sect. 7. I provide all the proofs in the Appendix.",2
38,3,Economia Politica,12 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-021-00228-6,Social exclusion and financial distress: evidence from Italy and Spain,October 2021,Chiara Mussida,Maria Laura Parisi,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"This paper analyzes the phenomenon of severe material deprivation from a comparative perspective, investigating its association with the socio-economic characteristics of Italian and Spanish households. Severe material deprivation has found a renewed importance with its inclusion in the poverty and social exclusion goal of the Europe 2020 strategy (European Commission 2012). Together with the indicators for at-risk-of-poverty and household work intensity, severe material deprivation (SMD) is thus one the EU’s tools for measuring social exclusion and is defined as the process of excluding persons from the minimum way of life acceptable in their respective countries (EU Council of Ministers 1985). The SMD indicator is a condition of multidimensional poverty: deprivation of a set of resources and functioning that are naturally related to the concept of permanent income, i.e., the level of living standard that an individual reaches over her lifetime (Ayala et al. 2011). SMD is equivalent to a low standard of living along several dimensions (e.g., Eurostat set 4 dimensions on a 1–9 scale, as explained below). In other words, SMD provides “a more expansive view of households’ wellbeing”, as Ayala et al. (2020) phrase it. Quantitative non-monetary indicators are combined to give a picture of SMD. The Social Protection Committee for the Europe 2020 strategy adopted these indicators to quantify the percentage of households that cannot afford some of the following nine items considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to achieve an adequate lifestyle (Fusco et al. 2013): (1) avoiding arrears (in mortgage or rent, utility bills, or hire purchase instalments), in other words, to make ends meet; (2) a 1-week annual holiday away from home; (3) a meal with meat, chicken, fish, or a vegetarian equivalent every second day; (4) coping with unexpected expenses; (5) buying a telephone; (6) a washing machine; (7) a color TV; (8) a personal car; (9) keeping the home adequately warm. A “deprivation score” ranging from zero to nine counts the number of items a household cannot afford. A person is said to be severely materially deprived if she/he lives in a household with a score greater than or equal to four. Note that the four-item threshold for SMD does not vary from year to year and accommodates naturally for differences in price levels in different parts of a country. Although the theoretical motivations of multidimensional poverty measures are sound, there are some drawbacks when using the SMD count indicator because its operationalization may be difficult: the number and choice of the items, their heterogeneity, their validity, the aggregation of the indexes, and the reliability of the scale can be critical (see, e.g., European Commission 2012; Guio & Marlier, 2013).Footnote 1 In order to reduce the potential drawbacks of the SMD indicator, in this paper we choose to define three components of deprivation by categorizing the nine items into three groups (following suggestions from the existing literature regarding item homogeneity; see Sect. 2) as follows: (1) deprivation of basic needs related to items (1), (2), (3), and (9) (we call this category B—basic); (2) deprivation of secondary needs related to items (5), (6), (7), and (8) (category S—secondary); (3) deprivation due to financial distress related to item (4), (category D—financial distress). Unlike the Eurostat SMD score, we rank the levels of deprivation from low-severe, if households fall into a single category, to medium-severe, when households fall into two categories, to acute-severe if a household falls into the three categories of material deprivation (i.e., if it flagged items in each of the three categories). Empirical evidence reveals that during the Great Recession, all European countries experienced a reduction in employment and per capita income. And yet, the reforms the European Commission suggested regarding social and tax transfer systems lost some of their effectiveness, poverty diffusion enlarged, and deprivation spread amongst a large number of families. In 2017, 7.7% of European households reported having great difficulty making ends meet; among these, 8.8% were single-female households and 8.6% were households with dependent children (Eurostat 2020).Footnote 2 The extent of deprivation was particularly striking for Italy and Spain, two Southern European countries harshly hit by the Great Recession.Footnote 3 These two countries represent an interesting case study since stylized facts suggest that despite belonging to the same region, even before the onset of the 2008–2009 crisis they reported heterogeneous percentages of households under severe material deprivation conditions, both far from the European average, despite having similar at-risk-of-poverty ratesFootnote 4 (see Fig. 5 in “Appendix”). In 2006, Eurostat estimated that 9.9% of the European population was severely materially deprived. At the time, the official Eurostat SMD indicator was below the EU average in Italy (6.4%), and even more so in Spain (4.1%). This difference increased after the crisis: in 2017, when the EU share was 6.6%, the percentage for Spain was still below average (5.1%), while the share for Italy was above average and almost twice as much as the Spanish share (10.1%).Footnote 5 Predicted probability of SMD by number of permanent workers in the household and region Why do countries that are similar in their economies and labor markets show different patterns of severe material deprivation? Series of the risk-of-poverty rate and SMD suggest a positive correlation in Italy while the association looks weaker in Spain, especially before the Great Recession (Ayala et al. 2011; Martínez & Navarro, 2016). The correlation indeed varies significantly across European countries (Salcedo & Izquierdo Llanes, 2019). That is why we should observe stronger income-related aspects of deprivation, such as financial distress, in Italy compared to Spain. A second explanation of the difference involves household preferences and priorities regarding what they consider essential or optional to their lifestyle, even with respect to food consumption (e.g., Gracia & Albisu, 2001). If we rely on country data on quality of life, 27% of individuals in Italy report having a low level of satisfaction with respect to their own finances [with a score going from 5.7 (out of 10) in 2013 to 6.4 in 2018, close to the EU average)], compared to 32.5% of Spanish individuals (Eurostat, 2019). The overall index of life satisfaction, on the other hand (despite being an immaterial concept), reports an equivalent percentage of unsatisfied people in both countries (15.7%). Third, the difference can be related to household characteristics, such as size, labor market status, gender, education, and home ownership (see, for instance, Poggi, 2007). First, we qualitatively assess the distribution of household features between the two countries. Second, we analyze whether severe material deprivation is associated with labor market status and household circumstances (economic household features, i.e., the number of employed persons in the household, the number of temporary workers, and the (average) work intensity status of the household). While there is a significant literature on the determinants of income poverty, there are fewer studies relating severe deprivation with economic household features in different countries. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. Moreover, we analyze whether the gender and education level of the head of household affect the relative probability of being severely deprived (at all intensities). In the years following the financial crisis, in Europe the economic and political debate has focused on how to respond to the issue of alleviating (poverty and) SMD. Policy schemes such as the minimum insertion income in Spain have shown their weaknesses after the crisis, and sparse interventions in health care, education, and employment have been undertaken, with only rare actions towards poverty and social exclusion, such as the successful initiative in the Comunidad Valenciana (Martìnez-Lòpez 2019). The discussion on policy interventions to combat SMD is still open, with the issues debated strongly both in Italy and in Spain, and this paper offers some evidence to help design and implement more targeted strategies. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 offers a review of the existing literature on SMD. Section 3 describes the microdata and the indicators used in our analysis of SMD in Italy and Spain. Section 4 introduces the econometric methodology, and Sect. 5 discusses the empirical results. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks and policy recommendations.",3

These delayed effects can arise due to women’s inability to recover from the troughs they encountered in the immediate onslaught of the pandemic in terms of livelihood loss, which then spill over to food insecurity, depletion of savings, reduction in credit-worthiness, a decline in intra-household bargaining power  (Agarwal, 1997), and so on. Much of the global focus, however, has largely been on two gender effects—increase in care work and domestic violence.Footnote 1 These two effects, while important, fail to cover the full impact on women, or to factor in impact as a sequential process rather than as a one-time event. Also a persistent focus on just two dimensions diverts policy attention away from other critical aspects of women’s well-being in developing economies. Using India as an illustration, this paper first outlines what kinds of gendered outcomes we can expect, drawing on our knowledge of pre-existing gender inequalities and people’s coping strategies under other types of crises (see also, Agarwal, 2021a, 2021b). It then examines COVID-related evidence to see to what extent these potential effects are captured by existing surveys, and the data gaps that remain. It also highlights group approaches through which women have remained, or can remain, better protected from the worst economic outcomes of the pandemic, and point to ways forward for shaping effective future policies.",9

Official information from the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA) reports that as of 21st July 2021, the total number of deaths from COVID-19 was 195,243.Footnote 1 According to the Coronavirus Resource Center at John Hopkins University, by the end of June 2021, Peru was the country with the highest number of deaths per 100 K population in the world (587.21) and the second country with highest case fatality (9.4%).Footnote 2 The pandemic struck the first week of March 2020 when the first case was identified, and on March 15th President Vizcarra officially declared a country-wide lockdown to start the next day, closing national borders, limiting domestic travel, forbidding all business activities deemed non-essential, and severely restricting people’s mobility. Only core activities related to health (functioning of hospitals and pharmacies, being able to care for and move vulnerable family members if needed, with special permits required), food (only buying and selling of staple foods at small local vendors), fuel (production, transportation, distribution and sale), and financial institutions were allowed. The lockdown continued until June 30th 2020, although in May a gradual reactivation of economic activities began, starting with the least risky ones. According to the Stringency Index built by the University of Oxford, which records the strictness of isolation and quarantine policies on a scale from 1 to 100, during these months Peru ranked highest in Latin America, and among the highest in the world.Footnote 3 The drastic social immobilization measures adopted by the Peruvian government caused a collapse in the national gross domestic product, which plunged 30.2% from a year earlier, the deepest slump of any major economy according to Bloomberg (Quigley, 2020).Footnote 4 The coronavirus crisis and the country's entry into a state of national emergency and quarantine had a massive impact on the Peruvian labor market. According to the administrative records of the Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE)’s electronic worksheet and formal employment monitoring board, in March 2020 there was a net loss of 151,099 jobs nationwide, and 160,090 in April of the same year. These private formal sector workers were found in the commerce, services, manufacturing, and construction sectors. In May 2020, the net loss of jobs was lower (39,978). It was only in June that a net increase was registered, which in the third quarter of the year stabilized at a monthly national average increase of 92,000 jobs in the same economic sectors mentioned (MTPE, 2020). The study of the distributive impact of the pandemic shock is gaining importance, as it becomes increasingly clear that the shock interacts with pre-existing heterogeneities in asset holding, in the ability to generate income, in the access to public services, as well as many others. Growing evidence around the world indicates that women are suffering disproportionately (relative to their male counterparts) from the effects of the crisis triggered by the spread of COVID-19; women are overrepresented in independent and informal economic sectors as well as business and service activities, which have so far been hit the hardest by the pandemic. The lower rates of female employment, and their predominance in part-time jobs, also place women in a particularly fragile situation. In general, the population in informal or low-skilled markets, in precarious employment conditions, historically excluded groups such as those of indigenous descent, and other vulnerable groups are the most exposed to the effects of COVID-19, making them poorer than they already were, with inequality becoming exacerbated (Lustig and Tommasi, 2020). Using nationally representative quarterly data from the 2020 Peruvian National Household Survey (ENAHO), this paper identifies the most important heterogeneities in the vulnerabilities of different groups of individuals and 'types' of households in the face of the pandemic, and quantifies the impacts on labor participation, occupational category, informality and hours worked of the heads of households and their spouses, both individually and in joint configurations of work activities as a couple. This paper shows how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting workers in various industries, occupations and types of employment in a differentiated way, and what the impacts of this are on inequalities and gender gaps between individuals within the Peruvian labor market. Also considered are the interactions of labor market dynamics with aggravating conditions such as rurality and family composition. An important and distinctive element is the incorporation of an intra-household perspective, which takes into account that workers do not live in isolation, and that their interactions with other workers in the same family, within the home, can alter vulnerabilities to shocks to set in motion strategies for diversifying activities among the members of the couple, for example, that help to better cope with the crisis.",2

This led to widespread hardships for women workers who lost their jobs and livelihoods. This has been well documented by a range of studies. Agarwal (2021a, b), for example, provides a detailed review and analysis of both the direct and indirect impact on women of livelihood losses, not just of women themselves but also of their spouses. Several studies have also examined the effect of job losses by migrant workers stranded in cities far from home without housing or food (CLRA, 2020; CPI-M-CITU, 2020; Mudur, 2020; SWAN, 2020). A gender-differentiated, disproportionate impact was seen on essential workers and frontline workers like the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) providing care services (Dasgupta & Mitra, 2020), as well as self-employed women in various trades (SEWA-Bharat, 2020). Some studies have also highlighted the rise in food insecurity and indebtedness among the poor including women (CSE, 2020; CSO, 2020). And there have been reports of increased distress among small borrowers, most of whom are women (Bera, 2020). Moreover, national-level analysis has shown that while both men and women lost their jobs under the lockdown, subsequent recovery was much lower for women than men (Deshpande, 2020). Caste and gender differences played out significantly in terms of access to government relief measures as well as loss of employment (Raina & Ananya, 2020). In this literature, however, very few studies have focused on rural households and almost none have focused specifically on women farmers, especially those who had been widowed or deserted prior to the pandemic (Kulkarni, 2020). These women faced particular difficulties in harvesting, transporting and selling their produce (Chishti, 2020). This article seeks to bring to light the particular challenges faced by “single” women farmers in rural Maharashtra, a state in Western India. It also highlights the key policy gaps and failures which have left women farmers, who had already been neglected, much worse off during the pandemic. We will use the term “single women” for women who are widowed, deserted or unmarried. In our study, 91% of the single women are widows. They come from poor households and lack both support from their marital families after widowhood and access to the government’s relief measures. The study is located in seventeen districts of the state of Maharashtra. A majority of these districts are drought prone and have had large numbers of farmers committing suicide. Indeed, Maharashtra is known to have the largest number of farmer suicides in India. Fourteen of the 17 study districts have been declared as suicide afflicted. Between 1995 and 2018, more than 70,000 farmers killed themselves in Maharashtra, accounting for 20% of all farmer suicides in the country (National Crime Records Bureau, 2018). Men constituted 90% of the suicides, leaving behind “farm-suicide widows” urgently needing social and economic support (MAKAAM, 2018).Footnote 1 They added to the widows whose husbands had passed away from other causes, as well as women who had been deserted. This paper is based on a sample of 946 such single women surveyed during the month of May 2020. In-depth qualitative interviews were also conducted with about 25 women. The survey was undertaken under the auspices of the Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch (MAKAAM), an all-India informal forum for women farmers’ rights constituted of collectives, civil society organisations, researchers and activists from 24 Indian states, working to secure recognition and rights of women farmers. The study thus provides us with a unique picture of women who are normally invisible both to researchers and policymakers (MAKAAM 2020). The paper is divided into 7 sections. Section 2 below gives a background to the study and outlines how the data were collected; Sect. 3 gives the characteristics of the single women studied. Section 4 discusses the kinds of problems the women faced, and Sect. 5 discusses the failure of state support. Section 6 discusses the overall findings and Sect. 7 provides concluding reflections and recommendations.",2
39,1,Economia Politica,01 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-021-00243-7,Gendering the crisis: austerity and the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil,April 2022,Ana Luíza Matos de Oliveira,Magali N. Alloatti,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economics is often presented as a neutral and technical science, as if the conflict for resources and policies remains uninfluenced by political and ideological interests. This paper argues that this supposed neutrality masks the effects of economic policies on socioeconomic inequalities, especially if gender issues are not taken into account. More specifically, we claim this is the case for austerity (Rossi et al., 2020). Having replaced the term neoliberalism, austerity can, however, be considered a new form of this, which has shaped economic and social policy in Latin America since the 1990s. Under the label of austerity, neoliberal policies—manifest in a reduction of the welfare state and of state regulation in various forms—have made a comeback. The term refers to responsibility, stringency, moral and even religious sentiments that guide good governance of public affairs, in order to maintain an allegedly balanced budget (Konzelmann, 2014). The concept further serves to invoke a sense of guilt that is passed on to society (Gálvez & Rodríguez-Modroño, 2016). Above and beyond such rhetoric and lexical choices, austerity involves a reduction in public spending and in the role of the State as the driver of economic growth and promoter of social well-being (Deleide & Mazzucato, 2019; Oliveira, 2020). It comprises discretionary measures that “affect the structure of the welfare state in terms of social security, public administration, the public sector, public services, the taxation system, labour market institutions, and so on” (Périver, 2018, p. 30–31; Mazzucato & Kattel, 2020). Austerity is seen as a way of controlling the budget with a view to reducing deficits. The latter can also be achieved by increasing taxes, though this alternative tends to be unpopular. As Martínez et al. (2020) and Dweck et al. (2020) argue, the advocates of austerity assert it to be the foremost way to maintain “healthy” public finances, crucial for the resumption of economic growth, employment, and private investment, as well as a way to keep inflation under control, a particularly sensitive topic in Latin America. Its promises, however, have not been fulfilled; as austerity is procyclical in nature, it tends to worsen recessions and reduce overall investment (Dweck et al., 2020; Deleide & Mazzucato, 2019). As such, austerity is neither a solution for overcoming economic crises, nor a solution for the historical and social vulnerabilities which characterise Latin American societies. We thus echo global criticisms of austerity’s negative effects, which include hampering countries’ abilities to swiftly respond to the challenges faced during the Covid-19 pandemic (New Statement, 2020). More specifically, we echo Bohoslavsky and Rulli (2020), in arguing that the adoption of austerity measures in Brazil prior to the pandemic has increased vulnerability, taking its heaviest toll on the most vulnerable demographics, as we will further outline in this paper. Based on a neoclassical standardised conceptualisation of the human being, the advocates of austerity are unable to explain inequalities which structurally shape contemporary capitalist society. They argue that gender and racial inequalities are individual problems, leaving unexplained the fact that these inequalities are a necessary component of the capitalist system (Almeida et al., 2020; Gibb & Oliveira, 2015). We underscore that gendered effects of fiscal austerity are extensive and must be integrated into any analysis (Karamessini, 2014). Bohoslavsky and Rulli (2020) emphasise the negative impact that orthodox economic policies, such as austerity, privatisation, and deregulation of labour, among others, have had on women’s human rights. Moreover, analysis of austerity’s overall gendered effects must also consider its effects on men, so that an overall reduction in wellbeing is not conflated with a reduction in inequality between men and women (Addabbo et al., 2015). We argue that most of the burden of cuts in social spending in Brazil has been borne by women. These include: a reduced budget for policies which support social reproduction, such as day-care centres; a reduction in policies to combat gender-based violence and guarantee economic autonomy, as well as cuts to areas where women represent the bulk of the workforce, such as health and education (Oliveira et al., 2020). In a sense, the Constitutional Amendment (CA) 95/2016 increases structural, gendered inequalities in Brazil, leading to a deterioration in the social structure and fabric many women had and would have benefitted from during the Covid-19 pandemic (Oliveira, 2020). Based on the understanding that welfare state mechanisms have a key role in stabilising and enabling responses to the Covid-19 crisis, we show how the existing gendered effects of austerity have made Brazilian women structurally more vulnerable during the crisis. This paper begins with a comprehensive review of the literature on austerity and its gendered impacts. The following section on women’s vulnerability addresses two aspects: (1) the gendered impacts of austerity in Brazil since 2015, highlighting the effects of the underfunding of policies prior to the pandemic and (2) the impacts of the pandemic on already underfunded programmes and policies, intensifying gendered effects and previous vulnerabilities. Our final remarks highlight the centrality of this discussion in understanding the unfolding of the pandemic and its aftermath for vulnerable groups from a gender perspective.",4

For feminist movement builders, COVID-19 like HIV/AIDS was a human security concern accompanied by a rise in domestic violence and increased unpaid labour as a key gendered feature of how women experienced both the pandemic and government responses to it (UN Women, 2020). However, the global measures to mitigate COVID-19 were not designed to deal with the material concerns associated with the impact of the pandemic. Instead, communities had to grapple with the real threat of illness and death posed by this novel virus alongside concerns about income, food, housing, and water. Unlike classical humanitarian disasters such as floods, hurricanes, drought and famine, COVID-19 is a slow and cumulative crisis for which international relief on the scale of other health or natural crises has been slow. JASS partners in non-welfare states have relied on mutual aid programmes to mitigate the material impact of COVID-19 such as loss of income and therefore associated food, housing, and wellbeing concerns. The analysis we offer in this paper illustrates the role of feminist leadership in developing responses to COVID-19 that models an approach to localisation that centres deep contextual knowledge and a complex understanding of power and gender inequality. JASS has a long history of supporting women’s organising during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which it draws on in its current support for feminist movements responding to COVID-19. JASS HIV/AIDS work started in 2006 in Malawi resulting in the “Our Bodies Our Lives” campaign in 2012, a movement that aimed at improving access to safer anti-retroviral medication and quality health care for women living with HIV. The campaign was catalysed by evidence of a global AIDS response that had not acknowledged the gender dimensions of the pandemic and was excluding women’s specific needs, thus exacerbating gender inequalities (Essof et al., 2013). This paper uses racialised disaster patriarchy and collective protection as frameworks that underpin our analysis of feminist interventions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in sections of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Racialised disaster patriarchy (see Luft, 2016) as a framework facilitates an understanding of the political economy of disasters while collective protection is a framework that responds to the underpinning logics of structural inequalities. There are two major arguments we make in this article. The first is that feminist movement-building strategies are critical to sustaining communities when they encounter humanitarian crises, such as what we are witnessing with COVID-19, due to a history of responding to structural inequalities and deep contextual knowledge. The second argument we offer is that feminist movements exercise leadership by centring collective protection as a framework to mitigate risk, empower, sustain, and strengthen communities dealing with the long-term impact of structural inequalities exacerbated by COVID-19. Collective protection refers to interlinked autonomous responses that draw on context specific indigenous knowledge systems that counter state and non-state attacks on women's rights activists (see Miller et al., 2006: 5). Consequently, these strategies are always invested in understanding and destabilising dominant power structures. Collective protection offers an expanded vision of human security. We develop these arguments across three sections in this article. In the first section we set up the conceptual framing through a review of critical literature on gender and humanitarian responses, racialised disaster patriarchy and collective protection. In the second section, we examine the JASS Mobilisation Fund (JMF) set up to support feminist community-based formations and movements during crisis. In the third section, we turn to empirical illustrations of the strategies to mitigate the impact and spread of COVID-19. Organised around two primary themes: we examine strategies around material concerns such as food, medicine and protective equipment, and violence against women. Finally, we offer concluding reflections on the lessons we can learn from feminist movement building approaches to deal with health crises.",2

At the time of the first draft of this paper, and according to the latest data from the World Health Organization (19 November 2021), more than 255 million cases have been reported, including 5 million deaths.Footnote 1 The unprecedented nature of this event was emphasized by Antonio Guterres, the U.N. Secretary-General, who warned that the world is facing the most challenging crisis since World War II—a pandemic threatening people in every country and which will bring a recession that probably has no parallel in the recent past. In a recent speech,Footnote 2 he puts it vividly: ‘We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations—one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people’s lives. […] But this is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attacking societies at their core.’ Along these lines, in the April World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that global growth in 2020 would fall to – 3%. This corresponds to a decrease of 6.3% points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period. This makes the pandemic event, known as the ‘Great Lockdown’, the worst recession since the Great Depression and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis. In addition, the International Labour Organization estimates that between 5 and 25 million jobs were lost in 2020, with a corresponding loss of between 860 million and 3.4 trillion US dollars in labour income. These figures have attracted the attention of all international organizations, including the European Commission, the IMF, the World Bank, and the OECD, to the extent that several financial packages have been put in place, accounting for trillions of euros.Footnote 3 At the same time, the Covid-19 outbreak has encouraged scholars to contribute to various scientific areas, with dedicated taskforces set up across Europe and the US.Footnote 4 As for the economic aspects of the pandemic, broad policy-based research is being carried out on many topics, with the main aim of disseminating emerging scholarly work on the Covid-19 epidemic to improve our understanding of policy options.Footnote 5 While many studies have tackled the challenges of the Covid-19 outbreak in different areas of economics, including health (Abaluck et al., 2020), industrial organization (Barrot et al., 2020), macroeconomics (Atkeson, 2020), finance (Boot et al., 2020; Toda, 2020), development (Leiva-Leon et al., 2020), and inequality (Alon et al., 2020), the unintended consequences of the pandemic on migrants have not yet been explored in depth (Devillanova et al., 2020; Guadagno, 2020). I complement the existing first-hand contributions on the effect of Covid-19 by implementing a difference-in-differences (DiD) research design and by explicitly—and primarily—focusing on the consequences of the pandemic in terms of the government (re)allocation of migrants. In particular, I use monthly observations of both the presence of migrants in reception centres and on migrant arrivals in Italy during the period from October 2017 to October 2020, combined with monthly data on Covid-19 cases across Italian regions. Italy represents a crucial case study as it was the first Western country hit by Covid-19 and for which granular data for a relatively long timespan are available. The identification mainly rests on cross-regional differences in the exposure to Covid-19, while exploiting the shock due to the spread of the virus in Italy since February 2020. I posit that regions more affected by the pandemic, namely regions that experienced a larger fraction of Covid-19 cases, might have experienced a different allocation of migrants in their reception centres compared to less exposed ones. Following this approach, I find that the regional presence of migrants decreases approximately 6% points more in regions more exposed to the pandemic as compared to those that are less exposed. In practice, this decrease corresponds to a decline of between 381 units when considering Puglia, a region not strongly hit by Covid-19, and around 2150 units in Liguria, a region highly affected by the pandemic. These results survive a battery of robustness tests, including the traditional event study à la Autor, time falsification, and alternative specifications of regional exposure to Covid-19. To consider the economic implications of these findings, I complete the analysis by collecting data on the amount of spending on refugees and asylum seekers by the general government across Italian regions in 2019. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the reallocation of migrants in regions more exposed to the pandemic implies potential savings in the range of 60–94 million euros, corresponding to about a 30–90% reduction in spending on migrant, refugee, and asylum seeker functions in these regions. In contrast, for regions less exposed to the Covid-19 outbreak the reduction is of roughly 3–6%. Moreover, I document that these savings have been (at least partially) offset by a lower than expected amount of financial resources transferred from the central government to regions for healthcare provisions to tackle the pandemic. While contributing to the existing literature on migration in general, this article is most closely related to contributions focusing on finding plausible sources of exogenous variation in the allocation of migrants (Dhalberg et al., 2012; Edo et al., 2019; Fasani, 2015). By documenting that the presence of migrants is affected by external shocks, I also contribute to the large existing body of research showing to what extent the allocation of migrants is influenced by natural disasters, wars, and climate change (see, for example, Do Yun & Waldorf, 2016; Fouka, 2019; Hugo, 2013). Finally, this paper is related to the emerging literature on the link between immigration and the choice of specific public spending items at the local level (Bove et al., 2021; Gerdes, 2011; Gamelerio, 2018). The remainder of the article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the institutional setting and Sect. 3, the empirical framework; Sect. 4 presents the data, and Sects. 5 and 6 illustrate the results and robustness tests, respectively; Sect. 7 discusses some of the potential implications of the results. Section 8 concludes.",

When not treated (i.e., abandoned or deposited in open dumps), MSW is directly released into soils and generates harmful and toxic substances (Wang et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2018). When treated (i.e., collected and deposited in waste treatment facilities), MSW produces a critical amount of polluting emissions (notably methane gas), contributing thus to global warming (Clarke et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the waste generation-income nexus (Cheng & Hu, 2010). Using the well-known Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) approach (Grossman & Krueger, 1991; Kuznets, 1955), evidence of a progressive de-linking process in some advanced economies has been early noted, while other countries continue to display a positive and linear correlation among these indicators (Cole et al., 1997; Johnstone & Labonne, 2004; Magazzino, 2017; Mazzanti, 2008; Mazzanti & Zoboli, 2005). In this paper, we believe that innovation is at the heart of this de-linking process as it may substantially affect waste disposal operations (landfill, recycling, and incineration), and, ultimately, MSW generation (Hurst et al., 2005). Looking at the waste-income literature, one striking observation is that the Research and Development (R&D) determinant has attracted a weak interest so far. It is though surprising as promoting technology innovation in the waste sector is believed to draw important local effects, playing thus a leading role along the waste treatment chain (Gardiner & Hajek, 2020). Aldieri et al. (2019) also reported strong knowledge spillovers in the waste recycling and environmental innovations areas in Europe. Innovation can help lower waste externalities by developing waste-to-energy facilities, heat recovery, and incineration capacities (AlQattan et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2015). Nevertheless, technological innovations diversify the firms’ supply of goods (and thus the generation of waste), while not allowing the improvement of products' life span (Chen et al., 2018; Gardiner & Hajek, 2020). Being of central importance in growth theory, R&D expenditures lead to direct market shares and export gains for firms, but also translate into more innovative products and larger amounts of waste for municipalities (Aw et al., 2011; Szarowská, 2017). Thus, the positive role of waste-related technologies remains to be confirmed (Gardiner & Hajek, 2020; Kuehr, 2007). This study investigates the case of Korea for three main reasons. Above all, this country is peculiar concerning its path to waste sustainability. Despite critical levels of domestic consumption, it recorded serious improvements in waste management since per capita MSW generation decreased from 514.5 kg in 1985 to 384.9 kg in 2016. Similarly, partly due to the early establishment of the Waste Management Law (WML) in the 1980s, the total MSW generation declined by 36% in the 1990–2016 period. Second, the World Atlas ranked Korea as the leading Asian country for waste recycling (with 49% of waste recycled in 2019). Later followed by Singapore and Hong Kong, Korea early employed regulatory instruments to influence and modify households’ and firms’ behaviours towards sustainable usages. By enforcing several waste-related acts imposing a volume-based garbage rate system built on the concept of polluter payment, waste management has become more effective for both municipal and industrial waste (Yang et al., 2015). Third, in parallel to the adoption of public acts, the Korean government has strongly fostered national research in waste management-related technologies. With the 5th highest (total) patent application in the world in 2012, the international competitiveness of Korean research seems well-established within high-tech sectors (Nam & An, 2017). This is reflected in the booming of patents in climate change mitigation technologies related to waste management and declared to the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Between 1990 and 2016, they encountered a significant rise from 22 to 946. Accordingly, this paper displays a competitive edge from previous studies and brings four novelty aspects to the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical assessment of the relationship between MSW and income in Korea. Second, while evidence on the role of R&D intensity on waste operations is limited, this paper fills this critical gap and focuses on the relationship among patents in climate change mitigation technologies, per capita income, and solid waste. Third, this paper contrasts with previous ones as it employs a series of finer waste data, namely MSW for disposal (landfill), recovery (recycling), and incineration operations (in thousand tonnes). Finally, it proposes an innovative empirical strategy able to depict non-linear relationships amongst variables. All in all, our research objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis on the Korean case study. Using yearly data spanning the most available period (1985–2016), we examine the relationship among innovation in environment-related technologies, per capita income, and three major waste disposal operations (landfill, recycling, and incineration). Additional production factors (Gross Fixed Capital Formation, GFCF, and labour) and urbanization have been included in the empirical analysis. Following Magazzino et al. (2020a, b, c), this study applies two independent empirical strategies: a time-series analysis over the frequency domain (the Breitung–Candelon Spectral Granger, BCSG causality), coupled with Machine Learning (ML) experiments (Artificial Neural Networks, ANNs). Besides this Sect. 1, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature. Section 3 describes the data, the econometric framework, and the ANNs model. Section 4 shows the empirical results. Section 5 provides a discussion on the results. Finally, Sect. 6 gives concluding remarks and policy recommendations.",12

In particular, the role of female owners in the introduction of firm innovations are not well-understood. The lack of studies on gender perspective in innovative processes could be explained by the unrecognizable role played by people in the innovation filed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical studies that explore the role of gender ownership for innovation output activities for the Transition Countries. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to bridge the gap by exploiting firm-level data drawn from the business environment and enterprise performance survey (BEEPS V) conducted in 2012–2014 jointly by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank Group, a survey which includes information on several topics such as innovation, organization and management practices, employees, relations between enterprises and government, and other general information on firms. In particular, our analysis is based on cross-section dataset covering the period between 2012 and 2014 for 28 Transition Countries. We employ both a probit model and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methodology to investigate where there is a gender gap in innovation between female and male-owned firms. Our analysis is focused on the manufacturing sector characterized mainly by SMEs. SMEs in Transition Countries are far away from the technological frontier and have several ways to innovate. In these countries, the innovative activities of the firms could strengthen and be complementary to the existing ones. Besides bridging the technological gap, the innovative activity is the best possible strategy to be competitive and survive the increasing pressure of developed countries that have a comparative advantage especially in the production of high skill-intensive goods. The main finding of the probit model highlights that female owners have a significant and positive impact on the probability of introducing technological innovation in firms compared to male-owned firms. The well-acknowledged factors of innovation are confirmed: human capital, the sources of knowledge, the R&D activities, and the access to external financial resources. In checking any regional effect, we have found that differently from European former-USSR Countries, the Eurasian former-USSR Countries present a significant and negative association with innovation. In addition, results are of particular interest when employing the Oaxaca Blinder decomposition methodology. The existence of a gender gap in innovation is confirmed. In fact, we found that the innovation gap between female and male-owned firms is strongly significant. The plausible explanation is that this is mainly due to the differences in endowment effects. Among the intangible assets, human capital and sources of knowledge are the main factors that affect the innovation gap between the two groups of firms. Both human capital and job training contribute positively to this gap, while tertiary education has a negative effect. Also, R&D activities and external knowledge contribute positively to the innovation differences. Concerning the tangible assets, the access to public subsidies has a significant and positive effect on the innovation gap. In contrast, the effect of the credit line appears to be significant and negative. The other tangible factors explain the other portion of the innovation gap. The article is organized as follows: the next section provides the conceptual background in order to go deeply into the gender gap in innovation activities between female and male-owned firms. Section 3 describes the data and the variables. Section 4 outlines the econometric strategy, Sect. 5 presents and discusses the results. Finally, the last section provides discussion and conclusions.",2

Several concurrent phenomena contribute to explaining the slowdown of productivity growth in the Italian economy including segmentation of the productive system as the result of increasing firm heterogeneity (Bugamelli et al. 2018). The empirical evidence suggests that there are two groups of firms. One is characterized by a large population of micro-enterprises with a low propensity to invest in innovation and human capital and internationalization, and weak financial structures. The other is a relatively small group of firms, mostly medium and large-sized, whose efficiency, performance and productive strategies are comparable to European competitors (Dosi et al. 2012; Calligaris et al. 2016). Average wages have either stagnated or declined since the 1990s and were disrupted in a major way by the 2008 financial crisis. However, the dispersion of wages both within and between firms (and sectors) has increased significantly over time (Card et al. 2018; International Labour Organization 2017). This is evidence of the coexistence of high-wage and low-wage firms which is reflected in the increasing segmentation and heterogeneity of their productive behaviours. The economic literature provides extensive discussion of sources of the observed changes to labour productivity, the wages distribution and the increased role of firm heterogeneity. They range from supply side explanations, such as the shortage of skilled workers, to demand side explanations such as lack of investment in new technologies and inefficient management practices. The present study contributes to this debate by focusing on the potential consequences of labour market reforms that, over the last decades, have reduced the employment protection legislation for new hires and, de facto, liberalized firms’ exploitation of flexible work arrangements. The share of employees covered by fixed-term contracts almost doubled from 7.2% of total employment in 1995 to 17% in 2018 (OECD 1999, 2003). Labour market flexibility is seen as a solution to the negative effects of the 2008 economic crisis and a means of dealing with structural unemployment. There are multiple arguments to consider. On the one hand, temporary contracts may favour the matching between supply of and demand for labour, especially when firms are facing significant changes to the business cycle (Houseman 2001), and may allow more efficient screening and selection of productive workers, which would improve productivity and wages (Wang and Weiss 1998; Autor 2001). On the other hand, temporary hirings can affect firm performance by: (1) altering the incentives to invest in specific inputs, including human capital (Arulampalam et al. 2004; Booth et al. 2002; Acemoglu and Pischke 1999; Ricci and Waldmann 2015); and (2) weakening the firm’s organizational capabilities, which are embedded in the firm’s procedural knowledge (Dosi et al. 2019). Knowledge accumulation relies on long-lasting employment relationships, allowing the development of training opportunities and increased job specific experience. At the same time, if flexible work arrangements have an adverse effect on labour productivity and wages, intense use of short-term working arrangements could contribute to increasing the segmentation of the Italian production structure and deepening the divide between high-productive and low-productive firms and high-paying and low-paying firms. In sum, hypothetically, firms could use temporary employment in at least three ways: “reactive use”—temporary workers are used to deal with unexpected fluctuations in demand; “planned use”—to augment the regular workforce and to allow for expected changes; and “systematic use” which means all staff are on temporary contracts. In the former two cases, there might be a positive association between temporary employment and labour productivity since the detrimental effect on knowledge accumulation is likely to be balanced by a better selection of more productive workers or adaptation to fluctuating demand. In the third case of systematic and continuous use of temporary employees to staff all positions, productivity is likely to decrease through disinvestment in human capital and weakening of the firm’s organizational capabilities (see among others, Abraham and Taylor 1996; Houseman 2001; Vidal and Tigges 2009; Aleksynska and Berg 2016). Against this background, we aim to provide evidence of an association between increasing use of numerical flexibility at the firm level—that is, intensive use of flexible work arrangements—and labour productivity and wages, taking explicit account of the differences in productivity levels and the wages paid to workers across businesses. We examine the association between use of temporary contracts and productivity, focusing on how it varies along the conditional productivity distribution. Low-productive and high-productive firms use flexible working for different reasons: in highly-productive firms, temporary contracts can be a stepping stone to more stable employment in the firm, but in less-productive firms, systematic use of flexible arrangements is more likely as part of a cost-cutting strategy. We exploit original, firm-level data from the 2007, 2010 and 2015 Rilevazione su Imprese e Lavoro (RIL) survey, conducted by INAPP (National Institute for Public Policies Analysis), for a representative sample of partnership and limited liability firms, and merge these data with balance sheet information from AIDA (Analisi Informatizzata delle Aziende Italiane) provided by the Bureau Van Dijk. We estimate different quantile regressions based on the panel data (Parente and Silva 2016; Canay 2011), to take account of the role of firm heterogeneity in shaping temporary contracts along the entire productivity and wage distributions. We found, first, that intensive use of temporary contracts is correlated to reduced labour productivity and wages at each point in the corresponding distributions. Second, we found that the magnitude of the negative estimates associated with fixed term contracts decreases along the productivity and wage distribution quantiles, suggesting that it is mainly low-productive/low-wage firms that resort to temporary employment to permanently staff positions, possibly to try to reduce labour costs. In the case of the most productive firms—those in the 90th percentile—the estimates are negligible in magnitude and statistically not significant, suggesting that these firms may use fixed-term contracts to screen new hires and/or as the step towards a permanent position. Third, our results are quite robust to sectoral specialization and firm size, which suggests that the diffusion of temporary contracts interacts with firms’ competitive and behavioural heterogeneity in shaping the evolution of the labour productivity and wage distributions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses previous evidence on temporary employment, wages and labour productivity, emphasizing those studies that, in some way, explicitly consider the role of firm heterogeneity. Section 3 presents the data and descriptive statistics. Section 4 introduces the econometric strategy and Sect. 5 presents the main results. Section 6 concludes.",10

Concerns about the impact of immigration raise questions on what determines the size and the composition of immigrant inflows. Immigrants are indeed expected to positively contribute to economic growth by supplementing skills in relatively short supply and enhancing the labour force. Understanding the type of immigrants that maximises these expected economic benefits is one of the main debated topics. Figure 1 shows the total number of international migrants in 2019 reached nearly 272 million, following a stable upward trend (UnitedNations 2021). Number of international migrants by major area of destination The rise in international migration to developed countries has been marked by unprecedented institutional and technological changes, such as ageing, new skills needs and growing specialisation in human capital and digital-intensive activities. These current shifts have remarkably affected the migration patterns in terms of both demographic and skill trends. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of highly educated immigrants increased throughout the OECD countries by around 20 million (OECD, 2019). The demand for highly skilled labour has reflected the overall increase in education levels worldwide, while key sectors of many developed countries’ economies now suffer from specific skill shortages. In light of growing global competitiveness, many countries have selectively opened their labour markets to those applicants with higher levels of education or based on demand criteria while at the same time discouraging low-skilled migration. In this sense, institutional and regulatory contexts are crucial to whether migrants are eligible for a country and, if so, which destination they choose. Economic literature has devoted attention to the selection and sorting of migrants across countries, considering migration as the result of spatial differences in the net returns to factor supply and the response to labour market disequilibrium (see Bodvarsson et al., 2015). As immigrants are not randomly selected from the population of origin country, literature has focused on understanding which subsample decides to move, such as the composition, or the characteristics, of foreign inflows. The policy is one of the determinants influencing the conditions of entry through specific immigration channels and the type of immigrants attracted to each destination. For this reason, the composition of immigrants is considered itself equilibrium outcome of these policies (Chassamboulli & Peri, 2020). Specifically, selective-immigration policies may act directly on selection by admitting only certain groups, but also indirectly by marking migration as costly for some immigrants than for others (Biavaschi & Elsner, 2013). In this sense, selective systems are considered a way to admit the highly educated and improve migrants’ quality. By “quality”, we understood a higher education level usually measured by the average log wage that migrants earn at destination (Borjas, 1987; Bertoli & Rapoport, 2015). Moreover, the quality of immigrants depends also on several characteristics, such as innate ability, talent, attitude towards risk, which remain unobserved for policymakers (Bertoli et al., 2016; Bertoli & Stillman, 2019). This paper aims to survey the existing economic literature on how the adoption of skill-selective immigration policies shapes immigrants’ characteristics from the receiving-country perspective. On the other hand, this survey intends to foster future research on the possible consequences of a widespread shift towards selective immigration policy on the selection process. Despite the increasing importance of this topic, it is still unclear how immigration policy in the host countries is likely to affect the direction—positive or negative—and the magnitude of selection. The main reason is the lack of relevant data on both flows and policies that have severely constrained these analyses. In addition, few papers have investigated the impact of policies on current and future incentives as well as on other determinants of self-selection process—i.e. networks (Bertoli & Rapoport, 2015)—and other cultural and social makers, such as gender norms, family ties, ethnic enclaves, marriage and fertility, historical colonial relationships, religiosity (see Boucher, 2018). The rest of the paper is organised into three main sections. First, it introduces the skill-selective immigration policies deployed by the destination countries. Then, it provides a brief review of the theoretical mechanisms through which immigrants are positively or negatively selected relative to the receiving country’s population. Second, it discusses the theoretical models used in the literature that includes the role of selective policy in their formalisation. Third, it presents the empirical results from different selected studies. There is a final concluding section, which briefly reviews the main findings and future avenues of work.",1

Since the average weight gain has been too abrupt to result from significant genetic evolution, several scholars have recently focused on other explanations such as the decrease in food prices (Goldman et al. 2011; Philipson and Posner 2008, 2003), the reduction of the time cost of food (Cutler et al. 2003; Ruhm 2012), technological changes due to economic growth (Huffman et al. 2010; Lakdawalla and Philipson 2009), or the introduction of welfare-improving technological change (Lakdawalla et al. 2006). However, these explanations can only partially explain the so-called “obesity epidemic” (Cawley 2015). Indeed, food prices and, most importantly, eating time and physical activity declined substantially from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s because of technological innovations that allowed for cheap and energy-dense food, increases in restaurant supply (Ruhm 2012), and less physically demanding jobs (Philipson and Posner 2003). These changes may have been the starting causes of an imbalance between calorie intake and calorie expenditure. However, given that prices varied little afterward, they cannot entirely explain the total growth of obesity (Christian and Rashad 2009). Recently, peer effects and social norms have been characterized as critical pathways for the biological and behavioral spread of excessive body weight. Norms and customs developed through shared experiences in a social environment can significantly influence behavior. When most of one’s peers are obese, and such a condition is common, imitative obesity could represent an essential contributor to weight-related norms. This view argues that weight gain exhibits a sort of ‘social contagion’ within friends and family networks (Christakis and Fowler 2007; Trogdon and Allaire 2014). This type of contagion may affect weight gain because judgments regarding body size depend on the actual size of one’s friends or on the prevalence of obese peers. Obesity spread through social ties and peers since having social contacts who are obese could change a person’s tolerance of obesity or influence their adoption of specific behavior (Christakis and Fowler 2007; Halliday and Kwak 2009; Trogdon et al. 2008; Ali et al. 2012). Eating patterns and relative satiation also appear to be affected by an individual’s surroundings, as they adjust consumption according to the body type of others (McFerran et al. 2010a, b). For these reasons, recent literature has explored social interaction as one of the channels of the obesity epidemic. Empirical literature has primarily focused on disentangling the relationship between individuals’ perception of their body weight concerning their reference group, because of social norms (Etilé 2007; Gil and Mora 2011) or because a person’s relative BMI influences overweight perceptions and dieting (Blanchflower et al. 2009; Oswald and Powdthavee 2007). Theoretical literature has tried to provide some general predictions to define the form of such a social component and to provide a mechanism through which peers might influence individual weight actions such as exogenous social norms (Burke and Heiland 2007; Dragone and Savorelli 2012), intertemporal social pressure, and appearance evaluations (Wirl and Feichtinger 2010; Strulik 2014) or more general interplay between economic, social and psychological factors (Reich and Weibull 2012). This paper highlights another channel, which is social distortion in weight perception. If being overweight is a widely spread phenomenon, it is less likely to be recognised as a problem by mitigating its health concerns. In the United States, for example, of the many adults who meet the conventional body mass index (BMI) standard for being overweight (\(BMI \ge 25\)), few had perceived themselves as such (Burke et al. 2009; Rand and Resnick 2000; Paeratakul et al. 2002), particularly between 1988 and 1994 and 1999 and 2004 when the increase in overweight people/obesity was more pronounced (Johnson-Taylor et al. 2008). These underestimations are usually described as misperceptions; however, this fails to consider the social dimension and the fact that the secular increase in adult body weight is the main contributor to changes in weight perceptions over time (Ali et al. 2011; Keightley et al. 2011). These underestimations correspond to the actual prevalence of overweight people in the representative group. Rather than being misperceptions, these judgments are more likely to be accurate representations of the social context. Adults of all races, genders, and weights “tend to see weight problems everywhere but in the mirror”, so that they see the national weight problem as being more significant than the individual weight problems of their friends and relatives (Taylor et al. 2006).Footnote 1 Squiers et al. (2014) also reported that one-third of the sample’s self-perceptions of weight were not aligned with their BMI. Mistaken perceptions have been linked to dangerous behavior, whereas accurate perceptions are associated with appropriate weight goals (Keightley et al. 2011). We hypothesize that individuals are less likely to perceive themselves as being at risk because the whole categorization of weight has changed as a result of the constant exposure to a growing population of overweight individuals so that current generations are more likely to misperceive their weight (Burke et al. 2009; Maximova et al. 2008; Ali et al. 2011; Barbieri 2018). In this paper, we analyse how much social distortion in weight perception, measured using various social norms proxies, could influence obesity rates increases in England between 2002 and 2006. To do so, we analyse a theoretical and empirical model with a social component by considering the interaction between one’s utility and the social prevalence of excessive weight in society, representing a social norm. Depending on the prevalence of obesity, the individual’s perception of a healthy weight will be distorted, and the individual will risk converging towards an unhealthy weight. We relate such a social norm to the actual realisation of weight in their reference network. The theoretical model explains the recent increase in obesity, relating it to the evolution of social approval of excessive weight, affecting individuals’ health concerns. As society is more indulgent towards obesity, it will be less commonly perceived as a health problem, converging to an overweight equilibrium. The empirical model using pooled data from the Health Survey of England (HSE) from 2002 to 2006 tests this conclusion by establishing several social norms based on regional health authorities. Using a Fairlie decomposition, we can estimate that up to a 22% increase in obesity rates between 2002 (20.2%) and 2006 (24.7%), which accounts for a 5% increase and was influenced by such social norms. Our estimates explain 42% of the obesity gap when we exclude the social norms. When we include the social norms, our estimates explain between 46 and 77% of the obesity gap. We also find that men have more significant increases in obesity rates with compared with women and that they are more susceptible to social distortion, especially low-skilled ones. Similarly, medium- and low-skilled women are more susceptible to environmental pressure than highly skilled ones, who are entirely unaffected by it. While many social norms affect men, women are vulnerable mainly to the ones associated with their closest peers in terms of demographic characteristics. Overall, these results show the need to reduce misperception and enhance health education to provide social-invariant weight categorisation to be followed, as well as healthy mentoring and tutoring to sustain and promote excessive weight reduction.",

Several climatic, social, and sectoral features related to the fundamental drivers of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are studied in the present literature. Although different studies provide valuable information on environmental degradation, there are still gaps in the extant literature. There was no uniform interpretation for the agriculture sector, a vast industry with a considerable impact on global environmental performance and economic growth. To fill this gap, this study examined the role of agricultural expansion, forest resources, and renewable energy on Nepal's environmental performance and economic growth between 1990 and 2018. Nepal is regarded as the world's least developed country. GDP per capita in 2018 was US$ 817.78 (constant US$ 2010), with 50.8% of the population earning less than US$ 3.20 per day (World Bank database, 2019). Nepal is not an industrial country. About two-thirds of the population works in the agriculture sector. The government has not considerably boosted national income in several years, and it remains one of the world's most economically developing countries. While Nepal's industrialization has stalled, data reveal that the country's economic development, environmental deterioration, and energy consumption metrics are all increasing over time. CO2 emissions in Nepal arise from a variety of sources. Agricultural growth emissions accounted for 11% of world greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in 2014 and 50.1% of Nepal's GHG emissions; without mitigation measures, global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions might climb by 58% by 2050 (World Resources Institute, 2019). Emissions from livestock enteric fermentation, rice cultivation, left-over manure from pasture, manure management, crop residues, soil manure, organic soil cultivation, and burning crop residues were 53.8%, 17.4%, 12.5%, 4.9%, 3.3%, 2.9%, 2.5%, and 0.8% in Nepal's agricultural sector, respectively (see Fig. 1). The global environmental problem is expected to worsen due to the negative trend; hence, regulating agricultural emissions and CO2 emissions have become a crucial global issue that must be addressed. This is a crucial issue since reducing agricultural emissions is one of the many ways to tackle climate change (World Bank database, 2019). Examining agricultural growth in CO2 emissions and economic growth models can provide insight into potential agricultural mitigation options. Nepal’s average agricultural emissions (CO2 equivalent) by sector from 1990 to 2017 [Source: FAOSTAT (2019)] Agriculture is critical for both developing and developed countries; decreasing agricultural productivity is not sustainable (Sertoglu & Dogan, 2016). Surprisingly, increased agricultural activities necessitate increased energy usage and emissions (Zhang et al., 2019). The agricultural sector in Nepal contributes significantly to the country's economy, accounting for 27.08% of GDP in 2017 (Statista, 2019). From 1961 to 2016, rising agricultural emissions in the region accompanied rising agricultural productivity, resulting in more outstanding agricultural production (Fig. 2) (FAOSTAT, 2019). For the timely expansion of sustainable agriculture in Nepal, an examination of the role of agriculture in the relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions is required. Agricultural emissions in Nepal, 1990–2017 [Source: FAOSTAT (2019)] Furthermore, Paustian et al. (2006) found that increasing carbon sinks and storage in the agriculture sector could help to mitigate climate change. This potential can be increased by using renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels to operate agricultural equipment and some types of machinery with minimal environmental impact (Dong et al., 2018). Renewable energy sources are heavily encouraged in a variety of industries, including agriculture (Qiao et al., 2019). As a result, the world's renewable energy output increases to satisfy the growing need for clean energy (Al-Mulali et al., 2016). The share of renewable energy increased by 4%, accounting for about 25% of global energy demand growth (IEA, 2019). In the context of Nepal, the Government's objective is to incorporate 10% of renewable energy into its energy mix by 2030 and to raise the generation potential to 80% of renewable energy by 2050 (REN21, 2019). This target reveals that renewable energy plays a vital role in reducing CO2 emissions (Baek, 2016). In the two models of this study, the composition of agricultural growth and renewable energy decreases CO2 emissions and sustainable agriculture. Incorporating renewable energy consumption into CO2 emissions and economic growth models could also reflect their impact on Nepal's environmental depletion. Cities worldwide account for 65% of global energy consumption and 70% of energy CO2 emissions (IREA, 2016). Much of urban CO2 emissions come from rising economic growth due to urbanization (Bekhet & Othman, 2017). Almost 50% of the world's community lives in cities, and 64% of the population in emerging economies is expected to urbanize by 2050 (Shahbaz et al., 2015). Among the South Asian nations, Nepal's urbanized urban population increased from 8.9% in 1990 to 19.3% in 2017 (World Bank database, 2019). Nepal is one of the ten least urbanized countries globally and one of the ten fastest urbanizing countries in the world. Massive energy consumption and pressing environmental problems will result in the quickest urbanization process because urban development usually involves several energy-dependent measures to increase emissions (Li et al., 2018). Urbanization can profoundly impact the environment, but it depends on the level of growth of the country (Gasimli et al., 2019). Sustainable agriculture and urbanization are given equal importance, as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals for 2015. As a result, it is necessary to assess the impact of urbanization on environmental degradation, which is critical for the long-term repercussions of the long-term strategy. The EKC hypothesis is significant, which examines the link between economic growth, agricultural, CO2 emissions, renewable energy, and urbanization. The application of the EKC theory to agriculture is remarkable (Liu et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the EKC concept, which combines renewable energy, agriculture, and urbanization, has received little attention. In Nepal, the EKC assessment focused solely on energy consumption (Parajuli et al., 2014) and economic growth-CO2 emission (Murshed & Dao, 2020), ignoring the impact of agriculture on CO2 emissions and economic growth. As a result, the study's objectives are expressed as follows: (1) investigate the impact of various agricultural sub-sectors on economic growth and CO2 emissions when combined with renewable energy, urbanization, and forest resources, and (2) apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to the EKC hypothesis in Nepal, focusing on various agricultural sub-sectors (such as total cereal production, total cereals area harvested, and total cereals yield). Based on previous investigations by Bekhet and Othman (2018) and Pata (2018), this study uses the ARDL method because the model is suitable for the mixed order of variables (I (0) and I (1)). This study analyses the EKC hypothesis in Nepal. It identifies the linkages between different agricultural subsectors, forest resources, urbanization, renewable energy, economic growth, and CO2 emissions, as well as the significant impact of mitigation policies on the environment and economic development. The study is unique and complements the literature as follows: (1) our study enriches the current EKC approach by considering the sub-sector of agricultural production (such as cereal production, cereal harvested area and cereal yield), forest resources, urbanization, and renewable energy as economic growth and CO2 emission factors. Although the existing EKC examinations have been increasing, the above parameters have been added to the EKC model in few investigations, and the results of the EKC are inconsistent. (2) In the literature, the use of time-series data to verify the EKC hypothesis is important because this study is for a single country only: Nepal. Since every country has significant differences in economics, politics, society, and biophysics, it is reasonable to expect different countries with different environmental-economic ties (Figueroa & Pastén, 2009). Time-series research is therefore considered to be more appropriate for testing the EKC hypothesis of a single country, as the results of one country are unlikely to be generalized to other countries (Danish et al., 2017; Shahbaz et al., 2015). (3) Our study also describes how each of the primary agricultural sub-sectors contributes to economic growth and changes in CO2 emissions and provides critical information on sustainable and green agriculture in Nepal. More explicit and precise mitigation measures and sustainable measures can be achieved in Nepal's agricultural sector by determining the influence of different agricultural sub-sectors on CO2 emissions. The study is prepared as follows: A comprehensive review of the literature is given in Sect. 2. Section 3 extends data and econometric methods. Section 4 reports the findings achieved. Section 5 includes conclusions and policy recommendations.",

The pressure of competitors and new entrants leads firms to set prices that reflect costs, while, in the absence of competition, firms gain product market power and command high prices (De Loecker et al., 2020). In addition to lowering consumer well-being, significant levels of market power due, for instance, to ineffective product regulation policies or relevant barriers to entry, have relevant consequences both at the firm level and the aggregate level. Intuitively, higher prices can lead to lower consumption and then output, which in turn affect firms’ labour demand, capital investment and innovation efforts. Changes in product market power have not only intra-firm effects: they are also one of the drivers of the redistribution of output and inputs across companies, which can result in resource misallocation and affect aggregate variables including labour productivity (Andrews & Cingano, 2014) and total factor productivity (Restuccia & Rogerson, 2013, 2017). Ultimately, these dynamics have ramifications for policy, such as antitrust, monetary policy and income redistribution (De Loecker et al., 2020). For these reasons, economists and policymakers have long been interested in the magnitude and the changes of product market power, in the effects on the economy and in the way market power is affected by various competition and trade policies. Product market power, which is often referred to simply as market power, is usually proxied by the markup (also known as price–cost margin), that is the ratio between the price applied by a firm and corresponding the marginal cost. Unlike its definition, the computation is not straightforward, as marginal costs are not observable. Since the publication of the seminal paper by Hall (1986), who suggests measuring the marginal cost using the observed change in input cost corresponding to the variation of output from one year to the next, a large strand of literature has estimated markups drawing upon Hall’s methodology, or applying an extension or refinement of the latter (e.g., Crafts & Mills, 2005; Domowitz et al., 1988; Klette, 1999; Morrison, 1988; Roeger, 1995). An important methodological advancement is made by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), who develop a method that, unlike prior work, produces firm-level estimates of markups and controls for unobserved productivity shocks. Since then, an increasing number of studies have estimated markups using microdata with the aim of understanding whether product market power increased during a certain time frame in a given economy or in a group of countries, how markup is related to certain firm-level and industry-level characteristics, such as market concentration, productivity and export status, or to what extent its variation has implications for relevant economic variables (e.g., Calligaris et al., 2018; De Loecker & Eeckhout, 2018; De Loecker et al., 2020; Diez et al., 2019; IMF, 2019; van Heuvelen et al., 2019). In particular, in an influential paper, De Loecker et al. (2020) document a significant increase in markups across US non-financial corporations over the last few decades, and show how product market power is related to investment rate, labour share and capital share, labour force participation, wage inequality, business dynamism and labour reallocation. This promising strand of research complements the macroeconomic literature on product market power, its underlying mechanisms and its effects on investment, factor shares and other variables (e.g., Barkai, 2020; Dixon & Lim, 2020; Eggertsson et al., 2021; Forni et al., 2014). It also contributes to a wider policy and academic discussion on the recent rise of product market power which has been documented in the US and other developed economies, and which seems to have played a role in the decline of the labour share and the investment rate, as well as in other worrying trends, observed in various countries since the early 2000s.Footnote 1 However, so far there are few microeconomic studies that jointly analyse product and labour market power despite the fact that, as stressed by Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) in a seminal theoretical work, product and labour markets are intimately related. In particular, although some contributions (i.e., Caselli et al., 2021; Dobbelaere & Mairesse, 2013; Mertens, 2019, 2020; Soares, 2020) have recently started to tackle these issues, there is still limited evidence on the relationship between firm-level product and labour market power, on their link with the labour share of income and other microeconomic factors that drive the dynamics of these indicators. Accordingly, we attempt to advance knowledge on this topic by investigating the recent trends in both product market power and labour market power in a large sample of Italian manufacturing firms. To this end, we use firm-level data collected from Aida (Analisi Informatizzata delle Aziende Italiane-Bureau van Dijk) and apply a sophisticated procedure which mainly draws upon De Loecker and Warzynski’s methodology (2012) and the subsequent refinements made by Caselli et al. (2021) and Mertens (2019) to better model imperfections in the labour market. First, we outline a preliminary account of markups and the indicator of product market power by illustrating some descriptive statistics. After that, we attempt to shed some light on the observed trends: specifically, we first uncover the underlying mechanisms and provide some tentative interpretations of the latter by performing a decomposition analysis; then, by means of a simple regression analysis, we conduct a more standard assessment of the association between market frictions and the factors identified by the past literature as potential determinants. From our microeconomic analysis, it emerges that the manufacturing sector has experienced a limited rise in markups and a shift in labour market power away from firms and towards workers. These trends are mainly driven by within-firm changes. Additionally, the overall growth in bargaining power, which explains the muted positive trend in the (revenue-based) labour share, is mostly attributable to the rise in the average firm-level wages; however, the latter are likely to hide relevant inter-individual heterogeneity, as national data on wage inequality suggest, and monopsony power is still non-negligible, especially in the Mezzogiorno. This paper contributes to the recent and promising line of research that jointly analyses frictions in the product and in labour market starting from firm-level data. Notably, it also expands the evidence on market frictions in Italy, a Western European country that, during the last two decades, has exhibited a mixed economic performance which, however, partly differs from the US one in terms of the variables scrutinized by De Locker et al. (2020).Footnote 2 Even though Italy has been included in some cross-country studies on markups (e.g., Battiati et al., 2022; Calligaris et al., 2018, 2019; Díez et al., 2019), empirical research on this subject (especially microeconomic research) has been limited so far. Giordano and Zollino (2017) compute macroeconomic total-economy estimates of Italy’s markups since 1861 and sectoral markups for the time span 1970–2012, using different methodologies. With regard to the most recent decades, they document a reduction in markups after the completion of the Single Market, which accelerated after the inception of the European Monetary Union. Evidence of a pro-competitive impact of the euro adoption is also provided by Bugamelli et al. (2008), while Bugamelli et al. (2015) show that, in recent years, import competition (especially from China) has contributed significantly to curbing price dynamics and firms’ markups. Thus, it seems that the trend in product market power observed in Italy between the beginning of the nineties and the first decade of the new millennium differs from the dynamics reported for the US in the same period. Nonetheless, Bugamelli et al. (2008; 2015); ;  do not employ a direct measure of markups, and the work by Giordano and Zollino (2017) produces aggregate estimates. Moreover, none of them cover the most recent years. Cavalleri et al. (2019), who investigate the trends in market concentration, markups and economic dynamism in Italy and other three Western European countries, compute both aggregate and firm-level measures of the variables under scrutiny and make some interesting comparisons across the four countries; however, the markup is simply calculated as the ratio between output and input (labour and materials) costs. An exhaustive and updated account of the evolution of product market power in Italy has been recently provided by Ciapanna et al. (2022), who resort to both macro and micro data and employ different measures and estimation techniques, including a production function-based methodology based on De Loecker and Warzynski’s framework. However, they focus on product market power while neglecting labour market frictions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the analytical framework and the data used to estimate the parameters of market inefficiencies. Section 3 provides a descriptive analysis of market imperfections in the Italian manufacturing sector. Section 4 illustrates the decomposition analysis. Section 5 summarizes the results of the regression analysis. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

The role of bridging and bonding social capital in the evolution of the pandemic,October 2022,Vincenzo Alfano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"2020 will be a year long remembered for having been the first of a pandemic that, about a century after the last one, affected the entire planet, forcing more or less every person on earth to adopt significant changes in his or her everyday life. Some of the wealthiest and most developed countries in the world discovered their fragility when faced with an invisible enemy that was difficult to keep outside their borders. The citizens of Western countries in particular had to learn to cope and live with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). These are a set of policies aimed at reducing the possibility of contagion that, certainly in spirit, and often also in practice, are very similar to Middle Age remedies for fighting the plague. Indeed, many contemporary governments have taken recourse to policies similar to those invented by the Republic of Venice in the seventeenth century, when the first public authorities established specifically to safeguard public health adopted resolutions to fight the scourge of the plague (Alfano & Sgobbi, 2021). Stay-at-home orders and imposed self-isolation have taken the place of lockdowns and quarantine, to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Several remedies aimed at increasing social distancing have been imposed by public authorities in order to reduce opportunities of contagion, and thus to flatten the curve of infections. To this set of policies belong remedies such as stay-at-home orders, bans on public gatherings, the closure of schools, and more generally all the social distance remedies that were adopted by public authorities in order to contain the diffusion of the virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). Over the course of 2020 it became clear that the evolution of COVID-19 infections is influenced by the seasons (Smith et al., 2020), and thus that the northern and southern hemispheres exhibit counter trends, and are difficult to compare. Taking into account this difference by focusing on countries in a specific area (and more specifically on the climatically more homogeneous region of Europe), it might seem at first glance that state reactions to the threat have been largely homogeneous. Nonetheless, if we look at the varying diffusion rates of COVID-19 in the different countries, anecdotal evidence suggests that the effectiveness of such remedies varied greatly from country to country. This is further confirmed by recent empirical studies that highlighted fear of the future, behavioral change, and systematically negative expectations regarding the future during the first COVID-19 wave (Bogliacino et al., 2021; Codagnone et al., 2021). One reason to explain the heterogeneity of these policies’ effectiveness is the peculiarity of NPIs compared to other kinds of policy. Since these are aimed at the entire population of a country, in Western democracies, which have certain standards regarding civil liberties and democracy, it is difficult for public authorities to enforce the respect of these restrictions with the use of force, given the scale of the phenomenon to keep under control. Indeed, it is easy to understand that the vast majority of the population is the target of lockdowns and social distancing measures, and that an important degree of voluntary compliance by the population is needed for these NPIs to work, since law-enforcement authorities do not, and probably may never have enough resources at their disposal to control the behavior of the entire population with success. Some NPIs oblige people to restrict certain behavior to private space (for instance, Italy, France and Germany adopted restrictions on the number of people that may gather in a private house); others, by their very nature, are more or less unenforceable, and depend purely on people’s good will (such as the restriction imposed in Italy by the decree of 12 March 2021 forbidding citizens from visiting friends and relatives “more than once” per day, a prescription that it is difficult to imagine public authorities having the ability to actually control). From all this it seems possible to conclude that, since NPIs are potentially a (very) restrictive policy that significantly affects citizens’ everyday behavior, and since they must be respected mainly on a voluntary basis, there is a space for the specific characteristics of a country to play an important role in the effectiveness of these NPIs. Among these characteristics, social capital seems to be a particularly interesting variable to test. By influencing the way people look both at other people belonging to their networks, and at strangers, it is very likely that social capital could constitute a determinant that affects the evolution of a pandemic and compliance with NPIs. Moreover, social capital also influences the way members of a given community have access to, and interact with, their different networks. It is easy to understand how this has an impact on the spread of an airborne disease such as COVID-19, and consequently on the efficacy of NPIs. It is important to highlight that social capital may have an impact on the evolution of the epidemic through several channels. The most obvious one, especially during the first wave when neither cures nor a vaccine was available, is through nudging people to respect social distancing, either in compliance with government NPIs, or by favoring the efficacy of other measures, such as common sense and World Health Organization suggestions. But there is more: another possible channel through which social capital could affect the trend of COVID-19 infections is by influencing everyday behavior that favors the spread of the virus, such as the decision to use public rather than private transport, which has been suggested to have played an important role in the spread of the virus (Alfano et al., 2021). Previous literature, with reference to many different fields, from genetically modified organisms (Kim, 2011) to nuclear energy (Jasanoff & Kim, 2009), suggests that political culture needs to be taken seriously in order to ensure the effectiveness of policies. Indeed, as explained, the manner in which people respect NPIs may also depend on the way they look at their communities, on the degree of trust and reciprocity they have in others, and on the degree of confidence they have in the authorities. However, little is known about the effect of trust on compliance with health and safety rules (Bargain & Aminjonov, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be the perfect setting in which to study the relationship between social capital and policy compliance, since it has been suggested that the COVID-19 crisis can be seen as a “global, and (mostly) simultaneous test of the behavioral implications arising from this confidence” (Chan et al., 2020: p. 1). The overall purpose of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the role social capital plays in the diffusion of COVID-19. More specifically, this study aims to examine, from a European cross-country perspective, whether and how social capital is related to a lower spread of COVID-19, ceteris paribus for the NPIs enforced. The research question of the present work may therefore be stated as follows: “What role does social capital play in the containment of COVID-19 infections?”. We consider this to be an important research question for at least two reasons. First, it is interesting to assess the impact of social capital on the spread of COVID-19 since the coronavirus pandemic remains a major threat for a large part of the global population, and thus research devoted to understanding the impact of socio-cultural characteristics on NPI effectiveness is useful as a means to help policymakers design better policy and estimate the impact of such policies, aside from forecasting the trend of contagion. The literature already has several pieces of research devoted to assessing the impact of NPIs (Alfano & Ercolano, 2020b; Alfano et al., 2021); it now seems important to also evaluate whether there is an effect on the efficiency of the policy due to the population on which it is applied. Moreover, epidemics and global pandemics are predicted to be a significant and continuing threat in the next few years (Adamson et al., 2021; Hotez, 2021; Simpson et al., 2020), and thus research devoted to understanding the impact of social capital on NPI effectiveness seems to be destined to become increasingly useful and necessary in the near future. We expect social capital to be a determinant of this relationship, since it influences the way networks of people are constructed, and the way people behave within and between these networks. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic and different populations’ NPI compliance provide a very interesting quasi-experimental setting in which we may understand more generally the impact of social capital on the degree of people’s respect for policies. One of the major shortcomings of the existing literature addressing this area is that it is very difficult to assess how many people have complied with a given policy, due to the intrinsic resistance of people to admit they have infringed the law, which typically hampers the usefulness of survey data in such research. Similarly, it is very difficult to assess levels of law compliance among the general population. While researchers in the field have found a number of creative ways to overcome this problem and find proxies for the degree of law compliance among the population, it seems that the COVID-19 crisis offers an interesting setting in this regard, given that the trend of the contagion is a good proxy for the degree of compliance with NPIs aimed at halting the spread of disease in the entire population of a given country. Finally, the chance to observe this relationship in a cross-country perspective, presented by the exogenous shock created by the pandemic, allows us to obtain estimates that we may generalize with more confidence. This setting enables us to have better estimations, and to avoid biases due to omitted variables or unobserved shocks impacting this relationship, which may easily constitute a weakness and an empirical challenge that would be difficult to overcome in a single country study. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. The next section reviews the relevant literature and formulates the research hypotheses. Section three presents the empirical strategy and the data used to test this relationship, while section four shows the relative results. The last section concludes.",16

In market relations, parties are often characterized by imperfect information on important elements of the transaction, such as the quality of the traded good, on which consequently they hold beliefs. As shown in the last decades by cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, beliefs are often distorted, and as source of belief distortion, a bias with important economic implications is overconfidence (Moore  & Healy, 2008; Malmendier  & Taylor, 2015). Overconfidence can take two main forms (Grubb, 2015): overoptimism and overprecision. Overoptimistic individuals overestimate their prospects or their abilities, while overprecise individuals underestimate uncertainty, thus placing overly narrow confidence intervals around forecasts. These biases can cause upward-biased estimates of the quality of a good (or downward-biased estimates of prices) thus leading to imperfect choices (Camerer  & Lovallo, 1999; DellaVigna  & Malmendier, 2006; Iossa  & Palumbo, 2010; Grubb  & Osborne, 2015). A market where bargaining, imperfect information, and overconfidence are jointly important aspects is the art market. As a matter of fact, “haggling for art” is a common practice, where sellers and buyers often engage in a bargaining process to establish the artwork’s prices, regardless of the selling method (posted or auction price) used by the art dealers (Velthuis, 2011). Dealing with goods that embody both cultural and economic values, agents in the art market usually operate in a context of “asymmetric disinformation” (Candela et al., 2012). Agents can be characterized by incomplete sets of information about artworks quality, and, to a large extent, heterogeneity arises because traders differ in their knowledge of how the art market works. On one hand, galleries, experienced collectors and artists are typically sophisticated traders, who have the expertise to correctly elaborate all the available signs and signals about the artwork and the artist, relying on a highly specific type of cultural knowledge or educational capital. On the other hand, less experienced collectors, who are particularly sensitive to trendy brands, may behave naively, suffering from “investment mania”, or be driven by “art passion” and not by the principle of risk minimization (De Vecchi, 2008; Candela et al., 2013; Kräussl et al., 2016).Footnote 1 This paper aims to develop a model of the art trade in which bargaining is the selling method, and the bilateral relationships between sellers and buyers depend on their possibly divergent and biased beliefs on the quality of the artworks, considered as goods with exogenous quality (Candela  & Cellini, 1998). In our model, artwork quality is a stochastic variable whose distribution is exogenously given, in that it is not influenced by sellers’ or buyers’ choices. Artwork quality is affected by an artist’s talent and fame, and agents in the art market can use signs and signals to proxy them. However, not all have the same ability to interpret these signs and signals (Candela et al., 2012). In particular, we assume that two types of agents exist: sophisticated and naïve agents. The former can interpret signs and signals properly, and hence they know the actual distribution of quality, that hereafter we will call objective distribution. Their reservation price, hence, hinges upon such a distribution. Naïve agents, instead, form their reservation price based on a subjective distribution of quality, which, due to overconfidence, has a higher mean and/or lower variance than the objective one. It follows that overconfidence does not affect quality, but only the perception of the stochastic process behind it. Our results can be summarized as follows. In the first part of the paper, we consider the interaction within a single buyer-seller pair, which models a situation in which the two agents do not consider the possibility to negotiate with other parties in case of disagreement. For the seller, the reservation price, i.e. the minimum price that she is willing to accept to sell the artwork, is determined by valuing the quality of the artwork based on a probability distribution, which is the objective one for sophisticated agents. The same is for the buyer’s reservation price, i.e. the maximum price that she is willing to pay for the artwork. By using a biased distribution, overconfident agents overestimate expected quality (in the case of overoptimism) or underestimate risk (in case of overprecision). In both cases, and irrespective of the side of the market that is biased (sellers or buyers), overconfidence has a positive impact on agents’ reservation prices. In turn, seller’s and buyer’s reservation prices determine if the trade occurs (whenever the buyer’s reservation price is higher than the seller’s one) and, if that is the case, the transaction price, which is the outcome of the bargaining process. The side of the market that is overconfident matters, when one looks at the likelihood of trading. While buyer’s overconfidence has a positive impact on the likelihood of trading, because sellers are more willing to exchange, profiting from their information advantage, the seller’s overconfidence has a negative impact, since her excessive reservation price makes buyers more reluctant to exchange. Conditional on trade occurring, overconfidence has always a positive impact on the transaction price, since it positively affects the lower bound and/or the higher bound of the feasible prices range. Focusing on the case of overoptimism, the expected quality of the artworks that are traded is higher, compared to the case in which no bias exists. If the buyer is overconfident, the high price she is willing to pay can convince a reluctant seller to trade the artwork with high expected quality. If the seller is overconfident, trade is less likely, but it can nevertheless occur when the expected quality is indeed high. In the second part of the paper, we move to a market setting, in which many pairs of agents may simultaneously bargain and negotiation is affected by the existence of alternative partners. For that purpose, we introduce a notion of market equilibrium, in which the disagreement outcome becomes endogenous. In a first model in which each side of the market is homogeneous, we find that seller’s market power is affected by the number of sellers and buyers. In particular, a large number of buyers and a small number of sellers increases the seller’s market power, since these conditions imply that buyers have a high probability to wait for a long time before having a new opportunity for a transaction, in case the negotiation breaks down. All the results concerning overconfidence derived for the single encounter extend to the market setting. In addition, we find that the impact of buyer’s (seller’s) overconfidence on prices is low when the number of buyers (sellers) is high, through their effect on seller’s market power. Secondly, we consider a market where a single seller operates, while the buyer side is composed of a heterogeneous population where sophisticated and naïve agents coexist. As expected, we find that the seller can exploit naïve consumers by overcharging them, and the difference in the prices paid by naïve and sophisticated buyers is increasing in the degree of distortion. More interestingly, we find that naïve buyers exert a negative externality on sophisticated ones. The price paid by sophisticated buyers is increasing in the level of distortion and the share of naïve buyers, as they both increase the seller’s expected utility from disagreement in the interaction with a sophisticated buyer, and consequently his market power. Similarly, an increase in the share of sophisticated buyers protects naïve buyers reducing the price they pay. Our paper contributes to several streams of literature. Firstly, we add to the extensive literature on the role of overconfidence in markets. Some of our results can be considered unsurprising given our assumptions. This is the case of the positive impact of overconfidence on prices, leading to misallocation, inefficiencies, and regret. However, the bargaining setting produces also novel insights. In particular, overconfidence can lead to a higher or lower likelihood of trade, depending on the side of the market that has biased beliefs. It also has a positive impact on expected quality, for the goods that are traded, although weaker than the corresponding price increase. We also observe that ours is not the first model including a role for overconfidence in bargaining. In particular, there is a burgeoning literature, including Yildiz (2003, 2004) and Galasso (2010), and surveyed by Yildiz (2011), that considers non-cooperative bargaining models, in which overconfidence refers to aspects of the bargaining process. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that considers overconfidence and bargaining in a market equilibrium and the first application to the art market. This allows identifying a specific mechanism for the emergence of positive or negative externalities across buyers characterized by different degrees of sophistication, a recurrent theme in the literature on behavioral industrial organization (Armstrong, 2015). Secondly, our paper contributes to the literature on artworks’ price formation mechanisms. Velthuis (2003) focuses on the price formation mechanism of art galleries and identifies the existence of a set of rules (“pricing scripts” or “pricing norms”) dealers follow where the price is never decreased but it can be discounted. Gallery owners are willing to negotiate the amount of discount on the posted price, and each gallery will handle it differently. When galleries post a price, a bargaining process on discounts of posted prices occurs between the dealer and the buyer (Angelini  & Castellani, 2018), even though the actual discounted amount is private information. A model of competition among galleries in line with Velthuis’s pricing scripts has been developed by Schönfeld  & Reinstaller (2007), while Cellini  & Cuccia (2014) analyze price formation considering the artist and the art dealer as part of the same market channel. Despite the anecdotal evidence on selling methods (Grant, 2013) and cognitive biases in agents’ behavior (Ragai, 2018), cultural economics studies lack a comprehensive theory that analyzes the role of beliefs over the artistic quality of an artwork in its price formation process, as the “behavioral economics of culture” is still in its infancy (Coate  & Hoffmann, 2022). Within this literature, we bring insights on how cognitive biases can affect bargaining, as developed by recent studies from the behavioral industrial organization (Spiegler, 2011). In addition, our framework allows us to take into account the differences between the tiers of the art market.Footnote 2 The high-end art market hosts more sophisticated agents and concerns trades of higher-quality pieces, for which information is more likely to be available and when it is not, agents are more willing to spend money or time to collect it given the higher value of the traded objects. Low-tier market hosts pieces with less available information, more brief known history, and less well-defined quality, such as emerging artists’ works, pieces with unknown or dubious provenance, and artworks with a higher likelihood of misattribution than those in the high tier. Therefore, in contrast with many papers of the current literature on this topic, our analysis develops results that mostly apply to the low-tier art market. The scope of our paper depends also on the factors that our model does not consider, such as seller’s reputation, the role of experts, who can help increase the information available to the agents, or that of auction houses as agents that both trade and share information through their catalogs. The latter, in particular, are key players in the high-tier market. For them, reputation is a fundamental asset to preserve. The low-end market is instead mostly hosted by galleries and dealers, bargaining is more likely to be observed, and reputation tends to have a less prominent role. Finally, we contribute to the debate on the role of information in cultural economics (McCain, 1980). Over the last decades, the literature has posited several definitions of artworks based on the level of information the agents possess, referring to cultural goods as experience goods (Blaug, 2001; Krueger, 2005), indeterminate goods (Lupton, 2005), meta-credence goods (Ekelund et al., 2020), or trust goods (Zorloni, 2013). In this paper, we apply the more general notion of “exogenous quality good” to artworks, as introduced by Candela  & Cellini (1998). Within this strand of literature, our contribution is one of the first models which consider how information interacts with biased beliefs using an analytical approach, a fact that possibly adds new tools for the comprehension of the complex role of information in this particular market. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present our conceptual framework on the role of (dis)information in the art market, with a specific focus on the notion of overconfidence. In Sect. 3, we set up our model of art pricing, considering first the impact of overconfidence on trading and price in the bilateral buyer-seller relationship, when agents are risk neutral and risk averse, to move then to a market setting. Sect. 4 concludes, by also pointing out a few empirical implications and possible extensions of our model.",

It is an important step on the path towards achieving sustainable goals (Morone 2018) and therefore a relevant mission for regional, national and European public policies (Befort 2020). In particular, the bioeconomy may foster competitiveness, sustainable economic growth and job creation in rural and industrial areas (Vivien et al. 2019). It is expected to reduce dependence on traditional fossil-based feedstocks (Hurmekoski et al. 2019) and to promote the utilization of locally sourced wastes and residues (Agovino et al. 2019), in support of the circular economy (Zabaniotou and Kamaterou 2019; Zotti and Bigano 2019). Although the bioeconomy is generally viewed as a positive “comprehensive societal transition”, potential trade-offs and negative impacts have also been recognized. Specifically, in addition to the rather well-known concerns surrounding the sustainability of the bioeconomy, food security, land grabbing, change in direct and indirect land use and other issues have been raised (see Choi et al. 2019; Falcone and Imbert 2019). Researchers have emphasized that the development of the bioeconomy is likely to place increased pressure on water bodies and natural ecosystems, and that this might limit any reduction in emissions (Pfau et al. 2014). Moreover, when considering sustainable transitions, regional differences must be considered (Ingrao et al. 2018). The sustainable development of regional bioeconomy systems is becoming increasingly difficult to evaluate (Ronzon and Sanjuán 2020). In particular, as Wohlfahrt et al. (2019) identified, any evaluation must incorporate the circularity of matter and energy, the strategies and concerns of various categories of stakeholders, different spatial and temporal scales involved in the value chain, the effects of exogenous drivers (e.g. policies and regulations) and the interactions between these aspects. In investigating the urgency of the transition from a fossil- to a bio-based economy, some works have focused on environmental aspects (Brizga et al. 2019), while others have referred to socio-economic dimensions (Jarosch et al. 2020) and still others to environmental-economic perspectives (Jander et al. 2020). Finally, some have included all three pillars of sustainability (Egenolf and Bringezu 2019). In the present study, we assessed socio-economic dimensions, following a defined line of research underlying that the monitoring systems of the bioeconomy should quantify the socio-economic developments across various sectors (Ronzon et al. 2020). Currently, the literature is lacking multi-dimensional studies of the socio-economic impact of such systems (Sanz-Hernández et al. 2019). Ronzon and M’Barek (2018) provided a socio-economic assessment of the bioeconomy performance of European countries based on an analysis of the number of workers, turnover and value added in several bioeconomy sectors. Starting with this analysis, a new socio-economic indicator for the bioeconomy (SEIB) was introduced by D’Adamo et al. (2020a, b). The SEIB was created using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and two variants were provided to define the impact of innovative sectors. Notably, in conducting a comparison of the bioeconomy performance of several countries, Capasso and Klitkou (2020) focused their attention on specific regions, underlying the need for a new socio-economic indicator to measure the regional performance of bioeconomy sectors. Against this background, the present study aimed at evaluating regional performance related to the bioeconomy. Specifically, we examined the case of Italy—a country with a historically strong economic base in primary production—employing an MCDA technique that, drawing on Istat data and applying the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), enabled the direct comparison of Italian regions. Two versions of the SEIB were applied: the first included all sectors of the bioeconomy while the second considered only manufacturing and bio-energy sectors, excluding all primary sectors. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a review of the literature. Section 3 describes the materials and methods; Sect. 4 presents the results while Sect. 5 discusses the main findings. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes and illustrates some limitations of the work.",26

The role of time perception reconsidered,October 2022,Chiara Franco,Claudia Ghisetti,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Sustainable consumption is nowadays central to reach one of the key objectives of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, along with sustainable production. The attention to the environment is not recent being rooted in the ‘70 s, when international organizations started placing the environment at the centre of the economic and political debate. One of the cornerstones was the publication of the report by Meadows et al. (1972), who analysed the limits within which growth can be compatible with environmental protection. However, heterogeneities can be found both between and within countries in the reactions and behaviours with respect to environmental concerns. Recent research efforts have studied how to better stimulate pro-environmental choices in consumers, as their actions are found to have a great potential in reducing environmental pressure (Dietz et al., 2009). However, it is not always the case for a pro-environmental behaviour to be matched with its correspondent underlying value and becoming an action, although there is evidence (e.g. various editions of the Eurobarometer, 2012, 2017) of positive environmental attitudes by consumers. Certain constraints may limit consumers’ decision process, making them unable to act according to their environmental concern. Those constraints may pertain to the lack of objective economic and technological factors, e.g. no possibility to recycle due to the lack of infrastructure and services; but they may also refer to more subjective psychological and social factors that hamper the change of a rooted behaviour. This last set of constraints constitute the focus of this study to help explaining how the thinking and the acting in a pro-environmental way may follow divergent paths. Still, while research on the determinants and consequences of both environmental attitudes and behaviours is well developed, drivers of their alignment or divergence are much less investigated. The motivations for such inconsistency can be manyfold and a coherent theoretical framework furnishing a unified explanation is still lacking (Kollmuss & Agyeman, 2002). This work draws on this recent strand of research that digs deeper into the reasons why consumers do not act in accordance with their environmental beliefs about the environment, i.e. on the so called “Value Action Gap”—VAG. Against standard economics assumption of fully rational consumers that act in a self-interested manner, environmental economics stresses the bounded-rationality nature of consumers when dealing with environmental choices and when responding to policy incentives towards certain pro-environmental behaviours and their tendency to diverge from pure self-interest. Our contributions to the literature are mainly three: first, we focus in a novel way on the scarcely empirically investigated determinants of the discrepancies between attitudes and actions, i.e. the VAG. Following what Chai et al. (2015) underline, most of the initial contributions were mainly theoretical or focused just on a few consumption practices. Second, we emphasize and analyze more deeply two determinants that are both part of the “value” people give to their available time, hereby conceived as an opportunity cost: (i) the direct role of time perception, mediated by the personal job attitude and (ii) the indirect role that contextual factors producing socially accepted norms may have in allowing individuals comparing their own attitudes and behaviours with those that are more widespread, indirectly saving time to gather information and to conform to a certain attitude and/or behavior that is prevalent in that context. Third, using a cross-country dataset over about 16,000 individual level data representatives of more than 30 countries (both developed and developing) coming from the third wave of the World Values Survey (WVS),Footnote 1 we thus provide results that can be generalizable over the years 1995–1998. This rich dataset provides variables on different range of attitudes such as those describing socio-demographic, psychological and even cultural traits. The focus in on the mid ‘90s, a period in which the ecological consciousness was taking shape, offers the opportunity to clarify how time and environment contextual perception were closely linked even in an historical period quite different from the one we are living in. Our empirical exercise, that includes the construction of a measure of discrepancy between environmental attitudes and behaviors, shows that VAG is affected by the perception of time that people experience, that we approximate in two ways: first, by looking at own’s job attitude, drawing—as an element of originality of this paper—on the literature on the so called “work life balance”. We focus on three different indexes that can account, respectively, for the preference given to leisure time, the degree of perfectionism in carrying own’s job, the role of job in giving meaning to one’s life. All these variables may mediate the perception of what we will call, according to existing literature, “time wealth”. Secondly, we built two country level variables to account for the role of the social context in creating social pressure and conformity. Indeed, time may affect VAG in two directions: the availability of “objective” discretionary time is an important determinant both for environmental attitudes (EA) and pro-environmental behaviours (PEB) (e.g. Chai et al., 2015) but also, indirectly, own’s perception of time available and the presence or lack of pressure perceived matters (e.g. Geiger et al., 2021). To change a rooted behaviour or attitude people need time to “reflect” on how to modify their personal habits and concerns. The role of the social context in indirectly guiding both EA and PEB, may facilitate the emergence of an imitation process, through which a pro-environmental social norm becomes rooted in the population. These determinants, while being explored in two distinct fields of research, represent two complementary perspectives on the role of time. Our results, both with respect to the role of job attitude and social context, highlight the importance of both direct and indirect opportunity costs of time in shaping VAG. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes our theoretical framework; Sect. 3 outlines the dataset and the variables; Sect. 4 comments results and robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.",

Hidalgo-Pérez,Benedetto Molinari,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"During the postwar period, wage inequality in the U.S. remained relatively stable until the end of the 1970s, when it began to rise noticeably. [See (Juhn et al., 1993) for wage inequality during the 1980s, (Acemoglu, 2002) and (Lemieux, 2006) during the 1990s, and (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011) during the 2000s.] This evidence stimulated a substantial debate on the concurrent causes that might have led to such an increase, including institutional factors such as declining minimum wages and de-unionization [(Freeman & Katz, 1995), (DiNardo et al., 1996)], greater commercial openness and trade [Acemoglu (2003)], and technological progress biased toward skilled employment [(Juhn et al., 1993)].Footnote 1 Although the latter became the mainstream explanation in the literature, several empirical studies questioned its role as the key determinant of wage inequality by highlighting several aspects of labor market data that appear inconsistent with the theory or that the theory is unable to rationalize. [Freeman and Katz (1995), DiNardo et al. (1996), Buchinsky (1998), Piketty and Saez (2003), Lemieux (2006).] In response to previous criticism, a more nuanced version of skill-biased technical change has been proposed to reappraise the relationship between technology and the labor market. By studying the effects of computers, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), and automated machines on business practice, (Autor et al., 2003)argued that technical change is not generally biased toward any skill but rather is complementary, i.e. directed, to some skills and substitute to others. In particular, technical change creates a comparative advantage for skills complementary to technology (e.g. cognitive skills) with respect to skills substitute to technology (e.g. routine skills), eventually increasing the price of occupational tasks performed with former skills versus those performed with the latter skills.Footnote 2 Later, (Atalay et al., 2018) confirmed that the arrival of ICT in business practice shifted workers away from routine tasks, given that ICT technologies were associated with an increase in nonroutine analytic tasks and a decrease in routine cognitive and routine manual tasks. (Caines et al., 2017)built an index of complex tasks that better captured the degree of substitutability between human labor and automated machines. Conditional on their refined indicator, they established some empirical facts for the U.S. labor market over the 1980–2005 time period: (i) labor has reallocated from less complex to more complex occupations over time; (ii) within groups of occupations with similar task complexity, labor has reallocated to non-routine occupations over time; (iii) there is a positive relationship across occupations between task complexity and wages and wage growth. A subsequent large body of literature tested the effect of routine-biased technical change in the U.S. labor market, showing that employment indeed increased in jobs mostly consisting in technology-complementary tasks and decreased in jobs mostly consisting of technology-substitute tasks [(Acemoglu & Autor, 2011); (Goos et al., 2014)], (Autor & Dorn, 2013) also showed that employment and wages in technology-substitute occupations diminished not only relative to technology-complementary occupations, but also relative to technology-neutral occupations, i.e. those jobs performed with manual skills that cannot be replaced by machines. Eventually, (Graetz & Michaels, 2018) and (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020; Acemoglu et al., 2020)managed to relate directly the installation of automated capital in manufacturing plants (robots) with tasks displacement and reductions of employment in routine jobs. Although the “job polarization” effect of automation achieved broad consensus in the literature, a similar hollowing-out effect on the wage distribution remained more controversial. By using systematic data from the U.S. labor market, (Autor et al., 2006, 2008) showed that occupational tasks are not randomly distributed across the wage distribution, but occupations consisting mostly of technology-substitute tasks are typically placed in the middle echelon of the wage distribution, whereas occupations consisting mostly of technology-complementary tasks are typically placed in the upper echelon, and technology-neutral jobs in the bottom echelon. In addition, they found that composition-adjusted residual wage inequality increased above and diminished below the median wage during the 1990s.Footnote 3 These two pieces of evidence suggested that routine-biased technical change polarized the wage distribution, depressing the wages of middle-income technology-substitute workers while raising that of high-income technology-complementary workers. (Firpo et al., 2011) empirically confirmed the suggestive evidence of Autor et al. by directly estimating the overall effect of occupational tasks on the wage distribution using unconditional quantile regressions. However, by analyzing the evolution of wages in over 250 detailed occupations, (Mishel et al., 2013) questioned this evidence by showing that changes in wage differentials between technology-complementary and technology-substitute occupations were too mild to regard automation as the key determinant of the observed growth in wage inequality. Similar findings were provided by Antonczyk et al. (2018) and Naticchioni et al. (2014), who found no evidence of wage polarization in Germany and the EU, respectively, despite there being a clear pattern of job polarization in those labor markets. More recently, several papers argued theoretically in favor of a “hollowing-out” effect of automation on the wage distribution [(Berg et al., 2018), (Caselli & Alan, 2019), Osorio and Pinto (2020)], but conclusive empirical evidence are still lacking. The contribution of this paper to previous literature is twofold. First, it provides a new perspective on the empirical relationship between automation and wage inequality in the U.S. labor market during the 1990s. It shows that automation has been the key determinant of the observed changes in wage inequality by affecting wage inequality within groups of homogeneous workers, whereas  it had no appreciable effect on the wage differentials between workers performing technology-substitute tasks and workers performing other tasks on duty. These findings are in line with those reported by the aforementioned literature, but we improve upon it because we provide the mixed evidence within a unique empirical analysis. This allows us to identify the different mechanisms through which automation affected the prices of technology-substitute and technology-complementary tasks and, through these channels, inequality among low wages and high wages. Then, the second contribution of the paper is to rationalize the empirical evidence by providing a new theoretical formulation of the routinization hypothesis that adds to the labor demand channel usually conjectured in the literature [e.g. (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019) ] a novel channel based on the effect of automation on the labor supply. The empirical analysis uses systemic data on the U.S. labor market to pursue a decomposition approach that first controls for changes in workers’ observable characteristics, and then separately identifies the effects of variations in the prices of occupational tasks on: (i) changes in wage differentials between worker groups performing different tasks on duty (between-group price effect); (ii) changes in wage inequality within worker groups performing similar tasks on duty (within-group price effect). This decomposition is obtained by estimating the extension proposed by Autor et al. (2005) of Machado and Mata (2005) Counterfactual Quantile Regression [henceforth, CQR].Footnote 4 Data on wages are collected using the May/ORG Census Samples database, supplemented by the fourth edition (1977) and the revised fourth edition (1991) of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Dictionary of Occupational Titles. This database is used to estimate a set of CQR in which wage inequality is explained by workers’ socioeconomic characteristics and tasks intensities performed on duty. According to our results, the decline in wage inequality experienced by workers placed below the 30th percentile is almost entirely explained by a reduction of wage dispersion within the group of workers performing routine tasks on duty. Both the composition effect and the between-group price effect only marginally affected wage inequality in this echelon of the wage distribution. By contrast, the variation in wage inequality among workers placed above the 60th percentile appear to be equally explained by positive between-group and within-group price effects, together with a strong contribution of the composition effect. Regarding the effects of automation, the estimation indicates that the large increase in the price of technology-complementary cognitive tasks has been the single most important driver of both the between-group and within-group price effects among high wages. On the contrary, the decrease in the price of technology-substitute routine tasks crucially determined the negative within-group price effect, but it was inconsequential on the between-group price effect which, in fact, had a negligible impact on wage inequality among low earners. To explain the different effects of automation-related task prices on within-group and between-group wage inequality, in the last part of the paper we develop a task-based model of automation in which workers’ occupational choices are endogenous and respond to changes in task prices. Regarding the labor demand, we follow the literature assuming that routine-biased technical change pushes downward the relative price of technology-substitute tasks and upward that of technology-complementary tasks. Regarding the labor supply, we show that the response of income-maximizing workers to changes in task prices shifts their supply of labor in each task. After an increase in automation, the model argues that (i) labor demand and supply forces operate in the same and negative direction on technology-substitute employment, thus entailing a substantial loss of routine jobs, and (ii) the most skilled routine workers are willing to devote extra effort in obtaining now-better-paid technology-complementary occupations (upward migration), whereas less skilled workers are not able to catch up with learning new technology and prefer to switch to manual occupations (downward migration). The first prediction shows that the model can replicate the “job-polarization” effect of automation, thus serving as model validation. The second prediction yields the key insights on the relationship between automation and wage inequality. In the lower half of the fitted earning distribution, inequality diminishes as in actual data. However, a reduction in routine workers’ wages is not a necessary condition for this to occur because the migration of routine workers toward other jobs is sorted across the skill distribution. The group of surviving routine workers is more homogeneous in terms of skills, thus featuring a more equal distribution of wages (less inequality) even when routine tasks are paid the same price. The effect on cognitive labor is symmetric. In response to automation, the group of workers performing technology-complementary tasks becomes larger and more skill-heterogeneous. Hence, the upward migration pushes upward within-group wage inequality in the upper echelon of the fitted wage distribution. Previous results can be related to the cited literature in the following way. In the empirical analysis, we find that variations in the prices of occupational tasks played a crucial role in determining the observed changes in wage inequality, as pointed out by Firpo et al. (2011) We qualify their results by showing that the price effect of occupational tasks operates on low-wage inequality and high-wage inequality through different channels. Variations in the prices of technology-complementary tasks enhanced wage inequality among high wages both between and within worker groups. Variations in the prices of technology-substitute tasks, instead, affected low wages inequality only within worker groups – i.e., workers with same education and experience and performing the same tasks on duty –, whereas it did not affect wage differentials between technology-substitute and technology-neutral workers, as already found by Mishel et al. (2013) Antonczyk et al. (2018), Naticchioni et al. (2014) Our results show that the reduction in wage inequality observed among low earners ((Autor et al., 2008)) is entirely explained by a smaller wage dispersion within the group of workers performing routine tasks. Using a theoretical model, we rationalize this evidence by suggesting the existence of a sorted migration of routine workers towards other occupations. This relates our paper with (Groes et al., 2015), and (Cortes, 2016), who empirically supported the existence of a sorted migration of high-wage routine workers toward abstract jobs, and low-wage routine workers toward manual jobs. While (Groes et al., 2015) and Cortes focused on the effects of migration on the labor force composition, we argue that this mechanism is important also to explain changes in wage inequality within the group of cognitive workers. Finally, our results conform with the recent findings of Acemoglu et al. (2021), who document a decline in wage inequality for worker groups specialized in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. It should be noted that the additional channel based on the labor supply that our paper suggests is not an alternative, but rather complements the labor demand one on which is usually based the narrative on the effects of automation in the labor market. As final remark, note that the theoretical framework developed in this paper is related to the literature on human capital, education/training, and technology. Although there is a large number of papers studying the effects of technical change on human capital and the labor supply,Footnote 5 few of them focus on the effects of automation on wages through occupational tasks. Acemoglu and Autor (2011), section 3) provides a tasks-based model in which routine-biased technical change affects both labor demand and labor supply. Our framework differs from that because agents in our model are heterogeneous in only one dimension, whereas Acemouglu and Autor’s agents are heterogeneous in a multiplicity of skills, each suitable for a specific task.Footnote 6 (McIntosh & Steven, 2013) addresses the problem of understanding the effect of automation on the labor market as a demand and supply issue, but he acknowledges that there is not enough research in this direction. Hsieh et al. (2019) uses in a general-equilibrium context a model similar to our partial-equilibrium one to explain the allocation of talents over different occupations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2.1 presents the data and Sect. 2.2 reports the results of the Counterfactual Quantile Regressions. Section 3 dwells on the insights of the empirical analysis regarding the effects of automation on wage inequality. To rationalize this evidence, Sect. 4 presents a model of the labor market in which workers are allowed to choose among technology-complementary, technology-substitute or technology-neutral occupations, each of which entails different learning costs. Then, Sect. 4.3 characterizes the effects of automation on the wage distribution and shows how they mimic the empirical evidence encountered in Sect. 3. Section 5 concludes.",

This concern is reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in which environmental sustainability impacts 7 out of 17 goals (goals 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). SDGs acknowledge that the target cannot be reached with “two hands” only (market mechanisms and enlightened institutions acting as benevolent planners) since citizens’ and corporations’ preferences for responsible (environmentally sustainable) consumption and production (SDG goal 12) play a crucial role in the perspective of a Partnership for the Goals (SGD goal 17). Consistent with this theoretical and institutional framework, in several countries, national governments are trying to use fiscal policies to strengthen market agents’ incentives to switch from high-carbon to low-carbon production and consumption. Climate change-related fiscal policies use several instruments (tax allowances, tax deductions, subsidies) that generally aim to increase (reduce) tax pressure on activities with a high (low) carbon footprint. By modelling these two choices, it is possible in principle to design budget-balanced policies, including both tax and subsidy measures, or otherwise stressing more than one of the two aspects (i.e., only subsidies), with obvious consequences in terms of government expenditure. The importance of the above described “multiple hand” approach involving the active participation of citizens and corporations and the political consensus needed for implementing fiscal policies for climate change mitigation motivate the importance of an enhanced focus of economic research on climate change preferences and, more specifically, on preferences for climate change policies. In our paper, we aim to contribute to this literature by focusing on the specific issue of preferences for climate change policies, thereby providing a contribution from an original specific angle to a literature that focuses more in general on climate change preferences (e.g., beliefs about climate change, opinions about the anthropogenic causes of it, willingness to pay to mitigate it). More specifically, we focus on the ample and detailed information provided in the European Social Survey about the respondents’ two separate opinions regarding taxing fossil fuels and subsidizing renewable energy sources. Our first descriptive goal is to see the distribution of consensus for the softer bonus-only approach (only subsidies on renewable sources) against consensus for the harder bonus/malus approach (both taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on renewable sources) across countries, the month of the interview, gender, age, income, education and political orientation. In the second part of the paper, we develop an econometric model to identify drivers that significantly affect such preferences. In the final part of our work, we discuss our findings and draw policy implications regarding the most effective fiscal policies to address climate change given the observed preference structure. The paper is divided into eight sections. In the second section, we provide a short survey of the literature on climate change preferences. In the third section, we outline our research hypotheses. In the fourth section, we provide a theoretical underpinnings of the research hypotheses. In the fifth section we describe our data. In the sixth section, we present our descriptive and econometric findings with their robustness checks, while in the seventh section, we discuss their policy implications. In the eighth section, we conclude the paper.",

Italy offers a compelling case: the south accounts for a disproportionate amount of the country’s 30% tax gap, which cost Italy €107.5 billion in 2016 (Salzano & Speciale, 2019). In addition, tax evasion rates are as much as three times higher in the south than in the north (Fiorio & Zanardi, 2008; see also Barone and Mocetti, 2011; Becchetti et al., 2017; Albarea et al., 2020). This large and consistent regional divide is frequently attributed to culture (Russo, 2013; D’Attoma, 2017, 2019; Hein, 2020; Hien, 2020)—an approach rooted in 60 years of research locating the source of southern Italy’s many problems in social “backwardness,” often referred to as amoral familism (Banfield & Fasano, 1958; Putnam, 1993; Bigoni et al., 2016).Footnote 1 In their influential contribution “The Moral Basis of a Backward Society,” Banfield & Fasano (1958) argued that the origin of the north–south gap in Italy lies in the moral flaws of southerners, who are only concerned about their welfare and that of their immediate family members with no regards for anyone else. Building on this literature, we compare taxpayers in two Italian regions: Emilia Romagna in the north and Campania in the south. We selected these regions for two main reasons. First, they have long been ranked at opposite extremes on tax compliance. According to the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (2021, p. 14), Campania is one of the Italian regions with the highest GDP-adjusted evasion rate (19.8% in 2018), whereas Emilia Romagna is among those with the lowest GDP-adjusted evasion rate (11.2% in 2018). Second, the two regions stand at opposite poles in terms of some proxies of social capital that might affect taxation-related behavior (Cartocci, 2007; Buonanno et al., 2009; Crescenzi et al. 2013; Bigoni et al., 2016; Casari et al., 2018; Alfano & Ercolano, 2021). Those proxies include trust in institutions and perceived quality of government: for both variables, Campania is at the lowest end of the spectrum, while Emilia Romagna is near the top (Teorell et al., 2011; Charron et al., 2013, 2014; Fazio et al., 2018; D’Attoma, 2019, p. 120).Footnote 2 Although both regions are subject to many of the same national formal institutions, Emilia Romagna and Campania differ significantly in their perceptions of fairness and legitimacy in government institutions (D’Attoma, 2019; D’Agostino et al., 2021).Footnote 3 If culture affects tax compliance and responsiveness to varying tax policies, subjecting both groups to the same tax compliance game should result in statistically significant behavioral differences (Ottone et al., 2018; D’Attoma, 2019).Footnote 4 In other words, if individuals with identical incomes and risk preferences face the same incentives in a tax compliance decision, then any differences in compliance or responsiveness to incentive changes would be due to differences in culture. Our results reveal no significant variation in overall tax evasion between northern and southern Italians. The only significant regional difference we find is that southern taxpayers are less responsive than northerners to increases in redistribution of tax revenues. This suggests the limited explanatory power of culture in tax compliance, and points toward institutional explanations, underscoring divergent regional experiences of state institutions as an explanatory variable. Our findings are novel in two respects. First, they provide insight at the level of regional disparities within nations, which remains “a rather neglected area of research” (Brosio et al., 2002, p. 259; see also Knoll & Griffith, 2003; Albouy, 2009; Rattsø & Stokke, 2017). This neglect is particularly pronounced in comparison to the extensive cross-national literature questioning culture’s role in taxpayer behavior [e.g., Alm & Torgler, 2006; Torgler & Schneider, 2007; Lewis et al., 2009; Lefebvre et al., 2015; Guerra & Harrington, 2018; Ottone et al., 2018; Pampel et al., 2019; Guerra & Harrington, 2021 (for a review)]. Second, we contribute a robust test of the culture hypothesis by drilling down from the collective to the individual level of analysis. We look not only at the average compliance rate between regions (as in D’Attoma, 2019), but—uniquely—at the sensitivity of individuals in those regions to changes in tax structures thought to be influenced by culture. Whether culture can influence behavioral responses to changes in tax system parameters has remained thus far underexplored. Some insights come from Ottone et al. (2018), who investigated how people from Italy and Sweden react in the laboratory to the same changes in two institutional features of the tax system: redistribution of tax revenues, and tax rates (from 10 to 30 to 50%). They found that participants from both countries as well as from different locations within the same country (Milan, Bologna, and Rome in Italy), reacted similarly to changes in redistribution and tax rates. This suggests that institutional features play a more relevant role than cultural factors in determining taxpayers’ behavior. However, no laboratory in the south of Italy was involved in Ottone et al.’s (2018) experiment. Hence, while this evidence provides a baseline argument to further investigate this topic, it does not allow us to develop precise hypotheses on how culture could affect the sensitivity of individuals in the north versus south of Italy to changes in tax structures. As is common in these cases, we adopt an inductive approach: we let results emerge from our data without any prior theory or hypothesis to be tested (Amore et al., 2022). Regarding tax policies, we consider not only redistribution and tax rates but—differently from Ottone et al. (2018) and D’Attoma (2019)—also audit probability, which our results show has a much stronger positive impact on tax compliance than tax rates and redistribution. Our findings innovate with respect to Ottone et al. (2018) and D’Attoma (2019) in showing that taxpayers in the north and south—while behaving alike in terms of average compliance rates—exhibit different sensitivity to a specific change in tax structures: those in the south are less responsive to greater redistribution than those in the north.",

Franzoni (1996) identifies three types of tax amnesty: –Return amnesty: it allows taxpayers to adjust their tax returns and pay a reduced penalty on the due amount, without preventing subsequent audit and control activities from tax authorities; –Investigation amnesty: it offers immunity from administrative actions in exchange for the payment of a determined amount (amnesty fee); –Prosecution amnesty: it grants a total or partial reduction of penalties to already-identified tax evaders in the aim of simplifying procedures and putting an end to judicial proceedings before tax authorities. Among the main purposes for enforcing tax amnesty (Baer & Le Borgne, 2008) are certainly those related to the immediate revenue needs, the offshore capital repatriation, but also the encouragement of tax compliance, so to raise tax revenues in the medium-long term. Moreover, tax amnesty may help to ‘reset’ the system (i.e. reorganise the piling up of tax liability) before a tax reform. Recent national measures have repeatedly called attention to the clearance of debt collectors’ stock – for example, with the ‘full and final settlement agreement’ (saldo e stralcio) of tax bills – since the current legal framework requires twenty years to pass before debts are written off as irrecoverable.Footnote 1 Notwithstanding their frequent use and supposed advantages, amnesty programmes still constitute a controversial issue: in fact, despite the immediate revenue increase and the return of part of tax evaders back into the system, their medium and long-term effects are debateable. Scholars generally agree that tax amnesty alone negatively impacts on individual compliance, and that without the concurrent implementation of more stringent enforcement actions aimed at modifying the cost of evasion, it is very plausible that tax amnesty participants will still avoid taxes, and taxpayers will interpret the mitigating measure as a sign of weakness on the authorities’ part (Alm & Beck, 1990; Baer & Le Borgne, 2008). In addition, it is of paramount importance to prevent the taxpayer expectations of future interventions from reducing tax compliance in the long run (Luitel & Sobel, 2007); indeed, repeated tax amnesties weaken the psychological costs of evasion – increasing a perceived sense of inequity among honest taxpayers, with the risk of ‘legitimising’ evasion (Nar, 2015). As to tax revenue, economic models confirm how, in the lack of subsequent enforcement actions, the possible positive impact of tax amnesty may be offset by more avoidance and less compliance in the long run (Andreoni, 1991; Fiorentini & Martina, 1997; Stella, 1989). Empirical research has sought to confirm the expected effects for different national and socio-economic contexts. By and large, these surveys highlight how tax amnesties, without additional reforms or legislative-administrative measures aimed at strengthening the tax system, will probably have a negative impact in the long run (Alm & Beck, 1993; Alm & Malézieux, 2021; Alm et al., 1990; Bernasconi & Lapecorella, 2006; López-Laborda & Rodrigo, 2003). This paper analyses a database built on car tax billsFootnote 2 issued in Tuscany, and investigates how the introduction of a prosecution amnesty (definizione agevolata) can impact on tax revenues, as well as on the compliance of defaulting taxpayers, i.e. those who had already received the payment notice and had been enrolled in the tax register. The revenue increase has been estimated in 11 million euros, a non-negligible sum if referred to the ordinary annual revenue, but of very limited extent if compared to the 817 million euros of accrued tax bills (only 1.6% of the total unpaid amount). Regarding compliance, by using a difference-in-difference analysis, we estimate that those who participated in the amnesty reduce by 5.3% the payment of the post-amnesty tax bills. This is probably due to the fact that at least a part of these individuals chooses not to pay directly but wait in the expectation of future tax concessions. These estimates of the effects on revenue and compliance constitute an important empirical work because it analyses, on real micro data, the effects of the prosecution tax amnesty for the first time for Italy. Obviously, the results can be extended with caution due to the tax specificity, and the database built only for a single region and on those who received at least one tax notice in the observation period. The paper is organised as follows: after this introduction, Sect. 2 describes the framework of car taxation, the related executive action rules set by the Revenue Agency, and the specific policy of prosecution amnesty under analysis. Section 3 illustrates the dataset, whereas Sect. 4 analyses the revenue effect and Sect. 5 provides an estimation of the compliance effect, i.e. the likelihood that tax cheaters will settle their bills in the future. Section 6 draws some conclusions.",

However, this rather strong correlation is particularly puzzling in the light of Austrian programmatic Wertfreiheit. If their economics is to be genuinely wertfrei (in particular, free of any underlying principles of justice),Footnote 2 then we should naturally expect some Austrian economists to be socialists, some to be outright communists and still others classical liberals or libertarians for that matter. Consequently, we somehow sensed that this intimate link between political libertarianism and Austrian economics cannot be a mere contingency. Rather, we presumed that there should be some implicit conceptual connection between the two. That the above is indeed the case is most conspicuously evinced in the Rothbardian ([1956] 2011) reconstruction of welfare economics as well is in its subsequent defenses.Footnote 3 Having said that, the entire Austro-libertarian edifice seems to be caught in a predicament. On the one hand, Rothbard and (much later) Herbener purport to provide a distinct economic argument for free market from efficiency.Footnote 4 And their pretenses notwithstanding, as we are about to see, their agenda fails as the idea of mutually beneficial exchanges they employ presupposes the free market. The above statement holds true since both authors find voluntariness of a given exchange sufficient to make it mutually beneficial, with voluntariness being defined solely in terms of the absence of right-violating acts or proposals. But if that is so, then it is the free market as a rights-respecting regime alone that necessitates mutually beneficial exchanges only. However, given this tight conceptual link between property rights and beneficial exchanges, whether the free market is efficient or not is not an open question any longer. The avowed economic case for the free market proves to be just an illusion. Instead, upon final analysis, the Rothbardian welfare economics merely reaffirms the author’s natural-rights-based defense of the free market provided elsewhere (e.g. Rothbard, [1973] 2006). In fact, the Rothbardian welfare economics is not just an isolated case wherein justice-related considerations are inextricably intertwined with Austrian economics. In fact, the general case for the existence of Austro-libertarianism can easily be made. To illustrate our point, let us just cite some of the most conspicuous realms of Austrian economics presupposing the libertarian ethic. For instance, Austrian entrepreneurship theory (e.g. Kirzner, 1973) rests on the assumption that entrepreneurs discover temporarily undervalued means (relative to the ends attainable therewith) while voluntarily (i.e. under the condition of respecting rights) interacting with other actors. Similarly, there are Austrians whose monopoly theory takes monopoly to be essentially a result of the government illegitimately bestowing trading privileges (e.g. Rothbard, [1962] 2009). Moreover, Austrian business cycle theoryFootnote 5 (e.g. Huerta de Soto, [1998] 2006) interestingly relies on normative considerations (viz. banks acting unrightfully lending depositors’ money). Furthermore, Austrian definition of inflation (e.g. Hülsmann, 2008) also characteristically presupposes governmental violence, and is hence also normatively tinted (viz. being rights-based). Eventually, Rothbard ([1962] 2009, p. lvi) himself conceived of exchanges as inseparable from the notion of property rights, while claiming that “[e]xchange cannot be adequately analyzed until property rights are fully defined”. Just to reiterate, it is in this sense that we can validly speak of Austro-libertarianism. To wit, there are scholars, such as the ones mentioned above, who combine the Austrian positive reasoning with the libertarian ethic of property rights. However, we take no issue with the mere fact that many Austrian theories simply assume this ethic.Footnote 6 Quite the contrary, this very fact in and of itself is not damaging at all, for Austrian economics might simply take the libertarian theory of justice as a given and then proceed with purely positive considerations, while spelling out logical consequences of the former. But then again, the most sensitive spot of Austro-libertarianism is Austrian welfare economics. For Austrian welfare theory to be meaningful, it must relate the regime of property rights (the libertarian prong) to welfare, with the latter being identified by Austrians with actual preference satisfaction (e.g. Mises, [1949] 1998, pp. 94–97). To make Austrian welfare economics informatively contribute to the study of welfare on the free market, we argue that we should clearly distinguish between two types of good. First, in order to fit nicely within Austro-libertarian framework, Austrian welfare economics should take the libertarian ethic of private property rights for granted. And secondly, it should focus on the actual preference satisfaction, which economists at large usually take to be constitutive of welfare (see: Hausman, 2012; Wight, 2015). And only then, we can meaningfully probe the problem of how the free market relates to actual preference satisfaction without begging any question in favor of the former. Furthermore, while keeping to the uncompromising spirit of the libertarian theory of justice (see Block, 2017; Hoppe, 1993; Nozick, [1974] 1999; Rothbard, [1982] 2002),Footnote 7 we shall take justice as lexically prior to welfare,Footnote 8 with the former being a non-tradable good weighing infinitely more than welfare. The present paper proceeds in the following order: in Sect. 2 we provide an overview of the general concepts of justice and welfare as well as probe the possible relations between the two. Having done so, we try to identify the specifically Austro-libertarian notions of justice and welfare. In Sect. 3, we subject Austrian welfare economics to critical scrutiny. In Sect. 4, we hint at some formal requirements that Austrian welfare economics should satisfy to coherently fit within Austro-libertarianism as well as to be able to informatively study market efficiency. Section 5 concludes.",
40,2,Economia Politica,04 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-022-00275-7,Inequality assessment in a dynamic framework with heterogenous agents,July 2023,Arsen Palestini,Giuseppe Pignataro,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The rapid increase of income inequality in the past few decades is one of the most problematic issues widely discussed in the public debate. In most countries, capital accumulation has dramatically raised at the top wealth level, while consumption and savings have substantially decreased for the majority of the population. Such difference contributes to worsening income inequality in most western countries and creates the need to understand the origin and the changes in the income distribution. Figure 1 shows for instance the constant increase in the trend of income inequality in Italy in the last years. Inequality in Italy: 2003–2017 Investigating their dynamic evolution is indeed necessary for policy targets aiming to control and even potentially reverse this trend justifying even public policy instruments like consumption or labor taxes. So far, however, there has been little work in the inequality literature that explicitly takes into account the evolution of the income inequality over time. It is the purpose of the present paper to make some progress in this direction, while modeling the different impact of initial wealth conditions on the unfair patterns of income distribution measured by the inequality index. When considering a dynamic scenario, where the relevant income sources are functions of time, some different questions may arise: which are the most appropriate models to take into account for the evaluation of inequality over time? Is there a way to guarantee that the resulting inequality verifies its dynamic properties? Which elements of the model should be modified or manipulated to implement a policy aiming to reduce inequality or to keep income inequality below a certain threshold? And above all, can an inequality reduction issue be inserted into a typical payoff maximization problem? First, we study some general conditions on capital accumulation that allow for a monotonic rise of income inequality over a finite time interval. The choice of a finite horizon model may seem unusual in this kind of literature, but we strongly uphold that it is useful and economically relevant to analyze the behavior of the accumulation of wealth to understand its effect in some short time periods. In this way, a better strategy for income inequality reduction can be addressed. Typically, governments and decision makers have to decide their strategies over a small number of years, consequently it makes sense to keep inequality under control during small periods. In our framework, we can observe how heterogeneity of initial wealth conditions influences the evolution of the optimal income value function of each agent and how much it contributes to the overall inequality. Second, inspired by the model of Lindner and Strulik (2004), we propose an optimisation problem where each agent maximises intertemporal utility from consumption and labour starting from different capital endowments. A natural consequence of this structure is that it is possible to apply an economic policy leading to the reduction of income inequality in the future periods. Plausible changes in consumption and labour tax may have a significant effect on the unfair distribution. Therefore we study the time paths of taxes and accumulated capital according to the optimal choice of a social planner. In particular, we focus on two policy options. First, the social planner may be interested in the reduction of income inequality under a specific target, or second, it can try to realise the process of minimising inequality after a time span. The formal model developed below further generates some new technical insights. First, the dynamics of income inequality is captured according to the Gini coefficient. We define its properties under a dynamic context when the flow of the optimal income value functions are linear in the state variables of the model at hand. Introducing heterogeneity of initial wealth conditions as different endowments for each agent allows for establishing some general criteria for the monotonicity of the income functions over time. We then modify a typical growth model emphasizing the aspect of dynamic redistribution. We thus calculate agents’ optimal value functions in closed form, so that inequality assessment can be performed and observed in a finite time interval. When such an option is possible, a policymaker observes the amount of capital accumulation and conceives a taxation strategy to minimise it or to prevent its excessive increase. Such a taxation is 2-dimensional because it is supposed to affect both labour and capital. Note that the purpose of our policy interventions is to reduce the inefficient allocations in an equality of opportunity perspective. In this view, labour source is considered as the variable of responsibility of individuals, while capital source is interpreted as a general family legacy which requires a dynamic intervention from the government. We do not aim to capture the general equilibrium effects but can provide a complete landscape in partial setting on how the government should play introducing a taxation frame on the determinants of income inequality. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first contribution that applies the concept of inequality issue into an optimal control structure. A fuller review of the related research with proper comparisons of the procedures is postponed in the next section. We finally observe how our model may have implications for empirical testing. For instance, using historical data, the model can be used as a predictor too, thus discovering the relative effect of the various parameters on expected income inequality. See Iacono and Ranaldi (2020) as a first contribution that addresses this concern in Italy for the period 1989-2016. Such line of investigation may constitute a fertile ground for future research. The organisation of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the main contributions of the literature, while Sect. 3 sets up the basic structure of the Gini coefficient and establishes general properties on the monotonic evolution of income inequality. In Sect. 4, we propose a modified version of Lindner and Strulik (2004), and we determine the optimal value function for each agent in a finite time horizon. Section 5 applies such methodology proposing two policy interventions for reducing inequality. Section 6, finally, discusses the main results and concludes.",

Violent events are hard to predict and difficult to counter as they propagate in unforeseeable directions. One major concern is the prospect of conflicts in regions of the world that are vulnerable to climate events and, also, prone to social instability. The goal of the present paper is to develop an empirical strategy that allows addressing unobservable sources of heterogeneity in the climate-conflict nexus. This allows better disclosing temporal and spatial mechanisms that are relevant for integrating climate adaptation policies with peacekeeping actions to fruitfully exploit potential ancillary benefits or to mitigate negative side-effects. We focus on Africa, a continent that is home to some of the most conflict-ridden regions in the world according to Croicu and Sundberg (2017). Empirical evidence suggests a correlation between changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, that have the effect of worsening living conditions of African populations in vulnerable areas, and the breakout of violence (Dell et al., 2014). The acceleration of climate change in such a precarious context exacerbates tensions and gives way to repeated armed conflicts as well as massive migratory movements (Daccache et al., 2015; Hendrix & Glaser, 2007; Marchiori et al., 2012; Maystadt et al., 2015). At the general level, changes in weather conditions present both direct and indirect impacts on human beings (Buhaug, 2015; Burke et al., 2015). Direct effects can be envisaged in the increase of violent behaviours associated to higher temperatures given that people become more nervous, or in the conflicts for access to water when extreme drought conditions directly harm human livelihood. Indirect effects are explained by the impacts on anthropogenic activities as in the case of agriculture, or reduction in land fertility or diseases diffusion, which in turns foster competition over scarce resources and at the end cause battles and wars. In the context of developing countries, agriculture is unquestionably the sector most exposed to climate variability (Raleigh et al., 2015). Together with agriculture, the joint increase in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns often leads to more severe drought conditions, also influencing the livestock sector by inducing changes in prices or pastoralism displacement with a consequent increase in competition on land-use (Maystadt & Ecker, 2014). Water access is another channel responsible for linkages between conflicts and weather-induced water scarcity since the control over water resources is an instrument of war for both offensive and defensive purposes (Gizelis & Wooden, 2010). The occurrence of climate-related shocks increases the risk of armed-conflict outbreak under certain socio-economic conditions, as for instance a high degree of ethnic fractionalisation (Schleussner et al., 2016), or the cultural specialisation of the affected ethnic group into activities that are particularly vulnerable to climate risks (van Uexküll et al., 2016). A recent and comprehensive literature review by Koubi (2019) points out that the debate on whether changes in climatic conditions systematically increases risk of conflict or magnitude is still open. Some studies point to a link between increasing temperature, or decreasing precipitation, and armed conflicts (Fjelde & von Uexkull, 2012; Hendrix & Salehyan, 2012; Hsiang et al., 2011; Raleigh & Kniveton, 2012) while others find no significant (or direct) impact (Adams et al., 2018; Buhaug, 2010; O’Loughlin et al., 2012; Theisen et al., 2013). Empirical analyses on Africa conversely find that excess precipitation is responsible for rising violence (Klomp & Bulte, 2013; Salehyan & Hendrix, 2014; Theisen, 2012; Witsenburg & Adano, 2009). A contentious, and to some extent unexplored, issue is whether location-specific conditions amplify the effects of changing weather conditions. Scholars concur that resilient communities experience lower risks of violence in certain climate conditions (Buhaug, 2015; Burke et al., 2015; Hsiang, 2016) but empirical research is still inconclusive on the sources of local resilience, partly due to methodological uncertainties (Ide, 2017). The present paper adds to the foregoing debate a novel methodology and empirical evidence on the existence and magnitude of the climate-conflict nexus in Africa with three contributions. First, we propose an econometric approach that overcomes some shortcomings of prior research. Empirical analysis of climate-induced conflicts based on large-N quantitative analysis (Busby et al., 2014) relies on count data that are operationalised in one of two ways: (i) binary information—i.e., whether a territory experiences peace (Y = 0) or conflict (Y = 1)—or (ii) a discrete non-negative variable measuring the number of recorded conflicts in a territory in a time period. Depending on the measure, empirical studies yield contradictory findings even when the same explanatory variables are used. This is because socio-economic, territorial and climate conditions interact in non-linear ways and minor variations in one, or more, of the attendant characteristics can lead to extremely different outcomes. Recent work using linear and non-linear probability models applied to large-N quantitative geo-referenced databases focuses on specific aspects, such as the political status of ethnic groups (Basedau & Pierskalla, 2014; Chica-Olmo et al., 2019), water scarcity (Almer et al, 2017), vulnerability to extreme events (Breckner & Sunde, 2019), short-term impacts of climate change via the agriculture sector (Harari & La Ferrara, 2018) or via the conflict trap (Cappelli et al., 2021), but does not specifically address the potential bias deriving from overdispersion of structural zeros in a large territory. One interesting contribution in this direction is the transition analysis carried by Mack et al. (2021) wherein a logistic regression approach reveals that changes in rainfalls affect the probability that a cell faces above average conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa. In order to control for differences in structural characteristics (i.e., season, geographical position), they apply different models to four regional aggregates. Along with this intuition on the role of structural features in shaping the transition from peace to war, we propose a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model to estimate the influence of local climate conditions and other geographical and socio-economic features both on structural zeros affecting the probability of conflicts and on the magnitude of violence. This empirical framework better accounts for the propensity of violence in small areas even if they have not experienced any conflicts in the past. Additionally, the empirical strategy allows accounting for structural features that might explain conflicts’ outbreak independently from changes in climatic conditions, for instance related to the social instability or institutional failures. In turn, this has the potential of informing policy, both in terms of adaptation strategies as well as peacekeeping actions, by focusing not only on areas that are commonly known as prone to climate-related social disruptions but, also, on peaceful places that would be at risk of violence if climatic conditions worsen. Second, we explore non-linear relationships between the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate-related events and the magnitude of violent conflicts. Such an exercise generates useful insights into the pivotal role of territorial characteristics (Ang & Gupta, 2018; Wischnath & Buhaug, 2014). The connection between climate and natural resource environment is far from trivial because the vulnerability of a territory depends on intervening context-specific features such as the degree of mechanisation in agricultural activities, the quality and quantity of chemical products used or the degree of diffusion of irrigation systems (Bates et al., 2008). The seminal study by Harari and La Ferrara (2018) finds a linear positive correlation between short-term climate shocks during the growing season and the probability of conflict breakouts. Likewise, Almer et al. (2017) report a similar association by analysing the impact of water scarcity on the number of days in which a riot occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa, thus addressing the magnitude of violence as well as its incidence. We build on and extend the above by: (i) measuring climate shocks determined by weather conditions with diversified time scales; (ii) explicitly accounting for local geographical features—as suggested by Anselin (1995)—by distinguishing the impact associated to the direction and to the magnitude of weather variations (Papaioannou, 2016). Our results suggest that the pressure on food availability related to water scarcity increases the number of conflicts only if the drought condition has persisted at least for 3 years prior. On the other hand, excess in rainfalls triggers larger and immediate reactions. This leads us to suggest that such non-linearity should be carefully accounted for when punctual actions for improving the resilience of the agricultural sector are planned. Third, we assess the role of cross-area spillovers on local conflicts. In particular, we estimate for each cell the impact on the magnitude of violence of changes in climate conditions, agricultural yield, and socio-economic features such as income per capita, income inequality and demographic change in neighbouring cells. In so doing, we capture indirect conflict pathways that are difficult to identify in the absence of large-N scale spatial data. The main findings are that long-term growth in temperature and precipitations in the surrounding areas leads to an increase of violent events within the cell by 4–5 times, with a threshold distance of up to 550 km radius. On the opposite, short-term events as floods trigger conflicts only at a narrow local scale with negligible geographical spillovers. This points to a broader approach towards the design of adaptation strategies, namely by accounting for potential ancillary benefits due to the propagation over space of the positive effects of higher climate resilience. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the empirical strategy, in Sect. 3 we present the main empirical results, and in Sect. 4 we present a discussion on policy implications.",6
40,2,Economia Politica,18 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-022-00279-3,Epidemics and policy: the dismal trade-offs,July 2023,Francesco Flaviano Russo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The COVID-19Footnote 1 pandemic will most likely be the defining event of this century: an astonishing number of people died, while the policies implemented to cope with it resulted in major recessions and in a surge of public debt, with potentially severe long-run effects. However it has not been the only large-scale infectious disease event in recent history. Even abstracting from influenza, a recurrent winter event, although not as deadly, and from AIDS, still ravaging, there are at least four others worth mentioning: the first SARS, the Swine Flu, the MERS and Ebola. Faced with a rapidly spreading contagious disease, epidemiologists typically prescribe social distancing, especially if asymptomatic infections are possible, mainly to ease the pressure on hospitals, which might not have enough resources to simultaneously treat all of the infected. Social distancing can be achieved in several ways: shutting down schools, universities, offices, plants, restaurants, bars and shops; closing the national, regional of even the city borders; forcing everyone to stay home; in the extreme limit, confining all of the infected away, alongside those who had contacts with them, as in Saramago’s “Blindness”. Lockdowns are obviously extremely costly. The GDP will plummet if productive activities are closed, leaving many workers without income and many entrepreneurs without cash-flow. Governments typically support both workers and entrepreneurs with transfers, but such deficit-financed policies increase debt and, for the already highly indebted countries, this translates into worse borrowing terms and into a higher probability to implement restrictive fiscal policies in the near future. Moreover, some firms will be forced to shut down even in case of financial aid, and the older, among the unemployed, will no longer be able to find another job. Lockdowns are not the only policy alternative. First, because there is the possibility to let the epidemic unfold without any intervention, to quickly reach herd immunity. A further alternative is the so-called Testing-Tracing-Quarantine (TTQ) policy, which entails identifying and testing all of those who came into contact with the already discovered infected individuals. The main goal of this work is to study the effects of alternative mitigation policies deigned to cope with an epidemic, conditional on the pathogen characteristics and on country-level characteristics. I build a model that nests the structure of a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model (Allen, 2017; Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) within an equilibrium dynamic economic model with heterogeneous agents and firms. Its key feature is that the evolution path of the epidemic, for given policy, is contingent on the identity of the infected individuals, with a resulting variability of potential outcomes that depends on who gets the pathogen at each stage. Moreover, the rich model structure allows to study the design of the mitigation policies in great detail. When comparing policies, I focus on what I define the dismal trade-offs, respectively between lives saved and output lost and between lives saved and debt. I propose two measures to evaluate them: the Output Dismal Ratio (ODR), defined as the average percentage of the population spared for each percentage point of output lost, and the Debt Dismal Ratio (DDR), defined as the average percentage of the population spared for each additional percentage point of public debt. I find that, on average, TTQ policies work best, in the sense that they yield the lowest dismal ratios, although both lockdowns and TTQ policies do not always result in positive ODR and DDR. The gains from both policies are higher in case of more aggressive and more deadly diseases, and at intermediate levels of the treatment capacity of the health system. Moreover, lockdowns are more effective in case of smaller families, bigger firms, denser societies and in case of a more diffused labor market participation. Conversely, TTQ policies, to work properly, must be able to isolate a big fraction of the asymptomatics. In terms of mitigation policy design, I find that lockdowns must be prolonged until the pathogen effective reproduction number (the number of new infections caused by each infected individual) drops below a very small value, and that severe lockdowns, that close a large number of economic activities, are not appropriate if the average firm size is small. Moreover, social-only lockdowns are less costly from a macroeconomic standpoint, but they might be insufficient in case of big average family and firm size. In a two-regions extension of the model, I also show that closing the borders to travel is always beneficial. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. I briefly discuss the related literature in Sect. 2. Section 3 contains the model description, while, in Sect. 4, I fully explain the calibration and simulation details. Section 5 summarizes the main simulation results. In Sect. 6, I explore the robustness of the results. In Sect. 7, I discuss several model extensions. Section 8 concludes. An appendix contains additional results and a brief description of the model solution algorithm.",
40,2,Economia Politica,21 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-022-00277-5,The expertise effect: the impact of legal specialists’ intervention on the timely delivery of laymen's judgments,July 2023,Umberto Nizza,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"France is one of the few countries to rely solely on legally untrained lay assessors (prud’hommes) for the judicial resolution of labor disputes in the first instance. The court in charge of dealing with employment disputes is called Conseil de prud'hommes (CPH), and it is composed of lay judges that are occupationally close to the custom and practices of the parties (Ray & Rojot, 2013). The court was established to solve disputes in a peer-to-peer forum (Lefebvre, 2002) and fulfill a significant social function (Machura, 2001) by imposing a constant dialogue between judges representing bourgeois and proletarians (Mouriaux, 1982). Today, all verdicts still require a cooperative solution that reconciles the views of distant social partners–unionists and employers associations' representatives–into a single co-written judgment. The balance between opposite views is the essence of the mandate of prud’hommes (Boulmier, 2002), and it is crucial for the conservative social order (Michel & Willemez, 2007) and industrial peace (Cottereau, 2002). Nevertheless, while in the past the norm was to settle litigation by pacifying social partners (Barthélémy & Cette, 2015) with a peaceful solution (Kieffer, 1987), the current situation does not allow real negotiations among litigants (Chappe & Doriat-Duban, 2003). A shared verdict would foster the law's protective function and economic efficiency (Barthelemy & Cette, 2015). However, the representation of both employers and employees simultaneously (Orif, 2015), complemented by a politicized judiciary, results in long delays and antagonistic arguments between social partners’ views (Moriaux, 2006). The litigation market before CPHs is, hence, full of unfinished cases (Larivière, 1997). The labor jurisdiction of prud’hommes is the most affected by litigation delays. Despite the smallest number of cases per year, the average processing time of employment cases is approximately triple compared to District Courts (Tribunals d’Instance) and more than double vis-à-vis High Courts (Tribunals de Grande Instance) (see Fig. 1). Average duration of cases (on the left) and new incoming lawsuits (on the right). Note: The Figure shows, graphically, the existing disparity of judicial delay and caseload between the Conseil de prud'hommes (CPH), the Tribunal de Grande Instance (TGI), and the Tribunal d'Instance (TI) in the period 2013 and 2017. (Source: Ministry of Justice) Eventually, all legal actors – plaintiffs, judges, clerks, and administrative staff – complain about the excessive duration of lawsuits among CPHs (Breda et al., 2017). Even though the primary goal of justice is not to convey cases to fast conclusions (Bufford, 1996), excessive legal cases chasing too few judges (Church, 1982) frustrates plaintiffs seeking compensation (Heise, 2000). It further involves significant social costs (Chappe, 2012) in terms of deterrence, accuracy (Fenn & Richmann, 1999), and a higher financial burden on litigants (Connolly & Smith, 1983). The theoretical reasons for litigation delays can be multiple: backlogs (Boyum, 1979), inconsistent jurisprudential case law (Berlemann & Christmann, 2017), complexity and uncertainty of the law (Di Vita, 2007), high procedural and bureaucratic formalism (Djankov et al., 2002), or inadequate calendaring systems (Somerlot et al., 1989) without third-party supervision (Ransom, 1923).Footnote 1 The court burdens taxpayersFootnote 2 more than any other jurisdiction (Serverine, 2012), with delays undermining the ""very essence"" of justice (Vereeck & Mühl, 2000) in diverting judicial resources solely to gain time (Di Vita, 2012). A third crucial issue affecting prud’hommes is that despite the recent legislator's intention to professionalize the judges, they are not compulsorily required to hold a law degree (Ouaissi, 2017). The lay assessors' unfamiliarity with the law translates into a perpetual linguistic and legal insecurity in legal argumentation (Willemez, 2012). Eventually, it exposes judgments to legal flaws (Peskine & Wolmark, 2021), with judgments based on ""humanity and common sense” (Gillet, 2015). In effect, the familiarity of prud’hommes with the industrial subculture is not per se sufficient to impose the structures and rationality that shall inform the legal thoughts of professional jurists (Newman, 1987). Traditional labor law is already challenged by the emergence of new technologies (Todolí-Signes, 2021), new recruiting methods, and atypical labor relations (Goldin, 2020). In recent years, all these difficulties have aggravated the already heated and nervous debates among prud’hommes, creating a real discontent among prud’hommes in doing their work (Béroud & Meynaud, 2021). The net result is that judges have interminable discussions (Masson, 2019), and delays in labor proceedings are notorious (Desrieux & Espinoza, 2019). In this context, in which coherent legal reasoning is required by increasingly complex legal issues (Masclet et al., 1995), it is plausible that legal expertise might impact the final decisions of lay assessors (Martire & Montgomery-Farrer, 2020). Indeed, when courts follow legal cognitive errors, resources are wasted with unnecessary long decisions (Wistrich & Rachlinski, 2013). The prud’hommal ignorance of the law obliges them to recourse frequently to professional legal actors' advice (Bordieu, 1987). In a typical situation, legal technicians (Iweins, 2016) and juridical talents (Kelly, 2009) would seek logical legal argumentation to foster consistency (Schlanger, 2003) and enforceable and theoretically sensible litigation (Cotterrell, 2013). Nevertheless, in the context of prud’hommes, only lawyers and professional judges are qualified individuals with appropriate legal training (Perrin & Gaune, 2010) and informational advantage (Corby et al., 2019). On the one hand, professional judges reduce the number of disputes that cannot be solved (Cavanagh, 1998). On the other hand, lawyers contribute with their experience (Audier, 2016) and skills (Spurr, 1997) in giving valuable advice (Gordon, 2010). The referral to professional judges (départage), acting as a tiebreaker (Desrieux & Espinoza, 2015), should be intended to find a compromise between employees' protection and entrepreneurial needs, end lay assessors' impasses (Hunter-Falck, 2015), and overcome particularly contentious principles of law (Tyl, 2008). The referral to professional judges, however, is costly. From a certain point of view, it increases the marginalization of non-legally qualified judges due to the complexity of the law (Burges et al., 2014) but reduces the historical and cultural context of judgment, elements not per se sufficient to shape judicial opinions (Garofalo, 2011) but essential in the labor domain. At the same time, the natural inclination of lay assessors, lacking legal training, to seek help from jurists to achieve rigorous, logical, and formalistic opinions (Posner, 2001) is costly in terms of time (Desrieux & Espinosa, 2020). In this framework, the role of lawyers in extending lawsuits' timing is unclear.Footnote 3 Empirical evidence suggests that attorneys overburden their law firms with excessive workloads and maintain an unsustainable volume of cases that prolong proceedings (Tahura, 2022). Nonetheless, in a setting in which judgments are delivered in a “non-canonical” way, legal technicians might endorse coherent legal reasoning to overcome legal complexity (Masclet et al., 1995) and create predictable behavioral patterns in the delineation of rights (Buchanan, 1974). Specialized lawyers represent professionals with a long-term perspective (Israël, 2019) and experts in the law's most complex legal and social aspects (Ramseyer & Rasmusen, 2010). Therefore, instead of inducing delay to wear opponent down (De Vos, 2004) and expand disputes (Mather, 2013), specialized lawyers might straightforwardly suggest the logical deductions to be written consistently in the judgments (Steiner, 2018). The net result could ultimately be reduced delays and conflicts in the litigation process among CPHs. To answer these questions, the manuscript tests whether an intensification in referrals to professional judges (départage) and an increase in the concentration of specialized labor attorneys impact the duration of employment litigation, using an innovative dataset consisting of 201 labor courts between 2013 and 2017, and a two-stage least squared estimating method. To instrument the endogenous variables of interest – referrals to professional judges and labor-specialized lawyers – the paper relies on three instrumental variables: the number of notaries per 10.000 inhabitants in 1865, the presence of a law school in the territorial jurisdiction of the court, and the ubiquity of the professional judge and prud’hommes. The results indicate that cases referred from prud’hommes to professional judges extend the litigation timing. At the same time, an increase in the market for specialized attorneys' services has no impact on the litigation pace. The final argument is that experienced jurists' intervention is dependent on many historical factors, and much of the troubles of employment litigation can be identified in structural flaws and unresolved issues. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the endogeneity issues to be tackled in the empirical strategy. Section 3 presents the empirical results discussed in the following Sect. 4, whereas conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5.",

Due to the nature of its activities, food system remains mostly unsustainable both in environmental and social terms. In fact, for a long time the “productivist paradigm” dominated this system (Gaitán-Cremaschi et al., 2019), generating several negative outcomes mainly impacting on the environmental sphere of sustainability “such as land, water, and ecosystem degradation; biodiversity loss; excessive greenhouse gas emissions; persistent malnutrition and hunger and fail to eradicate poverty particularly of rural populations” (El Biali et al., 2019, p.5). However, it is worth noting that other negative outcomes affect food system, a great amount of waste and loss, produced alongside the whole supply chain (Seuring & Müller, 2008; IPSES, 2016; Farooque et al., 2019). Food waste and loss have a great influence on the ecological (un)sustainability of food system; thus, in European Union (EU), the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES) ascertained that about the 20% of the produced food is wasted alongside the whole supply chain. This annually costs about 143 billion euros, including wasted resources and environmental impacts (IPES, 2016). In Italy, about 20 million tons of food is wasted every year, which costs about 12 billion euro per year (FUSIONS, 2016). A possible response to the sustainability issues that affect the system under scrutiny comes from the ecological economics, “an interdisciplinary field focused on issues of sustainable development that have emerged in response to the difficulties in solving the global and local environmental problem” (Shmelev, 2016, p.32). Ecological economics offers an interesting framework for analysing and supporting the transition of different productive system towards sustainability, which has been considered as pointing to meet world population essential needs—such as hunger and poverty—maintaining at the same time the supporting systems and living resources fundamental for planet’s life (National Research Council, 1999). Thus, “population numbers, location, and trends help define a sustainability transition by bounding both the numbers of humans whose needs are to be met and the size of the driving force of threats to the planet’s life support systems” (Kates and Parris, 2003, p.8064). Ecological economics—together with system theory, industrial ecology, regenerative design, performance economy, cradle to cradle, and biomimicry (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013; Ghisellini et al., 2016; Winans et al., 2017)—is at the core of Circular Economy (CE), which offers “tools to enhance and optimize for sustainability within the Western food system” (Jurgilevich et al., 2016, p.2). It follows that the implementation of CE strategies can contribute to make resources’ use more efficient and effective at all the stage of a supply chain (Borrello et al., 2017; Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018), also counteracting waste and loss occurring from production to retail and even to consume (Alamar et al., 2018; Richards & Hamilton, 2018). In doing so a step forward the transition toward sustainability—a future-oriented process that Sorman and Giampietro (2013) considered non-voluntary, and which needs to be forced and directed by international and national institutions—can be taken also enacting CE strategies (Buch‐Hansen, 2018). In this sense, it is worth noting that the literature on circular economy strategy for food system sustainability is still in its infancy (Batista et al., 2018; De Angelis et al., 2018; Howard et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018).Therefore, this study aims at contributing to bridge this gap further investigating the potential of CE strategies in supporting the transition of food supply chains towards sustainability (Genovese et al., 2017). A general, simple, but essential question inspired this work, the enactment of CE strategies can contribute to make food industry and its supply chains sustainable? If yes, how? To address this question, the analysis has been focused on pasta industry and its supply chains, which represents one of the main subsectors of the food industry. In fact, for example Italian pasta industry annually produces about 3.4 million tons of pasta, which accounts for 6% of total national food industry production (IPO, 2014). For the purpose of the analysis, a specific framework developed by Giampietro (2019) has been implemented and further exploited. Thus, it offers a good support for approaching in an integrated way most of food and pasta systems’ challenges, such as the progressive reduction and elimination of waste and loss. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 delves on general revision of the theoretical background of food and pasta supply chain sustainability, focusing on the potential of circular economy strategy for the transition of food system towards sustainability. Section 3 presents and discusses the proposed interpretative model, while Sect. 4 argues some managerial and policy implications. Finally, Sect. 4.1 is dedicated to final remarks and further research lines.",4

The key research questions can be expressed as follows: if sport is conventionally believed to be good for general well-being, can it also help enhance both cognitive and non-cognitive skills? Can sports practice improve learning efficiency and contribute to building a stronger knowledge base for the following steps of educational development? These seem relevant questions since considering them differently can produce relevant and deep implications for the educational system, the labour market and overall potential economic growth. It is common knowledge that practising sports can be very important for children, not only because of the enjoyment it brings, but also because of its many physical, social and emotional benefits (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001). In this paper, the impact of sporting activities on the learning process is analysed by focusing on late childhood, an essential phase in both cognitive and non-cognitive human growth (Heckman et. al, 2006). In particular, our database gives information about Italian children aged 10, a crucial stage representing a cognitive transition between the end of early childhood and the beginning of pre-adolescence. Does sport bring only immediate satisfaction or does it contribute to creating skills that are crucial for children and their future development? From the empirical point of view, the classical problem which arises in this kind of analysis is due to potential endogeneity and reverse causality. Unobservable factors linked to the skills and abilities of each student can influence both sports participation and its effects. The strategy to approach this problem, as most literature suggests, has been instrumental variables (2SLS) estimation. The choice of the instrumental variable is quite challenging and it is discussed and verified in every research to show that a strong and valid instrument has been used. This research includes a variable representing sports facilities/space availability which, apart from the required characteristics, is one of the more detailed and reliable quantitative references for indoor and outdoor sports facilities in Italy (CNEL, 2003). The econometric model specification tries to control the impact of other important factors linked to family characteristics and the personal characteristics of each student. The model, on the one hand, estimates variables on the education and profession of parents and, on the other hand, a rich set of variables measuring biographical characteristics, educational path and study facilities. The dependent variables are differentiated according to the kind of human capital considered: on the one hand, school grades, for estimating cognitive skills and, on the other hand, a synthesis of personality characteristics, for estimating non–cognitive skills. Each model is estimated for both boys and girls, since the latter have internationally achieved very different, and often better, results in the last few years. The first positive impact of sports training on human capital performance confirms the literature. However, this positive influence seems effective up to a certain level of training intensity, apart from girls who can devote more time to sport without affecting excellence in school results. The second set of results shows that non-cognitive skills seem to benefit from the most intense level of sports training, since more intense practice could contribute better to enhancing this human capital component. The contribution of this study seems quite innovative because it crosses different dimensions—gender, intensity, type of human capital—working on national data. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 presents a brief literature review, Sect. 3 describes the dataset, Sect. 4 shows the empirical method adopted for the econometric estimation, Sect. 5 discusses our results and, lastly, Sect. 6 concludes the study by offering some policy insights.",
40,2,Economia Politica,05 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40888-022-00267-7,Corruption and firms’ efficiency: international evidence using an instrumental variable approach,July 2023,Luigi Aldieri,Cristian Barra,Concetto Paolo Vinci,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over time, a large amount of economic literature has been devoted to assessing the impact of corruption on both economic growth and innovation, with mixed results both theoretically and empirically. Indeed, while one strand of the theoretical literature predicts that corruption hinders economic growth (Aghion et al., 2016; Aidt et al., 2008; Kunieda et al., 2014; Shleifer & Vishny, 1993), a second strand of theoretical research has instead emphasized that corruption may facilitate it (Dzhumashev, 2014; Leff, 1964; Liu, 1985). According to these papers, several mechanisms might operate in the corruption-growth nexus and such to justify these mixed theoretical predictions. Specifically, the contributions supporting the “sand the wheels” hypothesis argue that corruption has a detrimental impact on trade (Wanchek, 2009), reduces income mobility and entrepreneurship (Boudreaux, 2014), hinders the development of the financial system (Emenalo et al., 2018), and diverts resources from productive to unproductive activities, where bribery is more profitable (Shleifer & Vishny, 1993). Others, for instance Kunieda et al. (2014), show that corruption increases tax rates or reduces tax revenues and, through that, reduces the amount of available resources for the financing of infrastructures that facilitate innovation (Aghion et al., 2016). Additional mechanisms, however, might operate and such to explain the detrimental effect of corruption and growth. These channels have been notably identified in the contribution of Pellegrini and Gerlagh (2004), who show that beside a direct effect, corruption adversely affects economic growth via its indirect effect on investments and, to a lesser extent, on trade openness and political stability. In his comprehensive review of the role of corruption, Svenson (2005) emphasizes that while at the micro-level corruption adversely affects economic outcomes, as it distorts entrepreneurial incentives and the distribution of entrepreneurial skills, props up inefficient firms, and misallocates the allocation of talents, technology, and capital, evidence of an insignificant effect of corruption on growth is instead detected at the macro-level.Footnote 1 On the other hand, papers supporting the “grease the wheels” hypothesis suggest that corruption positively affects growth as it speeds up bureaucratic procedures and overcomes inefficient regulations (Leff, 1964; Liu, 1985), though Dzhumaschev (2014) warns that this positive effect only occurs if the government’s size is above its optimal level. These ambiguous theoretical predictions are reflected in a large body of empirical research which supports these two contrasting views. While the detrimental effect of corruption on growth is documented in the papers of Mauro (1995), Méon and Sakkat (2005), and Johnson et al. (2011), the contributions of Méndez and Sepúlveda (2006) and Méon and Weill (2010) instead provide favorable evidence for the “grease the wheels” hypothesis and find evidence of a positive relationship between corruption and growth. Others, for instance Saha and Sen (2021), have instead proven that the corruption–growth nexus crucially depends on the type of political regime. Using data for a set of 100 countries over the 1984–2016 period, they show that corruption is growth-enhancing in autocracies but detrimental to growth in democracies. In particular, they argue that the positive effect of corruption on growth in autocracies is driven by the commitment of the political elites to economic freedom, which, in turn, stimulates firms’ investments, and, through that, has a positive effect on long-run growth. Similar results are obtained by Zergawu et al. (2020), who rely on a panel of 99 countries over the 1980–2015 period to evaluate the relationship between infrastructures, institutional quality, and economic growth. By relying on alternative measures of institutional quality,Footnote 2 such as control of corruption, bureaucratic quality, rule of law, and government stability, their evidence indicates that the joint effect of infrastructure and institutional quality is growth-enhancing, with a major role played by control of corruption. More recently, however, the economic literature has also been concerned with the impact of corruption on different dimensions of innovation. Most of this literature suggests that increased corruption discourages entrepreneurship and innovation (Anokhin & Schulze, 2009), reduces the likelihood of introducing new products onto the market (De Waldemar, 2012), depresses the issuance of quality certificates and of innovation inputs and machineries (Paunov, 2016), and slows down both investments in R&D and the number of registered patents (Xu & Yano, 2017; Dincer, 2019; Ellis et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020), further emphasizing that innovative firms represent the main target of corrupt officials (Ayyagari et al., 2014). On the other hand, Goedhuys et al. (2016) show that corruption facilitates innovation, provided that firms face several administrative and bureaucratic obstacles, while Pluskota (2020) documents a non-linear relationship between corruption and growth and innovation, with low levels of corruption found to be growth-enhancing. Another strand of the literature, for instance De Rosa et al. (2010), Hanousek and Kochanova (2016), and Giordano and Lopez Garcia (2018), has instead proposed a complementary approach based on evaluation of the effect of corruption and bribery on firms’ performance. In particular, De Rosa et al. (2010) rely on a sample of over 11,000 firms from 28 transition and developed countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) drawn from the 2009 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) to empirically assess the impact of two alternative forms of corruption on firm-level productivity. Accordingly, while bribe taxes, defined as informal payments to government officials to speed up the daily operations of the firms, are found to reduce productivity, time taxes, defined as red tape, are instead proven to be insignificant. Their analysis further reveals that that the detrimental effects of corruption are larger for non-EU countries and crucially depend on the overall level of institutional quality, as the lower the level of institutional quality, the stronger will be the adverse effects of corruption. Finally, according to their findings, in the presence of a weak institutional environment most productive firms do not pay bribes. Using data from CEE countries, Hanousek and Kochanova (2016) study the effects of corruption on both firm-level sales and productivity. Their findings suggest that while the performance of firms shrinks as the mean of firm-level bribes increases, the former is instead enhanced when firm-level bribes become more dispersed. Moreover, their findings indicate that the adverse consequences of the local bribery environment are larger for firms with more than 10 employees and that the impact of both mean bribes and dispersion becomes higher in countries with weaker institutional environments. Giordano and Lopez-Garcia (2018), using data for nine CEE countries over the 2003–2012 period, investigate the relationship between firm-level bribes and the efficiency of within-sector production factor allocation. Accordingly, higher corruption is associated with lower efficiency and higher misallocation of both labor and capital. Moreover, the adverse effects of increased corruption are higher for smaller countries and in the presence of poor quality of institutions. Martins et al. (2020), using a sample of 21,250 firms in both developed and developing countries, appraise the impact of corruption on different dimensions of firms’ performance, such as sales’ growth, employment growth, productivity growth and investment, showing that corruption systematically hampers the performance of firms. While a pervasive literature has been devoted to assessing the impact of corruption on growth and innovation, only a limited amount of theoretical and empirical research has instead investigated the relationship between corruption and firms’ efficiency. From a theoretical perspective, the main economic literature suggests that increased corruption hampers the efficiency of firms as it changes the incentives of the managements towards factor coordination (Dal Bó & Rossi, 2007), while according to Lien (1990), corruption is detrimental to allocative efficiency if there exists some degree of discrimination. Others, see for instance Murphy et al., (1991, 1993), emphasize that corruption, acting like an extortionary tax on innovators, depresses both innovation and innovation efficiency. Although some contributions, Castiglione et al. (2018), Sun et al. (2019), Zalle (2019), Aldieri, Makkonen, et al. (2020), and Aldieri, Barra, et al. (2020), by relying on alternative measures of governance quality, have proven that the higher the quality of institutions, the higher the efficiency of firms,Footnote 3 little is known on the impact of corruption, as stand-alone dimension of institutional quality, on the efficiency of firms. Contributions of this type are limited, to the best of our knowledge, to the papers of Dal Bó and Rossi (2007) and Sharma and Mitra (2015), who have shown that increased corruption is detrimental to the technical efficiency of firms. Departing from this literature, in this paper, using data on firms’ innovation from the US, Europe, and Japan over the period 2002–2010, we investigate the impact of control of corruption on firms’ efficiency and test the following hypothesis: H1) increased control of corruption enhances firms’ efficiency. A priori, we therefore expect this hypothesis to be empirically accepted. Indeed, following Méon and Weill (2005), corruption distorts individual incentives and affects not only the accumulation of productive resources but also the intensity with which they are employed, hence suggesting that control of corruption and firms’ efficiency should be directly correlated. To assess the effects of corruption on firms’ efficiency, the empirical analysis proposed in this paper is developed in two main steps. In the first step, we rely on the application of the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) proposed by Kumbhakar et al. (2014) to obtain a measure of firms’ efficiency. We then regress the estimated efficiency scores against the ICRG control of corruption indicator through the application of an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach, where our preferred measure of control of corruption is instrumented, in line with Mauro (1995), with an index of ethnolinguistic fractionalization. The application of this two-stage procedure is justified by the fact that the previous literature, most notably Méon and Weill (2005), Dal Bó and Rossi (2007), Sharma and Mitra (2015), Castiglione et al. (2018), and Aldieri, Makkonen, et al. (2020), Aldieri, Barra, et al. (2020)), has directly embodied the quality of institutions within the SFA framework, hence making these estimates vulnerable to the likely endogeneity between measures of government quality and efficiency. The approach followed in this paper, on the other hand, allows us to obtain consistent estimates of the efficiency scores in the first stage and, in the second, to control for the endogeneity in the corruption-efficiency nexus. Our results indicate that increased control of corruption systematically enhances firms’ efficiency. Moreover, as it might be argued that firms’ efficiency is not directly observable, we also examine the impact of control of corruption on the number of patents issued and R&D expenditures. Evidence obtained through this econometric exercise reveals that a higher capacity of government to control corruption is positively and significantly correlated with these two dimensions of innovation, hence suggesting that control of corruption plays a key role in explaining the innovative performances of firms. The evidence reported in this paper, which is robust to alternative specifications of the underlying technology, to an alternative instrumentation strategy, based on a measure of freedom of press, and to the aggregation of firm-level innovation, brings, in our opinion, some relevant policy implications. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a theoretical underpinning, while Sect. 3 introduces the methodology employed to empirically assess the efficiency and investigate the corruption-efficiency nexus. Section 4 describes the main variables employed, while Sect. 5 reports the results obtained from our benchmark specifications. Section 6 provides a battery of robustness checks, while Sect. 7 concludes and discusses the main policy implications.",
