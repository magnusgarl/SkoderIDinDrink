These values can be viewed as variations on the Shapley value obtained by equal division of every coalition’s dividend among its members. The notions of selector values (Derks et al. 2000), weighted Shapley values (Kalai and Samet 1987) or random order values (Weber 1988) are now well-established in the cooperative game theory. In this paper I define and study another class of values for cooperative TU games. Though it might well be claimed that these values also deserve the name of “random order values”, I use the term “procedural values” instead. These values are also close relatives of the Shapley value. The generalization, as well as the difference from the aforementioned classes, lies in the fact that, while preserving the assumption of equal probabilities of all possible orders in which the grand coalition is formed, I admit the possibility of redistribution—but of marginal contributions of players instead of dividends of coalitions. The method of redistribution will be called procedure. Every procedure is determined by a family of real coefficients and, on the other hand, it determines a value on the space of TU games. A reasonable interpretation is that a player who wishes to join a coalition that has already formed is obliged to pay an “entrance fee” to the players who already are in the coalition, and that this fee constitutes a specified fraction of the newcoming player’s marginal contribution. This section introduces the notions used in the paper. In Sect. 2 I present two equivalent definitions of a procedure and a couple of simple examples, together with the values resulting from the presented procedures. Section 3 is devoted to properties of procedural values; it also contains the main theorem on their axiomatization. The final section reviews some variations and generalizations. Most of the notions and the notation used are standard. We shall be dealing with \(n\)-person cooperative games, \(n\) being a fixed but arbitrary positive integer; usually the case \(n \ge 3\) is of interest. A cooperative game (transferable utility game) is a pair \((N,v),\) where \(N=\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}\) is the set of players and \(v\) is the characteristic function—any real function defined on the set of all coalitions, i.e. all subsets of \(N,\) satisfying \(v(\emptyset )=0.\) Its values are called worths of coalitions. Since the set of players will usually be fixed in this paper, I shall identify every cooperative game with its characteristic function. The set of all \(n\)-person cooperative games will be denoted by \(\mathcal{G}_{n}\); this set forms a \((2^{n}-1)\)-dimensional vector space. The players will be denoted with small letters (\(i,j,k,\ldots \)) , and the coalitions with capitals (\(S,T,U,\ldots \)). For a coalition denoted by a capital letter, the corresponding lowercase letter will denote the cardinality of the coalition, e.g. \(t=\#T.\) For brevity, I shall usually omit braces when enumerating players in a coalition, thus obtaining for instance \(ijk\) instead of \(\{i,j,k\}\) and \(T\cup j\) instead of \(T \cup \{j\}\) . In a game \((N,v),\) two players \(i,j \in N\) are interchangeable if, for every coalition \(T \subseteq N \setminus \{i,j\}, v(T \cup i) = v(T \cup j),\) and player \(k \in N\) is a null player if, for every coalition \(T \subset N, v(T \cup k) = v(T).\)
 
\(\Pi \) is the set of all permutations of the set \(N.\) For any player \(j \in N\) and any permutation \(\pi \in \Pi ,\) let us denote: —the sets, respectively, of all predecessors of \(j\) and all successors of \(j\) in the ordering \(\pi \) (in both cases including player \(j\)). For any real number \(z,\)
\(z^+\) and \(z^-\) will denote its positive and negative part:   \(z^+ = \max (z,0)\) and \(z^- = \min (z,0).\)
 A value is any function \(\psi \) assigning to every game \((N,v)\in \mathcal{G}_n\) a vector \(\psi (v)=(\psi _1(v),\psi _2(v),\ldots ,\psi _n(v))\); \(\psi (v)\) is the value of the game
\((N,v),\) and its components are individual values of the players. If \(\sum _{i=1}^{n}\psi _{i}(v)=v(N)\) for every game \((N,v)\in \mathcal{G}_{n}\) , then the value \(\psi \) is efficient. Efficient values are rules of dividing among all players the quantity \(v(N),\) interpreted as the “gain” that all players together can achieve if they all agree to cooperate. Many (though not all) commonly accepted values depend somehow on the marginal contributions of players to coalitions. The marginal contribution of player \(j\) to coalition \(T\) (containing \(j\)) is the difference \(v(T)-v(T\setminus j).\) In particular, for a given ordering \(\pi \) of \(N\) we shall denote by \(m_{j , \pi } (v)\) the marginal contribution of \(j\) to the set of his predecessors in the ordering \(\pi \): The historally first and undoubtedly most prominent value for cooperative games, the Shapley value (Shapley 1953) is defined as the vector of expected marginal contributions of players under the probability measure given by uniform distribution on the set \(\Pi \): Various generalizations of the Shapley value are obtained when other probability distributions on the set of permutations are allowed; this leads to the class of random order values (see Weber 1988). The generalization in this paper goes in different direction. I follow Shapley in assuming that all permutations of players are equally probable, but, unlike Shapley and Weber, I do not require players to retain their marginal contributions for themselves. Instead, I assume some specific ways of redistribution of marginal contributions of successive players entering the coalitions between themselves and the players already present in the coalition.",41

In particular, many of such results have been obtained under assumptions related to different types of concavity or convexity of payoff functions, possibly discontinuous. We can mention here several recent papers like Bich (2009), Carmona (2009), Carmona (2010), McClendon (1986) and Połowczuk et al. (2007). The aim of the paper is to study the problem of the existence of “simple” Nash equilibria formed by so-called two-point strategies, that is such mixed strategies whose supports consist of at most two of players’ pure strategies. We examine this problem for two-person non-zero-sum games on the unit square with payoff functions possessing some new properties called poor concavity and poor convexity. It is worth mentioning that several results of this type were found both for finite games (Połowczuk 2006, 2003; Połowczuk et al. 2007; Radzik 2000) and for games on the unit square (Parthasarathy and Raghavan 1975; Radzik 1991, 1993) with convex and concave payoff functions. Five new “existence theorems” are proposed for games in which players’ payoff functions are poorly concave or poorly convex in various configurations. This new notion of poor convexity is a natural generalization and extension of the classical convexity. In the paper, we develop the theory of poorly convex functions, using these results further in the proofs of the theorems. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to preliminary definitions and some background results which are a starting point for our study. In Sect. 3 we introduce the new basic notions of poorly convex functions and discuss them. In Sect. 4 we present our five main results about the existence of Nash equilibria in games. Poorly concave functions and their properties are studied in Sects. 5 and 6, while Sect. 7 contains the proofs of the theorems.",2

As cooperative games, they do not require agents to follow any predetermined game form, making them well-suited to the study of power struggles without third party enforcement, in which any proposed game form may itself be contested. Allowing transferrable resources to contributed to both power and value is a similarly appealing extension to standard cooperative games. Concretely, consider coalition formation problems. Non-cooperative analyses typically specify rules for determining a proposer and a sequence of respondents, which often seem contrived. Standard cooperative analyses, on the other hand, do not recognize that prospective coalition partners may be attractive not just for intrinsic reasons, but for their transferrable holdings. Google, for example, seeking to defend hardware manufacturers using its Android operating system from Apple’s legal attacks, has sold patents to HTC, allowing HTC to—days later—launch its own patent case against Apple (Kwong 2011; Milford and Decker 2011). In international politics, great powers often transfer power—in the form of military aid—to their clients. Such behavior is pervasive and intuitively obvious, but poses problems for the standard analyses mentioned. Analysis of pillage games has focused on their stable sets: these are both intrinsically interesting, and have been shown to be equivalent to a (farsighted) core in expectation (Jordan 2006). Thus, if the property of being undominated is an appealing one, and if forward looking agents are seen as natural, stable sets are a compelling solution concept. There is evidence that pillage games’ stable sets behave better than those of other cooperative games: they are small, and often unique—in sharp contrast to the famous ‘signature’ example of Shapley (1959) which constructed a game in characteristic function form with an infinite number of stable sets, each potentially infinite.Footnote 1
 Both stable sets’ small size and their apparent uniqueness owe to pillage games’ structure: coalitions’ power must satisfy a coalitional monotonicity axiom (larger coalitions, in the sense of set inclusion, are more powerful) as well as weak and strong versions of a resource monotonicity axiom (coalitions whose members have more resources are more powerful). On size, Jordan (2006) used the strong resource monotonicity axiom to prove that pillage games’ stable sets were finite.Footnote 2 Kerber and Rowat (2011) further exploited the same axiom to tighten Jordan’s bound to a Ramsey number. Saxton (2011) also made use of the coalitional monotonicity axiom to tighten the bound yet further to one that nonetheless remained doubly-exponential. Kerber and Rowat (2014) identified three axioms satisfied by all examples of pillage games previously studied—anonymity (or symmetry), continuity, and responsiveness—and derived a tight bound of 15 allocations for three agent pillage games satisfying these additional axioms. On uniqueness, Jordan (2006) proved that the wealth is power pillage game—his leading example—had a unique stable set; he did not find examples of multiple stable sets. Kerber and Rowat (2014) proved uniqueness in three agent pillage games satisfying the three additional axioms; a draft of their paper that preceded the present paper’s results (Kerber and Rowat 2009) also conjectured that pillage games’ monotonicity axioms might lead to fine balances of power, such that stable sets either existed uniquely, or did not exist at all. This paper presents a family of counter-examples to that uniqueness conjecture, each more general than its predecessor. All extend the majority pillage game (or strength in numbers game) analyzed by Jordan and Obadia (2014) and Jordan (2006). In the classic majority game (Lucas 1992), domination only occurs if one coalition has strictly more members than the other. For three agent majority games, there are a continuum of stable sets, each containing a continuum of allocations such that one agent’s resources are held constant; the choice between two allocations within such sets pits one agent against one other, satisfying internal stability. Three agent majority games also have a degenerate stable set containing three allocations, each of which splits the resource equally between two of the agents. By contrast, the majority pillage game breaks ties in coalitional size in favour of the coalition with greater aggregate resource holdings; this additional mode of dominance eliminates the majority game’s continuum stable sets. The examples presented here extend the majority pillage game by violating the anonymity axiom that grants each agent identical intrinsic strength. Insofar as most empirical applications will not involve intrinsically identical agents, it is clearly important that the theory be developed to handle violations of anonymity. The present constructions all include one or more powerful agents with a large, fixed intrinsic strength, and many lesser agents with variable—but lower—strengths. Specifically, they all exhibit the following power dichotomy: for all but a handful of exceptional allocations, the powerful agents are more powerful than the lesser agents; however, at those exceptional allocations, the lesser agents just match the powerful agents. The logic behind these constructions is that stable sets must satisfy both internal stability—harder for large sets—and external stability—harder for small sets. As pillage games’ stable sets are small, the existence of powerful agents with the ability to dominate all but a small number of exceptional allocations overcomes the usual problem with external stability. Once the allocations sharing the endowment between the powerful agents are included in candidate stable sets, the problem of constructing stable sets reduces to one of assessing stability over the finite exceptional sets. This problem is both straightforward, and reminiscent of classical cooperative analysis (see, for example, Lucas (1971)). Section 3 presents the first counter-example, a four-agent game whose exceptional set is defined to create a cyclical dominance relation among its four elements. Thus, either the even or odd elements of the exceptional set may belong to a stable set, yielding two stable sets. While most of the examples use power functions violating the continuity axiom, we show that this is an expositional aid rather than an intrinsic feature of the examples. Section 3.1 applies the same construction to a pillage game with an empty core. Section 4 generalizes the initial example by defining an exceptional set for each non-overlapping set of three lesser agents. By creating these to exclude the possibility of dominance across them, stable sets are constructed by independently picking either the even or odd elements from each such exceptional set. Thus, an \(n\)-agent game yields \(2^{\tfrac{n-1}{3}}\) stable sets. Section 5 shows how to introduce dominance relations across exceptional sets, making choices of even or odd elements from one dependent on choices from another. This can arbitrarily reduce the number of stable sets below \(2^{\tfrac{n-1}{3}}\). Finally, Sect. 6 constructs a multi-good pillage game with two stable sets, but only three agents. Multi-good pillage games (Rowat 2009) add qualitatively to the original single-good pillage game by treating consensual trade in the same framework as non-consensual ‘pillage’. In this richer environment, dominance can be symmetric, allowing construction of two-element exceptional sets for two agents, each element of which dominates the other. In single good pillage games, domination cannot be symmetric (Jordan 2006), making four-element exceptional sets the smallest that can support two stable sets. The Appendix collects proofs. An earlier version of the paper (MacKenzie et al. 2013) contained more detail at various points. In conclusion, this paper replaces the conjecture that pillage games have no more than one stable set with new questions. First, do the additional axioms of anonymity, continuity and responsiveness—sufficient for uniqueness with three agents (Kerber and Rowat 2014)—guarantee that larger pillage games also have no more than one stable set? As the constructions presented here rely on violating anonymity, is that condition alone sufficient for uniqueness? Finally, as the present constructions only produce finite numbers of stable sets, are there pillage games capable of producing infinite sets of stable sets?",2

Axiomatically, it was characterized by the linearity, efficiency, symmetry, and null player axioms. In various fields of economics and political science it is necessary to consider games that involve a large number of “insignificant” players. In such cases it is fruitful to model the game as a game with a continuum of players. Aumann and Shapley (1974) modified the value axioms and extended the definition of the value to games with a continuum of players. They proved the existence and uniqueness of the value on important spaces of nonatomic games. In computational terms, both the Shapley value and the Aumann–Shapley value assign each agent his average marginal contribution to coalitions he may join, in certain models of random ordering of the agents. On general classes of nonatomic games the value may not exist. Nevertheless, this is not the case when market games, derived from transferable utility (TU) perfectly competitive economies, are concerned. The core of a market game is nonempty, and if all agents have differentiable utility functions, then the Aumann–Shapley value is also well defined, and it constitutes the unique element of the core. Without the differentiability assumption, the core of a market game is usually multivalued. But even in this scenario, all known values have the property of being elements of the core. This is the case with (Hart 1980) measure-based values of a nonatomic market game, and also with the (Mertens 1988) value (which is defined on a large space of games containing the linear space spanned by all nonatomic market games). In fact, in the special case of market games, the Mertens value is given by an explicitFootnote 1 formula as a barycenter of the core (Mertens 1988). The important and natural question that arises is whether the properties of the value can uniquely determine it, and make sure it is a member of the core. Arbitrary core selections can lead to distortions, e.g., significant differences in payoffs in “nearby” economies, discrimination between agents, and inconsistencies between choices. However, if the value indeed uniquely selects an element of the core, then the different choices of that element in different games are linked to each other via the value axioms, in a consistent and economically meaningful way. This problem has proved to be extremely difficult. The first advancement in that direction was made by Haimanko (2002), essentiallyFootnote 2 proving that if the games are functions of finitely many mutually singular probability measuresFootnote 3 then the standard value axioms together with the continuity axiom uniquely determine the Mertens value. Nevertheless, (Haimanko 2002) analysis heavily relies on the mutual-singularity assumption. It seems that a milestone in the way to characterize the value on the space of all market games would be to first eliminate the mutual singularity assumption. One of the main tools developed by Haimanko (2002) is a representation of the value as an “average” of marginals of the underlying game. In this paper we prove a generalization of this result for the case of general vector measure market games. We then use this result to characterize the Mertens value as the unique continuous value on the space of vector measure market games. A subsequent result is a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the value on other spaces of vector measure market games.",1

This is a relevant question, in particular for policy discussion concerning education acquisition and labor markets. For instance, there appear to be widespread concerns that—possibly because of asymmetric information (see Bénabou and Tirole (forthcoming))—salaries in the labor market may not adequately reflect the social marginal benefit of employees’ productivity or human capital, distorting incentives for education investment. Similarly, when admission to good schools and colleges, and thus access to high quality peers in the classroom, is based partly on parents’ income through user fees or house prices in the presence of borrowing constraints, rewards to prior effort in education acquisition or early childhood investments will be distorted. The question has attracted considerable attention in the literature. Cole et al. (2001b) show that surplus efficient investments are in the equilibrium set when utility is perfectly transferable.Footnote 1 At the other extreme, for strictly nontransferable utility, such that surplus has to be split equally among partners, Peters and Siow (2002) establish Pareto (though not necessarily surplus) efficiency of investments in a two-sided matching market. Bhaskar and Hopkins (2014) point out the limits of this result, and Gall et al. (2006) provide an example of surplus inefficient investments in a one-sided market when utility is less than perfectly transferable and distorts the matching pattern. Gall et al. (2009) find investment distortions in form of simultaneous over-investment at the top and under-investment at the bottom, and analyze rematching policies. Mailath et al. (2013) examine the relation of the dimensionality of the price system and potential investment distortions in a two-sided market. This raises the question of the degree of utility transferability required to ensure that investments maximize aggregate surplus. Evaluating allocations in terms of surplus efficiency appears reasonable from a normative, ex ante perspective (in the sense of Harsanyi 1953), and from a positive point of view when surplus relates to output. In essence, nontransferable utility may distort ex ante investments away from the surplus maximizing allocation through two possible channels. First, payoff distortions may cause the equilibrium assignment to differ from the first best. That is, given equilibrium investments and payoffs there may be another assignment that is not necessarily stable but generates higher aggregate surplus, which may affect incentives. Second, given an equilibrium assignment nontransferabilities may cause the equilibrium payoffs to not adequately reflect the externalities that an agent’s investment generates on potential matches. This paper shall be concerned with the second channel only; analyzing surplus efficiency of the matching pattern and possible remedies is done elsewhere (Gall et al. 2009). One obvious way in which nontransferable utility may affect equilibrium payoffs is in that they may not maximize joint surplus in each match formed in equilibrium. That is, ex post efficiency of surplus may fail in that given an equilibrium assignment and investments, in some matches a different surplus division would increase joint surplus. This implies, of course, that also the associated equilibrium investment incentives are distorted away from a surplus efficient allocation that maximizes aggregate surplus by choosing investments and surplus distribution in matches. As fully transferable utility ensures that payoffs are ex post efficient and an equilibrium allocation maximizes aggregate surplus (see Cole et al. 2001b among others), the first observation in this paper is perhaps a little surprising: ex post efficiency of equilibrium payoffs does not guarantee a surplus efficient allocation. The reason for this is that with nontransferabilities ex post efficiency leaves open the possibility that two agents with the same attribute receive strictly different equilibrium payoffs ex post. Hence, the expected remuneration of this attribute at the investment stage (a convex combination of different payoffs) generally will not coincide with the social marginal contribution of this attribute (which is precisely the extra surplus generated in the match that an extra agent with the attribute will be assigned to, when all other agents obtain their equilibrium payoffs). If, however, in equilibrium all agents with the same attribute receive the same payoff ex post, ex post efficiency guarantees that each attribute is remunerated with the social marginal surplus generated by having one more agent with that attribute. That is, when an equal treatment of equal attributes property holds, ex post efficiency of equilibrium payoffs implies that an equilibrium allocation is surplus efficient conditional on the equilibrium assignment. Since the surplus efficient allocation is also an investment cum matching equilibrium allocation this means that some equilibrium allocation is surplus efficient, absent coordination failures. One example are matching models where surplus has to be shared equally among partners and joint surplus is a strictly monotone function of attributes: the unique matching equilibrium has only homogeneous matches. Splitting the surplus is ex post efficient and satisfies the equal treatment property, so that these matching markets will generally have an investment and matching equilibrium that is surplus efficient.Footnote 2
 When equilibrium payoffs are not ex post efficient, the equal treatment property will still ensure that each attribute is remunerated commensurate with its marginal contribution to social surplus, albeit in terms of the payoffs constrained by nontransferabilities. Hence, the equal treatment property implies that an investment cum matching equilibrium will be constrained surplus efficient, i.e., constrained to the payoffs achievable in equilibrium given the nontransferabilities. This means a social planner who can adjust investments, but not the sharing of surplus, could not increase aggregate surplus given the matching. This result is particularly interesting in light of policies of rematching individuals, such as affirmative action, suggesting the resulting equilibrium will induce constrained efficient investment incentives. The equal treatment property of equilibrium payoffs, which is key to the welfare properties, can be tied to the primitives: a sufficient condition for equal treatment is marginally transferable utility (MTU): partners in any match can transfer utility to each other at a bounded, strictly positive rate in each possible match of attributes. The results are derived in a model of ex ante investments, made before a one-sided matching market with a continuum of agents. Costly investment determines the probability distribution over possible attributes an agent may attain. After attributes have realized agents enter the market, match into pairs, and jointly generate surplus, which depends on attributes. A matching equilibrium is a stable match with side payments, and equilibrium investments are optimal anticipating the matching equilibrium payoffs. Side payments are subject to nontransferabilities, captured by the Pareto frontier in each match, which may take any form between fully transferable and strictly nontransferable utility. Surplus in a match may not be monotone and transferability may vary between different attribute pairs, allowing for substantial heterogeneity in preferences over possible matches.Footnote 3 The results follow from deriving the graph structure of the payoff externalities of a change in investments and using the structural properties of an equilibrium match of attributes. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the model framework and provides an example. The main result is in Sect. 3, complemented by an application to matching markets yielding full segregation. Section 4 concludes and the appendix contains proofs and details omitted in the text.",2

Zarzuelo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Voting power in political bodies can be represented by simple games, which identify the winning and losing coalitions: a winning coalition can enforce laws, amendments, etc. In order to measure the power of an individual voter or political party one can use a power index, like for instance the Shapley–Shubik index, which is the Shapley value applied to the transferable utility game that assigns one to winning and zero to losing coalitions. As is well known, the Shapley–Shubik index distributes a total of one among the players by assigning to each player the fraction of the number of player permutations in which that player is pivotal. This way of measuring individual power, however, neither takes the possible issues at stake into account nor the individual positions of the players concerning these issues. In order to remedy this defect, Owen and Shapley (1989), following up on earlier papers of Owen (1971) and Shapley (1977), assume that each player occupies a position in \({\mathbb {R}}^m\): one can think of there being m possible criteria, and a point \(x \in {\mathbb {R}}^m\) represents a position with respect to these criteria. An ‘issue’ is then a function \(f : {\mathbb {R}}^m \rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}\), with the interpretation that if \(f(x) \le f(y)\) then a player with position x is more in favor of issue f, and thus more likely to support f, than a player with position y. Owen and Shapley restrict attention to linear homogenous issues; i.e., an issue can be represented by a vector \(r\in {\mathbb {R}}^m\) with length one, so that a player with position x is more in favor of r than a player with position y if \(r \cdot x \le r \cdot y\) (dot-products). Given a simple game and a constellation of player positions, for each issue r a pivotal player exists, by building a coalition starting with the player whose position has the smallest dot-product with r. Then the Owen–Shapley spatial power index assigns to each player the fraction of issues at which this player is pivotal. In other words, compared to the Shapley–Shubik index, the player permutations are weighted by considering the positions of the players. Although the model underlying the Owen–Shapley spatial power index may seem somewhat abstract, the concept derives important support from the fact that, at least if \(m=2\) and the simple game is proper and strong (meaning, for each coalition, that either that coalition is winning and its complement losing, or the other way around), the strong point and the center of power coincide. The latter point is the convex combination of the player positions using the Owen–Shapley spatial power index values as weights; and the strong point is the Copeland winner, i.e., the position that is least vulnerable to opposition by (winning) coalitions in terms of Euclidian distance. See Owen and Shapley (1989) for details and a proof of this result. Another relation between the Owen–Shapley spatial power index and the evaluation of positions using Euclidian distance has recently been obtained by Martin et al. (2014). They show, by using a limit argument, that if pivotalness is based on closeness in terms of Euclidian distance and all possible points in \({\mathbb {R}}^m\) are regarded as ‘issues’, then the Owen–Shapley spatial power index again results. They also clarify the difference and overlap between the original concepts of Owen (1971) and Shapley (1977). In this paper we assume \(m=2\). A spatial game is a combination of a simple game and a constellation of player positions. A spatial power index assigns to each player in a spatial game a nonnegative number, where these numbers sum up to one. We show that the Owen–Shapley spatial power index is uniquely characterized by five axioms: a version of the well known transfer condition similar to the one in Einy and Haimanko (2011); anonymity and dummy axioms adapted to the spatial context; and two axioms dealing exclusively with the spatial positions of the players. One of these last two axioms requires that it should not matter where the constellation of player positions is located in space: only the players’ relative positions matter. The other axiom says that if the position of one player moves towards the position of another player along the straight line through the two positions, then the power of the latter player does not change. This axiom embodies the fact that such a movement does not change the relative positions of these two players with respect to any issue. Thus, among the five axioms considered it is the one that is most specific for the Owen–Shapley spatial power index; in particular, it reflects the idea of straight lines as representing issues. Our dummy property has a flavor of consistency: it says that dummies can be left out, in a way to be specified, without changing the power of the other players. In this respect it is related to the Null-Player-Out property in Derks and Haller (1999). A consequence is that our characterization is formulated for a variable player set. We show that by adding a positional continuity condition, the weak dummy property—requiring, as usual, that dummies have zero power—is sufficient, and the player set can be fixed. We also show that in both characterizations the axioms are logically independent. As far as we are aware, these are the first characterizations of the Owen–Shapley spatial power index. 
Further related literature Far from claiming completeness, we mention a few relevant related papers. Shenoy (1982) provides a spatial version of another well-known power index, the Banzhaf index. Passarelli and Bar (2007) propose a power index which is more directly based on the Euclidian distance of player positions to issues, where the latter are points in the same space as the player positions. They also discuss application to the EU. Benati and Marzetti (2013) take a generalized approach to power indexes, comprising the Shapley–Shubik and Owen–Shapley power indexes, and also apply this to EU’s council of ministers. Blockmans and Guerry (2015), taking the Benati and Marzetti (2013) approach as a lead, introduce issue saliences and consider empirical applications for Belgium. Alonso-Meijide et al. (2011) develop an alternative spatial power index based on lengths of paths connecting player positions and induced by player permutations, and consider an application to the Catalan Parliament. Also the more specific political science literature provides many interesting references to this topic. We mention in particular Enelow and Hinich (1984, (1990), Grofman et al. (1987), and Straffin (1994) for overviews and applications. For a discussion about the basic underlying assumption of a spatial power index, namely that players (e.g., political parties) are more likely to vote in favor of a particular proposal as their position is closer to the proposal, see Braham and Holler (2005) and Napel and Widgrén (2005). For a general comparison of power indices see Bertini et al. (2013).

46.0,2.0,International Journal of Game Theory,01 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00182-016-0537-7,"Erratum to: A nonstandard characterization of sequential equilibrium, perfect equilibrium, and proper equilibrium",May 2017,Joseph Y. Halpern,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As pointed out by an anonymous referee, Theorem 1.4 in the original article, which gives a characterization of perfect equilibrium in terms of nonstandard probability, is incorrect as stated. Fortunately, the theorem is easily corrected. There are actually two distinct problems, which I outline here. The first problem involves the definition of best response. Both sequential equilibrium and perfect equilibrium consider best responses at all information sets, even ones off the equilibrium path. The subtlety arises in making clear what it means to make a best response at an information set off the equilibrium path. In the standard definition of what it means for a behavioral strategy profile \(\vec {\sigma }\) to be a sequential or perfect equilibrium (see, e.g., Osborne and Rubinstein 1994), a sequence of completely-mixed behavioral strategy profiles that converges to \(\vec {\sigma }\) is considered (where a behavioral strategy \(\sigma _i\) for player i is completely mixed if, at each information set I for player i, it assigns positive probability to each possible action at I). In the original article, this sequence of behavioral strategy profiles converging to \(\vec {\sigma }\) is replaced by a single completely-mixed nonstandard strategy profile \(\vec {\sigma }'\) (i.e., a strategy profile where each individual strategy can assign a nonstandard probability to each action) that differs infinitesimally from \(\vec {\sigma }\). (The notion of being completely mixed remains the same: each action at an information set gets positive probability, but now that probability can be a nonstandard real, in particular, an infinitesimal). The idea is that, by using a completely-mixed strategy \(\vec {\sigma }'\), the notion of \(\sigma _i'\) being a best response to \(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\) becomes completely unambiguous. The characterization of sequential equilibrium involves \(\sigma _i'\) being an \(\epsilon \)-best response to \(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\) at all information sets for player i, where \(\epsilon \) is an infinitesimal. The characterization of perfect equilibrium requires something stronger: that \(\sigma _i\) be a best response to \(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\) at all information sets for player i. The problem is that \((\sigma _i,\vec {\sigma }'_{-i})\) is not a completely mixed strategy, and may not reach an information set I at all. This leads to problems with the definition of best response (Definition 2.1) in the original article. To solve this problem, we should go back to the original motivation for these definitions. What we really want to say is that, after reaching I using \(\vec {\sigma }'\), \(\sigma _i\) is the best continuation for player i from then on. To make this precise, we need to know i’s beliefs regarding the relatively likelihood of histories in I; this belief is determined by the completely-mixed strategy profile used to reach I. Recall the notation from the original article; given a behavioral-strategy profile \(\vec {\sigma }\), \(\Pr _{\vec {\sigma }}\) is the distribution on terminal histories induced by \(\vec {\sigma }\). Since we can identify a partial history with the terminal histories that extend it, \(\Pr _{\vec {\sigma }}(h)\) and \(\Pr _{\vec {\sigma }}(I)\) are well defined for a partial history h and an information set I. As usual, we take a belief system
\(\mu \) to be a function that associates with each information set I a probability denoted \(\mu _I\) on the histories in I. Given a behavioral strategy \(\vec {\sigma }\) and a belief system \(\mu \) in an extensive-form game \(\Gamma \), let where Z is the set of terminal histories in \(\Gamma \). Here \(\mu _I(h)\) is the probability that history \(h \in I\) is where in I player i actually is; \(\Pr _{\vec {\sigma }}(z|h)\) is the probability that z will be the history played given that play proceeds according to \(\vec {\sigma }\) from h on; and \(u_i(z)\) is the utility that i gains from z being played. Finally, if \(\vec {\sigma }\) is a completely-mixed behavioral strategy profile, let \(\mu ^{\vec {\sigma }}\) be the belief system determined by \(\vec {\sigma }\) in the obvious way: We can now define what it means for a player’s strategy to be a best response at an information set. 
Definition 2.1
\('\) If \(\epsilon \ge 0\) and I is an information set for player i that is reached with positive probability by \(\vec {\sigma }'\), then \(\sigma _i\) is an \(\epsilon \)-best response to
\(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\)
for
i
conditional on having reached
I
using
\(\vec {\sigma }'\) if, for every strategy \(\tau \) for player i, we have \(\mathrm {EU}_i(((\sigma _i,\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}),\mu ^{\vec {\sigma }'}_I) | I) \ge \mathrm {EU}_i(((\tau _i,\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}),\mu ^{\vec {\sigma }'}_I) | I) - \epsilon \). By way of contrast, here is Definition 2.1 in the original article: If \(\epsilon \ge 0\) and I is an information set for player i, \(\sigma _i\) is an \(\epsilon \)-best response to
\(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\)
for
i
conditional on having reached
I if, for every strategy \(\tau \) for player i that agrees with \(\sigma _i\) except possibly at I and information sets preceded by I, we have \(\mathrm {EU}_i(\sigma _i, \vec {\sigma }'_{-i}) \ge \mathrm {EU}_i(\tau , \vec {\sigma }'_{-i}) -\epsilon \). Note the differences between Definitions 2.1 and 2.1\('\). Definition 2.1\('\) enforces the assumption that I is reached using \(\vec {\sigma }'\) by using the belief system \(\mu ^{\vec {\sigma }'}\). In Definition 2.1, \(\sigma _i'\) plays no role; rather, \(\sigma _i\) and \(\tau \) have to agree up to I, so the implicit assumption is that I is reached using \((\sigma _i,\vec {\sigma }_{-i}')\), not \(\vec {\sigma }'\). It is this difference that causes problems (see the discussion of the statement of Theorem 4.1 below).Footnote 1
 The second major problem with Theorem 1.4 involves the definition of perfect equilibrium. According to Definition 2.2 in the original article, “\(\vec {\sigma }\) is a perfect equilibrium in an extensive-form game \(\Gamma \) iff there exists a sequence \(\vec {\sigma }^n\) of completely mixed behavior strategies such that \(\vec {\sigma }^n \rightarrow \vec {\sigma }\) and, for all n and each information set I of player i, \(\sigma _i\) is a best response to \(\vec {\sigma }^n_{-i}\) conditional on having reached I.” Even ignoring the issue of best response discussed above, this is not the standard definition of perfect equilibrium. The standard definition involves games in agent-normal form, with a different agent assigned to each information set. When considering a best response for agent i at an information set I, agent-normal form allows for the possibility that i will tremble at information sets below I; Definition 2.2 in the original article does not allow this. In Footnote 2 of the original article, it is claimed that Definition 2.2 is equivalent to the standard definition. This claim is false. In fact, Definition 2.2 in the original article characterizes the notion of quasi-perfect equilibrium (van Damme 1984), which is much like perfect equilibrium, except that trembles by agent i are not allowed when considering i’s best response. As van Damme (1984) shows, quasi-perfect equilibrium and perfect equilibrium can differ in quite simple games. To prove Theorem 1.4, it is most convenient to use a characterization of perfect equilibrium due to van Damme (1984, Lemma 1). Given an information set I for player i, let \(A_I\) be the set of actions for i at I. As usual, we take \(\Delta (A_I)\) to be the set of probability measures on \(A_I\). Note that if \(\sigma _i\) is a behavioral strategy for player i then, by definition, \(\sigma _i(I) \in \Delta (A_I)\). 
Definition 2.1
\(''\) If \(\epsilon \ge 0\) and I is an information set for player i that is reached with positive probability by \(\vec {\sigma }'\), then \(b \in \Delta (A_I)\) is a local
\(\epsilon \)-best response to
\(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\)
for
i
conditional on having reached
I
using
\(\vec {\sigma }'\) if, for all \(b' \in \Delta (A_I)\), we have that where \(\sigma _i'[I/b']\) is the behavioral strategy that agrees with \(\sigma _i'\) except possibly at information set I, and \(\sigma _i'[I/b'](I) = b'\). Note that Definition 2.1\(''\) allows changes only at I; by way of contrast, Definition 2.1\('\) allows changes at I and all information sets below I. Perfect equilibrium can be characterized as follows: 
Definition 2.2
\('\)
\(\vec {\sigma }\) is a perfect equilibrium in an extensive-form game \(\Gamma \) iff there exists a sequence \(\vec {\sigma }^n\) of completely mixed behavior strategies such that \(\vec {\sigma }^n \rightarrow \vec {\sigma }\) and, for all n and each information set I of player i, \(\sigma _i(I)\) is a local best response to \(\vec {\sigma }^n_{-i}\) conditional on having reached I using \(\vec {\sigma }^n\).Footnote 2
 To understand the impact of these changes, consider the following theorem from the original article, which attempts to characterize perfect equilibrium: If \(\Gamma \) is an extensive-form game with perfect recall, then \(\vec {\sigma }\) is a perfect equilibrium in \(\Gamma \) iff there exists a nonstandard completely-mixed strategy profile \(\vec {\sigma }'\) that differs infinitesimally from \(\vec {\sigma }\) such that, for each player i and each information set I for player i, \(\sigma _i\) is a best response to \(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\), conditional on having reached I. When attempting to evaluate whether \(\sigma _i\) is a best response to \(\vec {\sigma }_{-i}'\) conditional on having reached I according to Definition 2.1, we must implicitly assume that I is reached using \((\sigma _i, \vec {\sigma }'_{-i})\). But \(\sigma _i\) is not completely mixed and, indeed, might not reach I at all. This causes problems in stating the theorem. If we add the words “using \(\vec {\sigma }'\)” at the end of the theorem (i.e., I is reached using \(\vec {\sigma }'\)), where “best response to \(\vec {\sigma }'_{-i}\), conditional on having reached I using \(\vec {\sigma }'\)” is defined by Definition 2.1\('\), then we get a characterization of quasi-perfect equilibrium. The proof of Theorem 1.4 sketched in the original article actually proves this result, since the definition of quasi-perfect equilibrium is used rather than that of perfect equilibrium. We can get a characterization of perfect equilibrium by further replacing “\(\sigma _i\) is a best response to \(\vec {\sigma }_{-i}'\) ” by “\(\sigma _i(I)\) is a local best response to \(\vec {\sigma }_{-i}'\) ” (i.e., using Definition 2.1\(''\) rather than Definition 2.1\('\)). The proof is just a slight variant of that given in the paper, and is left to the reader. A similar change must be made in Definition 2.2 to get an appropriate definition of perfect equilibrium; this is exactly what was done in Definition 2.2\('\). The key point is that, again, the phrase “using \(\vec {\sigma }^n\)” needs to be added to Definition 2.2, the definition given in the original article.",1

This has important implications for the pricing of products or the transfer of goods between a principal and an agent, since the inefficiency induced by asymmetric information may be reduced by considering the long term behavior of the agent. There are many ways to model repeated interactions between a principal and an agent, say a seller and a buyer, and by the revelation principle the optimal mechanism will involve the buyer reporting his private information, as long as adequate incentive compatibility and rationality conditions are satisfied. Because of truthful reporting, if the private information known when the contract is signed is the only thing that has a bearing on future private information the problem can be seen intuitively in a greatly simplified way. The dynamic contract resembles a string of static ones, contingent on the time period, agent type and period specific reports. An early contribution in the literature on dynamic mechanisms with adverse selection is the work of Baron and Besanko (1984), who describe a monopoly able to commit, dealing with an agent of variable type, in two periods. Dynamic settings with constant types are considered in Dewatripont (1989), Hart and Tirole (1988), and Laffont and Tirole (1988), Laffont and Tirole (1990). Cremer and McLean (1988) justifies the usual assumption of independent information across agent types to prevent full rent extraction. Laffont and Tirole (1990) introduce a standard framework, analyze the two-period renegotiation proof contract, and Laffont and Tirole (1996) introduce variable agent types and commitment in the context of regulation. More dynamic models in which types are stochastically determined are studied by Rustichini and Wolinsky (1995), and Courty and Li (2000). In more recent contributions, Battaglini (2005) studies variable stochastic types in infinite time with commitment, and Battaglini (2007) analyzes limited commitment with stochastic types. Eső and Szentes (2007) consider many agents in two time periods, when the principal can also release private information. Bergemann and Välimäki (2010) and Athey and Segal (2013) introduce dynamic generalizations of the classic Vickery-Clarke-Groves incentive compatible and efficient mechanism, Boleslavsky and Said (2013) study an infinite period dynamic interaction with persistent shocks and continuous types, while Pavan et al. (2014) work on the general mechanism design problem with continuous types. From an application perspective, it is interesting to consider that there is a link between the private information at different times, and this link can be stochastic—given by a probabilistic evolution; statistic—given by an underlining condition like an initial probability distribution; or in general a combination. In Battaglini (2005), we see the simplest form of a stochastic link: the utility type evolves according to a Markov process. It is simplest in the sense that the information is linked only between consecutive periods, and the preceding periods to the last are irrelevant. By contrast, this paper considers a statistic link: the utility types are given by a distribution depending on a buyer type. This paper presents the interaction between a buyer and a seller, when the buyer has private information about his periodic utility type, and his long run buyer type. The buyer type will be informative of the utility type in terms of probabilities, and all buyer types will draw from the same discrete set of utility types. The buyer type is private information and will influence the type of contract that is optimally offered only to him. A general model for the interaction between a seller and a buyer with one of a discrete set of types is developed. General results allowing for the simplification of the problem are obtained, based on the idea of generating a restricted set of constraints and finding a candidate mechanism in the larger parameter space restricted by that subset, and then verifying that a sufficiently strong set of constraints also hold. The results are applied to derive expressions for optimal allocations in a setting in which each period the buyer can have one of two possible utility types, a low type and a high type, which can change over time. The utility types are selected according to a distribution which can also change, with the condition that the high buyer type is more likely to have the higher utility type each period. The analysis shows that there is separation between buyer types: for the two types, two contracts are offered, and for each of these contracts, reporting different utility types in a period leads to different allocations in that period. In a typical way, allocations for unprofitable low buyer types have to be reduced, to reduce the information rent paid to the profitable high types. Therefore, allocations are optimal following high utility reports of any buyer types, and also optimal for low utility reports of the high buyer types, but are distorted for low buyer types reporting low utility types. Prices in the optimal menu can be chosen to compensate buyers for an optimal level of information rent. As expected, the level of distortion is increasing in the relative weight of high types, and increasing in the difference of the effects of private information. If the buyer type is reported in a truthful mechanism in the first period, any dynamic changes of allocations are a reflection of time changes of the possible type values, which are common knowledge. The contribution of this worked application is to extend the analysis of the dynamic interaction between a principal and an agent of two possible types, who has private information about his future demand and about the likelihood of that demand being high or low, also allowing the demand types and the likelihood to vary in a general way over time. It is important to look at such dynamic contractual relationships, since they are of major importance in an economy. As information technology advances, tracking customers becomes easier and can lead to better tailored products and offers (Miravete 2003). Handling such long term data can improve the customer screening potential of companies which have the resources. Examples are businesses that sell memberships to repeat clients. They have the ability to enforce long term contracts, and the service usage can be carefully monitored. Moreover, the service to users can be charged at different rates based on quantity brackets, and the seller can package utility increasing features into the contract. The contracts themselves come with initial or overtime financial commitments. The consumer will arguably have knowledge of his potential usage pattern, defining a possible buyer type, and his monthly consumption choice would be equivalent to reporting a period specific type—by the taxation principle. One can consider also monopolistic suppliers selling to a small business, or franchise owners dealing with individual franchises. The agent companies and franchises hold specific private information about the profitability of the business, as well as about the day to day sales potential, which would determine short term profits. Long term strategy must incorporate the information from repeated interaction. The approach of this paper is novel also because of the method of analysis employed. As is standard in the literature, incentive compatibility constraints necessary for a direct truthful mechanism have to be introduced in the maximization problem. The goal is to restrict the relevant set of incentive compatibility constraints.Footnote 1 To simplify the problem consider, in a first stage, consider only the compatibility constraints that have to be satisfied after the contract is signed, and after the buyer reports truthfully the private information he has ex ante. These constrains ignore the buyers that have misreported their initial private information. With only this subset of constraints, say \({\mathcal {W}}\), the optimal menu space considered is wider than allowed, so any menu found satisfying \({\mathcal {W}}\) that is also incentive compatible ex ante will be fully optimal. With the problem thus divided, the next step involves finding conditions that restrict the large space of viable parameters—these conditions are equivalent to \({\mathcal {W}}\) holding. Then maximization conditions are applied to this restricted set of parameters, so that the solution is fully incentive compatible. Because distortions in allocations arise as a result of ex ante private information, the more analytically involved problem is figuring out correct allocations that satisfy the incentive compatibility constraints between ex ante types. The benefit of this method is that the analytically difficult part can be separated, and expressions are solved in a problem with far fewer parameters. This type of contracting problem is important since agent private information that comes in sequentially is realistic in many settings. As a qualitative justification for this assertion, consider the problem faced by a gym, trying to sell gym memberships. For simplicity, assume there are only two kinds of buyers: a heavy gym user type, and a light user type. The light user type is more likely to only want access to basic machines and facilities, while the heavy user type will more often require specific facilities (pool, squash court, fitness classes), in addition to the basics. In this example, the heavy and light users are our high and low types, and the momentary need for facilities in the gym is the period by period utility type. Both the heavy and the light users know what they will likely want, but do not yet know when that would happen. The difference is understood to be in the frequency of this demand. The results suggests a low type should be offered a basic membership package, with pay-per-use access to the facilities not included, while a high type should be offered an extensive package, which comes with a discount on more facilities, and which is worthwhile only for a heavy user. The discount would correspond to the information rent paid to the high type, since he has the option of buying the basic package. 
Courty and Li (2000) study a similar problem about the allocation of an indivisible good, where private information is linked across only two time periods. Both a discrete two-type case and a continuum of types are considered. In the first period the agent finds out his type, which partially restricts the buyer’s possible valuations for the ticket in the future. The informativeness of the buyer’s private information can differ both in the sense of first order stochastic dominance—when the high type knows he values a ticket more than the low type, or in the sense of a mean-preserving spread—when the high type is more uncertain about the value of the ticket. The first period information can be used by the principal to propose an interim contract to increase his returns, compared to signing the contract ex post when the agent has all the private information. Considering contracts with partial refunds, the authors find that the informativeness of the signal the buyer gets is what determines the optimal mechanisms, and not the uncertainty that affects all the buyer types. The virtual value determined in the continuous type case is suggestive of the allocations determined in this paper. In both cases, the distortion of the low type is proportional to the informativeness of the initial agent type and the relative difference in the utility types. The private information that the buyer has before signing the contract is what leads to information rents and to distortions of future allocations from the first-best. Therefore, one would expect that the present set-up induces distortions at arbitrary periods similarly, to account for the same private information. However, that cannot be directly deduced, since the utility type reports in future periods can provide information on the initial buyer type, so the dynamic game is not separable into independent games at different periods. The present paper can be seen as extending some of their results to an arbitrary, possibly infinite, number of periods. 
Battaglini (2005) considers an alternative approach, with a dynamic interaction between a buyer and a seller in infinite time, much like in this paper, where agent utility can change period by period based on a discrete utility type determinant, and this type is linked across time by a Markov (memoryless) process. It is assumed that types are positively correlated across time, that is, a high type is more likely than a low type to become a high type again. The incipient type evolution in the first two periods is the same as in the present paper, which will consider that types are correlated across time based on a common distribution, so it is no surprise that the allocations are also the same. After the second period, the dynamics diverge: in Battaglini (2005) the distortion for the low report type remains only after a history of low-type reports, and is probabilistically reduced progressively until it vanishes at infinity; in this paper the distorted allocation for a low type report is maintained indifferent of the history of low-type reports, and does not converge to the first best. Rustichini and Wolinsky (1995) work with another simpler model with Markov types in which the strategic agent behavior is limited, and the focus is on the principal’s learning of the demand environment. 
Boleslavsky and Said (2013) examine a model with a dynamic interaction between a buyer and a seller, which shares many of the features of the model herein. The significant differences are that (i) they use a continuous buyer distribution with positive support—i.e., there are no gaps in buyer types, and that (ii) the shocks to the period by period utility type of the buyer have a very specific structure, with persistent effect—the buyer’s value is proportional to the product of the history of shocks. The no-gap-in-buyer-type assumption is necessary, given the analysis method, much like in Pavan et al. (2014), because of the use of the envelope theorem to restrict incentive compatibility constraints. The assumption of the buyer value as a product of shocks is however more consequential. It makes any shock to the valuation of the buyer infinitely persistent, and its multiplicative form leads to a “path-independence” property for allocations, which is used in reducing the number of compatibility constraints considered, thus simplifying the analysis. The optimal allocations derived start with “honeymoon phases” of advantageous prices of different lengths, and demanding different entry costs, which serve to screen the buyer types. In a very important recent paper, Pavan et al. (2014) attempt to characterize general dynamic mechanism design problems in finite and infinite time. They consider a general stochastic process for information, with possibly non-time-separable agent payoffs. To obtain more explicit results, they require continuity in the probability measure that determines types, and in general, continuity in the total variation metric. The results do not translate to discrete type settings, where the differential methods cannot apply, however, they are quite general, and the intuition described is informative. In particular, the authors note that the change in informativeness of the period-by-period report of the buyer determines the change in time of the allocation distortion. In the present paper, the optimal truthful mechanism requires reporting the buyer type in the first period, which implies that the allocation distortions in subsequent periods should be the same, since future reports are equally informative for the seller.",2

Using the tools of game theory, it proposes rules of interactions such that the participants’ strategic behavior complies with the designer’s objective. In a leading example, the designer’s purpose is to implement the socially efficient outcome, that is, to find the allocation that maximizes total welfare. The major challenge to efficient implementation is the fact that information about individual preferences is private.Footnote 1 In a setting with quasi-linear utilities, D’Aspremont and Gérard–Varet (1979) construct an ingenious mechanism that aligns the agents’ individual incentives with total welfare maximization. In a Bayes–Nash equilibrium, the agents reveal their types to the principal and thus efficiency can be achieved. The AGV mechanism has become an essential building block for the mechanism design theory (Athey and Segal 2013). Since the AGV mechanism is tailored to the concept of Bayes–Nash equilibrium, its success in inducing truth-telling and, therefore, efficiency in practice depends on (1) whether the participants’ behavioral response to the mechanism coincides with the Bayes–Nash prediction and, if it does not, (2) whether efficiency still obtains under the possible deviations. While the first question has not been addressed directly in the literature, the experimental results in (simpler) complete information games suggest that the answer may be negative. As to the second question, little is known as to the loss of efficiency if the participants do not play equilibrium. This paper tries to fill this gap by studying how the mechanism performs in a behavioral framework where, contrary to the requirement of Bayes–Nash equilibrium, the agents conduct only a limited number of iterations of reasoning. The choice of the behavioral setting follows a large body of evidence from experimental games. Recent surveys by Crawford et al. (2009) and Camerer and Ho (2015) show that non-equilibrium models with finite depth of reasoning, such as the Level-k model (Lk; Nagel 1995; Stahl and Wilson 1994; Costa-Gomes et al. 2001; Costa-Gomes and Crawford 2006) and the cognitive hierarchy model (CH; Camerer et al. 2004), systematically outperform equilibrium in predicting human behavior. Along with closely fitting the lab data, these models are able to predict some frequently observed field phenomena such as the winner’s curse in common-value auctions: see Crawford and Iriberri 2007. We choose the Lk model due to its tractability, but most of our results also hold in the CH model.Footnote 2
 
Lk is a model of reasoning prior to a game, where the agent maximizes his payoff against a non-equilibrium belief about other agents’ strategies. The belief is constructed in the following iterative process. An agent of level \(k=1\) (“L1 agent”) believes that his opponents (“L0”) behave non-strategically. In incomplete information games, such as the AGV mechanism, L0’s can be modeled in two distinct ways: either they truthfully reveal their type (”truthful L0”) or draw their actions (type reports) from a random distribution (“random L0”). An L2 agent best replies to the profile of L1 strategies, L3 best replies to L2, and so on. In general, an Lk strategy is best reply to the profile of \(L(k-1)\), suggesting the interpretation that agents try to “outguess” their opponents.Footnote 3 To illustrate, consider a seminal game in this literature,Footnote 4 where players pick a number between 0 and 100 and the one whose number is closest to some fraction, say one half, of the average wins the game. In this guessing game, if L0s randomize uniformly between 0 and 100, L1s will choose 50/2=25, L2s will choose 25/2, etc. As k increases, the best response of Lk approaches 0, the only Nash equilibrium of the game. This paper applies the Lk model to the AGV mechanism with one-dimensional types. We look at the case where the principal knows the type distribution and expects equilibrium behavior on part of the agents. Such principal is ignorant of the fact that he operates in an Lk environment. In this setting we conduct a positive exercise and find conditions under which the mechanism remains robust to Lk. Throughout the paper we assume independent private valuations and utilities that are strictly concave with respect to the allocation.Footnote 5 First, we observe that in the truthful-L0 specification of the Lk model the mechanism never produces a loss in efficiency. In that specification, the L1 best reply is given by the equilibrium condition of AGV which implies truth-telling. By induction, this result extends to any higher level k, therefore the mechanism chooses the efficient allocation irrespective of the levels prevailing in the population. Further, in the random-L0 specification of Lk, we show that if the distribution of random actions (L0) coincides with the distribution of payoff types, then the participants at any level larger than zero report truthfully to the mechanism. Next, we analyze the more interesting case where the type distribution used by the planner to assign transfers differs from L1s’ expectation of the opponents’ actions. In this case, the externality payment generally fails to align the agent’s incentives with total expected welfare maximization. As a result, the AGV mechanism does not induce truth-telling and produces a sub-optimal allocation. Denoting the distribution of random L0 strategies by \(\Phi \) and the distribution of types by F, we study how the relation between \(\Phi \) and F affects the Lk strategies in the mechanism. We focus on the case where \(\Phi \) dominates F (in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance) or vice versa. This corresponds to scenarios where players believe a salient strategy is to systematically under- or over-report one’s type. The main result characterizes the deviations from equilibrium behavior for the case that the efficient choice rule is linear in agents’ types (the environment we call neutral). If L0 agents are expected to under-report their types, then all types of an L1 agent will over-report their types to the mechanism, and vice versa. Therefore L1 agents display compensatory bias in reports. The distortion carries over to higher levels, but the expected absolute value of the distortion of type decreases as level k goes up; in the case of quadratic utilities, the rate of decrease is exponential. Interestingly, the direction of the bias (i.e., whether the agents over-report or under-report their types) alternates at each iteration from k to \({k+1}\). This result has two interesting implications for the outcome of the mechanism. First, if the pool of agents is a mixture of two subsequent levels (e.g., L2 and L3), the distortion of efficiency is lower than in a group where only one of these levels is present. Second, as Lk goes up, the outcome approaches efficiency. The results extend partially to the non-neutral case where types are complements or substitutes with respect to the efficient choice of allocation. Non-neutrality means that the marginal effect of one agent’s type on the efficient allocation is not invariant in the other agent’s type. In particular, when the other agent’s type is high, the marginal effect is stronger in case of complements and weaker in case of substitutes. In either of these environments reports have two counter-veiling effects on the choice of allocation. The first direct effect of compensating bias pushes the allocation in the direction of marginal payoff increase. The second indirect effect changes the choice rule’s sensitivity to the opponent’s report. Therefore, compensating bias remains best reply in type ranges where the direct effect dominates. We demonstrate by means of example that the dominance of the indirect effect changes the prediction. While the main interest of this paper is positive, we conduct a separate normative analysis of the AGV mechanism. This part is concerned with a principal who is aware of the Lk environment and seeks the appropriate AGV-type mechanism for efficient implementation. In particular, we change the transfer rule to reflect the actual expected externality (under the level-k strategy profile) and thus to elicit the information correctly.Footnote 6 The Lk environment is characterized by three components: type distribution F, random actions distribution \(\Phi \) and agents’ levels k. When all three components are known, the efficient Lk mechanism differs from the original AGV in its transfer to L1 agents only. By correcting the incentives at level 1 the principal restores truth-telling at all levels and achieves efficiency. When the information on \(F, \Phi \) or k is missing, the principal can expand the mechanism to elicit the agents’ knowledge. One way to do this is to add a betting round where the agents guess each others’ reports. Ex post, the principal rewards correct guesses. Betting is a powerful tool for the elicitation of correlated informationFootnote 7 and turns out to be instrumental in the Lk environment. We show how betting can be used to elicit levels k and other information necessary to construct the efficient mechanism. This paper is among the first studies of mechanisms in an Lk environment. Crawford (2015) looks at the double auction mechanism and revisits Myerson and Satterthwaite’s (1983) impossibility result in the Lk framework. He finds, in particular, that revelation principle does not hold in this framework since the choice of mechanism influences the correctness of Lk beliefs. Similar to his paper, the normative part of our analysis exploits the predictably incorrect beliefs of Lk agents. De Clippel et al. (2014) provide a characterization of implementable choice functions in a general setup with finite depth of reasoning. They consider the expected externality mechanism as an example and show that it achieves efficient implementation under the assumption that L0 report truthfully. In contrast, the present paper allows for L0 to be random and arbitrarily far from truthtelling. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the key assumptions, the Lk model in incomplete information games and in the AGV mechanism in particular. Section 3 describes the properties of Lk strategies in the AGV mechanism: equivalence of Lk and equilibrium models in the AGV mechanism, the biases due to first order stochastic dominance and convergence in the neutral environment. Section 4 shows how the AGV mechanism can be adjusted to the Lk environment, and Sect. 5 concludes.",9

(Posted on the website of the Game Theory Society by Shmuel Zamir, Editor, and Bernhard von Stengel, Co-Editor of IJGT, on 1 July 2011.)
 The International Journal of Game Theory (IJGT) encourages submissions of significant papers in Combinatorial Game Theory, and has invited Aviezri Fraenkel to its Editorial Board to deal with these submissions. IJGT, founded in 1971, has a long tradition of publishing papers in game theory with significant mathematical content. Combinatorial Game Theory has developed into a field with advanced mathematical and computational complexity techniques and a number of challenging open questions, where new results will nicely fit with and complement the scope of IJGT. Combinatorial games are typically two-player games with perfect information and “win”, “lose”, and “draw” or “tie” as possible outcomes, and an underlying mathematical structure. This is in contrast to games involving chance and lack of information such as Poker, which are central to “classical” game theory. A basic combinatorial game is Nim, given by a number of heaps of chips where players alternately remove some chips from one of those heaps, and the last player to move wins. Over a century ago, it was shown how to play Nim optimally using the binary representation of the heap sizes. This method can be extended to “impartial” games where the available moves from any position do not depend on the player to move. An important algebraic structure is the “sum” of games where a player can move in one of several independent parts of the game. Such decompositions are important, for example, to improve the complexity of algorithms for playing endgames of the board game Go where humans still highly outperform computers.Footnote 1
 Recent progress in Combinatorial Game Theory concern difficult questions on partizan (not impartial) games such as chess, misère play (where the last player to move loses) and interactions of game tokens, both of which conflict with the “sum” of games, and computational hardness questions. The classic book on combinatorial games is “Winning Ways” by Elwyn R. Berlekamp,Footnote 2 John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy from 1982, republished in 2009. More recently (2007) the reader-friendly enticing textbook “Lessons in Play” was produced by Michael Albert, Richard Nowakowski, and David Wolfe; and now (2013) also the authoritative graduate text “Combinatorial Game Theory” by Aaron Siegel. As shown by Conway in another classic book “On Numbers and Games” (ONAG, 1976), all two-player games can be constructed by a simple Dedekind-reminiscent cut, with a rich mathematical theory. The real numbers are a subset of the set of all games. Many challenging questions concern the computational complexity of optimal play, given a particular game specification. Given the advanced development and mathematical depth of Combinatorial Game Theory, its significant papers will be a welcome contribution to IJGT. We hope that IJGT will be considered as the premier publication outlet by the Combinatorial Game Theory community.",1

Its equilibrium concept, an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) describes evolutionary outcomes in environments where populations are large and matching is uniformly random.Footnote 1 Since an ESS is a refinement of Nash equilibrium, it obviously cannot explain any behavioral departure from purely self-serving behavior in the one-shot Nash sense. In particular it cannot account for cooperative behavior in say, a prisoners’ dilemma, or shed light on altruism more generally, nor can it account for any other non-Nash behaviors such as spite (Hamilton 1970; Alger and Weibull 2012) or costly punishment (Fehr and Gächter 2000). In order to explain such deviations from Nash behavior, evolutionary game theory turned to models with a finite number of agents hence departing from the first of the mentioned conditions of Maynard Smith and Price (1973). Thus in Schaffer (1988), the finite set of individuals have “market power” and can influence average fitness while making simultaneous decisions (playing the field). In the model preferred by Maynard Smith (1982)—namely repeated games—a few agents, usually just two, can perfectly monitor and record each others’ past actions and condition their strategies hereupon (in evolutionary theory, the repeated games approach is usually referred to as direct reciprocity). Both of these frameworks have led to a large body of research in economics and game theory (see e.g. Alós-Ferrer and Ania 2005; Leininger 2006; Samuelson 2002; Vega-Redondo 1997, and references therein). Others, beginning with Wright (1921, 1922) and his F-statistic, focused on studying populations where individuals do not get matched in a uniformly random manner. When matching is non-uniformly random the fitness of an individual will depend on the group of individuals he is matched with, and groups with different compositions will on average meet with varying reproductive success (Kerr and Godfrey-Smith 2002); see also Bergström (2002). Take the prisoners’ dilemma. If cooperators have a higher chance compared to defectors to be matched with cooperators, matching is non-uniformly random, and specifically it is in this case assortative. If the matching is assortative enough, cooperators will end up receiving a higher average fitness than defectors and thus positive levels of cooperation can become evolutionarily stable. Assortative matching has also been shown to lead to more cooperative outcomes in Moran processes (Cooney et al. 2016).Footnote 2
 Non-uniformly random matching is a realistic description in situations where a large group of individuals cannot perfectly monitor each others’ past behaviors but receive some signals about opponents’ types and exert some influence on the matching process (Wilson and Dugatkin 1997; Bergström 2003). It can also result due to prolonged interaction of individuals in separated groups (Maynard Smith 1964), if individuals are matched according to a “meritocratic matching” process in the sense of Nax et al. (2014), if matching depends on the geographical location of individuals (Eshel et al. 1998; Nowak and May 1992; Skyrms 2004), or if (genetically) similar individuals match assortatively as in models of kin selection (Hamilton 1964; Grafen 1979; Hines and Maynard Smith 1979; Alger and Weibull 2010; Ohtsuki 2010). Several other processes are listed in Bergström (2013) who also shows that the index of assortativity of Bergström (2003) and Wright’s F-statistic are formally equivalent. In general, the above conditions lead to what biologists refer to as structured populations.Footnote 3
 Now, the existing literature on non-uniformly random matching usually deals with special cases—the typical being the two-player, two-strategy case where matching is assortative. Exceptions to this include Kerr and Godfrey-Smith (2002) who study many-player games with two strategies, van Veelen (2011) who uses a setting similar to ours and discusses inclusive fitness, and Alger and Weibull (2016) who develop a general model to investigate the evolutionary stability of preferences. Here we consider the general case and define Nash equilibrium and ESS within the resulting population game (Sandholm 2010, pp. 22–23). The fitness function of the population game is derived from two primitives: a (symmetric, normal-form game) payoff matrix and a function that assigns particular population compositions to group compositions (called a matching rule). Given this structure of fitness functions, we then show how several results known from population games carry through to our setting. In particular, any Nash equilibrium is a steady state for the replicator dynamic, any (Lyapunov) stable steady state for the replicator dynamic is a Nash equilibrium, and any ESS is an asymptotically stable state of the replicator dynamic. More substantially, we push the literature forward by deriving results on the efficiency of the Nash equilibria of population games. A key point—well known from the prisoners’ dilemma—is that under uniformly random matching, Nash equilibrium may be inefficient in the sense that the average fitness of the population is not maximized. Since ESS and Nash equilibrium coincide in evolutionary models based on uniformly random matching, it follows that uniformly random matching generally fails to produce outcomes that are efficient. When matching is non-uniformly random, this raises the following question: If we keep the payoff structure fixed and vary the matching rule, will some matching rule lead to efficiency? Our main result in this regard (Proposition 3) tells us that any efficient outcome will in fact be a Nash equilibrium under some matching rule. Such efficient outcomes could, for example, be reached endogenously by populations who can influence the matching process.Footnote 4
 The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the general setup, introduces matching rules, and defines Nash equilibrium and ESS. Section 3 contains our main theoretical results. Section 4 provides a number of applications in two-player, two-strategy normal-form games. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",12

It is therefore to be expected that the core correspondence is piecewise linear. Bloch and de Clippel (2010) introduced an equivalence relation based on the extreme points of the core to identify the classes of balanced games on which the core is additive. In this paper, using a result of Kuipers et al. (2010), we characterize those equivalence classes by finitely many linear inequalities. It follows that the core correspondence is indeed piecewise linear. Additionally, we provide three alternative characterizations of the maximal regions on which the core correspondence is linear. First, such regions coincide with closures of equivalence classes of full dimension. Second, such regions coincide with closures of equivalence classes that are maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Third, for every extreme point of the core of a game in the interior of a maximal region, the collection of tight core inequalities constitutes a basis.",

However, often the preferences of the agents do not depend only on the activity itself, but also on the number of participants in the activity [see also Darmann et al. (2017)]. For instance, consider the situation in which working tasks (that take place simultaneously) have to be split among agents, where the agents’ preferences are not only over the different working tasks but also over the number of agents working on the specific tasks. Additional examples include a company that wishes to set up free sports classes for its employees (Skowron et al. 2015) or the organizers of a workshop who have to organize social activities for the free afternoon. For example, these activities could include a bus trip, a table tennis tournament, or taking a sauna. Now, an agent might be willing to take part in a bus trip with many participants, but does not want to take a sauna in case it is too crowded or participate in a table tennis tournament with too many participants. Obviously, as this is quite natural for the different activities, also the opinions over the group size for a specific activity might vary from agent to agent. Of course, the possibility to abstain from any activity is a viable alternative as well. The goal now would be to assign agents to activities in a reasonable way, based on such preferences.Footnote 1 We are thus concerned with a setting in which agents have preferences over pairs “(activity, group size)”, including the possibility “do nothing” to which we refer as the void activity \(a_{\emptyset }\). A general model in which the agents’ preferences are weak orders over such pairs is introduced in Darmann et al. (2017) as the group activity selection problem (GASP). In this paper, we consider \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\), the variant of \(\mathsf{GASP}\) in which the agents’ preferences are strict orders. Given the agents’ preferences, the aim is to assign agents to activities in a reasonable way. There are, of course, different approaches towards this task. One possibility would be to take a social choice perspective, aiming at assignments that maximize positional scores such as approval or Borda scores, or at a Condorcet winner among the assignments [see Darmann (2018)]. In this work, we take a more game-theoretical approach by aiming at stable assignments, i.e., assignments that do not admit an incentive to deviate from, for different notions of stability such as Nash, individual and core stability. In addition, we will consider Pareto optimal solutions for our problem. After considering the relations between these concepts in the setting of \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\), we take into account two natural special cases of agents’ preferences and we provide computational complexity results both for the decision version of the respective problems and for the related verification problems of deciding whether a given assignment is stable (and Pareto optimal, respectively). As in Darmann et al. (2017) we require that no agent is assigned to an activity such that the agent would rather do nothing, i.e., prefers \(a_{\emptyset }\) to the pair “(assigned activity, group size)”; an assignment satisfying this property is called individually rational. Clearly, in an individually rational assignment no agent has an incentive to deviate to the void activity \(a_{\emptyset }\). This work is closely related to Darmann et al. (2017), where the general model of the group activity selection problem \((\mathsf{GASP})\) is introduced; in \(\mathsf{GASP}\), the agents’ preferences are weak orders over the pairs “(activity, group size)”. The focus of Darmann et al. (2017), however, is laid on the variant \(\mathsf{a\text {-}GASP}\), where the agent’s preferences are trichotomous: each agent partitions the set of pairs “(activity, group size)” into approved ones (i.e., pairs that are preferred to the void activity), the void activity, and disapproved ones (pairs to which the void activity is preferred). In that paper, the main concepts considered are maximum individually rational assignments (i.e., individually rational assignments that assign the maximum number of agents to a non-void activity) and stable assignments respectively. The main objective of Darmann et al. (2017) is a computational complexity study of the problem of finding such assignments, which includes several special cases such as increasing and decreasing preferences. In our work, we focus on the variant \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\) of the group activity selection problem in which the agents’ preferences are strict orders. While \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\) is approached from a social choice viewpoint in Darmann (2018), we apply the stability concepts of \(\mathsf{a\text {-}GASP}\) to strict orders and analyse the computational complexity involved in finding stable assignments, with respect to the two intuitive special cases of increasing and decreasing preferences. In addition, we include the concept of Pareto optimality (and weak Pareto optimality) in our analysis and provide an efficient algorithm to find a Pareto optimal (and thus also weakly Pareto optimal) assignment. The model of \(\mathsf{GASP}\), and hence \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\), is closely related to the one of hedonic games [see Banerjee et al. (2001) and Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2002)], and in particular anonymous hedonic games (Banerjee et al. 2001). In hedonic games, agents have preferences over the possible coalitions (i.e., subgroups of agents) they are part of; in anonymous hedonic games, the agents’ preferences depend only on the size of that coalition. The goal would be a partition of the agents into subgroups in a reasonable manner. Note that \(\mathsf{GASP}\) can be embedded in the hedonic game framework [see Darmann et al. (2017) for details]. However, observe that \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\) (and \(\mathsf{GASP}\) in general) allows for a more compact representation of agents’ preferences and bears two natural special cases that, in some cases, allow for finding stable assignments efficiently. Stable partitions have been studied by Ballester (2004) from a computational viewpoint, both for anonymous and non-anonymous hedonic games. In particular, Ballester (2004) shows that deciding whether there is an outcome that is core stable, Nash stable, individually stable or contractually individually stable is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete for both anonymous and non-anonymous hedonic games. While these results translate to the general group activity selection problem \(\mathsf{GASP}\), they do not directly imply similar hardness results for the setting of \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\) considered in this work. In addition, the computational complexity of stable partitions with respect to different notions of stability such as Nash stability, individual stability or core stability has also been considered in the context of additively separable hedonic games, e.g., in the works of Aziz et al. (2011) (where also the concept of Pareto optimality is considered), Dimitrov et al. (2006) and Olsen (2007). 
Aziz et al. (2013) focus on the computational complexity involved in finding Pareto optimal solutions in hedonic games and variants thereof, including anonymous hedonic games and roommate games. They show that it is \(\mathsf NP\)-hard to find a Pareto optimal solution both in anonymous and non-anonymous hedonic games, and provide an algorithm which determines a Pareto optimal solution for some of its variants, including roommate games, in polynomial time. These results, however, do not immediately carry over to our setting. In particular, while \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\) can be embedded in the general (non-anonymous) hedonic game framework, for \(\mathsf{o\text {-}GASP}\) we provide an algorithm that computes a Pareto optimal assignment in polynomial time (see Sect. 3.4). Further related work includes the works of Lee and Shoham (2015) and Spradling et al. (2013). In Lee and Shoham (2015), the stable invitation problem is introduced, both in an anonymous and non-anonymous version. In the stable invitation problem, the goal is to find a set of agents to be invited to an event. In the anonymous stable invitation problem, the agents have preferences over the number of invitees; in the non-anonymous version, the agents additionally specify a set of accepted agents and a set of rejected agents. Lee and Shoham (2015) provide a number of complexity results for finding stable invitations and also consider strategic behaviour of the agents. In the work of Spradling et al. (2013), agents have preferences over pairs made up of a role and a coalition; the role refers to the actual role the agent takes in the coalition, and the coalition specifies the composition of roles that make up the coalition. Spradling et al. (2013) provide a number of computational complexity results for finding stable partitions of the agents, for different notions of stability. Very recently, however, Igarashi et al. (2017a, b) expand the group activity selection problem \(\mathsf{GASP}\) by adding social networks to the setting, and agents can only take part in the same activity if they form a connected subgroup of the network. Finally, for a survey of group activity selection we refer to Darmann and Lang (2017). The paper is organized as follows. The formal framework, including a presentation of the relationship between the concepts and an overview over the results, is presented in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we discuss the decision problem whether a stable assignment exists, and, given this decision problem can be solved efficiently, provide polynomial-time algorithms for finding such assignments. In that section, we also provide a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a Pareto optimal assignment. In Sect. 4 we consider the related decision problem whether a given assignment is stable respectively (weakly) Pareto optimal. Section 5 concludes the paper.",3

An example choice-set form appears in Fig. 1. This is similar but not identical to the well-known Osborne-Rubinstein (OR) game specification in which nodes are sequences of past choices. An example OR form also appears in Fig. 1. The new specification has an apparent advantage in the sense that sets are simpler mathematical objects than sequences. Section 7 carefully discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the new specification relative to the OR form, and also relative to the remaining three specifications in this paper. Selten’s “horse” in each of the five specifications. This paper [a] introduces choice-set forms, [b] links choice-set forms and OR forms, and [c] links KS forms and simple forms. (Shown are the tree, the choices, and the information sets of each of five forms. Not shown are the forms’ players. Preferences are not formulated in this paper.) The second contribution of this paper is to build a formal connection between choice-set forms and OR forms. This formal equivalence will require two qualifications, because choice-set forms are slightly less general than OR forms in two regards. First, choice-set forms implicitly impose no absentmindedness in the sense of Piccione and Rubinstein (1997). Second, they implicitly impose no shared alternatives in the sense that two information sets are not allowed to share the same (feasible) alternatives (i.e., choices). Theorem 3.1 shows that every OR form with no absentmindedness and no shared alternatives is equivalent to a choice-set form. Conversely, Theorem 3.2 shows that every choice-set form is equivalent to an OR form with no absentmindedness and no shared alternatives. Thus the theorems show (given no absentmindedness and no shared alternatives) that there is a logical redundancy at the heart of the OR specification: sets of past choices can unambiguously replace sequences of past choices. All five specifications are essentially equivalent, even though they are fundamentally different in how they specify nodes and choices. (A minor issue is that only OR forms and KS forms allow absentmindedness. Section 7.1 discusses absentmindedness, shared alternatives, and two other minor issues.) Let an “AR form” be a discrete extensive form as defined by Alós-Ferrer and Ritzberger (2016a) (henceforth AR16). An example AR form appears in Fig. 1. Such forms extend the specification of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). Incidentally, AR16 also defines non-discrete extensive forms for differential and yet more general games. Such non-discrete forms are beyond the scope of this paper. The current literatureFootnote 1 does not provide a formal connection between OR forms and AR forms. This may be surprising because some prominent and valuable articlesFootnote 2 have tangentially and informally suggested otherwise. It seems that the misstep was caused by improperly combining the following two (correct) results from AR16. [a] AR16 Example 6.5 (p. 145) essentially says that OR trees constitute a special case of “simple trees”. This accords with Fig. 2’s top line, which shows that OR trees specify nodes as choice sequences while simple trees specify nodes as abstract entities. [b] AR16 Theorems 6.2 and 6.4 (pp. 139 and 147) say that “simple forms” are equivalent to AR forms. This equivalence is repeated here as Theorems 6.1 and 6.2, and is shown between the last two columns of Fig. 2. Together, [a] and [b] might seem to suggest that OR forms are special cases of AR forms. But this logic would be faulty because [a] concerns only trees while [b] concerns entire forms.Footnote 3 Thus the reasoning does not provide a formal link between OR forms and AR forms. Fortunately, it only remains to link OR forms and simple forms because [b] links simple forms and AR forms. Further, part of this remaining gap is bridged by Kline and Luckraz (2016) (henceforth KL16). They essentially show that OR forms are equivalent to “KS forms”, where the initials K and S correspond to Kuhn (1953) and Selten (1975). This equivalence is repeated here as Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, and is shown between the OR and KS columns of Fig. 2.Footnote 4 Thus it yet remains to link KS forms and simple forms. KS forms and simple forms are similar in that they both specify nodes as abstract entities (as shown in the top row of Fig. 2). However, KS forms and simple forms differ in that KS forms specify their choices as abstract entities, while simple forms specify their choices as sets of nodes (as shown in the second row of Fig. 2). The third contribution of this paper is to bridge this gap between KS forms and simple forms. This new equivalence appears as Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, and is shown between the KS and simple columns of Fig. 2. With this missing piece in place, it emerges that all five specifications are essentially equivalent. This provides game theorists with a wide spectrum of equivalent specifications. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this paper move from left to right across the five specifications in Fig. 2. Section 7 considers the minor qualifications in the theorems, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each game specification. Finally, the four pairs of equivalence theorems in this paper suggest four equivalences between subcategories of a category of game forms. First steps in this direction are Streufert (2018a, b).",2

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze stochastic games from an epistemic point of view. A distinctive feature of an equilibrium approach to games is the assumption that every player believes that the opponents are correct about his beliefs (see Brandenburger and Dekel 1987, 1989; Tan and Werlang 1988; Aumann and Brandenburger 1995; Asheim 2006; Perea 2007). The main idea of this paper is to analyze stochastic games without imposing the correct beliefs assumption, while at the same time preserving the spirit of subgame perfection. This leads to a concept called common belief in future rationality—an extension of the corresponding concept by Perea (2014) which has been defined for dynamic games of finite duration. Very similar concepts have been introduced in Baltag et al. (2009) and Penta (2015). Common belief in future rationality states that, after every history, the players continue to believe that their opponents will choose rationally in the future, that they believe that their opponents believe that their opponents will choose rationally in the future, and so on, ad infinitum. The crucial feature that common belief in future rationality has in common with subgame perfect equilibria is that the players uphold the belief that the opponents will be rational in the future, even if this belief has been violated in the past. What distinguishes common belief in future rationality from subgame perfect equilibrium is that the former allows the players to have erroneous beliefs about their opponents, while the latter incorporates the condition of correct beliefs in the sense that we make precise. We introduce our solution concept using the language of epistemic models with types, following Harsanyi (1967, 1968a, b). An epistemic model specifies, for each player, the set of possible types, and for each type and each history of the game, a probability distribution over the opponents’ strategy-type combinations. An epistemic model succinctly describes the entire belief hierarchy after each history of the game. This model is essentially the same as the epistemic models used by Ben-Porath (1997), Battigalli and Siniscalchi (1999, 2002) and Perea (2012, 2014) to encode conditional belief hierarchies in finite dynamic games. For a given discount factor \(\delta ,\) we say that a player believes in the opponents’ future \(\delta \)-rationality if he always believes that his opponents maximize their expected utility, given the discount factor \(\delta ,\) now and in the future. More precisely, a type in the epistemic model believes in the opponents’ future \(\delta \)-rationality if, at every history, it assigns probability 1 to the set of opponents’ strategy-type combinations where the strategy maximizes the type’s expected utility, given the discount factor \(\delta ,\) at the present and every future history. A player is said to believe in the opponents’ future uniform rationality if he always believes that his opponents maximize their expected utility, for all discount factors large enough, now and in the future. Formally, we say that the type believes in the opponents’ future uniform rationality if it assigns probability 1 to the set of opponents’ strategy-type combinations where the strategy maximizes the type’s expected utility—for all discount factors larger than some threshold—at the present and every future history. Common belief in future \(\delta \) -rationality requires that the type not only believes in the opponents’ future \(\delta \)-rationality, but also believes, throughout the game, that his opponents always believe in their opponents’ future \(\delta \) -rationality, and so on, ad infinitum. Similarly, we can define common belief in future uniform rationality. In this paper we show that common belief in future rationality is always possible in a stochastic game with finitely many states, and always allows for stationary optimal strategies. More precisely, we prove in Theorem 5.1 that for every discount factor \(\delta <1\), we can always construct an epistemic model in which all types express common belief in future \(\delta \)-rationality, and have stationary optimal strategies. A similar result holds for the uniform optimality case—see Theorem 5.2. The fact that stationary optimal strategies exist for common belief in future rationality is important both from a conceptual and an applied point of view. Conceptually, stationary strategies are very attractive since they are memory-less. Indeed, in a stationary strategy a player need not keep track of the choices made by his opponents or himself in the past, but need only look at the current state, and base his decision solely on the state he is at. Also from an applied perspective stationarity is an important virtue, as it makes the strategies much easier to describe and compute in concrete applications. A second objective of this paper is to relate common belief in future rationality in stochastic games to the well-known concept of subgame perfect equilibrium (Selten 1965). In Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 we provide an epistemic characterization of subgame perfect equilibrium for two-player stochastic games. We show that a behavioral strategy profile \((\sigma _{1},\sigma _{2})\) is a subgame perfect equilibrium, if and only if, it is induced by a pair of types \((t_{1},t_{2})\) where type \(t_{1}\) (a) always believes that the opponent’s type is \(t_{2},\) (b) believes in the opponent’s future rationality, and similarly for type \(t_{2}.\) We refer to condition (a) as the correct beliefs condition, and to condition (b) as mutual belief in future rationality. Indeed, condition (a) for types \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\) implies that type \(t_{1}\) always believes that player 2 always believes that 1’s type is \(t_{1}\) and no other, and hence that player 2 is correct about 1’s beliefs. Similarly for player 2. It is exactly this correct beliefs condition that separates subgame perfect equilibrium from common belief in future rationality, at least for the case of two players. The reason is that the correct beliefs condition, together with mutual belief in future rationality, implies common belief in future rationality. Hence, our characterization theorem shows, in particular, that subgame perfect equilibrium is a refinement of common belief in future rationality. Our characterization result is analogous to the epistemic characterizations of Nash equilibrium as presented in Brandenburger and Dekel (1987, 1989), Tan and Werlang (1988), Aumann and Brandenburger (1995), Asheim (2006) and Perea (2007). The equilibrium counterpart of common belief in future uniform rationality is the concept we term uniform subgame perfect equilibrium. A uniform subgame perfect equilibrium is a strategy profile that is a subgame perfect equilibrium under a discounted evaluation for all sufficiently high values of the discount factor. It is well-known that uniform subgame perfect equilibria may fail to exist in some stochastic games. Indeed, every uniform subgame perfect equilibrium is also a subgame perfect equilibrium under the limiting average reward. It is well-known that subgame perfect equilibria, and in fact even Nash equilibria, may fail to exist in stochastic games under the limiting average reward criterion. This is for instance the case in the famous Big Match game (Gillette 1957), a game we discuss in detail in this paper. Our existence results in Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, which guarantee that common belief in future rationality is always possible in a stochastic game—even for the uniform optimality case—do not rely on any form of equilibrium existence. Instead, we explicitly construct an epistemic model where each type exhibits common belief in future \((\delta \)- or uniform) rationality. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we provide a preliminary discussion of the concept of common belief in future rationality, and its relation to subgame perfect equilibrium, by means of the famous Big Match game (Gillette 1957). In Sect. 3 we give a formal definition of stochastic games. In Sect. 4 we introduce epistemic models and define the concept of common belief in future rationality. In Sect. 5 we prove that common belief in future \(\delta \)- (and uniform) rationality is always possible in a stochastic game, and always allows for stationary optimal strategies. In Sect. 6 we present our epistemic characterizations of subgame perfect equilibrium. All proofs are collected in Sect. 7.",5

On the one hand, we have models that explicitly embed specific mechanisms that are responsible for some cognitive limitation, e.g., Mullainathan (2002) introduces a model of limited memory motivated by—empirically documented—psychological and biological mechanisms. On the other hand, there are models that primarily focus on the behavioral consequences of such limitations, rather than on their underlying mechanisms, e.g., the literature on automata studies repeated games with players who avoid complex strategies, without attributing this tendency to a single mechanism (for an early overview of this literature, see Kalai 1990). This paper belongs to this second stream. In particular, we study the behavioral implications of a family of psychological traits and cognitive constraints, whose common denominator is that players fail to reason about the opponents’ rationality in certain parts of the game tree, either because they cannot, or because they find it cognitively costly, or even because they simply do not deem it important to do so. We refer to this phenomenon as limited focus. Such restriction is particularly interesting, for instance, in the context of signalling future actions, where it reduces the signalling power of the sender (see our leading example in Sect. 2). The reason for classifying our work in the second stream within the bounded rationality literature is that we are not primarily interested in identifying the source of the players’ failure to focus on certain histories, but rather in understanding the behavioral consequences of this failure. Our main result characterizes (by means of an elimination procedure) the strategies that can be rationally played under common strong belief in rationality when the players focus only on a subset of the game tree (Theorem 2).Footnote 1 The underlying idea is that each player is endowed with a function that maps each history (where this player is active) to a subset of the non-terminal histories, viz., to the player’s focus at this history. Then, the player tries to rationalize the opponents’ moves only at the histories that she focuses on, in contrast to the standard forward induction solution concepts which postulate that players try to rationalize the opponents’ actions at all histories (e.g., Battigalli and Siniscalchi 2002; Battigalli and Friedenberg 2012). In particular, we say that the player strongly believes in the opponents’ rationality given her focus whenever the following holds: she will keep believing that her opponents will behave rationally at the histories that she focuses on, if they already behaved rationally at the (past) histories that she focuses on. In other words, the opponents’ behavior at the past histories that the player focuses on constitutes the only evidence that the player can use against the opponents’ rationality; on the other hand, the future histories that the player focuses on describes the degree to which the player believes in the opponents’ future rationality (given that there is no evidence against it). Then, common strong belief of rationality naturally iterates this reasoning. Our framework is flexible enough to accommodate as special cases several cognitive constraints and psychological traits that lead to limited focus. The most obvious examples of such constraints would be limited memory and limited foresight. But moreover, through our framework, we also identify new interesting cognitive constraints and psychological traits, such as for instance our notion of focal histories (Sect. 3.3). Finally, we show that standard solution concepts—such as common strong belief in rationality and common belief in future rationality—emerge as natural special cases of our model. While presenting our framework’s special cases, we also show that different cognitive constraints or psychological traits may lead to the same focus domain, and therefore to the same behavioral predictions. Thus, it is often impossible to identify the underlying constraint/trait from choice data or even from the players’ beliefs (Remark 3). As an example, take backward induction which implicitly postulates that the players focus on their opponents’ rationality only at present and future histories (e.g., Perea 2014). In this case, we cannot identify whether the players have forgotten the strategic incentives at past histories—and therefore they cannot reason about the opponents’ past rationality—or whether they consciously disregard them. But then again, we are not mainly interested in identifying the precise cause of their failure to focus on past histories. Rather we are primarily interested in the behavioral consequences of this failure, and the latter only depends on what they focus on, and not on why they focus on these histories. The paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2 we present our leading example, which we use throughout the paper to illustrate both our framework and our results. In Sect. 3 we introduce our formal framework and we present different special cases and applications of our model. In Sect. 4 we introduce our epistemic model. In Sects. 5 and 6 we introduce our solution concept and our elimination procedure, respectively. In Sect. 7 we present the main characterization results. In Sect. 8 we embed standard solution concepts into our framework. Section 9 addresses some concluding remarks. All proofs are relegated to the Appendices. Since we touch upon several different issues, the relationship to the existing literature is discussed throughout the paper.",

The informed player, the sender, can send a signal, contingent on type, and the uninformed party, the receiver, takes an action, which may be conditional on the observed signal. In equilibrium, the informed player optimally chooses a signal, knowing that the uninformed player will take an optimal action conditional on his inferences from the signal, and inferences are correct. If the sender chooses to send different signals for different types, the uninformed party can unambiguously determine the informed player’s type. In this case the equilibrium is called separating. Among many equilibria, separating equilibria are of central interest because informational asymmetry is resolved. Contribution In the model described above, we focus on those type separating strategies of the sender that, combined with the induced optimal strategy of the receiver, form a (separating) equilibrium. Such strategies are called SE strategies. Earlier results on the characterization of SE strategies in signaling games, despite their seeming generality, fail to capture many simple and natural extensions of the classic job market model by Spence. We achieve full coverage of job market models with quasi-linear utilities. That is, settings in which the utility function of the sender is calculated as the payment a by the receiver, minus the cost c(s, t) of signaling s when of type t (in formula, \(U_S = a - c(s, t)\)). The advantage of quasi-linearity is that it separates the cost of signaling from the response of the receiver, thereby making the cost independent of the response of the receiver. This advantage translates itself into two improvements upon previous literature, which we describe below. First, we give a complete characterization of SE strategies that uses only four fairly mild conditions, the most prominent one being that the cost function should satisfy decreasing differences, an algebraic version of the single crossing property. Under these conditions many of the results on SE strategies can already be established. For example the—intuitive—result that any SE strategy is strictly increasing with type follows immediately. Notably, we do not need differentiability (or even continuity) of the utility function of the sender, so that these results apply in a wide variety of settings. Second, when type space is a halfopen interval, we only need a further three relatively natural and straightforward conditions on model primitives to characterize existence and uniqueness of the SE strategy. The requirements on the signaling cost function are that it is continuous, and that it has a continuously differentiable and bounded partial derivative with respect to the signal.Footnote 1 Approach The technique we use to establish our results is in itself worth a short discussion. We use the—essentially algebraic—theory of node potentials on directed graphs to derive our results. This technique has recently been applied with much success in the, related, context of mechanism design.Footnote 2 See for example Heydenreich et al. (2009), Carbajal and Ely (2013), Chung and Olsewski (2007) and Kos and Messner (2012) for applications of the theory of networks to mechanism design without differentiability. The algebraic nature of the theory allows us to discard conditions on the first and second order partial derivatives of the utility function of sender, the conditions that drive most of the earlier results. Our proof technique highlights that differentiability is in itself not the driving force of these results. Instead, these results are shown to rely only on the implied algebraic structure of marginal gains in type pooling versus marginal costs of signaling captured by the decreasing differences condition. Related literature Mailath (1987) studies a model in which the utility function of the receiver is \(C^2\), utility is strictly monotonic in types and actions, and strictly quasi-concave in signals, plus a technical condition on the first and second order derivatives of the utility function for the sender, called boundedness. Type space is assumed to be a compact interval, the signal space is assumed to be equal to the type spaceFootnote 3 and the action space is the entire set of reals. Under the assumption of single crossing it is shown that an one-to-one strategy is a separating equilibrium strategy precisely when the strategy is strictly increasing and it solves a characterizing differential equation. Existence and uniqueness of a separating equilibrium strategy is then shown under the additional assumption that the derivative of the utility function of the sender with respect to signals satisfies a boundedness condition. 
Mailath and von Thadden (2013) study a model in which the utility function of the sender and the best response function of the receiver under complete information are both \(C^2\). Further, under complete information the receiver needs to have a unique best response, and the induced valuation function of the sender needs to satisfy a technical condition on both first and second order derivatives of the valuation function. Thus, the conditions on the strategy of the receiver are only implicitly formulated, in terms of the induced payoff function for the sender. They show that if a separating equilibrium strategy of the receiver is differentiable at a certain point, it is characterized by a differential equation at that point. They also show that if (1) a strategy is separating, (2) it solves the characterizing differential equation, and (3) it satisfies a version of the single-crossing property, then that strategy is incentive-compatible. They apply their results in several examples. 
Quinzii and Rochet (1985) study a model where both types and signals are higher dimensional. They show for the case of linear, separable costs, that a separating equilibrium exists under assumptions of smoothness of the productivity function, plus convexity of the surplus function. 
Hoppe et al. (2009) study a matching market between a set of men and a set of women. Each man and each woman has private information regarding their type. The value of a match depends on both the type of the man and the woman in question.Footnote 4 Signals are costly, but do not depend on type of either men or women, and are linearly deducted from utility. In this model, Hoppe et al. (2009) show that there exists a single symmetric, strictly monotonic, and continuously differentiable equilibrium. They also characterize this equilibrium by means of a differential equation. However, the analysis does not rule out the existence of non-symmetric, non-monotonic, or non-differentiable equilibria, and uniqueness is not guaranteed. Organization Section 2 presents the model of signaling games and several notions of graph theory. In Sect. 3 we fully characterize SE strategies in terms of node potentials for an induced length function. In Sect. 4 we derive conditions to guarantee existence of a unique SE strategy when type space is a halfopen interval. We show that the unique SE strategy can be computed by solving an associated differential equation. We illustrate the power of our techniques in four applications, among those the job market model and an example of a model without differentiability. All omitted proofs are in the “Appendix”.",

It seemingly depends on all coalitional values, but a closer look reveals the inherent high redundancy in its definition. Indeed, as Brune (1983), and later Reijnierse and Potters (1998) have proved: in any n-player game there are at most \(2n-2\) coalitions which actually determine the nucleolus. Unfortunately, the identification of these nucleolus-defining coalitions is no less laborious as computing the nucleolus itself. On the other hand, if special properties of the game enable us to specify a priori a polynomial size characterization family of coalitions for the nucleolus, then we can compute it in polynomial time (in the number of players). There are several classes of balanced games for which polynomial time nucleolus algorithms are available in the literature. The key to the efficiency of some of these algorithms (e.g. in case of assignment games) is Huberman’s (1980) theorem stating that in a balanced game all nucleolus-defining coalitions are essential (cannot be weakly majorized by a partition) in the game, hence the inessential ones can be ignored. Although typically not explicitly mentioned, but several other known polytime algorithms (e.g. in case of fixed-tree games) rely on the dual counterpart of Huberman’s result: in computing the nucleolus of a balanced game, all dually inessential coalitions (which can be weakly minorized by a partition in the dual game) can be ignored. Our aim is to investigate what kinds of weighted versions of the nucleolus can also be computed by taking into account only coalitions in these families. Since the above mentioned reducibility results require nonemptiness of the core, our domain will also be the class of balanced games. We are mostly concerned about the per-capita nucleolus (Grotte 1970, 1972), so we restrict our study to linear weight systems. On the other hand, we allow weights that depend not only on the size, but also on the value of the coalitions. In particular, we allow the weight of a coalition to be equal to its value (provided it is positive), thus some of our results also apply to the proportional nucleolus of a balanced game (with only positive coalitional values). The nucleolus is based on the coalitional surplusses (the difference between the payoff to and the value of the coalition). This measure, however, does not take into account neither the size, nor the value (or any other characteristic that maybe important for an application) of the coalitions. Various weighted nucleoli (based on weighted surplus measures) were considered by several authors, but mostly from an axiomatization point of view, see e.g. (Derks and Peters 1998; Derks and Haller 1999; Kleppe 2010; Kleppe et al. 2016; Calleja et al. 2018). We address issues in connection with their computation. In general, a linearly weighted nucleolus can be determined by the very same methods as the (standard) nucleolus, only straightforward adjustments are needed that only negligibly effect the performance. This is particularly true for the most frequently applied sequential linear programming approach pioneered by Kopelowitz (1967) (for a recent implementation finely tuned even for large games, see (Nguyen and Thomas 2016)). On the other hand, and in contrast to the rich literature on the computation of the (standard) nucleolus in specific classes of games, we can only mention the algorithm by Huijink et al. (2015) that computes the per-capita nucleolus in bankruptcy games. One of our results might shed light on a possible reason for this phenomenon. We demonstrate (in Example 3) that the family of essential coalitions is not sufficient to determine the per-capita nucleolus, not even in a balanced game, so Huberman’s (1980) reducibility result cannot be used in the computation of the per-capita nucleolus. We find, however, that if we compute the nucleolus of a balanced game from the dual coalitional values, Huberman’s idea works, not just for the (standard) nucleolus (that is implicitly the basis for many known efficient algorithms), but also for the per-capita and other monotone nondecreasingly weighted nucleoli. We prove (in Theorem 4) that if the core of the game is not empty, all dually inessential coalitions (those which can be weakly minorized by a partition in the dual game) can be ignored when we compute the per-capita (or other monotone nondecreasingly weighted versions of the) nucleolus from the dual game. We believe that this observation could become the theoretical basis for various polynomial time algorithms (yet to be) designed for the per-capita nucleolus in specific classes of balanced games known to have polynomial many dually essential coalitions (e.g. assignment games, fixed-tree games). Other candidates for this endeavour might be the well-known classes of games whose duality relations are discussed by Oishi and Nakayama (2009). The usefulness of looking at the dual games also in the axiomatizations of solutions is underlined by Oishi et al. (2016). The organization of the paper is as follows. We collect the necessary general preliminaries and introduce the linear weight systems in the next section. In Sect. 3, we discuss weighted least cores, since computing them is the first step in finding the weighted (pre)nucleoli. We present properties of the weight function under which the family of essential coalitions is sufficient to determine the weighted least core, and also when the family of dually essential coalitions is sufficient to determine the weighted least core in the dual game of a balanced game. In Sect. 4, we present the weighted primal and dual versions of the lexicographic center procedure (Maschler et al. 1979) that sequentially reduces the set of allowable payoffs until it shrinks to the (pre)nucleolus allocation, and discuss which properties of the weight system make the inessential coalitions, or in the dual version the dually inessential coalitions redundant in these sequential optimization processes when applied to balanced games. In Sect. 5 we discuss how and when we can refine our results by combining the primal and dual restricted descriptions of the standard/per-capita least core/(pre)nucleolus. In that last section we also illustrate the simplification potential of applying dual (in)essentiality on the 5-player (balanced) cost game discussed by Suzuki and Nakayama (1976).",1

It arises naturally in various applications related to operational research, including sharing transportation costs between customers (Goel and Gruhn 2008), dividing the profit from cooperation among supply chain agents (Nagarajan and Sošić 2008), and measuring the distribution of the power in legislative bodies (Algaba et al. 2007). One of the well-known solutions to this problem is the Shapley value (Shapley 1953). It divides the payoff from cooperation in a way that satisfies various fundamental properties (or axioms). Mathematically, according to the Shapley value, the share of a player in the overall outcome from cooperation equals to her average marginal contribution to this outcome, taken over all possible permutations of players. Shapley (1953) argued that his payoff division scheme can be rationalized by the following deterministic coalition formation process: assume that players create the grand coalition sequentially in a random order. A new player receives the payoff that equals her marginal contribution to the group of players that she joins. Now, the Shapley Value is the player’s expected such payoff given all possible orders of players. The Shapley value is used not only to divide costs or share profits in cooperative scenarios, but also as an advanced tool in various other settings, such as assessing the role of a criterion in multi-criteria decision making (Grabisch et al. 2008), attributing risk in public health applications (Cox 1985), and evaluating centrality of nodes in networks (Gómez et al. 2003; Skibski et al. 2018a). The standard version of the Shapley value was developed for games in the characteristic function form, i.e., when it is simplistically assumed that the value of a coalition depends solely on its members. However, many real-life scenarios involve externalities, i.e., partitions of outside players may affect the value of a coalitions. Externalities occur, for instance, in supply chains (Netessine and Zhang 2005), oligopolistic markets (De Clippel and Serrano 2008), and in the international agreements (Finus 2003; Plasmans et al. 2006). Unfortunately, the Shapley value for games with no externalities cannot be immediately extended to such richer settings. This is because a direct translation of Shapleys original axiom system to games with externalities is too weak to yield a unique value. Addressing this issue has been a subject of an intense debate in the literature (see (Kóczy 2018) for a recent overview). Two orthogonal approaches can be distinguished. The first approach, followed by the majority of authors, is focused on developing a new axiomatization by either modifying Shapley’s original axiom system, extending it by additional axioms, or proposing completely different one (De Clippel and Serrano 2008; Myerson 1977; Maskin 2003; Hafalir 2007). In contrast, in the second approach, the focus in shifted from axioms to the coalition formation processes that may occur in games with externalities. The key idea is to study such processes and analyse the values that they yield. The axiomatic characterisation of any value is then typically built upon the coalition formation process that yields this value. In this vein, Grabisch and Funaki (2012) proposed three values for games with externalities, supported by particular coalition formation processes. These values, however, do not satisfy the Null-player Axiom—Shapley’s fundamental requirements that says that a player who does not contribute anything to any coalition should not obtain any payoff. More recently, Skibski et al. (2018b) proposed a general approach to extend the Shapley value to games with externalities in which the coalition formation process is viewed as the discrete-time stochastic process characterized by an arbitrary family of quasi-probability distributions \(p = (p_1, p_2, \ldots )\). The authors showed that all values that satisfy the direct translation of Shapleys axioms to games with externalities can be obtained using such a process approach. We refer to such values as p-Process (Shapley) values. The Chinese Restaurant Process—one of the key stochastic processes in probability theory—turns out to be of particular importance in the context of games with externalities. In more detail, Skibski et al. (2018b) showed that using the Chinese Restaurant Process in the process approach leads to well-known value from the literature; moreover, it can be uniquely characterized by the strengthening of the Null-Player Axiom and the direct translation of Shapley’s remaining axioms. This value, now termed the Stochastic Shapley Value (Skibski et al. 2018b), had been previously derived by Feldman (1996) and Macho-Stadler et al. (2007) based on two specific axiom systems. While the work by Skibski et al. (2018b) forged the link between cooperative game theory and probability theory in the context of extending the Shapley value to games with externalities, this link has not been yet thoroughly explored. Interestingly, however, as we show in this article, there exist a plethora of results in probability theory that may shed a new light on our understanding of payoff division in games with externalities. In particular, we study the relation between the properties of the probability distributions that underline stochastic processes and the corresponding values. We begin our analysis by considering two well-known properties—exchangeability and consistency. In more detail, we first show that if distributions from the family p satisfy the property of exchangeability, then the p-Process Shapley Value satisfies a property called Strong Symmetry. We then show that if, in addition to exchangeability, the family p satisfies the property of consistency, then the p-Process Shapley Value satisfies a property called the Null-player Out Axiom. Next, we discuss two further properties of probability distributions. The first one, called in the literature conditional independence, means that the partitions formed by latter elements is independent from the partition of earlier ones. When combined with exchangeability and consistency, conditional independence characterizes the class of the celebrated Ewens probability distribution. We show how this property of p leads to a new, natural axiom, called Condition Independence in Games, met by the resulting p-Process Shapley value. The second property, which we call 2-partition equality, says that probability distribution on two partitions of two-element set should be uniform, i.e., both partitions are equally likely. This is because both elements involved can be either together or apart. We show that it is possible to translate this property to Embedded Coalition Anonymity—an axiom proposed by Albizuri et al. (2005), but now focused solely on 3-player games. Intuitively, this axiom says that in a 3-player game, swapping the values of a (singleton) coalition embedded in two partitions does not affect the payoffs of players. Our key result is that the Stochastic Shapley value is a unique extension for which the underlying probability distribution satisfies all four properties, i.e., exchangeability, consistency, conditional independence, and 2-partition equality. Thus, through our analysis, we provide a new axiomatization of the Stochastic Shapley value. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, we present basic definitions and notation. In Sect. 3, we consider properties of the probability distribution and show how they translated to the properties of the corresponding values for games with externalities. In Sect. 4, we discuss existing values that can be obtained using the process approach. Conclusions follows.",1

Each item \(j\in J\) has a weight \(w_j\) which represents the item’s utility. The utility of an item is the same for all n players. In competing for these  items, a player i is bound in her choice by a downward-closed set system \(\mathcal {S}_i\subseteq 2^J\), meaning that only the subsets \(S_i\in \mathcal {S}_i\) are feasible for her. Players aim to maximize their utility, which means maximizing the total weight of the chosen items \(w(S_i)=\sum _{j\in S_i} w_j\). Items are indivisible, hence a feasible solution consists of a profile of subsets \(S=(S_1,\dots ,S_n)\) such that \(S_i\in \mathcal {S}_i\) for all i and \(S_i\cap S_k=\emptyset \) for all \(i\ne k\). Our interest goes into the efficiency loss that occurs when the distribution of items is not controlled centrally, and hence we study the price of anarchy for three types of equilibria for this class of games. The motivation to address this problem is discussed in detail in Sect. 2. Nash equilibria and sequential play A distinguishing feature of the game that we propose is that each item \(j\in J\) can only be selected by at most one of the players. In that situation, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a selection of subsets \(S_i\), one for every player \(i=1,\dots ,n\), so that \(S_i\cap S_k =\emptyset \) for any two players \(i\ne k\), and for each player i we have that \(w(S_i)\ge w(T_i)\) for all \(T_i\in \mathcal {S}_i\) with \(T_i\subseteq J{\setminus }(\cup _{k\ne i} S_k)\). In words, given the items \(S_k\) selected by players other than i, among the remaining items \(J{\setminus }\cup _{k\ne i} S_k\), player i selects a feasible subset of maximum weight. When interpreted as a single-shot strategic form game, to realize this disjointness restriction we can define the payoff of a strategy \(S_i\) equal \(-\infty \) whenever another player’s strategy is \(S_k\) with . While this seems a bit unnatural, our primary interest is to analyze the more natural variant of the game where players select their subsets sequentially. Then, the items selected by previous players are no longer available for subsequent players. We address both problem variants in this paper. Equilibrium concepts and price of anarchy For the entire paper, we measure the quality of an (equilibrium) solution \(S=(S_1,\dots ,S_n)\) by the total value of all selected items, or equivalently, the sum of values of all selected items \(w(S):=\sum _{i=1}^n w(S_i)\). The question is by how much an equilibrium solution falls behind an optimal solution that could be computed by some central authority, in the worst case. For a maximization problem as the one considered here, the price of anarchy (Papadimitriou 2001; Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou 2009) denotes the ratio of the value of an optimal solution over the value of an equilibrium solution. We analyze the price of anarchy for three different equilibrium concepts, namely pure strategy Nash equilibria, subgame perfect equilibria (Selten 1965) of a sequential version of the game, and a third equilibrium concept that we refer to as k-collusion Nash equilibrium. The idea of the latter is that up to k players may collude and are allowed to use any profit sharing protocol among themselves, hence can be thought of as acting like a single player. This concept also appears in a paper by Hayrapetyan et al. (2006). In fact, k-collusion equilibria are a generalization of k-strong Nash equilibria as defined by Aumann (1959); see also Andelman et al. (2009).

 Consider \(n=2\) players and two items \(J=\{1,2\}\), with weights \(w_1=w_2=1\), and the feasible subsets are \(\mathcal {S}_1=\{\emptyset ,\{1\},\{2\}\}\) and \(\mathcal {S}_2=\{\emptyset ,\{2\}\}\). \(\triangleleft \) In an optimal solution, player 1 chooses the first and player 2 chooses the second item, that is, the strategy profile is \(S=(S_1,S_2)=(\{1\},\{2\})\) with payoffs (1, 1) and \(w(S)=2\). This allocation is a Nash equilibrium. There is another Nash equilibrium, namely \(S=(\{2\},\emptyset )\), because \(\{1\}\not \in \mathcal {S}_2\). As the payoffs are (1, 0) and \(w(S)=1\), this instance has a price of anarchy of 2. The strategic form of this game is depicted in Fig. 1. Strategic form for Example 1 with Nash equilibria in bold Considering the sequential game where player 1 precedes player 2, this yields a game tree that is depicted in Fig. 2. A strategy for player 2 now specifies three actions, one for every possible choice of player 1. When the order is \(1\rightarrow 2\), all Nash equilibria of the strategic form game are also obtained as subgame perfect equilibria, namely \((\{1\},(\{2\},\emptyset ,\{2\}))\) and \((\{2\},(\{2\},\emptyset ,\{2\}))\), with outcomes \((S_1,S_2)=(\{1\},\{2\})\) and \((\{2\},\emptyset )\), and payoffs (1, 1) and (1, 0), respectively. The worst case subgame perfect equilibrium is indicated in bold in Fig. 2. For the reverse order of the sequential game (player \(2\rightarrow \) player 1), the only subgame perfect equilibria are \((\{2\},(\{1\},\{1\}))\) and \((\{2\},(\{2\},\{1\}))\), with as unique outcome \((S_1,S_2)=(\{1\},\{2\})\) and corresponding payoff (1, 1). As the sequential price of anarchy takes the worst case over all possible sequential games, Example 1 has sequential price of anarchy of 2. Game tree for sequential version (player \(1\rightarrow \) player 2) of Example 1. The worst-case subgame perfect equilibrium is marked bold Finally, assume that both players collude, then obviously, the only allocation that maximizes their joint payoff is \((S_1,S_2)=(\{1\},\{2\})\) and corresponding payoff (1, 1). Therefore, the 2-collusion price of anarchy equals 1. Relation to set packing and maximum coverage problems The set packing problem is one of Karp’s 21 problems first proved to be \(\mathsf {NP}\)-complete (Karp 1972); it is listed as problem [SP3] in Garey and Johnson’s classic on computers and intractability (Garey and Johnson 1979). In set packing, the task is to select from a given collection \(\mathcal {S}\) of subsets of a set of items J, a collection of k disjoint subsets, for a given number k. In the weighted optimization version of the problem each subset \(S\in \mathcal {S}\) has a weight w(S), and the goal is to find disjoint subsets of maximum total weight. The general set packing problem with or without weights is NP-complete (Garey and Johnson 1979), and in general it is not even approximable to within any constant. We refer to Chandra and Halldórsson (2001) and Hazan et al. (2006) for more details. The problem that is considered in this paper corresponds to the much simpler variant of set packing where items \(j\in J\) have weights \(w_j\), and \(w(S):=\sum _{j\in S}w_j\). Due to our assumption that the set system is downward-closed, as an instance of maximum weight set packing this problem is trivial when there is no limit on the number of chosen subsets (e.g., take all singletons in \(\cup _{i=1}^n \mathcal {S}_i\)). However if only a given number of n subsets may be chosen -which is the problem that we consider- the downward closedness yields that the problem is equivalent with the the NP-hard maximum coverage problem. That problem can be approximated to within a factor \(1+ 1/(e-1)\) (Hochbaum 1997), and the same approximation guarantee is recovered in this paper as the sequential price of anarchy for symmetric set packing games. Throughput scheduling A subclass of set packing games are throughput scheduling games. These games were the subject of an extended abstract underlying this paper (de Jong et al. 2013). Throughput scheduling has been studied from the algorithmic perspective e.g. by Bar-Noy et al. (2001) and Berman and DasGupta (2000). Here, the set of items J corresponds to a set of non-preemptive jobs, each with a release time \(r_j\), a due date \(d_j\), and a weight \(w_j\). There are \(m\ge 1\) machines to process these jobs. In the most general setting, the machines can be unrelated, meaning that the processing time of any job j may depend on the machine \(\ell \) it is processed on, and the \(\ell \times m\) matrix \((p_{\ell j})\) of processing times on machines can have rank \(>1\). A subset \(S_i\) of jobs is feasible for player i if there exists a schedule of the jobs in \(S_i\) on the set of machines of player i, so that each job can be processed in the time window \([r_j,d_j]\). The job sets \(\mathcal {S}_i\) that are feasible for player i is then a downward closed set system. Except one, all lower bounds on the price of anarchy for set packing games are presented as instances of throughput scheduling games. Approximate equilibria We generally consider \(\alpha \)-approximate versions for all three equilibrium concepts, for any fixed \(\alpha \ge 1\). That means that a strategy profile is considered in \(\alpha \)-approximate equilibrium if the corresponding payoffs per player are maximal up to a multiplicative constant \(\alpha \), given the strategies of the other players. Indeed, the idea of considering approximate instead of exact equilibria is by now a widely accepted concept in algorithmic game theory, with different variations. Already Roughgarden and Tardos (2002) consider it for network routing games, and for example Skopalik and Vöcking (2008) discuss corresponding hardness results in the context of congestion games. Approximate equilibria can be generally motivated in at least two ways: The first is that players may be reluctant to changing strategies for small improvements, and the second is that players may be computationally bounded, and restricted to approximate equilibria by the computational hardness of computing a best response. We come back to this point later. It is important to note that our price of anarchy bounds are tight for all \(\alpha \)-approximate versions of the three equilibria that we consider. Main contribution Our contribution is as follows. If all players play \(\alpha \)-approximate Nash equilibria, the price of anarchy for set packing games equals \(\alpha +1\). We also show that sequential play, that is the game where players select their sets subsequently, does not allow to improve on that bound in general. However, for the special case of symmetric set packing games (to be defined later), sequential play does yield improved results for the price of anarchy: We show that subgame perfect equilibria yield a price of anarchy of \({\root \alpha \of {e}}/({\root \alpha \of {e}-1})\), which is tight, too. Note that for \(\alpha =1\), this equals \(1+1/(e-1)\). Finally, we analyze k-collusion Nash equilibria, and show that when players are assumed to play \(\alpha \)-approximate k-collusion Nash equilibria, the price of anarchy interpolates between \(\alpha \) and \(\alpha +1\), as it is equal to \(\alpha +(n-k)/(n-1)\).",1

At the Aalsmeer Flower Auction in the Netherlands, many lots of flowers are sold continuously each day. Governments across the world procure goods and services through auctions. Even though a single procurement contract might be awarded in a particular auction, these auctions are often recurring events with the same set of bidders. Because of the sequential nature of auctions in these examples, the auctioneers have a choice how much information to disclose about the outcomes of earlier auctions prior to the start of next auction. I study this question in a setup where an auctioneer sells two items sequentially using first-price auctions to two bidders, whose valuations for each item can take one of two possible values. I consider the following disclosure rules by the seller: (1) disclose both the winning and losing bids of the first auction, (2) only the winning bid, (3) only the losing bid, (4) only the winner’s identity, or (5) do not disclose anything. The objective is to identify among these disclosure rules the one that maximizes the seller’s expected revenue.Footnote 1Footnote 2 Although the bidders’ valuations of the items are assumed to be independent across bidders, they are correlated across items. Specifically, I consider two extreme cases. The first case considered is when the item valuations are perfectly negatively correlated, meaning, if a bidder has a high value for one item, then he has a low value for the other item and vice versa. The second case considered is when the item valuations are perfectly positively correlated, meaning, a bidder has either high or low values for both items.Footnote 3 By considering these two extreme cases, one can verify whether the optimal disclosure rule depends on the prior distribution of valuations. The assumption of valuations being perfectly positively correlated is standard in the literature (to be discussed in Sect. 1.1). To justify the case of negative correlation, suppose two paintings, say, one by Rembrandt and the other by Picasso, are auctioned. One can imagine that each participating bidder has strong interest in one of the paintings because it would better complement his collection, but the other bidders are unsure which painting it is. Alternatively, the auctioned items can be physically located at different places (as is often the case in the auctions of natural resources like timber) and a bidder must incur transportation costs to collect them. If a bidder is located closer to one item than the other, then because of the transportation costs, he will attach higher value to the former item. Further, if other bidders are unsure about this bidder’s location (for example, because the bidder’s true identity is unknown), this creates uncertainty about his valuations. I establish a set of results. First of all, I find equilibrium bidding strategies in the sequential first-price auctions for each combination of disclosure rule and the correlation of valuations (that is, ten different cases in total). Once the equilibrium strategies are found, I compare the seller’s revenue from different disclosure rules to find the following. If the valuations of items are negatively correlated, then it is beneficial for the seller to disclose some information, whereas if the valuations are positively correlated, then any information disclosure harms the seller. The intuition for this result is as follows. If the seller discloses some information from the first auction, it allows the bidders to update their beliefs about the opponent. This, in turn, gives incentives to the bidders to conceal information about their valuations in the first auction. In particular, a bidder who has high value for the second item, benefits if he is perceived by the opponent as someone who has low value for that item because then the bidding in the second auction will be less aggressive. The consequences from concealing their true valuations depend on the correlation of valuations across items. If the valuations are perfectly negatively correlated, then type \(\left( 0,1\right) \) bidderFootnote 4 tries to disguise himself as type \(\left( 1,0\right) \) bidder. Because the latter type bids aggressively for the first item, it means that type \(\left( 0,1\right) \) bidder must also bid relatively aggressively for that item even though his valuation of the item is low. In equilibrium, he even bids above his valuation of the first item with a positive probability. As a result, what type (0, 1) bidder gains in the second auction, he loses from more aggressive bidding in the first auction, so that his overall payoff is exactly the same that he would obtain if there was no information disclosure.Footnote 5 In turn, type (1, 0) bidder is strictly worse off: he loses from more aggressive bidding in the first auction, but he does not benefit from less aggressive bidding in the second auction. Because this type loses, the seller gains although not necessarily to the same extent as some surplus can be lost due to inefficient allocation of items. If the valuations are perfectly positively correlated, then type \(\left( 1,1\right) \) bidder tries to disguise himself as type \(\left( 0,0\right) \) bidder. Because the latter type does not bid aggressively for the first item, it means that type \(\left( 1,1\right) \) bidder also does not bid too aggressively for that item even though his valuation is high.Footnote 6 Consequently, the seller loses from less aggressive bidding in both auctions and is better off by not disclosing any information. I also establish outcome equivalence between various disclosure rules, which is summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, which rules are outcome equivalent again depends on the correlation between valuations. Thus, I find that disclosing the winning bid is equivalent to disclosing both bids if the valuations are negatively correlated, but it is equivalent to disclosing the winner’s identity if the valuations are positively correlated. And it is opposite for the losing bid. The intuition for these results can also be related back to the information updating between the first and second auctions and to the properties of the equilibrium in the second auction. At the start of the second auction, each bidder assigns some probability that the opponent has low value for the second item. Let’s refer to the bidder who has higher probability of having low value as the weak bidder. Roughly, all that matters for the equilibrium payoffs in the second auction is the probability with which the weak bidder has low value. Next, one can ask which of the two bidders—the winner or the loser of the first auction—is more likely to be the weak bidder. When the valuations are negatively correlated, then between the types (1, 0) and (0, 1), it is likelier that the former type will win the first auction. Therefore, the winner of the first auction will be perceived as the weak bidder in the second auction. This intuitively explains why, on one hand, those disclosure rules that reveal the winner’s bid are equivalent and, on the other hand, those disclosure rules that do not reveal the winner’s bid are equivalent. When the valuations are positively correlated, then between the types (0, 0) and (1, 1), it is likelier that the latter type will win the first auction. Therefore, the loser of the first auction will be perceived as the weak bidder in the second auction. This again explains why, on one hand, those disclosure rules that reveal the loser’s bid are equivalent and, on the other hand, those disclosure rules that do not reveal the loser’s bid are equivalent. One can also be more specific on the revenue ranking of the disclosure rules. Given the equivalence between different disclosure rules, it is enough to compare the revenues from disclosing the winning bid against disclosing the losing bid. I find that irrespective of the sign of correlation, for most of the parameter values, the bidders bid more aggressively when the losing bid is announced, leading to lower payoffs to the bidders and higher revenue to the seller. Though, as argued before, if the valuations are positively correlated, then any information disclosure is dominated by no disclosure. There also exists a close relationship between the disclosure rule and the efficiency of the equilibrium outcome in the first auction.Footnote 7 I find that the equilibrium is inefficient (resp., efficient) when the bid of the weak bidder is disclosed (resp., not disclosed). Therefore, if the objective of the seller is to implement an efficient outcome irrespective of the sign of correlation between the valuations of the items, she should only announce the winner’s identity. To understand this connection between the disclosure rule and efficiency, consider, for example, the case of negatively correlated valuations. Suppose there is an efficient and, consequently, separating equilibrium in the first auction and both bidders are of type (0, 1). When the winning bid (that is, the bid of the weak bidder) is disclosed, it becomes common knowledge that both bidders are of type (0, 1) and they bid aggressively in the second auction. To avoid it, type (0, 1) wants to pool with the other type and, as a result, the equilibrium is inefficient. On the other hand, when only the losing bid is disclosed, the loser still faces uncertainty about the type of the winner and the bidding in the second auction is not so aggressive. This removes the need for type (0, 1) to pool with the other type. Similar intuition applies to the case with positively correlated valuations. Finally, I check how robust the results are to departures from the benchmark model. Thus, I consider examples of imperfectly correlated valuations, asymmetric bidders, and more than two bidders. I find that most of the results continue to hold in the case of imperfectly correlated valuations, suggesting that the assumption of perfectly correlated valuations is not that restrictive. Also, when the bidders are asymmetric and the valuations are negatively correlated, the seller still benefits from disclosing the winning bid, but the equivalence between disclosing the winning bid and both bids does not hold anymore. Similarly, having more than two bidders changes the equivalence results between different disclosure rules. Thus, I find that with negatively correlated valuations, announcing the winning bid is now equivalent to not announcing anything. Finally, for the case of negatively correlated valuations, I also provide an example of more complicated disclosure rule that outperforms the disclosure rules considered so far. In particular, I assume that the seller announces the winning bid if it is below some threshold value, otherwise she announces the losing bid. I am not the first to study information disclosure in sequential auctions when bidders have multi-unit demand and they know their valuations for all items before any bidding takes place.Footnote 8 To the best of my knowledge, however, all the existing studies assume that the valuations across items are perfectly positively correlated. I am the first to explore how the equilibrium strategies and the equilibrium outcomes depend on the sign of correlation between the valuations of the items. The studies closest to this one are Thomas (2010), Cason et al. (2011), Kannan (2012) that also investigate the effects of information disclosure in sequential auctions’ setup with two items and binary valuations.Footnote 9 They all, however, assume that each bidder attaches the same value to both items. Apart from covering the case of negatively correlated valuations, I also contribute to this literature when the valuations are perfectly positively correlated, by allowing the high values of the two items to differ. Thus, for some priors, I find that the ranking of revenues from different disclosure rules depends on the relative sizes of the high values for both items. Additionally, I consider a wider range of disclosure rules. There are also other studies that use the same setup as the aforementioned studies to explore issues other than information disclosure. Thus, Ding et al. (2010) study the dynamics of equilibrium prices when both bids are announced; Yao and Xiao (2013) compare the revenues from the simultaneous and sequential auctions when only the winning bid is announced in the latter auctions; Āzacis and Vida (2012) illustrate how the announcement of the winning bid naturally leads to the information exchange between the bidders about their valuations. Almost all studies that analyse the effects of information disclosure in sequential auctions with multi-unit demand assume binary valuations. Two exceptions are Février (2003) and Tu (2005), which assume that the valuations are drawn from a continuous distribution. Similar to my results, Février (2003) finds that when the valuations are positively correlated, the seller is better off by not disclosing any information than announcing the winner’s identity. Tu (2005), similar to this study, considers a range of disclosure rules, but additionally he requires the equilibrium strategies to be monotonically increasing in valuations. This requirement rules out pooling equilibria and even leads to the non-existence of equilibrium for some disclosure rules. All studies that are cited above, assume a sequence of two auctions. Bergemann and Hörner (2017) depart from this assumption and instead consider an infinite sequence of auctions, but still assume binary and constant valuations. To rule out explicit collusion by bidders, they look for equilibria in Markov strategies and establish that more information hurts both revenue and efficiency. Similar to this study, Bergemann and Hörner (2017) find that the only disclosure rule that ensures that an inefficient equilibrium does not exist is the one when only the winner’s identity is disclosed. Finally, there exists a related literature that compares various disclosure rules in a single-item auction when bidders interact post auction.Footnote 10 I mention only few examples. Information disclosure about bids matters in Lebrun (2010) because bidders can engage in resale after the auction; in Giovannoni and Makris (2014) because bidders have reputational concerns; and in Fan et al. (2016) because bidders engage in oligopolistic competition after a cost-reducing patent has been auctioned to one of them. The rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 sets out the model. Sections 3 and 4 analyse the cases with negative and positive correlations between the valuations of the items, respectively. Section 5 contains discussion of various extensions of the model. Finally, most of the proofs are relegated to the appendix.",4

This requires a belief about the choices of his opponents, but also a belief about the opponents’ beliefs about their opponents’ choices, and so on. Such reasoning processes have been studied thoroughly in the framework of static games, in various forms of the concept of common belief in rationality. However, the extension of these concepts to the framework of dynamic games is not entirely trivial. One possible way to extend the idea of common belief in rationality would require that the players believe their opponents make only rational choices, in particular that past choices have been rational. However, in many cases this is not possible, since there may be stages in the game where players have to conclude that an opponent has chosen irrationally in the past. To solve this problem some alternative concepts have been proposed. Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2002) propose the concept of common strong belief in rationality, in which players, whenever possible, must believe that their opponents are implementing rational strategies. Perea (2014) proposed the concept of common belief in future rationality, in which at each decision point a player must believe that all players are rational in the present and in the future, but allows players to believe that irrational choices have been made in the past. This concept is similar to sequential rationalizability, proposed by Dekel et al. (1999; 2002), and Asheim and Perea (2005). 
Reny (1992, 1993) studies the idea of common belief in past and future rationality at all information sets, coming to the conclusion that in most games, it is not possible to reason under such concept. However, taking as a starting point the concept of common belief in future rationality in which we allow players to believe that past choices were irrational, we consider a concept in which a restricted notion of belief in past rationality is assumed. The example presented in Fig. 1 will be used to illustrate the concepts that are being discussed, while it also serves as one of the motivations for developing a new rationality concept. Example of a dynamic game The key idea in the new concept we propose is that a player does not only believe that his opponents choose rationally in the future, but also that the decisions made in the past were rational among a restricted set of choices. In Fig. 1 we can see that at \(\varnothing \) the optimal choice for player 1 is c. However, if the game were to reach \(h_{1}\), player 2 must believe that a suboptimal choice was made at \(\varnothing \). Under the concept of common belief in future rationality player 2 can assume either a or b was chosen at \(\varnothing \), as there is no restriction on the beliefs about choices made in the past. We propose that player 2 should reason about the choice made at \(\varnothing \) by considering only those choices that reach \(h_{1}\) and from those find which are optimal: in this case, we can see that a is the best choice for player 1 from those that reach \(h_{1}\) assuming he would choose f afterwards. Hence, under the new concept, player 2 must believe at \(h_{1}\) that player 1 chose a in the past. The concept proposed here, which we call “common belief in future and restricted past rationality” is a refinement of common belief in future rationality. The difference is that common belief in future rationality does not reason about the choices made in the past, while the addition of “restricted past rationality” makes players consider the subset of past choices that reach an information set and find the optimal choice in this subset. In other terms, the important factor in what is proposed is that a player, at an information set h, may still believe that the opponents chose irrationally in the past, but if that is the case, he must believe that the opponents chose the “least irrational” strategies among the strategies that reach h. A key feature of our new concept is that belief in the opponents restricted past rationality is always possible, whereas belief in the opponents’ (unrestricted) past rationality is only useful when studying strategies that fall on the path of those that are rational, while disregarding the rest of the game. Since we are ranking the possible mistakes, we can tell there should be a connection between the concepts of proper rationalizability, proposed by Schuhmacher (1999) and Asheim (2001), for the normal form of a dynamic game and common belief in future and restricted past rationality for a dynamic game. In Theorem 1 it is shown that properly rationalizable strategies in the normal form can rationally be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality. And since we know that there are properly rationalizable strategies for every finite normal form game, then we have that there are strategies that can rationally be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality for every finite dynamic game. This shows that common belief in future and restricted past rationality has plausible restrictions which, when studying the normal form, allows players to make reasonable decisions in the dynamic game. In addition we propose an algorithm for this concept, and we show that it delivers exactly the strategies that can rationally be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality. Note that the example presented in Fig. 1 has unobserved past choices. This is intentional, because we can easily show that for games with observable past choices in which we possibly allow for simultaneous moves, common belief in future rationality and common belief in future and restricted past rationality are equivalent. To see this, note that under observable choices, every information set for every player is a singleton which implies that each player knows exactly what the previous choices were. Since this happens, players do not have to reason about what possible choices were made earlier, since such choices are already given and known to everyone, reducing the reasoning only to future choices. This also shows that the algorithm presented here and the backward dominance procedure proposed in Perea (2014) coincide when the games have observable past choices, as the description of the second set \(\hat{S}_{-i}^{k}(h)\) in Step k of Algorithm 1 reduces to a description that is equivalent to the sets \(\Gamma ^{k}(h)\) in the inductive step of the backward dominance procedure. For one-shot games, common belief in future rationality and common belief in future and restricted past rationality both coincide with common belief in rationality, and hence are equivalent. Since it is well known that common belief in rationality is weaker than proper rationalizability, there are one-shot games in which a strategy can rationally be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality, but that same strategy is not properly rationalizable in the normal form. Hence, the converse of Theorem 1 does not hold. Such a game is presented in Fig. 2, which does not have generic payoffs. In this game, strategies b and d can rationally be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality, but b and d are not properly rationalizable. We conjecture that for generic payoffs, proper rationalizability is equivalent to common belief in future and restricted past rationality. Counterexample to the converse of Theorem 1 It was shown by Asheim (2001) that every choice that has positive probability in some proper equilibrium is optimal for some properly rationalizable type. Therefore proper rationalizability can be seen as the non-equilibrium analogue to proper equilibria. van Damme (1984) proves that for every dynamic game, the proper equilibria of its normal form induce quasi-perfect equilibria of the dynamic game. In this way he shows that it is possible to reason about a dynamic game in terms of the normal form and obtain equilibria of the dynamic game by looking at the normal form only. This is precisely one of the driving ideas behind the present paper, in which the concept of proper rationalizability, which is less restrictive than proper equilibrium, is linked to a concept for dynamic games that, in contrast to common belief in future rationality, takes into account a restricted version of rationality in the past. Also in contrast to strong belief in rationality, it makes players reason about the optimality of choices at every information set, even if an information set can only be reached by past choices that are suboptimal. Another motivation for proposing a new reasoning concept is that common belief in future rationality only reasons about what can happen from a certain point in time onwards, without caring about how the game got to this instance. On the other hand, strong belief in rationality may impose no restrictions at information sets that can only be reached by irrational past choices. Our concept, in contrast, may impose restrictions even in such situations. Indeed, if the game reaches a certain information h, the player that has to choose knows the game could reach such information set only if his opponents have previously made choices that can reach h. Therefore, according to our concept, this player believes his opponents chose the most plausible among the choices that actually reach h. That is, he concentrates on those opponents’ strategies that reach h, that are optimal at all future information sets, and that are optimal at all past information sets among strategies that reach h. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss a few examples that highlight some properties of our new concept. In Sect. 3 we introduce dynamic games. In Sect. 4 we present the concept of proper rationalizability for the normal form of a dynamic game. In Sect. 5 we introduce the notion of common belief in future and restricted past rationality for a dynamic game. In Sect. 6 both of these rationalizability concepts are connected, by showing that the strategies that are proper rationalizable can also be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality. In Sect. 7 we describe an algorithm and show that it yields precisely those strategies that can be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality. Section 8 has some concluding remarks and Sect. 9 contains all the proofs of this paper.",

They can be defined inductively: the dividend of the empty set is zero and the dividend of any other possible coalition of a player set equals the worth of the coalition minus the sum of all dividends of proper subsets of that coalition. Hence, Harsanyi dividends can be interpreted as “the pure contribution of cooperation in a TU-game” (Billot and Thisse 2005). Harsanyi could show that if the Harsanyi dividends of all possible coalitions are spaced evenly among its members, each player’s payoff equals the Shapley value (Shapley 1953b). The weighted Shapley values (Shapley 1953a) distribute the Harsanyi dividends proportionally to players’ personal given weights. The ratio of the weights of two players is equal for all coalitions containing them. However, sometimes this seems unrealistic. For example, in some coalitions, the influence of one of two players on the other players may be higher than in other coalitions with other players. Hammer et al. (1977) and Vasil’ev (1978) proposed the Harsanyi set, a class of TU-values called Harsanyi solutions, also known as sharing values (Derks et al. 2000) which take this into account. There the players’ weights, assigned to the Harsanyi dividends via a sharing system, can differ for all coalitions. Myerson (1980) introduced the balanced contributions axiom which allows, along with efficiency, an elegant axiomatization of the Shapley value. It states for two players i and j that j’s presence contributes as much to i’s payoff as i’s presence contributes to j’s payoff. The w-balanced contributions properties, the ratio of the winnings or losses of two players when the other player leaves the game is proportional to their weights, joint with efficiency, characterize the TU-values of an interesting class (Myerson 1980). These values coincide with the weighted Shapley values (Hart and Mas-Colell 1989). So far, no analogous characterization to the above-mentioned characterization of the weighted Shapley values is known for the Harsanyi solutions. To enable corresponding axiomatizations for the Harsanyi solutions, we present a new concept, called “value dividends.” These are defined inductively: the value dividend of a singleton is the player’s payoff in a single-player game and the value dividend of any (non-empty) other coalition to a player represents that player’s payoff in the game on the player set of this coalition minus all value dividends to that player in all subgames. We can therefore regard a value dividend as the “pure” payoff to a player that has not yet been realized in a subgame. Similar to the w-balanced contributions properties, we introduce an axiom called \(\lambda \)-balanced value dividends where \(\lambda \) is a sharing system. If \(\lambda \) has the characteristic that the ratio of two players sharing weights is equal in all coalitions containing them, the \(\lambda \)-balanced value dividends property is equivalent to the w-balanced contributions property. The value dividends allow further axiomatizations of the Harsanyi solutions and lead to an extension of the Harsanyi set: we provide an axiomatization of the class of generalized Harsanyi solutions, called generalized Harsanyi set. These values are generally no longer additive and use sharing function systems to distribute the Harsanyi dividends. A central property of all TU-values, discussed in this paper, is the inessential grand coalition property. This property states that in games where the Harsanyi dividend of the grand coalition is zero a players’ payoff in the subgames determines the player’s payoff. The generalized Harsanyi set allows proportionality principles in allocation. A common consensus of most proportional sharing rules is the proportional standardness property for two-player games (Ortmann 2000), which means that in two-player games the whole must be divided proportionally to the singleton worths of both players. For more than two players, however, there is absolutely no agreement on how proportionality should be applied. Many possibilities are suggested such as the set-valued proper Shapley value (Vorob’ev and Liapunov 1998; van den Brink et al. 2015) where proportionality is stated by a fixed point argument. Whereas, as single-valued solutions, the proportional rule (Moriarity 1975) and, as a value from the generalized Harsanyi set, the proportional Shapley value (Gangolly 1981; Besner 2016; Béal et al. 2018) consider only the worths of the singletons as weights, the proportional value (Feldman 1999; Ortmann 2000) uses the worths of all coalitions in a recursive formula. As a new representative of the generalized Harsanyi set, we introduce the proportional Harsanyi solution that also involves for calculating the whole coalition function for a sharing function system in a recursive formula. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 contains some preliminaries. In Sect.  3, we define the concept of value dividends, present a new characterization of the Harsanyi set via efficiency and \(\lambda \)-balanced value dividends and contrast w-balanced contributions with \(\lambda \)-balanced value dividends. In Sect. 4, we introduce the inessential grand coalition property that is crucial for the remainder of the article and propose an axiomatization of the Harsanyi solutions and of the Harsanyi set as a whole. In Sect. 5, we generalize the Harsanyi set and give a class characterization. In Sect. 6, the proportional Harsanyi solution is defined and axiomatized, and the domain, the value, and reasonable axioms are illustrated using an example. Additionally, we give a quick comparison of the proportional Harsanyi solution with the Shapley value by a new axiomatization of the Shapley value. Section 7 concludes and discusses the results. Some extensions of the Harsanyi and the generalized Harsanyi set are briefly presented. Finally, the Appendix (Sect. 8) shows the logical independence of the axioms in our characterizations.",9

Fonseca,Francesco Giovannoni,Miltiadis Makris,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Often, bidders care about the reputational effects of their bidding. For instance, this is the case when managers bid on behalf of shareholders for a takeover of another firm. Imagine that the value of the target firm to each bidding firm has a (private) component which depends on their management’s ability. That is, the higher this ability, the better the potential acquisition would be managed and the more valuable it would be. Thus, how much a bidding manager is willing to pay is a function of her ability as a manager. Insofar as managers’ career prospects and future rewards depend on the post-auction inferences of markets about managerial ability to evaluate and manage assets, and managers are aware of this, the type of information that is disclosed at the end of the auction will influence their bidding. In other words, managers with career concerns will use their bids to publicly signal their ability. The same argument applies to bidding for spectrum auctions, sports agents bidding for a free player, or collectors, who also offer consultancy services, when bidding for a work of art to add to their collection. In such environments, auction disclosure rules that pre-specify the type of information released at the end of the auction become important. They may have an impact on auction revenues, the bidders’ careers prospects and/or the level and distribution of post-auction wages and managerial compensations. These effects will in turn influence government revenues from license auctions, the interaction of market discipline and performance of managers of potential targeted firms, the regulation of art auctions, the scope of salary caps and existence of undisclosed fees in sports transfer markets, to mention but a few. The significance of these makes it imperative to understand the effects of various disclosure rules on auction and post-auction outcomes. This paper is an experimental investigation of the implications of disclosure rules on bidding behavior, auction outcomes and remuneration of bidders’ post-auction services. To study these effects, we frame the incentives between the auction and the possible longer-term effects in a setting where bidders valuations in the auction are also linked to their productivity as workers. We chose this setting, which maps closely with the example of takeovers described above, because it is easy to explain to the participants in our experiment. As the structure of the experiment should clarify, however, the incentives in the experiment also apply to all of the examples described above. Specifically, we consider a setting with two stages. In the first stage, we run sealed-bid first-price auctions for a single object between two bidders. In the second stage, the bidders from the first-price auction take on the role of workers in a labor market where their wages are determined. In the latter market, two firms may hire any number of workers (who can work for only one firm) and each firm bids a wage for each worker’s services. The benefits to firms from hiring bidders/workers are the same, and proportional to the bidders’ valuations of the auctioned object. This is effectively Bertrand competition between firms for the services of any given worker. Throughout, valuations are private information of workers and at the end of the first stage, the winning worker’s identity is publicly disclosed. Treatments differ in terms of the information released to everyone at the end of the auction about submitted bids before the wage-setting market takes place. An important benefit of this setting is that it maps very closely with the theoretical framework in Giovannoni and Makris (2014), from which we derive predictions. In particular, we consider four disclosure rules. We have disclosure rule \({\mathcal {A}}\) (for “all”), where all the bids and the corresponding bidder’s identity are revealed; disclosure rule \({\mathcal {N}}\) (for “none”) where the winner’s identity is revealed but none of the bids are; disclosure rule \({\mathcal {W}}\) (for “winner”) where only the winning bid (and the winner’s identity) is disclosed, and disclosure rule \({\mathcal {S}}\) (for “second”) where only the losing bid (and the winner’s identity) are disclosed.Footnote 1 We also consider as controls the disclosure rule \({\mathcal {B}}\) (for “base”) where no second-stage wage-setting market takes place, and the situation (disclosure rule \({\mathcal {T}},\) for “transparent”) where a second-stage wage-setting market takes place but valuations are revealed at the end of the first-stage auction. In both treatments, there is no theoretical scope for signaling through bids. We address two main questions. The first question is whether bidders recognize the signaling opportunities created by the presence of the aftermarket. If they do recognize these signaling opportunities, the second question is whether their behavior conforms to the different incentives implied by the different disclosure rules. We also ask, to the extent that the results do not conform to the theoretical predictions, what might explain the deviations from predicted behavior. Our results suggest that subjects’ behavior provide a positive answer to the first question. In particular, workers bid higher than they would in the absence of an aftermarket to signal their productivity: we call this overbidding. With respect to the second question, subjects do not show the full sophistication needed for confirming (expected) revenue comparisons across treatments. We show how, for treatments \({\mathcal {A}}\), \({\mathcal {W}}\) and \({\mathcal {N}}\), but not for \({\mathcal {S}}\), the amount of a particular worker’s overbidding is indeed related to how likely it is that such bid is revealed. This shows an understanding of the underlying incentives, with the exception of the \({\mathcal {S}}\) treatment. These results imply that signaling incentives in auctions are fairly robust, and the impact of these effects should be taken into account when setting up or studying auction markets. Our results also suggest, however, that precise predictions on the effect of specific disclosure rules should be made with a degree of caution. In particular, we do find that revenue is higher when there are signaling incentives, a natural consequence of overbidding. However, while subjects understand the differences in signaling opportunities across disclosure rules, they do not do so to the extent that revenues are affected as predicted by theory. For example, if we compare the \({\mathcal {W}}\) treatment with the \({\mathcal {A}}\) treatment, theory predicts a steeper bidding function in the former, but overall higher expected revenues in the latter because incentives to overbid across individuals are higher. Our results find that the empirical bidding function in the \({\mathcal {W}}\) treatment is indeed steeper than that in the \({\mathcal {A}}\) treatment, but expected revenues are not significantly different across treatments. This indicates that bidders understand the relative differences but not the absolute ones across incentives. Put another way, bidders seem to understand the comparative statics but are not sophisticated enough to conform to the point predictions. We can show that most of these failures can be explained by the behavior of bidders whose valuations are quite low or quite high, whereas bidders with intermediate valuations tend to conform more to theoretical predictions. There is a theoretical literature that deals with cases where reputational effects distort bidding behavior. Das Varma (2003), Haile (2003), Goeree (2003), and Salmon and Wilson (2008) discuss the effects of external incentives on bidding behavior. Their focus is on the comparison of various price mechanisms for a given disclosure rule. In our experiment, all our treatments instead fix the first-stage price mechanism (first-price auction) and vary the disclosure rules. This is because Giovannoni and Makris (2014) show that in an environment where external incentives introduce solely signaling incentives, disclosure rules are the crucial component in terms of expected revenue comparisons. Katzman and Rhodes-Kropf (2008) and Molnar and Virag (2008) also recognize the importance of disclosure rules but their results are more ambiguous than those in Giovannoni and Makris (2014).Footnote 2 Finally, Dworczak (2017) studies the problem of optimal disclosure rules, allowing for much more generality in the disclosure of information, but does not allow for reputational concerns for the losers in the auction. Our paper also relates to a few strands of literature within experimental game theory. In the first instance, this work is the latest in a line of research exploring the motives for overbidding in auctions. A long-standing literature on experimental auctions studies the role of informational feedback and overbidding in first-price auctions. Isaac and Walker (1985) first studied this question. They compared the case where the winner’s bid was revealed to the case where all bids were revealed; they found more overbidding in the former treatment than the latter. More recently, Dufwenberg and Gneezy (2002) and Ockenfels and Selten (2005) have extended the literature on informational feedback. One possible behavioral explanation as to why different modes of feedback can result in different levels of bidding relative to the risk neutral Nash equilibrium is regret. This behavioral explanation was first proposed by Engelbrecht-Wiggans (1989), and extended by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Katok (2005). Filiz-Ozbay and Ozbay (2007) propose a model of anticipated regret to explain why different informational conditions lead to overbidding. Another literature that explores overbidding in auctions is that on auctions with resale. Overbidding relative to the “standard” case occurs in this environment because bidders whose private values are low have the opportunity to recoup any losses incurred in the first auction through reselling the object (see Lange et al. 2011; Georganas 2011 and Georganas and Kagel 2011; Filiz-Ozbay et al. 2015; Pagnozzi and Saral 2017, for recent experimental investigations). In our paper, bid disclosure affects bidding behavior not for behavioral reasons, but as the profit-maximizing response to career concerns. Our paper thus contributes to the relatively small experimental literature on signaling. Miller and Plott (1985) study a product quality signaling game; Cooper et al. (1997) study limit pricing games. More recent studies include Cooper and Kagel (2005; 2009), who study individual vs team play in signaling games, Kübler et al. (2008), who study job market signaling in the lab and Jeitschko and Normann (2012), who study signaling games with deterministic vs stochastic signals. Dodonova and Khoroshilov (2014) examine the signalling hypothesis proposed by Fishman (1988) behind jump bidding in takeover auctions with entry costs. The innovation in our paper is that we study signaling through auctions which introduces an additional layer of complexity. In some of our treatments, the information that becomes publicly available depends on the behavior of other agents: when only the winner’s bid is disclosed, for example, any bidder is never certain that her bid will be disclosed. Our paper is closely related to Bos et al. (2018), who experimentally investigate the role of an external observer on behavior in a two-player aftermarket. The external observer in their experiment performs the same role as the firms in our experiment, in that payoffs to bidders may depend on the observer’s valuation. The experiment varies the auction format (first-price vs. \({}^{\sim }\)second-price), information to the external observer about the winner’s payoffs, and whether the observer’s estimates of bidders’ private values affects bidders’ payoffs. Similar to our results, the authors find that signaling opportunities affect bidding behavior in the auction, even though bidding is not as aggressive as predicted by theory. They also find that the first-price auction when winner’s payment is revealed outperforms all other treatments in terms of revenue and efficiency. This paper complements our research in two dimensions. It compares two auction formats under one disclosure rule, while we focus on multiple disclosure rules under the first-price auction. It also considers a different implementation of the aftermarket stage. In the next section, we introduce the theory and hypotheses behind our experiment. Section 3 describes the experiment and Sect. 4 collects our results. In the latter Section we also provide a discussion of the results. Section 5 concludes while the Appendix contains some more theoretical details as well as detailed instructions for the experiment.",2

A strategy profile belongs to the \(\alpha \)-core if no coalitions of players have profitable joint deviations against to all strategies of the opponents. Scarf (1971) proved the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core when the players are endowed with continuous and quasi-concave utility functions and the sets of strategies are finite-dimensional. Kajii (1992) extended Scarf’s result to the setting of games with continuous and non-ordered preferences: each player is characterized by a mapping defined on the set of strategy profiles, and it is assumed that all such mappings are open-graph and convex-valued. In the light of some recent advances on the existence of Nash equilibria in discontinuous games, new conditions for the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core in games with discontinuous payoff functions have been provided by Uyanik (2015). In the mentioned paper, the author introduces a coalitional version of the continuous-security by Barelli and Meneghel (2013), and other conditions so that the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core is obtained through the non-emptiness of the core of a suitable NTU-game. Here, Scarf’s Theorem (Scarf 1967) plays a crucial role. In the present paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core in games with discontinuous and non-ordered preferences. In doing this, we do not use Scarf’s Theorem (Scarf 1967), but we adapt to our setting the approach to the Nash equilibrium existence problem considered by Scalzo (2019a). More precisely, given a game with non-ordered preferences, we define a real-valued function so that the solutions to the corresponding Ky Fan minimax inequality (Fan 1972) coincide with the \(\alpha \)-core elements of the game. Hence, we apply the general results on the existence of solutions to the Ky Fan minimax inequality given by Scalzo (2013, (2019a) and identify sufficient (and necessary) conditions on the game for the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core. The conditions we obtain are adaptations to our setting of those given by Scalzo (2019a, (2019b) for the existence of Nash equilibria in discontinuous games. The investigation on the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core in games with discontinuous and non-ordered preferences can be motivated, for example, by the analysis of situations like the following one. Consider a family of clubs \(\{C_i :i\in N\}\), each of which being represented by an individual \(i\in N\), called administrator of \(C_i\). Suppose that \(i\ne j\) implies \(C_i \ne C_j\). Assume that clubs get benefits from a common asset and the gain they obtain depends on the investments of all clubs. So, every club ranks profile of investments \(x=(x_i )_{i\in N}\) by means of a rule which aggregates the preferences of the members (for example, unanimity rule, majority rule, etc.). Even if each member of a club has a utility function on the set of profiles of investments, the aggregation rule may give rise to a non necessarily ordered preference (for instance, the majority rule induces a non transitive preference). Moreover, the aggregate preference of a club \(C_i\) may not satisfy the continuity properties considered by the previous literature (open-graph preferences). This is the case, for example, if i is interpreted as the administrator of a condominium \(C_i\). By the role, she/he is naturally led to identify amounts even when they are different but differ by less than a threshold level \(\lambda >0\). That is: x and y are indifferent for \(C_i\) if \(\left| \sum _{j\in N}x_j -\sum _{j\in N}y_j \right| <\lambda \); and \(C_i\) prefers y on x if \(\sum _{j\in N}y_j \ge \sum _{j\in N}x_j +\lambda \) (see also Campbell and Walker 1990). This preference cannot be represented by utility functions and the mapping \(P_i\) defined by \(P_i (x)=\{y:C_i \text{ prefers } y \text{ on } x\}\) is not open-graph.Footnote 1 Now, remaining in the condominium interpretation, it is plausible that all \(C_i\) are located in a common district, reason why cooperation among administrators is beneficial. Consequently, the \(\alpha \)-core solution concept plays obviously a role, whereas the results from the previous literature do not apply. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls definitions and results on the Ky Fan minimax inequality. The setting of the paper is introduced in Sect. 3, where the previous literature on the non-emptiness of the \(\alpha \)-core is also recalled.

For instance, a power index applied to a weighted majority game associated with a political parliament, typically considers how often a political party is needed to form a majority, without taking the issue at stake (for instance, a new law) into account. One may well argue that this is how it should be (for instance, Braham and Holler 2005), but one may also argue that this is a drawback (e.g., Napel and Widgrén 2005). For a relatively recent overview of power indices for simple games see Bertini et al. (2013). These power indices include the Shapley value (Shapley 1953), also called Shapley–Shubik index (Shapley and Shubik 1954), the Banzhaf value (Banzhaf 1965; Shenoy 1982; Nowak 1997) and the Banzhaf–Coleman index (Coleman 1971), the Holler index (Holler 1982), and many more. Most of these power indices, including the ones mentioned, are based on counting in some way or another the number of times a player is pivotal in the simple game. There are, however, also many approaches which do take the issues at stake, and the preferences of players regarding these issues, into account. Notably, so-called spatial power indices are defined on simple games, enriched by adding positions of the players in policy space. For instance, Owen (1971) and later Owen and Shapley (1989) add to the simple game a vector of positions of players in two-dimensional Euclidean space, and use this to obtain a variant of the Shapley–Shubik index, called the Owen–Shapley spatial power index, which takes these positions into consideration. See Peters and Zarzuelo (2017) for an axiomatic characterization of this index. As will become clear below, the approach in the present paper is based on a similar idea as the Owen–Shapley spatial power index. On the topic of spatial power indices, see also Enelow and Hinich (1984), Enelow and Hinich (1990), Grofman et al. (1987), Straffin (1994), Felsenthal and Machover (1998), Felsenthal and Machover (2005), and Laruelle and Valenciano (2008). More recent contributions are Alonso-Meijide et al. (2011), Benati and Marzetti (2013), Martin et al. (2017), and Blockmans and Guerry (2015). An alternative and less known definition of a power index is proposed by Hoede and Bakker (1982), based on so-called inclination vectors: the positions of players with respect to certain issues may influence each other, and a power index may depend on the strengths of these influences. See also Rusinowska and de Swart (2003). A theory of power measurement within corporate and/or financial networks is proposed by Gambarelli and Owen (1994). See also Karos and Peters (2015) and Mercik and Stach (2018). For power measurement on graphs, see e.g. van den Brink (2002), or Peters et al. (2016). Karos and Peters (2018) discuss power indices when the possibilities of players and coalitions are described by an effectivity function. Still other approaches model the impact of preferences on power by means of a noncooperative voting game: see, for instance, Schmidtchen and Steunenberg (2014). Our approach is best illustrated by a simple example. Consider a parliament with four parties, called 1, 2, 3, and 4, which have numbers of seats 49, 17, 17, and 17, respectively. To pass any law a strict majority (at least 51 seats) is required.Footnote 1 The Shapley-Shubik and (normalized) Banzhaf values assign power distribution \(\frac{1}{6}(3,1,1,1)\), and the Holler index assigns \(\frac{1}{9}(3,2,2,2)\). These power distributions are completely independent of what is at stake. Now suppose that during the period that this particular composition of the parliament is in vigor, there are three main issues (say, new laws) under consideration, and suppose that the big party 1 is highly in favor of these issues. This implies that party 1 is practically powerless, since it always depends on some other party (which is less enthusiastic about these issues) in order to pass the corresponding law. Pursuing the example somewhat further, call the issues a, b, and c, and let the ‘order of enthusiasm’ for each of the issues be given by 1, 2, 3, 4 for a, 1, 3, 4, 2 for b, and 1, 4, 3, 2 for c. If we assume that for each issue a supporting coalition is formed according to the given order, we see that the pivotal party for a would be party 2, for b party 3, and for c party 4. Taking the number of times a party is pivotal as a measure for its power, the resulting power distribution is \(\frac{1}{3}(0,1,1,1)\). In a nutshell, this is the (main) issue based power index that we consider in this paper.Footnote 2 As mentioned above, this approach is closely inspired by the construction of the Owen–Shapley spatial power index (Owen and Shapley 1989). In the spatial game model of Owen and Shapley, each issue is a point u on the unit circle in \(\mathbb {R}^2\) and each player i has a position \(p_i\) in \(\mathbb {R}^2\). Then player i is more enthusiastic about issue u than player j if \(p_i\cdot u < p_j \cdot u\)—thus, the inner product is interpreted as linear (dis)utility. A given simple game then determines, for each issue, which player is pivotal: this is the first player who makes the coalition, formed in the order of enthusiasm, winning. As a result, the unit circle is partitioned into subsets with different pivotal players, and the relative size of the subset (arc(s)) for which a player is pivotal, is defined to be that player’s power according to the Owen–Shapley spatial power index. Here, assuming that all positions are different, the set of issues for which the pivotal player is not unique has measure zero and can be neglected. This is no longer the case if the number of issues is finite, as in the present paper: this is one of the reasons that we take the orderings of the players per issue, rather than their positions (i.e., their preferences over the issues) as primitives in the model. For more discussion on this choice the reader is referred to the concluding Sect. 6. Instead of spatial games, in this paper we consider issue games. An issue game consists of a monotonic simple game for some player set N, and for each issue within the set of issues M, a linear order over the set of players N. This linear order expresses the order of enthusiasm or support of the players for the issue under consideration. Such a collection of linear orders is called an issue profile. In the example above, the simple game is the four-player weighted majority game, and the issue profile is the set of three linear orders over the four players, associated with the issues a, b, and c. A power index assigns to each player in an issue game a nonnegative number, where these numbers sum up to one. The power indices studied in this paper are characterized by weight vectors (nonnegative vectors with coordinates summing up to one) for the set of issues, such that the power assigned to each player in an issue game is equal to the weighted sum of the issues for which this player is pivotal. (In the example above, all three issues have equal weight \(\frac{1}{3}\)). The main part of the paper is devoted to presenting several axiomatic characterizations of this class of power indices. The first result in the paper is Theorem 3.1, in which this class is characterized by two axioms: Issue Dependence and No Advantageous Splitting. Issue Dependence requires that in a situation where each player is pivotal for at most one issue, the power of a pivotal player depends (only) on the issue at stake. This axiom will imply that we can attach fixed weights to issues. No Advantageous Splitting says that no player, by splitting up into several players, can change the power distribution. For instance, in the above example, if party 2 would split up into two parties of sizes, say, 8 and 9 seats, its total power should stay the same, and also the powers of players 1, 3, and 4 should not change. The axiom is similar in spirit (and equal in name) to an axiom for bankruptcy problem rules in De Frutos (1999), where it is considered as a kind of non-manipulability. It is also closely related to the 2-efficiency axiom in Nowak (1997), used in a characterization of the Banzhaf index. The proof of this result is quite transparent: given an issue game, if a player is pivotal for more than one issue, we split this player up in new players such that each of the new players is pivotal for exactly one issue; and then apply Issue Dependence. In order for this to work, we assume that the set of players may vary, as a finite subset of the universal set of players identified with \(\mathbb {N}\). The set of issues is regarded as fixed. In the second characterization (Theorem 4.1) we consider the axiom of Invariance with respect to Symmetric Players: given any issue game and two players i and \(i'\) who are symmetric in the associated simple game, if i is pivotal for an issue and we change the linear order of that issue so that \(i'\) becomes pivotal, then the power assigned to every other player should not change. Additionally, we strengthen Issue Dependence to Strong Issue Dependence: if, in two issue games, the partitions of the set of issues, obtained by grouping together those issues which have the same pivotal player, coincide, then the power assigned to the players should only depend on the issues for which they are pivotal. These two conditions again characterize the same class of power indices. The proof of Theorem 4.1 is in some sense dual to the proof of Theorem 3.1: we start with an issue game in which the simple game is a unanimity game for the grand coalition (in particular, all players are symmetric), and by using Invariance with respect to Symmetric Players, change this to an issue game with any arbitrary partition of the set of issues, by grouping issues together; then, we apply Strong Issue Dependence. In our third characterization (Theorem 5.3) we use the axiom Equal Power Change, which concerns the simple game rather than the issue profile. This axiom is a variation on the transfer property of Dubey (1975) and makes that the power index is uniquely determined by its values on issue games in which the simple games are unanimity games. Adding this axiom, allows for a considerable weakening of Strong Issue Dependence, namely to Symmetric Player Issue Dependence. The two axioms, plus Invariance with respect to Symmetric Players, again characterize the same class of power indices. The organization of the paper is as follows. After preliminaries in Sect. 2 the three characterizations are presented in Sects. 3, 4, and 5 . Section 6 concludes with further discussion.",5

The canonical example of a many-to-many market is the specialty training followed by junior doctors in the UK (Roth 1991). Other examples of many-to-many markets are markets for part-time workers and the non-exclusive dealings between down-stream firms and up-stream providers. Many-to-many markets are also useful to model multi-unit assignment problems such as course allocations (see Budish 2011; Sönmez and Ünver 2010; Kojima 2013) or the assignment of landing slots (see Schummer and Vohra 2013; Schummer and Abizada 2017). We consider a many-to-many matching market and assume that preferences are responsive (Roth 1985). Under this assumption, no mechanism is stable and strategy-proof for even one side of the market (see Roth and Sotomayor 1990). Furthermore, even in one-to-one markets, there is no mechanism that is stable and strategy-proof for the agents on both sides of the market. Due to these negative results, the literature has concentrated on mechanisms guaranteeing strategy-proofness on one side of the market, thus overlooking preference manipulation from agents on the other side of the market (but see Romero-Medina and Triossi 2013a for capacity manipulation). However, manipulation by agents on both sides of the market is a concern, for example, in different school choice mechanisms (see Abdulkadiroğlu et al. 2005). In this paper, we explore the possibility of designing revelation mechanisms that are stable, strategy-proof, and group strategy-proof for the agents on both sides of the market, by restricting the preference domain. Indeed, stability and strategy-proofness are central concerns in market design. Theoretical and empirical findings suggest that centralized markets that achieve stable outcomes are more successful than centralized markets that do not achieve stable outcomes. In particular, those that do not produce stable outcomes are more likely to break down and be abandoned (see Roth and Sotomayor 1990; Roth 2008; Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez 2013).Footnote 1 Additionally, strategy-proofness prevents agents from needing to strategize. This is relevant in markets where agents differ in their sophistication. Finally, group strategy-proofness implies strategy-proofness and prevents welfare losses resulting from collusion among agents. We show that, when the preferences of all agents are responsive and the firms have acyclical preferences, the worker-optimal stable mechanism is group strategy-proof. A cycle in the preferences of the firms occurs when there is an alternating list of firms and workers “on a circle” such that every firm prefers the worker on its clockwise side to the worker on its counterclockwise side and finds both acceptable. We say that preferences are acyclical if there are no cycles. First, we show that, under responsive preferences, when the preferences of the firms are acyclical, the set of stable matchings is a singleton, and the unique stable matching can be implemented through a procedure that we call Adjusted Serial Dictatorship. In this procedure, each worker, at her turn, selects her favorite firms among those she is acceptable to and that still have vacant positions. We employ this result to show that, under acyclicity, any stable mechanism is group strategy-proof both for firms and workers. We conclude by showing that acyclicity is also the minimal condition guaranteeing the existence of a mechanism that is stable and strategy-proof for the agents on both sides of a many-to-many matching market under responsive preferences. More precisely, we show that if the preferences of the firms have a cycle, there exists a responsive profile of preferences for the workers such that no stable mechanism is strategy-proof. Our results imply that strategy-proofness and group strategy-proofness are equivalent requirements when imposed on a stable mechanism under responsive preferences. In general, group strategy-proofness is more demanding than strategy-proofness. In particular, in the school choice problem, the student-optimal stable mechanism always provides a stable and strategy-proof mechanism. However, efficiency and group strategy-proofness require priorities to satisfy an acyclicity condition (see Ergin 2002). Our characterization contributes in explaining the restrictiveness of imposing strategy-proofness on stable mechanisms in many-to-many matching markets. Finally, we apply our results to the course allocation problem. In this case, only one side of the market is strategic, and acyclicity is a sufficient condition for the existence of a strategy-proof mechanism. We show that acyclicity is also necessary if the designer cannot condition the mechanism on the capacities of the courses. Acyclical preferences have been extensively studied in matching markets. The concept of acyclicity that we use coincides with that introduced in Romero-Medina and Triossi (2013b) for one-to-one matching markets. In many-to-one matching markets, Ergin (2002) introduces a weaker notion of acyclicity and shows that the worker-optimal stable mechanism is efficient and group strategy-proof for workers if and only if the preferences of the firms are acyclical. Kesten (2012) and Romero-Medina and Triossi (2013a) find that two different forms of acyclicity are necessary and sufficient conditions for worker-optimal stable matching to be immune to capacity manipulation. Pycia (2012) shows that the core is nonempty in every state if and only if agents’ preferences are pairwise-aligned (a condition equivalent to acyclicity). Furthermore, under pairwise-alignment, the core is a singleton and a large family of games implements the unique core allocation in strong Nash equilibrium. Core manipulability and its relation to singleton cores have been previously studied. Sönmez (1999) extends previous results by Demange (1987) and shows that there exists an allocation rule that is Pareto efficient, individually rational and strategy-proof if and only if the core is essentially single-valued. Also, in one-to-one matching markets, Demange et al. (1987) study the manipulability of stable matchings by coalitions including agents on both sides of the market. In this case, uniqueness guarantees that a matching is not manipulable. This result does not hold in many-to-many matching markets (see Example 1). Our results complement those in Kojima (2013) and Jiao and Tian (2017). In a multi-unit assignment problem, Kojima (2013) proves that the worker-optimal stable matching is strategy-proof for workers if and only if any cycle involves only the top-ranked workers, a condition that he calls essential homogeneity, which is weaker than the concept of acyclicity that we employ in this paper.Footnote 2 Jiao and Tian (2017) prove that the worker-optimal stable mechanism is group strategy-proof for workers if preferences satisfy the extended max-min criterion and a quota saturability condition. The preference domain in Jiao and Tian (2017) reflects a high degree of ambiguity aversion. Instead, we assume the preferences to be responsive.Footnote 3 The concept of group strategy-proofness that we employ is stronger than the one in Jiao and Tian (2017). For an allocation to be strategy-proof, they require that no coalition of agents can misrepresent their preferences in a way that makes each member of the coalition strictly better off. This concept is often referred to as group incentive compatibility or weak group strategy-proofness (see Roth and Sotomayor 1990; Hatfield and Kojima 2009; Barberá et al. 2016). Instead, we use the usual concept of group strategy-proofness requiring each member of the coalition to be weakly better off and at least one to be strictly better off. In contrast to Jiao and Tian (2017) and Kojima (2013), we focus on preventing manipulation and collusion by the agents on both sides of the markets. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 presents the results. Section 4 concludes. The proofs are in the “Appendix”.",4

Determining taxation policy is a political process. India is a multi-party democracy with a federal structure consisting of a Union government (called the Centre) and provincial governments (called the States). Achieving a stable taxation policy requires the participation of the relevant political parties governing the Centre and the States. On 1st July 2017, a landmark taxation law came into effect in India through the implementation of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016 which replaced the multitude of existing taxes by a single Goods and Services Tax (GST).Footnote 1 The new act inserts Article 279A into the Constitution of India. This Article requires the creation of a constitutional body called the GST Council. Among other things, Article 279A specifies the decision making mechanism to be followed in the GST Council. Voting procedure in the GST council Clause 9 of Article 279A specifies the following. “Every decision of the Goods and Services Tax Council shall be taken at a meeting, by a majority of not less than three-fourths of the weighted votes of the members present and voting, in accordance with the following principles, namely:  the vote of the Central Government shall have a weightage of one-third of the total votes cast, and the votes of all the State Governments taken together shall have a weightage of two-thirds of the total votes cast, in that meeting.” From the above, it becomes clear that the voting procedure in the GST Council is a weighted voting mechanism. The purpose of this work is to analyse the GST voting rules using the formal framework of voting games. There is a rich and several decades old literature on voting games. The notion of voting power of a player was proposed by Penrose (1946) and later by Banzhaf (1965). Shapley (1953) and Shapley and Shubik (1954) studied voting in the framework where the order in which votes are cast is important. There has been a great deal of work on formal analysis of voting games. We refer the reader to Felsenthal and Machover (1998) and Laruelle and Valenciano (2011) for details and the surveys (Napel 2016; Kurz et al. 2015) for discussions on the various topics in the area. A textbook level introduction to the area can be found in Chakravarty et al. (2015). Most of the literature on voting games has studied the setting where each player has two options (to vote ‘yes’, or to vote ‘no’) and the outcome is binary. Laruelle and Valenciano (2012) studied the setting where each player has four choices, namely to vote ‘yes’, to vote ’no’, to abstain, or to be absent and the outcome is still binary. The more general framework where the players have multiple options and and there could also be more than two outcomes has been analysed by Freixas and Zwicker (2003) and Freixas and Zwicker (2009). Use of weighted voting for taking decision is employed in various public bodies. Two of the most important examples are the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). Analysis of the voting procedures in these bodies using the formalism of voting games have been reported in the literature (Leech 2002a, b). Other examples include elections in the Senate of US, and in the parliaments of several European countries. The voting rules of the GST Council do not specify a single voting game. Since the number of members “present and voting” can vary, a number of voting games can arise. Further, the voting weights of the members are not fixed. Rather, it is only mentioned that “the vote of the Central Government shall have a weightage of one-third of the total votes cast”. The rules do not specify how the rest two-third of the total voting weight are to be distributed among other members. However, a resolution can not pass without the Centre. So, every voting game includes at least one player - the Centre. We introduce a new notion, which we call voting schema, to formally model the voting rules in the GST Council. In a voting schema, there is a primary player and a set of secondary players. The primary player represents the Centre, while the secondary players represent the States. In a particular meeting, a set of secondary players may be present and voting. So, a voting schema gives rise to a number of voting games, one for each set of secondary players who participate in the voting. We assume that the secondary players have some a priori weights. Depending on the actual set of players who participate in the voting, the voting weights need to be determined. The primary player will obtain a fraction \(\lambda \) of the total voting weight while the other \((1-\lambda )\) fraction of the voting weight will be distributed among the secondary players “present and voting” in proportion in proportion to their a priori weights. A method for obtaining such voting weights is described and proved to be essentially unique. We make a detailed formal study of voting games arising from voting schemas of the above type. The primary player’s voting weight is such that it can block any resolution, but, will need the support of some secondary players to pass a resolution. A set of secondary players, on the other hand, cannot pass a resolution without the primary player, but may be able to block a resolution. This tension between the primary player’s ability to pass a resolution and a group of secondary players’ ability to block a resolution is formally modelled as \((\alpha ,\beta )\)-efficiency of the game, where \(\alpha \) is the minimum number of secondary players required by the primary player to pass a resolution and \(\beta \) is the minimum number of secondary players required to block a resolution. Games arising from the condition that the a priori weights of the secondary players are equal are called uniform games. We prove that the values of \(\alpha \) and \(\beta \) are maximised if the game is uniform. Further, in a uniform game, if n players participate in the voting, then \(\alpha +\beta =n+1\). The combination of these two results show that for any game which is \((\alpha ,\beta )\)-efficient, the condition \(\alpha +\beta \le n+1\) must hold. We argue that the weight of the primary player should be such that it is a blocker, but no more. To achieve this, we consider games with modified winning condition (in short, modified games), where the winning condition is changed from “\(\ge \)” to “>”, and where the winning threshold q equals \(1-\lambda \). Analogues of the results on \((\alpha ,\beta )\)-efficiency mentioned above are stated for modified games. The final section transfers the theoretical results back to the context of GST voting rules. A set of four desiderata are derived, namely, the Center should be a blocker, its weight should be sufficient to ensure it is a blocker and no more, the weight of any State should be less than that of the Centre, and the Centre’s task of mustering a passing coalition should be at least as difficult as the task of a group of States to block a resolution moved by the Centre. It is shown that the present voting rules in the GST Council satisfy the first and the fourth desiderata, but not the second and the third desiderata. We propose some modifications to the GST voting rules such that all the four desiderata are satisfied. The rules arising from the suggested modifications are quite close to the present GST voting rules and can be easily incorporated into the GST Act.",2

The set of competing players can be either finite or infinite. At each period, an active player is drawn according to a fixed distribution, and he chooses one of the possible positions. If the object is in this position, then the active player finds the object and wins the game. Otherwise, the object moves according to the transition matrix, and the game enters the next period. Each player observes the action chosen by his opponents, and the transition probabilities, initial probabilities and probabilities of being the active player are known to all players. The goal of each player is to find the object and win the game. So each player prefers the winning outcome and is indifferent between the outcomes in which one of his opponents wins or in which nobody finds the object. The main result of this paper is that the set of subgame perfect equilibria is exactly the set of greedy strategy profiles, also known as myopic strategy profiles, i.e. those strategy profiles in which the active player always selects one of the most likely positions containing the object. The key to this result is to show that by playing a greedy strategy, each player can guarantee that he wins with a probability at least as much as his probability of being active. This implies that, in each subgame, under a greedy strategy profile each player wins with exactly the same probability as his probability of being active. Hence, under a greedy strategy profile, all subgames are identical as far as the winning probabilities are concerned, and each greedy strategy profile is robust to one-deviations: the best each player can do at a certain period is to choose an action that maximizes the probability to win immediately. All these arguments hinge on the fact that the active player is chosen according to the same distribution at each period. Intuitively, this assumption ensures that the active player cannot invest into the future by finding the object with low probability at the present period, as this would not only benefit him but also the other players, proportionally to the fixed probabilities with which each player becomes active. The rest of this paper is divided as follows. In Sect. 1.1 we refer to related literature. In Sect. 1.2 we introduce the model and in Sect. 1.3 we present an illustrative example. In Sect. 2 we study the winning probabilities of players playing a greedy strategy, and we present a characterization of the subgame perfect equilibria. We show that the set of subgame perfect equilibria is exactly the set of greedy strategy profiles. In Sect. 3 we discuss some extensions of the model and see to which extend the main result still holds or not. The conclusion is in Sect. 4. The field of search problems is one of the original disciplines of Operations Research, with various applications such as military problems, R&D problems or patent races, and many of these models involve multiple decision makers. In the basic settings, the searcher’s goal is to find a hidden object, also called the target, with maximal probability or as soon as possible. By now, the field of search problems has evolved into a wide range of models. The models in the literature differ from each other by the characteristics of the searchers and of the objects. Concerning objects, there might be one or several objects, mobile or not, and they might have no aim or their aim is to not be found. Concerning the searchers, there might be one or more. When there is only one searcher, the searcher faces an optimization problem. When there are multiple searchers, they might be cooperative or not. If the searchers cooperate, their aim is similar to the settings with one player: they might want to minimize the expected time of search, the worst time, or some search cost function. If the searchers do not cooperate, the problem becomes a search game with at least two strategic non-cooperative players, and hence game theoretic solution concepts and arguments will play an important role. For an introduction to search games, we refer to Alpern and Gal (2006), Gal (1979, 2010, 2013), Garnaev (2012), and for surveys see Benkoski et al. (1991) and Hohzaki (2016). There are many different types of search games in the literature due to variations in characteristics of the searchers and of the object. Pollock (1970) introduced a simple search game with one searcher, in which an object is moving across two locations referred to as “state 1” and “state 2” respectively, according to a discrete-time Markov chain. The objective of the searcher can be either to minimize the expected number of looks to find the object, or to maximize the probability of finding the object within a given horizon. The model allows for overlooking probabilities, which means that even if the searcher chooses the correct location, he may fail to find the object there. Instead, Nakai (1973) investigates the search problem with three states, while assuming perfect detection, so not accounting for overlooking probabilities. Flesch et al. (2009) investigates a search game similar to Pollock (1970), but in addition to searching for the object in state 1 or state 2, the player has a third option which is to wait. The point of waiting is that it is costless and can induce a favorable probability distribution over the two states at the next period. It is shown that there is a unique optimal strategy, which is characterized by two thresholds. Jordan (1997) studies the structural properties of the optimal strategy, where the goal is to find the object while minimizing the search costs. Thereby he derived some properties of the optimal strategy for the search problem with a finite set of states in the no-overlook case and for the case where each state has the same overlooking probability and cost. Assaf and Sharlin-Bilitzky (1994) investigates a search problem with two states in which the object moves according to a continuous-time Markov process. The objective is to find the object with a minimal expected cost, where the “real time” until the object is found is also taken into account in the cost structure. A competitive environment with more searchers and a static object is considered in Nakai (1986). Finally, in the companion paper (Duvocelle et al. 2020), we consider a two-player competitive search game where players play by turns. We show that an equilibrium does not always exist, but that we can find subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibria for all \(\varepsilon >0\). A classical reference for an overview of search games is the book of Alpern et al. (2013). For a recent paper on search games, we refer to Garrec and Scarsini (2020). They model the search game as a zero-sum two-person stochastic game where one player is looking for the other one. They provide upper and lower bounds on the value of the game. An object is moving over a finite set \(S=\{1,\ldots ,n\}\) of states according to a time-varying Markov chain. The initial distribution of the object is given by \(\pi =(\pi _s)_{s\in S}\), and the transition probabilities at each period \(t\in \mathbb {N}\) are given by the \(S\times S\) transition matrix \(P_t\), where entry \(P_t(s,s')\) is the probability that the object moves to state \(s'\), given it is in state s at period t. Let I denote a set of players, who compete to find the object. We assume that \(I\subseteq \mathbb {N}\) and \(|I|\ge 2\); so the set I can be either finite or countably infinite. The players do not observe the current state of the object, but they know the initial distribution \(\pi \) and the transition matrices \(P_t\), for each \(t\in \mathbb {N}\). At each period \(t\in \mathbb {N}\) one of the players is active: player i is active with probability \(q_i > 0\), where \(\sum _{i \in I} q_i = 1\). The active player chooses a state \(s_t\in S\). If the object is in state \(s_t\), then the active player finds the object and wins the game. Otherwise the game enters period \(t+1\). We assume that each player observes the actions chosen by his opponents, and knows the probabilities \(q_i\), for each \(i\in I\). The goal of each player is to find the object and win the game. For each player the game has three possible outcomes. The first possible outcome is that the player himself finds the object and wins the game. The second outcome is that one of his opponents finds the object and wins the game. The third outcome is that no one finds the object. In this game each player prefers the first outcome, but is indifferent between the second and third outcomes. This means that players do not have opposite interests, which makes it a non-zero-sum game. The action set for each player i is \(A_i=S\). Thus, a history at period \(t\in \mathbb {N}\) is a sequence \(h_t=(i_1,s_1,\ldots ,i_{t-1},s_{t-1})\in S^{2(t-1)}\) of past active players and past actions. By \(H_t=S^{2(t-1)}\) we denote the set of all histories at period t. Note that \(H_1\) consists of the empty sequence. Given a history \(h_t\), with the knowledge of the initial probability distribution \(\pi \) and the transition matrices \(P_1,\ldots ,P_{t-1}\), the players can calculate the probability distribution of the location of the object at period t. This probability distribution does not depend on the past active players, only on the past actions in \(h_t\). A strategy for player i is a sequence of functions \(\sigma _i = (\sigma _{i,t})_{t\in \mathbb {N}}\) where \(\sigma _{i,t} :H_t\rightarrow \Delta (S)\) for each period \(t\in \mathbb {N}\). The interpretation is that, at each period \(t\in \mathbb {N}\), if player i becomes the active player, then given the history \(h_t\), the strategy \(\sigma _{i,t}\) recommends to search state \(s\in S\) with probability \(\sigma _{i,t}(h_t)(s)\). We denote by \(\Sigma _i\) the set of strategies of player i. We say that a strategy is pure if, for any history, it places probability 1 on one action. A strategy is called greedy if, for any history, it places probability 1 on the most likely states. In the literature the greedy strategy is sometimes also called the myopic strategy. Consider a strategy profile \(\sigma =(\sigma _i)_{i\in I}\). The probability under \(\sigma \) that player i wins is denoted by \(u_i(\sigma )\). Note that The aim of player i is to maximize \(u_i(\sigma )\). If the object has not been found before period t, and the history is \(h_t\), the continuation winning probability from period t onward is denoted by \(u_i(\sigma )(h_t)\) for player i. A strategy \(\sigma _i\) for player i is a best response to a profile of strategies \(\sigma _{-i}\) for all other players if \(u_i(\sigma ) \ge u_i(\sigma '_i,\sigma _{-i})\) for every strategy \(\sigma '_i \in \Sigma _i\). A strategy profile \(\sigma =(\sigma _i)_{i\in I}\) is called an equilibrium of the game if \(\sigma _i\) is a best response to \(\sigma _{-i}\) for each player \(i \in I\). A strategy \(\sigma _i\) for player i is a best response in the subgame at history h to a profile of strategies \(\sigma _{-i}\) for all other players, if \(u_i(\sigma )(h) \ge u_i(\sigma '_i,\sigma _{-i})(h)\) for every strategy \(\sigma '_i \in \Sigma _i\). A strategy profile \(\sigma =(\sigma _i)_{i\in I}\) is called a subgame perfect equilibrium if, at each history h, in the subgame at history h the strategy \(\sigma _i\) is a best response to \(\sigma _{-i}\) for each player \(i \in I\). In other words, \(\sigma \) is a subgame perfect equilibrium if it induces an equilibrium in each subgame. In the model we introduced the greedy strategies. However, it is not clear a priori if those strategies are relevant, nor if one greedy strategy can be better or worst than another one. Now we examine an example in order to try to answer those questions. Consider the following game with a parameter \(c\in (0,1)\), with two states and two players. At each period player 1 is active with probability \(q_1=0.99=1-q_2\). The initial probability of the location of the object is \(\pi =(c,1-c)\) and the transition matrices are defined as follows: for all \(t \in \mathbb {N}\), The induced Markov chain of this game is depicted in Fig. 1. An illustrative example We discuss two cases. Case 1 Consider the case in which \(0<c< \tfrac{1}{3}\). At period \(t=1\) it is more likely for the object to be in state 2 as \(c<1-c\). Intuitively, if player 2 gets the chance to be active at period 1, he should look in state 2 as his chance to play later is quite low. However, it is not immediately clear what player 1 should do at period 1. On the one hand, if he looks in state 1 and he does not find the object, then he finds it in period 2 with probability 1 if he can play, which is likely to happen as \(q_1=0.99\). On the other hand he might also simply want to maximise his chance to find the object at period 1 by looking at state 2. More precisely, assume first that player 2 is active at period 1. If he looks at state 1, with probability c he finds the object and with probability \(1-c\) the active player at period 2 can find the object by looking at state 1. In this case, player 2 finds the object with probability \(c+q_2\cdot (1-c)\). However, if he looks at state 2, with probability \(1-c\) he finds the object and with probability c the active player at period 2 can find the object with probability \(1-c\) by looking at state 2. In this case, player 2 finds the object with probability at least \(1-c+q_2\cdot c \cdot (1-c)> c+q_2\cdot (1-c)\) as \(q_2=0.01\) and \(c<\tfrac{1}{3}\). Thus, it is strictly better for player 2 to look at state 2 at period 1. The same holds for each subgame in which the probability distribution of the object is \((c,1-c)\); in particular this is the case after a player choosing state 2 and not finding the object there. Now assume that player 1 is active at period 1. If he looks at state 1, then similarly to the analysis of player 2, he finds the object with probability \(c+q_1\cdot (1-c)\). However, if player 1 decides to choose state 2 at each period he is active, by our analysis of player 2, it follows that player 2 will also do the same. Hence player 1 finds the object with probability \((1-c)+q_1 \cdot c \cdot (1-c)+q_1 \cdot c^2\cdot (1-c)+\ldots =1-c+q_1\cdot c>c+q_1\cdot (1-c)\) as \(q_1<1\) and \(0<c<\tfrac{1}{3}\). So it is better for player 1 to choose state 2 at period 1. From our discussion, it follows that every Nash equilibrium induces the play in which at each period the active player chooses state 2. If a deviation occurs to state 1 and the object is not found, the next active player chooses state 1 and wins the game. This is a greedy strategy profile as at each period the most likely state is chosen. Case 2 Consider the case in which \(c=1/2\). In this case, both states are equally likely, so a greedy strategy can choose any state at period 1. Note that at any period, if state 1 is chosen and the object is not found, a greedy strategy finds the object at the next period in state 1. However, if state 2 is chosen and the object is not found, a greedy strategy can choose any of the two states at the next period. Therefore, there are many greedy strategy profiles, and all can induce different plays. It is then natural to ask whether every greedy strategy profile induces the same winning probabilities. As we will show later, every greedy strategy profile leads to the winning probability \(q_1\) for player 1 and \(q_2\) for player 2.",4

This theory of “optimal stopping” is presented in the monographs of Chow et al. (1971) and Shiryaev (1973). At roughly the same time, Dubins and Savage (1965) were formulating their theory of gambling problems which encompassed a theory of when to stop playing. The relationship between the two theories is treated by Dubins and Sudderth (1977a). A class of two-person, zero-sum stopping problems was defined by Dynkin (1969), who also showed his games to have a value. A number of mathematicians have extended these results in various directions such as to non-zero sum games and n-person games. (See, for example, Rosenberg et al. (2001), Shmaya et al. (2003, 2004), Mashiah-Yaakovi (2014), or Solan and Laraki (2013).) Here we propose a theory of two-person, zero-sum games related to Dubins–Savage gambling theory. In the formulation of Dynkin, exactly one player was able to halt play at every stage. Here it is possible that one or both or neither of the players can stop at some states. The payoff for Dynkin’s game was zero if play was never stopped whereas we use the Dubins–Savage payoff corresponding to the limsup of the values of a utility function. These games are shown to have a value and good strategies are found for the players. A related class of n-person games is defined and shown to have approximate equilibria.",

A substantial part of these works concern simple motion pursuit and evasion differential games of many players. Often, either geometric or integral constraints are imposed on the control parameters of players. In Croft (1964) Croft showed that in the n-dimensional Euclidean ball n lions can catch the man, while the man can escape from \(n-1\) lions when the controls of the players are subject to geometric constraints. A similar game problem was studied by Ivanov (1980) on any convex compact set and an estimate from above was obtained for guaranteed pursuit time. Interesting results were obtained in Alexander et al. (2009), Azamov (2008), Bakolas and Tsiotras (2011), Berkovitz (1986), Bhattacharya et al. (2016), Konstantinidis and Kehagias (2016) and Sun and Tsiotras (2014) for various games in unbounded regions as well as on graphs. Evasion problem on time interval \([t_0, \infty )\) was introduced and studied by Pontryagin and Mischenko (1971). In Mishchenko et al. (1977) Mishchenko et al. proposed a new manoeuvre for evasion in the game of many pursuers. Chernous’ko (1976) studied an evasion game of one evader and several pursuers with a state constraint, i.e. the evader was supposed to remain in a neighborhood of a given ray for the duration of the game. He proved that if the evader is faster than the pursuers then evasion is possible. This result was extended by Chernous’ko and Zak (1985) and Zak (1978, 1981, 1982) to more general differential game problems. Related problems of evasion from a group of pursuers were studied in Borowko et al. (1988) and Chodun (1989). In Pshenichnii (1976) Pshenichnii considered a simple motion differential game of many pursuers and one evader in \({\mathbb {R}}^n\), when all players have the same dynamic possibilities. He proved that if the initial state of the evader belongs to the interior of convex hull of pursuers’ initial states, then pursuit can be completed, otherwise evasion is possible. Based on this work, Pshenichnii et al. (1981) developed the method of resolving functions for solving linear pursuit problems with many pursuers. Later on, the results of paper (Pshenichnii 1976) were extended by many researchers to cover various cases. For example, when control sets of players are convex compact sets, Grigorenko (1990) obtained the necessary and sufficient conditions of evasion of one evader from several pursuers. The papers Chikrii and Prokopovich (1992) and Kuang (1986) are also extensions of Pshenichnii (1976). In Kuchkarov et al. (2012) the game problem of many pursuers and one evader was studied on a cylinder. In the recent work of Kuchkarov et al. (2016), the results of Pshenichnii (1976) were extended to differential games on manifolds with Euclidean metric. In Blagodatskikh and Petrov (2009) Blagodatskikh and Petrov obtained necessary and sufficient condition of evasion in a simple motion differential game of a group of pursuers and a group of evaders in \({\mathbb {R}}^n\) where all evaders use the same control. By definition, pursuit is considered completed if the state of a pursuer coincides with the state of at least one evader. Also, the works (Bannikov and Petrov 2010; Vagin and Petrov 2001) related to such games. Recently in Scott and Leonard (2018) the authors consider a pursuit-evasion game involving one pursuer and multiple evaders motivated by the seminal “selfish herd” model of Hamilton (1971). The pursuer can freely move in any direction with bounded speed and evaders move with bounded speed and bounded turning speed. Using Isaacs’ heuristic argument they constructed an optimal strategy for the pursuer and concluded that the optimal strategy for the pursuer is to focus on a single evader that can be captured in minimum time. Moreover, “non-targeted” evaders are always able to escape. We refer to Kumkov et al. (2017) for a survey of results on differential games of many players with geometric constraints. In the case of integral constraints, simple motion evasion games of many players were solved in Alias et al. (2016), Ibragimov et al. (2012) and Ibragimov et al. (2018). In the present paper, we study a linear evasion differential game of many pursuers and one evader. The controls of players are subjected to integral constraints. To the best of our knowledge no previous study has investigated the linear evasion game problem stated in the present paper. The main difficulties in solving the problem are the construction of evasion strategy and to prove the fact that the objects go around the origin on some specified time interval [0, T] maintaining some distances from the origin. Note that we employ non-anticipative strategies in the present game model (see, for example, Cardaliaguet et al. 2000). Note that there is a similarity between the constructed evasion strategies and proofs of the main results of current and existing works (Ibragimov et al. 2012, 2018). They are (i) the definition of time intervals \([\tau _i, \tau '_i)\), (ii) the construction of a strategy for the evader which allows the evader to use a manoeuvre on \([\tau _i, \tau '_i)\) against the i-th pursuer, (iii) estimating the distances between the evader and pursuers, and establishing that evasion is possible. We believe that these steps will be common for the most of open evasion differential game problems of many players with integral constraints described by the linear system of equations as well. However, the main difficulties in solving the open problems will remain to overcome the steps (i)–(iii) listed above. In the case of linear equations studied in the present paper, the strategies of existing papers do not work since, for the linear equation describing the game, we have to find its own \(\tau _i\). Also, by contrast, we need bounded \(\tau _i\), \(\tau '_i\) and new techniques to estimate \(x_p(t)\). Note that according to the strategy of the present paper, in contrast to previous works, each object, for any control functions of pursuers, moves with a positive speed in the direction of y-axis on the time interval [0, T]. Moreover, all the objects will become on the upper half plane by the time T, and then evasion is established. The fact that each time interval where the evader uses a manoeuver is contained in the interval [0, T] plays a key role in establishing a number of estimates in the proof of the main result. This work is a milestone study to undertake a detailed analysis of linear evasion differential game problem of many pursuers and one evader with integral constraints.

The sender can attempt to communicate her information to the receiver before the receiver takes an action. The receiver would, ideally, like to make his choice of action dependent on the state of the world, but in a way that differs from the sender’s ideal choice of action. Thus, there is a conflict of interest. Communication is costless (termed “cheap” in the literature). Messages the sender transmits to the receiver have no intrinsic meaning, or no intrinsic meaning that can be verified, and only possibly take on meaning (reveal information) in equilibrium. One of the main findings of the cheap talk literature, started by Crawford and Sobel (1982), is that influential communication in one sender one receiver games is typically only possible if the conflict of interest is not too large.Footnote 1 This has been shown in the equilibrium characterization by Crawford and Sobel (1982) and expanded by Goltsman et al. (2009). If the conflict of interest is large, credible communication seemed only possible if messages are verifiable or costly (for a survey of this literature, see Sobel 2013). Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) propose and analyze a one sender one receiver game with a multi-dimensional state space with an extreme form of conflict of interest. The receiver is essentially as modelled in Crawford and Sobel (1982), but the informed sender actually does not at all care about the state itselfFootnote 2: the sender’s preference is state independent. Surprisingly, and by a beautiful argument—which eventually allows the use of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem (a fundamental fixed-point theorem)—Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) show that, in their model, influential cheap talk equilibria always exist. To analyze games of incomplete information, such as those of the cheap talk literature, in addition to specifying players, strategies, and consequences (payoffs) to complete the model one has to make informational assumptions. The informational assumptions made in Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010), as also in Crawford and Sobel (1982), are as follows. The utility functions of both sender and receiver are common knowledge, as is the receiver’s subjective belief about the state. In fact Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) relax these informational assumptions in a robustness exercise in two different ways, and show, for each case, that the game so modified still exhibits influential equilibria. Both robustness exercises allow the sender to have possibly different utility functions. In both cases the sender knows her utility function and the receiver’s subjective belief about the sender’s utility function is common knowledge. In one specification this commonly known distribution has finite support with the number of positive probability utility functions less than the dimensionality of the state space. In the second specification this commonly known distribution places a sufficiently large atom on a single utility function. As the state space is a compact subset of, at least, two-dimensional Euclidean space and as there are, in principle, an infinite number of possible utility functions the sender could have (even an infinite number of utility functions that are all very close to each other) we feel a different robustness check should also be undertaken. In this paper we assume that the receiver, while possibly having a good general idea about the sender’s preferences, does not believe that any particular utility function (out of the infinitely many possible ones) has positive probability. We call this the Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) model with Harsanyi-uncertainty, as the uncertainty is very much as it is in the purification argument of Harsanyi (1973). Completing this model by assuming that the receiver’s subjective belief about the sender’s utility function is common knowledge, we then find that this modified game has no influential equilibria. This result does not depend on the choice of the set of possible utility functions (as long as a belief without atom can be specified and a genericity assumption is satisfied) nor on the exact shape of the distribution of these beliefs. One could possibly argue that the fact that Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) did not perform a robustness check with Harsanyi-uncertainty already indicates that no such robustness can be proven. Note however two things. First, the absence of such a robustness result could also simply mean that it is hard to prove that “there is a robust influential equilibrium in every game”. In Appendix A we show that in many cases there are in fact infinitely many other kinds of equilibria in the original Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) model, in addition to the hyperplane-based equilibria identified by Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010), and it might be possible that one of these is robust. Second, the opposite statement to “there is a robust influential equilibrium in every game” is only that “there are some games in which there is no robust influential equilibrium”. We prove here that “no game has any robust influential equilibrium”, a much stronger statement. The paper is organized as follows. We begin by stating the model of Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010) and our modification to that model in Sect. 2. Section 3 demonstrates the main finding of Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010), as well as the non-robustness to Harsanyi-uncertainty of all influential equilibria, by means of the simplest possible example. The main result of our paper is then stated and proven in Sect. 4 for the case of finite message spaces and in Sect. 5 for the case of infinite message spaces. Sect. 6 concludes.",1

It is well known that, once agents have initially equal income, competitive allocations are fair and the reverse is not true. Furthermore, core allocations might not be fair, not even if so is the initial endowment. Zhou (1992) introduces a stronger fairness concept, called strict fairness, by imposing, besides efficiency, that no agent envies the possibility to join a coalition and to get its average bundle. He proves that, when the set of agents is replicated, the set of strictly fair allocations of the replica economy shrinks to the set of equal-income competitive allocations, whereas, in an atomless economy, both sets coincide without asymptotic limit arguments.Footnote 1 This coincidence fails in the so-called mixed markets, in which a continuum of negligible traders interacts with a family of influential traders represented by atoms of the measure space of agents. In this paper we propose a weakening of the strict fairness notion that characterizes equal-income competitive allocations in presence of non-negligible traders. Our approach consists in enlarging the class of potentially envied coalitions and following the idea of Aubin (1979) to allow every agent to choose her rate of participation in a coalition, and not only whether to participate or not. We propose a fairness notion that requires efficiency and absence of envy towards the so-called fuzzy (or generalized) coalitions. In other words, we define an efficient allocation to be fuzzy strictly fair if almost every agent t does not envy a fuzzy coalition, that is if it is not possible for a certain group of traders to redistribute among themselves their resources according to their participation rates and get a bundle that t strictly prefers to her own. We show that fuzzy strict fairness FSF has the twofold merit to characterize the set of equal-income competitive allocations \(W_{ei}\), and simultaneously, the fuzzy core or the Aubin-core \(C_A\) of an economy that may exhibit atoms (Theorem 3.4 and Corollary ). This is contrary to the strict fairness SF notion of Zhou (1992) which makes this job only under perfect competition. As a matter of fact, we prove that, in atomless economies, SF and FSF coincide (Corollary 4.2), and hence, the equivalence theorem of Zhou (1992) follows from ours. But, in general, FSF is a proper subset of SF, because an enlargement of the set of potentially envied coalitions causes the reduction of the set of allocations judgeable fair (Proposition 2.5). Moreover, we investigate the properties of envied fuzzy coalitions and get further characterizations of competitive equilibria and of the Aubin-core. Thanks to the Lyapunov-Richter’s theorem, we observe that if negligible agents are members of an envied coalition, they join it with their whole resources (Proposition 4.1). Hence, the opportunity to employ a fraction of their endowment is actually significant only for the non-negligible traders (atoms). This possibility also allows an individual to belong simultaneously to the set of envious agents and to the envied coalition. Indeed, we prove that once a trader envies a fuzzy coalition, almost every agent in the economy joins the envied coalition (Theorem 4.3). This means that envied fuzzy coalitions have full support in the sense that they are non-null almost everywhere. Azrieli and Lehrer (2007) point out two main interpretations of fuzzy coalitions in the literature. The first is, as already observed, to let agents choose their level of participation in a coalition. The second, suggested by García-Cutrín and Hervés-Beloso (1993) and later by Hüsseinov (1994), consists in associating to every finite economy an atomless one and interpreting fuzzy coalitions in the finite economy as ordinary coalitions in the associated atomless economy. We extend this interpretation to mixed markets in terms of envied coalitions rather than blocking coalitions. Precisely, given a mixed economy \({{\mathcal {E}}}\), we consider the atomless economy \({{\mathcal {E}}}^*\) as determined by Greenberg and Shitovitz (1986), and we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sets FSF of \({{\mathcal {E}}}\) and SF of \({{\mathcal {E}}}^*\). Indeed, we prove that any fuzzy strictly fair allocation in the mixed economy \({{\mathcal {E}}}\) corresponds to a unique strictly fair allocation in \({{\mathcal {E}}}^*\) and vice-versa. This allows us to view fuzzy coalitions and fuzzy strictly fair allocations respectively as standard coalitions and strictly fair allocations of an associated, suitably defined, atomless economy. Summing up, our analysis contributes to two pieces of literature, the one that studies the problem of a fair redistribution of divisible resources and the other that concerns the fuzzy cooperation approach and possible characterizations of competitive equilibria in non-perfectly competitive economies. The literature of fair division is huge and rich of various equity notions proposed in decades of research. This paper focuses on the notion of strict fairness due to Zhou (1992) which has been recently studied by Cato (2010), who proposed a local version of SF by imposing absence of envy only among neighbors (see also Donnini and Pesce 2021), by Basile et al. (2018) who compared SF with a coalitional fairness notion in economies with infinitely many goods, by Donnini and Pesce (2020) who got the equivalence \(W_{ei}=SF\) in mixed markets under stronger assumptions than those used to prove the Core-Walras equivalence theorem (Shitovitz 1973). In this paper, we keep the model of mixed markets but, weakening the notion of strict fairness, we avoid additional conditions on the space of agents as well as restrictions on the set of potentially envied agents. We indeed follow Aubin’s approach which permits extending several results to non-perfectly competitive economies. This policy is also widespread in the literature. See, among others, Florenzano (1990), Noguchi (2000), Liu and Liu (2014), Pesce (2014) and Bhowmik and Graziano (2015) for the equivalence Walras-Aubin–Core in different frameworks; Hervés-Estévez and Moreno-García (2015), Hervés-Beloso et al. (2018) and Graziano et al. (2020) for the link between \(W_{ei}\) and the bargaining set, and Yang et al. (2011) between the bargaining set and the Aubin-core. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the model, we introduce the notion of fuzzy strict fairness, and we provide some basic relationships among the main definitions. Section 3 contains the equivalence theorem, whereas Sect. 4 some properties of fuzzy envied coalitions and consequent characterizations of the set of fuzzy strictly fair allocations. Section 5 refers to the construction of the atomless economy \({{\mathcal {E}}}^*\) associated to the mixed market \({{\mathcal {E}}}\) and provides an interpretation of fuzzy coalitions and of the set of fuzzy strictly fair allocations. Section 6 concludes with some remarks.",1

It is assumed that an individual’s behavior cannot influence the future behavior of other individuals, implying the absence of supergame effects. A Nash equilibrium is then seen as a stationary state in population frequencies over the individual’s pure strategies. In such interactions, conventions for how to play the underlying game often emerge.Footnote 1 These conventions not only help the individuals to coordinate but also simplify their decision-making (see, e.g., Schelling 1960; Lewis 1969). However, as is well-known, simple examples show that many Nash equilibria are implausible as such conventions. The completely mixed Nash equilibrium in the following coordination game is a striking exampleFootnote 2 In this game, it seems unreasonable that the individuals would not be able to over time coordinate their expectations to settle on one of the strict equilibria. In the spirit of Myerson and Weibull (2015), this paper develops a set-valued concept that identifies Nash equilibria that are compatible with potential conventions in finite normal-form games. In such a game, a block is a nonempty set of pure strategies for each player, and a block game is a game where each player is restricted to using strategies with support in the associated block. Myerson and Weibull (2015) interpret blocks as the basis for potential conventions, that is, sets of strategies individuals take into consideration when called to play the game in their player role. For such conventions to be self-enforcing, no individual should be able to do better by using strategies outside of the convention. This notion can be formalized in several ways. An elegant and operational formulation is due to Basu and Weibull (1991): a block is closed under rational behavior, or curb, if it contains all best replies to the mixed-strategy profiles with support in the block. As noted by Myerson and Weibull (2015), curb blocks are sometimes large and depend on features of the game that may be regarded as strategically inessential. Therefore, the authors weaken the above robustness requirement to only hold when the overall population play constitutes a Nash equilibrium. They formalized this within a framework in which every player role in a game is represented by a large population of boundedly rational individuals. Using this framework, the authors elaborate two block properties called coarse and fine tenability, respectively. Coarse tenability satisfies the weaker robustness requirement by requiring that the block contains at least one best reply to any population Nash equilibrium. Fine tenability relaxes this requirement by restricting the population distribution of boundedly rational individuals to be biased towards more rationality types. Settled equilibria are Nash equilibria with support in minimal coarsely and finely tenable blocks. In this paper, I explore an intermediate block property, between curb and coarse tenability, called Nash block. A Nash block contains all best replies to all Nash equilibria of its block game. Thus, every Nash equilibrium of a Nash-block game is a Nash equilibrium of the full game. A Nash-block settled equilibrium, or NBE, is any Nash equilibrium with support in some minimal Nash block. Every finite game has at least one such equilibrium.Footnote 3 Minimality (in terms of set inclusion) is here motivated by the fact that it simplifies the players’ decision-making by reducing the number of strategies they have to consider. The main advantage of the Nash block concept is that it offers a simple way to decompose games into self-contained block games that can be studied in isolation from the full game. To find a Nash block, a simple algorithm suffices which does not require finding all Nash equilibria nor to perturb the data of the game: (1) Start with any block and compute all Nash equilibria of the associated block game, (2) add a (weakly) better reply for one of the players to one of the Nash equilibria from the previous step, (3) repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more strategies are added. This process stops after a finite number of repetitions and the resulting block is a Nash block.Footnote 4 The point is that if the analyst (or the players) has a reasonable prior of what the starting block should be, e.g., the strategies that have been observed to be used in the past, there is no need to consider the whole game. To further see the benefits of the concept, consider an analyst studying a situation as described by the mass-action interpretation. When the analyst specifies a model for the analysis, instead of ad-hoc selecting the strategies that she deems “essential” for the problem at hand, the Nash block concept provides a systematic approach to select candidate blocks for the analysis to focus on.Footnote 5 For Nash equilibria of the full game with support in some Nash block, only analyzing the Nash-block game is without loss of generality in the following sense: global properties of an equilibrium component– such as robustness against payoff perturbations– are determined by local properties of the same component in the corresponding Nash-block game.Footnote 6 I establish this using index theory (Ritzberger 1994). I show by the way of examples that the solution concept developed in this paper offers an operational approach to equilibrium selection that has good cutting power in games in which standard solution concepts are known to perform poorly.Footnote 7 These include games with cheap talk or signaling, which are typically associated with a plethora of Nash equilibria, many of which constitute implausible predictions. As hinted by its definition, the Nash block concept is closely related to the curb concept. I show that most of the latter’s robustness properties are inherited by Nash blocks. In particular, a strategy profile constitutes a singleton Nash block if and only if it is a strict Nash equilibrium. Moreover, every Nash block contains the support of an essential component (Jiang 1963)—thus also a proper equilibrium (Myerson 1978) and a strategically stable subset. Despite these similarities, the Nash and the curb concept differ on an open set of games. The Nash block concept is also related to coarse tenability. Although the former has a succinct definition without reference to population play, it can be characterized within Myerson and Weibull (2015) population framework. This characterization provides a micro foundation for the concept and highlights its relationship with coarse tenability. While the latter requires that no individual does strictly better using strategies outside the convention (in equilibrium), the Nash block concept strengthens this condition to require that any individual does strictly worse doing so. I show by way of example that coarsely (and finely) tenable blocks lack some of the robustness properties that Nash blocks inherit from the curb concept. Finally, I discuss a property that minimal Nash blocks share with minimal tenable blocks (but not curb blocks), namely, that such blocks are not invariant under the deletion of strictly dominated strategies. However, in contrast to minimal tenable blocks, minimal Nash blocks are invariant under the addition of such strategies. Therefore, in any given game it is easy to identify the set of such blocks that are invariant under both the removal and addition of strictly dominated strategies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a motivating example. In Sect. 3, notation and definitions are provided. The Nash block concept is introduced in Sect. 4, where some of its fundamental properties are provided and its cutting power in important classes of games is highlighted. Section 5 discusses the concept’s relationship with coarse tenability. In Sect. 6, index theory is used to study properties of Nash equilibrium components with support in the same Nash block. In Sect. 7, it is shown that minimal Nash blocks may contain strictly dominated strategies. Finally, related set-valued concepts are discussed in Sects. 8 and 9 contains a discussion of the concept’s relationship with explicitly modeled dynamics.",

In many scenarios, agents can take part in at most one activity (e.g., since these take place simultaneously), which is the setting considered in this work. In this respect, ‘activity’ should be taken in a wide sense; typical examples include, for instance, tasks, coalitions, or courses. The group activity selection problem (GASP) asks how to assign agents to activities in a “good” way. In the original form introduced by Darmann et al. (2012, 2018), agents express their preferences both on the activities and on the number of participants for the latter; in general, these preferences are expressed by means of weak orders over pairs “(activity, group size)”. We will consider a simplified version of the group activity selection problem, called s-GASP. Here, agents only express their preferences over the set of activities. However, the activities come with certain constraints, such as restrictions on the number of participants, concepts like balancedness, or more global restrictions. The goal is again to find a “good” assignment of agents to activities, respecting both the agents’ preferences as well as the constraints. In this work, we investigate the case that activities bare constraints on the number of participants, which are of the following kind: each activity has a lower and upper bound on the number of agents that can take part in it; the activity can only be used if the number of agents assigned to it is in that interval. The applications of such a setting include assignments of agents to “group activities” such as participants of a workshop to social activities in the free afternoon (e.g., for activities with costs to be split as in a bus trip, a certain minimum amount of participants could be required), co-workers to projects or working tasks, or students to courses. In general, we are therefore concerned with a problem of translating individual preferences into a group decision in a meaningful way, which is the central question of social choice and has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence in recent years. With the emergence and increase of recommender systems, e-commerce, and online platforms connecting people and serving as a tool to coordinate group activities, the study of properties of solutions and their practicability in terms of the computational complexity involved hence also have rapidly been gaining in relevance. But what is a good assignment? Clearly, this essentially depends on the application on hand, but there are several concepts in the social choice and game theory literature that propose for an evaluative solution. We consider two classes of solution concepts for assessing the quality of an assignment: stability criteria that mainly come from game theory and that aim at telling whether an assignment is stable enough (that is, immune to some types of deviations) to be implemented. First, individual rationality requires that each agent is assigned to an activity she likes better than not being assigned to any activity at all. Then, a solution concept considered both in hedonic games and in matching theory, is the notion of stability. It asks whether the assignment is stable in the sense that no agent (individual stability) or no group of agents (core stability) would want to or be able to deviate from her coalition, her match, or in our case, her assigned activity. Besides considering these different variants of stability, it also makes sense in our setting to investigate the variations of virtual stability, meaning that it is not possible that an agent or a group of agents deviates from the assigned activity due to the given constraints on the desired activity. welfare and fairness criteria that stem from social choice theory and fair division. The former measure, qualitatively or quantitatively, the welfare of agents. A common quality measure in terms of efficiency of an assignment is the notion of Pareto optimality: there should be no feasible assignment in which there is an agent that is strictly better off, while the remaining agents do not change for the worse. More generally, one may wish to optimize social welfare, for some notion of utility derived from the agents’ preferences: for instance, one may simply be willing to maximize the number of agents assigned to an activity (which is one of the goals pursued in this work). If fairness is important in the design, the notion of envy-freeness makes sense: an assignment respecting the constraints is envy-free if no agent strictly prefers an activity another agent is assigned to to the activity she is currently assigned to. Envy can hence be the reason for an “unstable” assignment, and therefore envy-freeness can also be interpreted as a kind of stability criterion. Our model is related to various streams of work: Group Activity Selection Problem (see the survey by Darmann and Lang (2017)). Darmann et al. (2012, 2018) introduce the group activity selection problem (GASP), in which agents need to be assigned to activities (each agent to at most one activity). There, agents’ preferences depend both on the activities and on the number of participants in the respective activity and are captured by means of weak orders over pairs “(activity, group size)” including a dedicated outside option (the void activity). The works of Darmann et al. (2012, 2018) and Darmann (2018a, 2018b) are concerned with the variants of GASP in which the agents’ preferences are approvals and strict orders respectively and analyze the computational complexity of finding assignments that are stable or maximize the number of agents assigned to activities. The parametrized complexity of (variants of) GASP has also been studied in the literature. For instance, Ganian et al. (2019) consider the parametrized complexity of GASP with typed agents. Moreover, the model of GASP has been expanded by Igarashi et al. (2017a, 2017b) by introducing social network constraints: any pair of agents can only take part in the same activity if the respective agent-vertices of a given social network graph are connected by an edge in the graph. For that setting, Igarashi et al. (2017a, 2017b) and also Gupta et al. (2017) study stability concepts from a computational viewpoint, with the focus on fixed parameter tractability. Finally, we refer to Eiben et al. (2018) for another extension of the original model of GASP, where agents also express their preferences over other agents by listing enemies and friends. In contrast to these works, however, in the model of s-GASP the agents have preferences over activities including the void activity, and constraints on the number of agents that can be assigned to each of the activities are given exogenously. We also consider additional aspects such as envy-freeness and the tension between envy-freeness and Pareto optimality, and we focus on weak orders (albeit almost all of our hardness results hold for strict orders as well). Assignment problems (see, e.g., Chapter 17 in the book by Schrijver (2003)). \({\textsf {s{-}GASP}}\) with constraints on the group sizes is similar to the classical assignment problem where agents are assigned to tasks (at most one agent to each task and at most one task to each agent), minimizing some related total cost: our activities correspond to tasks, and for each activity, we introduce as many copies of the corresponding task as the upper bound of the considered activity. The void activity can be represented by a dummy task. The difference in our setting is that activities might come with lower bounds and can only be assigned if enough agents are willing to participate. Course/Project allocation, (see, e.g. Cechlárová and Fleiner (2017), Kamiyama (2013) and Monte and Tumennasan (2013)). Students bear preferences over courses they would like to be enrolled in (these preferences are typically strict orders), and there are usually constraints given on the size of the courses. Courses will only be offered if a minimum number of participants is found, and there are upper bounds due to space or capacity limitations. Cechlárová and Fleiner (2017) consider a course-allocation framework where agents can be matched to more than one activity (course), and in their model, each agent has a certain capacity of courses she is able to take part in. Cechlárová and Fleiner (2017) are concerned with Pareto optimality, and provide NP-hardness for the problems of (i) deciding if a given matching is Pareto optimal in the case that all agents have strict preferences over a subset of acceptable courses, and (ii) finding a Pareto optimal matching in the case that each agent is indifferent between all courses she finds acceptable. Kamiyama (2013) and Monte and Tumennasan (2013) consider the scenario in which an agent can be assigned to at most one activity (project), each of which needs a minimum number of agents to open, and the agents have strict preferences over projects; the goal here would be a strategyproof and Pareto-optimal matching. These works are very close to our setting, but our setting contains a dedicated outside option (the void activity), and agents’ preferences are represented by weak orders over activities instead of strict rankings. Note that we do not restrict to Pareto optimality but also consider solution concepts such as core stability and virtual stability. In addition, our setting is related to the many-to-one weight matching problem considered by Arulselvan et al. (2018). They are concerned with a set of vertices (agents) that need to be matched with another set of vertices (posts) of an undirected graph, and each post comes with a lower and upper bound on the number of agents engaged in the post; each agent can be assigned to at most one post. Each edge in the graph has a weight, and the goal would be a many-to-one matching with total maximum weight. In the unit weight case, this problem corresponds to finding an individually rational assignment maximizing the number of agents involved in a non-void activity in the model of \({\textsf {s{-}GASP}}\) considered in this paper, see also Sects. 3 and 5. Our setting is also related to the college/school admission problems with two-sided preferences and quotas as considered by Biró et al. (2010), Boehmer and Heeger (2020), Goto et al. (2014), and Hamada et al. (2017). In the college admission problem (see also Gale and Shapley (1962)), there is a set of students that need to be assigned to colleges; each college has a certain upper bound on the number of students that can be enrolled, while both students bear preferences over the colleges and colleges bear preferences over the students. We point out that in our setting, we are concerned with one-sided preferences only: the agents have preferences over the activities, but not vice versa. Hence, observe that in the college admission problem, a stable assignment takes into account the preferences of both sides, which is not the case in our setting. As an additional contrast to our setting, in the above papers the preferences are assumed to be strict. Similar to our work, however, Biró et al. (2010), Boehmer and Heeger (2020), Yokoi (2020), and Hamada et al. (2017) are concerned with lower quotas, i.e., each college comes also with a lower bound on the number of students that must be admitted to the college to ensure its opening. In such a setting, Yokoi (2020) is concerned with envy-freeness, while Biró et al. (2010) and Boehmer and Heeger (2020) focus on stability; in particular, Biró et al. (2010) show that deciding whether a stable assignment exists is NP-complete, and Boehmer and Heeger (2020) analyze the parametrized complexity involved. In contrast, as we show in this work, in \({\textsf {s{-}GASP}}\), for most of the stability concepts considered, a stable assignment always exists and can be found efficiently. In the variant considered by Hamada et al. (2017), however, in a feasible assignment, all colleges must be open; on the contrary, our setting also allows for activities to which no agents are assigned. Moreover, regional minimum or maximum (common) quotas have been considered in the college admission problem as well, where in each region (i.e., set of colleges) a certain lower, respectively upper, bound on the total number of students (see Goto et al. (2014) resp. Biró et al. (2010)) has to be met. Finally, our work also has a certain vicinity to the problem considered by Garg et al. (2010), where scientific papers need to be assigned to referees. Hedonic games (see the recent survey by Aziz and Savani (2015)) are coalition formation games where each agent has preferences over coalitions containing her. The stability notions we will focus on are derived from those for hedonic games. However, in our model, agents do not care about who else is assigned to the same activity as them, but only about the activity to which they are assigned to.Footnote 1 In multiwinner elections, there is a set of candidates, voters have preferences over single candidates, and a subset of k candidates has to be elected. In some approaches to multiwinner elections, each voter is assigned to one of the members of the elected committee, who is supposed to represent her. Sometimes there are no constraints on the number of voters assigned to a given committee member as is the case for the Chamberlin-Courant rule (Chamberlin and Courant 1983), in which case each voter is assigned to her most preferred committee member; on the other hand, for the Monroe rule (Monroe 1995), the assignment has to be balanced. A more general setting, with more general constraints, has been defined by Skowron et al. (2015). Note that multiwinner elections can also be interpreted as resource allocation with items that come in several units (Skowron et al. 2015) and as group recommendation (Lu and Boutilier 2011). While assignment-based multiwinner election problems are similar to simplified group activity selection, an important difference is that for the former, stability notions play no role, as the voters are not assumed to be able to deviate from their assigned representatives. In this work, we will take into account various solution concepts and consider two tasks: First, do “good” assignments exist? Can we decide this efficiently? And if they exist, can we find them efficiently? Our second concern is optimization: we are looking for desirable assignments that maximize the number of agents which can be assigned to an activity. Again, we may ask whether an assignment that is optimal in this sense exists, and we can try to find it. We will focus on one family of constraints concerning the size of the groups—we assume that each activity comes with a lower and an upper bound on the number of participants—and give a detailed analysis of the described problems for this class. Our results for this class are twofold. First, we show that it is often possible to find assignments with desirable properties in an efficient way: we propose several polynomial-time algorithms to find good assignments or to optimize them, meaning that we want to maximize the number of agents assigned to a non-void activity. We complement these findings with NP- and coNP-completeness results for certain solution concepts. Whenever we encounter computational hardness, we identify tractable special cases: we will see that basically all our problems can be solved in polynomial time if there is no restriction on the minimum number of participants for the activities to take place. This corresponds to the setting of the assignment problem where tasks do not have a limitation on the lower bound of agents. An overview of our computational complexity results is given in Table 1 in Sect. 3. Second, we show that also in this class of problems considered, there is a certain tension between the concepts of envy-freeness and Pareto optimality, even for small instances. From a technical point of view, we mainly use reductions to establish our hardness results and flow networks to obtain polynomial-time algorithms. Many of our hardness results are obtained by reductions from the NP-complete problem Exact Cover by 3-Sets (X3C). The constructions we use are often similar to a certain extent, but the argumentation to justify the desired properties of the constructed instances differs. We therefore give two of these proofs in detail in the main part of this work and defer the remaining constructions and their discussion to the Appendix. The special structure of the problems considered in Sect. 5, however, was helpful for working with matchings, either to obtain polynomial-time algorithms, or as a base problem for reductions to obtain computational hardness. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we formally introduce the simplified model as well as possible constraints and several solution concepts. Section 3 is the main part and provides an analysis of the computational complexity of the questions described above. Section 4 deals with the tension between envy-freeness and Pareto optimality. A special type of constraint asking for a certain kind of balancedness is considered in Sect. 5 where we investigate the case that an activity can only take place if exactly q agents are assigned to it, for some fixed number q. In Sect. 6, we conclude and discuss the general model of the simplified group activity selection problem, as well as future directions of research.",

In this model, the worth of each coalition represents the monetary opportunities when these players join forces. Once the grand coalition is formed, the worths of subcoalitions serve as benchmarks for a fair allocation of the worth of the grand coalition. Solutions assign to each transferable utility game a set of recommended allocations for the cooperating players. These solutions are fundamentally distinguished on the basis of axioms, i.e., formal expressions of properties which may or may not be satisfied. Already since the earlier development of cooperative game theory, the core has been one of the central solution concepts for transferable utility games. This solution recommends all allocations which are efficient and stable, i.e., which fully allocate the worth of the grand coalition in such a way that each subcoalition is allocated at least its worth. As the core of a game is closed, bounded, and convex, it consists of zero, one, or infinitely many allocations. The core has been mainly studied on the basis of consistency and reduced game properties. Consistency of the core can be generally described as follows. Consider a transferable utility game and a corresponding core allocation. Suppose that some players leave with their allocated money and the remaining players reevaluate the allocation. For this, a reduced game for the remaining players is specified. If the core is consistent, then the initial allocation restricted to the remaining players is in the core of this reduced game. The exact formulation of consistency axioms is determined by the specific definition of reduced games. The most appealing definition may depend on the context of the underlying collaborative situation, and alternative definitions may admit alternative interpretations. In fact, the core has been proven to be consistent for several definitions of reduced games. Inspired by Davis and Maschler (1965), Peleg (1986) showed that the core is consistent when the worth of a coalition of remaining players in reduced games is defined as the maximal surplus to any subgroup of leaving players, and that this reduced game property characterizes the core in conjunction with individual rationality and superadditivity. Tadenuma (1992) showed that the core is consistent when the worth of a coalition of remaining players in reduced games is defined as the surplus to all leaving players, and that this reduced game property characterizes the core in conjunction with individual rationality. Funaki and Yamato (2001) showed that the core is consistent when the worth of a coalition of remaining players in reduced games is defined as its worth in the original game, and that this reduced game property characterizes the core in conjunction with individual rationality and a weak version of coalitional rationality. In fact, the results of Peleg (1986), Tadenuma (1992) and Funaki and Yamato (2001) are derived on the domain of balanced games, i.e., transferable utility games with a nonempty core. Nevertheless, the core is consistent on other domains as well. Peleg (1989) and Sudhölter and Peleg (2002) characterized the core using Davis–Maschler consistency on the subdomain of totally balanced games, i.e., transferable utility games with a nonempty core for each subgame. Hwang and Sudhölter (2001) presented a characterization of the core based on Davis–Maschler consistency on the domain of all transferable utility games which is also valid on several subdomains, e.g., totally balanced games, balanced games, and superadditive games. Recently, Hokari et al. (2020) studied consistency characterizations of the core on the domain of convex games. To our knowledge, the relation of the core with another well-known consistency axiom formulated by Hart and Mas-Colell (1989) has not been studied so far. This reduced game property was originally introduced for single-valued solutions and explored for the Shapley value (Shapley 1953). In the corresponding reduced game, the worth of a coalition of remaining players is defined as the monetary surplus to the leaving players when the solution is applied to the joint subgame. Dutta (1990) suggested an extension to multi-valued solutions in terms of selections, but explored it for Dutta–Ray’s single-valued egalitarian solution (Dutta and Ray 1989) on the domain of convex games, for which it boils down to the original definition. In this paper, we formally define Hart–Mas-Colell consistency and its converse for multi-valued solutions for transferable utility games on the basis of allocation schemes. We show that the core is the unique inclusion-wise maximal solution satisfying individual rationality and a weak version of Hart–Mas-Colell consistency on the domain of convex games and we derive a pure axiomatic characterization. Moreover, we characterize all nonempty solutions satisfying individual rationality, anonymity, scale covariance, superadditivity, weak Hart–Mas-Colell consistency, and converse Hart–Mas-Colell consistency. This family consists of (a) the Shapley value, (b) all homothetic images of the core with the Shapley value as center of homothety and with positive ratios of homothety not larger than one, and (c) their relative interiors. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides preliminary notions and notations. Section 3 formally introduces Hart–Mas-Colell consistency and its converse. Section 4 studies the core and Sect. 5 provides a joint characterization. Section 6 concludes.",1

(2021) point out that the adjusted proportional rule violates order preservation under claims variations. This property was wrongly used to prove the part of Theorem 1 according to which the adjusted proportional rule Lorenz dominates the minimal overlap rule. Mirás Calvo et al. (2021), moreover, provide an alternative proof of the disputed part of Theorem 1. The lemma below, however, establishes that the adjusted proportional rule satisfies a restricted version of order preservation under claims variations that allows a simple correction of our original proof. Let (c, E) be a claims problem with \(0\le c_1\le c_2 \le \cdots \le c_n\) and \(E\le C/2\). Let \(c'=(0,c_2,c_3,\ldots , c_n)\) and let \(i<j\). Then, Let \(C_n = c_1+c_2+\cdots +c_{n-1}\). We first consider a claims problem (c, E) with \(C_n<E\le c_n\). Then, only individual n has a positive minimal right. The adjusted proportional rule allocates this minimal right (equal to \(E-C_n\)) to individual n and uses the proportional rule to solve the revised problem \((c_1,c_2,\ldots ,c_{n-1},C_n;C_n)\). Consequently, Now, let (c, E) be a claims problem with \(E\le C/2\). We distinguish two cases. Case \((i): C_n < E\). Since \(2E\le C\), we have \(E<c_n\). Use (2) and obtain Consider \((c',E)\). Let \(C'_n=0+c_2+\cdots +c_{n-1}\). Since \(C'_n \le C_n <E\) and \(E< c_n\), we can use (2) and we obtain Hence, moving from (c, E) to \((c',E)\), the adjusted proportional rule shifts the amount \(c_1/2\) from individual 1 to individual n, and the inequalities in (1) are satisfied. Case \((ii): E \le C_n.\) No individual has a positive minimal right in (c, E). Let \({\bar{c}} =\) \(({\bar{c}}_1,{\bar{c}}_2,\ldots , {\bar{c}}_n)\) with \({\bar{c}}_i = \min \{c_i,E\}\) for each i. Then, \(A(c,E)=P({\bar{c}},E)\). We distinguish three cases. Case (ii, a): in \((c',E)\) no individual has a positive minimal right. Then, \(A(c',E)=P(\,{\bar{c}}',E)\) and the inequalities in (1) are satisfied. Case (ii, b): in \((c',E)\) only individual n has a positive minimal right. Then, \(C'_n < E\), and either \(E\le c_n\) or \(c_n<E\). In case \(E\le c_n\), we have \({\bar{c}}_n=E\) and \(A(c,E) = (E/(C_n+E))\times {\bar{c}}\) with \(E/(C_n+E)\le 1/2\). Next, use (2) and obtain The inequalities in (1) are satisfied. In case \(c_n\!<\!E\), we have \(A(c,E)=(E/C)\times c\) with \(E/C\le 1/2\). Furthermore, The factor of proportionality in the P-term in (3) is equal to \(C'_n/(2C'_n + c_n - E)> 1/2\). Again, the inequalities in (1) are satisfied. Case (ii, c): in \((c',E)\) two individuals have a positive minimal right. We claim that \(n=3\). Assume the contrary: let \(n\ge 4\) and let individuals n and \(n-1\) have positive minimal rights. Then, \(C'_n<E\) and \(C'-c_{n-1} < E\). Therefore, \(C\le C'_n + C' - c_{n-1} < 2E\). This conflicts with the assumption that \(C\ge 2E\) and our claim follows. Hence, we consider the claims problem \((c_1,c_2,c_3,E)\) with individuals 2 and 3 having positive minimal rights in \((0,c_2,c_3,E)\). Then \(c_3 < E\) and Since \(A(c_1,c_2,c_3,E)=(E/C)\times (c_1,c_2,c_3)\), the inequalities in (1) hold. \(\square\) We note that in case \(E>C/2\), the inequalities in (1) may be violated. The following example, in the spirit of Mirás Calvo et al. (2021), provides an illustration: Counter to the inequalities in (1), individual 2 gains more (loses less) than individual 3 when moving from claims problem (c, E) to \((c',E)\). We now formulate and prove the disputed part of Theorem 1. 
The adjusted proportional rule Lorenz dominates the minimal overlap rule.
 Let \(E\!\le \! C/2\). The original proof (pp. 802-803 (d) \(A\!\rightarrow \! MO\)) uses order preservation under claims variations in the final paragraph of Proposition 4 (p. 803) to compare claims problems of the form (c, E) and \((c',E)\) as defined in the above lemma. Hence, the full power of the property is not needed. The restricted version of order preservation under claims variations is sufficient for the original proof to hold. Next, if \(E>C/2\), then the adjusted proportional rule Lorenz dominates the Talmud rule, and the Talmud rule Lorenz dominates the minimal overlap rule (p. 805 (c), and p. 802 (d)). The transitivity of the Lorenz dominance relation entails that the adjusted proportional rule Lorenz dominates the minimal overlap rule. \(\square\)",

The seminal contributions studied the division of the liquidation value of a bankrupt firm among its creditors (O’Neill 1982; Aumann and Maschler 1985) and the distribution of a tax burden among citizens differing in their taxable incomes (Young 1987, 1988). The literature on the claims problem evaluates the allocation mechanisms, or rules, examining their normative and practical properties.Footnote 1 In this paper, we consider the following stability property: when a problem can be separated into smaller problems by fractioning individual claims and the endowment across these, the allocations recommended for the smaller problems should add up to the allocation recommended for the original problem. This additivity property is appealing from an accounting perspective, since it enables the allocation of a grand budget to be decentralized into area-specific budgets. When can a claims problem be separated? Upon closer inspection, separating arbitrary problems and then adding their solutions is unjustified. For instance, consider the distribution of a million euros among individuals A and B, each holding a claim of one million euros. Taken naively, additivity would allow us to separate this problem into two smaller problems. In the first problem, a million euros are to be distributed, A has a claim of a million euros, and B has a claim zero euros. In the second problem, zero euros are to be distributed, A has a claim of zero euros, and B has a claim of a million euros. The only overall solution to these problems involves A receiving one million euros. This particular separation is arbitrary, favouring A, and is, thus, incompatible with basic equity properties in the original problem. To overcome this pathological case, we only require additivity when the allocation recommended for each smaller problem is non-degenerate, assigning positive awards to each claimant. We identify the family of all rules satisfying this modified version of additivity property as well as “consistency” and “endowment monotonicity”. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the claims problem, notation, and defines the constrained equal losses rule and its asymmetric extensions. Section 3 discusses the axioms involved in our analysis and presents the main results. Section 4 contains the proofs. Section 5 concludes by discussing further corollaries of our results and a conjecture.",

Inaccurate claims, though perhaps advantageous in the short run, hurt an informed party’s ability to wield influence in the future by affecting the latter’s credibility, audience size, etc.In spite of that, one often observes (diametrically) different accounts of the same underlying facts. For example, the following two quotes, taken from articles published in November 2018 by, respectively, the New York Times and Fox Business, offer very different evaluations of the state of the U.S. economy in the preceding months. “Emerging signs of weakness in major economic sectors, including auto manufacturing, agriculture and home building, are prompting some forecasters to warn that one of the longest periods of economic growth in American history may be approaching the end of its run.”Footnote 1 
“U.S. employers added a better-than-expected 250,000 jobs in October, soaring past expectations for an increase of 190,000 jobs (...). The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent, the lowest rate in nearly 50 years, while the labor force participation rate increased to 62.9 percent from 62.7 percent during the month.
Footnote 2
 One potential driver of such divergence in the selection and interpretation of facts is that informed parties have an ideological agenda and wish to influence public opinion accordingly. In this paper, we investigate the competition between two biased senders for an audience, whose members switch their preferred source of information in proportion to the discrepancy between sources’ past messages and the revealed state. We propose a simple infinite horizon model that captures key features of the problem. Two biased and strategic senders face the public in every period. In each period, the state \(\omega _{t}\) is drawn anew from a fixed continuous distribution. The state is observed only by senders at the beginning of the period, while the public observes it by the end of the period with some probability. Each sender k has a fixed favoured state \(\omega ^{k}\) which may or may not be commonly known. After observing the state, each sender sends a period-t message \(m_{t}^{k}\). At the beginning of each period t, a share \(x_{t}^{k}\) of the market (audience) is held by sender k, and this share represents the fraction of the public that listens to him (i.e. trusts him, is loyal to him). Senders’ shares sum up to one in any given period, i.e. all members of the public are loyal to (exactly) one or the other media. Sender k’s period-t message affects his payoff through two channels; by influencing the beliefs of his current audience, and by affecting the size of his audience tomorrow. Formally, message \(m_{t}^{k}\) yields a period-t payoff to sender k which is a function of his audience share \(x_{t}^{k}\), the distance between \(m_{t}^{k}\) and his ideal state \(\omega ^{k}\), as well as his ideological commitment \(\lambda ^{k}\). His period-t payoff decreases in the weighted distance \(\lambda ^{k}(m_{t}^{k}-\omega ^{k})^{2}\) and it increases in \(x_{t}^{k}\). In other words, sender k prefers sending messages that are close to his ideal state and are received by a large audience. The simplest interpretation is that k’s audience naively takes k’s message at face value, so that the smaller the distance between \(m_{t}^{k}\) and \(\omega ^{k}\), the closer his audience’s belief to his ideal belief. The message \(m_{t}^{k}\) chosen by k at t also affects k’s expected audience tomorrow. At the end of t, the current state \(\omega _{t}\) becomes observable with some probability \(\gamma\) and, in this case, the public compares senders’ messages to the revealed truth. Then, at \(t+1\), each sender loses to his opponent a fraction of his audience that is increasing in the (square of the) size of his lie \((m_{t}^{k}-\omega _{t})^{2}\). In particular, if senders’ initial market shares are identical and both reports diverge equally from the truth, market shares stay put. One can think of electoral campaigns, where false claims by two opposing parties (candidates) cancel out. If instead only k lied, then l acquires a share from k while k acquires no share from l. Summarizing, senders’ incentives exhibit two key features. First, a sender faces a trade-off between advantageously moving the beliefs of his audience towards his ideal state by biasing his report, and ensuring a large audience tomorrow by reporting truthfully. Second, a sender benefits from his competitor’s lies as this yields an expected inflow of audience. Senders simultaneously choose their messages with the aim of maximizing the expected value of the discounted sum of their future payoffs. Each message \(m_{t}^{k}\) of sender k can depend on all information available up to the start of date t (including the realized state \(\omega _{t}\) and k’s audience \(x_{t}^{k}\)). The natural strategies to examine in this environment are Markov strategies, in which the period-t message can depend only on the current state and the current market audience. We construct a simple Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), in which sender k’s message at each date t is a convex combination of the current state and his favoured state, \(m_{t}^{k}=\) \(a^{k}\omega _{t}+\) \((1-a^{k})\omega ^{k}\). The truthfulness of k in any period is thus quantified by the constant \(a^{k}\) that depends neither on the state nor on k’s audience. In the extreme case of \(a^{k}=1\), sender k always reports truthfully, whereas if \(a^{k}=0\), he ignores the realized state and simply reports his ideal point. Moreover, we show that the identified strategy profile constitutes the unique MPE if we restrict the strategy sets of senders to Markov strategies that condition the period t message on the current state only. Our second set of findings regards the comparative statics of \(a^{k}\) w.r.t. the key parameters. For example, we find that the common discount factor \(\delta\) and the verification probability \(\gamma\) influence the reporting strategies asymmetrically through a function that captures the cost of lying. We consider also the effect of ideal states and the ideological commitments to these states by the two senders. We refer to \((\omega ^{k}-E[\omega ])^{2}\) as the ex-ante bias of k. Assuming identical ex ante biases (resp. ideological commitments), k is more truthful than l, i.e., \(a^{k}>a^{l}\), if and only if k is less ideologically committed (resp. ex ante biased) than l. Second, unilaterally increasing the ex-ante bias or ideological commitment of one player renders both strictly less truthful. Hence, \(a^{k}\) and \(a^{l}\) are both decreasing in the ex-ante bias and in the ideological commitment of any given sender l. For an intuition concerning the indirect impact on player k of increasing l’s lying, note that the latter reduces the expected cost of lying for k (in terms of lost audience), and thus incentivizes k to lie more as well. This in turn has a positive feedback effect on l’s lying incentive. We also find that, interestingly, the degree of polarization of sender preferences (as captured by the distance \(\left| \omega ^{k}-\omega ^{l}\right|\) separating their ideal states) is not a relevant quantity in determining the truthfulness of equilibrium communication. Rather, the key quantity is simply the sum of ex-ante biases. Finally, we also show that higher uncertainty negatively affects the accurateness of communication. In other words, \(a^{k}\) and \(a^{l}\) both decrease in \(Var(\omega )\).",
