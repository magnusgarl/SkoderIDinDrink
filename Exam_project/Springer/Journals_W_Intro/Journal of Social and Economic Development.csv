The problem that has been a matter of great concern in the crop fields is soil particle erosion, caused mainly by rain water in natural environment and through artificial irrigation and tillage in unlabeled or undulated sloppy fields. Unplanned use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides or insecticides is also making soil particles more prone to erosion. A vertical soil profile provides us the nature of vulnerability to soil erosion and agricultural production. The closer to upper surface (A-horizon) of soil which contains maximum organic matter is more favorable to plant growth compared to the next high-density lower layer (B-horizon), which is characterized by maximum accumulation of iron, aluminum oxides and silicate clays (Larson et al. 1983).With more and more tillage, the A-horizon gets mixed with the B-horizon and the soil becomes more prone to erosion with the reduction in infiltration and permeability rate, humus content, hydraulic conductivity and availability of plant nutrients (National soil erosion-soil productivity research planning committee 1981). One of the most dramatic technological revolutions in crop management is conservation or zero tillage. Conservation tillage (CT)Footnote 1 that leaves 30 % or more of crop residue on the soil surface can reduce erosion through wind and rainfall, increase water filtration, moisture retention and raise the level of organic matter in the top soil (Galloway et al. 1981; Dick and Daniel 1987; Edwards 1995). It covers a spectrum of non-inversion practices from zero-tillage to reduced tillage aiming to maximize soil infiltration and soil productivity, minimize water losses along with conservation of energy and labor (Rockström et al. 2003). CT along with few other popular alternatives like use of cover crops, extensive crop rotations and straw mulch have been packaged and promoted as Conservation Agriculture by Food and Agriculture Organization of UN (FAO) and European Conservation Agriculture Federation (ECAF). Their main goal is to make better use of agricultural resources through integrated management of available soil, water and biological resources (FAO 2001; Garcia-Torres et al. 2003). Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, scarce in both food and water, like Ghana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa and Zambia, have successfully used CT to increase crop production, reduce soil erosion and improve water conservation (Elwell 1993; Oldreive 1993). Areas at a high risk of erosion, such as the sloping land, land exposed to wind erosion and land with light-textured soils, which are more prone to erosion will get advantage from reduced tillage systems. Some crops like cereal grains, oil seeds and beans are better grown in CT system than corn or potatoes (Hofmann 2008).Footnote 2 A lot of studies are there regarding the diffusion of CT as a new production technology and the factors influencing the adoption of that technology (Pagoulatos et al. 1989; Uri 1997; Gray et al. 1996; Batte et al. 1993). It is also being rapidly adopted in the Indo-Gangetic plain of South Asia. Zero-tillage farming increases wheat yields through timely sowing and reduces production costs by up to 10 %. It reduces water use by about 1 million liters per hectare (a saving of 20–35 %), improves soil structure, fertility and biological properties and thereby proved now the most widely adopted resource-conserving technology in the region, especially in India with an estimation of 57 % return, based on an investment of $3.5 million during the year 2004 (World Dev. Report: Agriculture for Development 2008). Another related as well as significant problem that is associated with cultivation process is drought or water scarcity. According to International Rice Research Institute, drought causes massive disaster to 38 % of world area which is home to 70 % of world population and source of 70 % of food production.Footnote 3 CT can play an important role in drought management as well. Bosch et al. (2005) have observed in southeastern USA that in water-scarce regions (either due to lack of rain fall or lack of irrigation facilities), CT can be used as a soil management tool for cotton production on sandy and drought-prone soils. The plant residue remaining at the top surface from previous crops acts as vapor barrier against evaporative water loss thereby reducing raindrop impact energy, decreasing surface runoff and improving infiltration (Triplett et al. 1968). By improved infiltration, the plant-available water can be enhanced and irrigation requirements can be reduced. However, the main difficulty with this system is weed control alongside increased use of pesticide and nitrogen. Genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops, a product of modern plant biotechnology, may fruitfully be utilized in the crop residue management practices, especially in conservation tillage system. GM crops like herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybean and cotton and insect-resistant cotton and corn verities have environment-friendly traits.Footnote 4 They can facilitate CT program (i.e., no-till or low-till) by controlling weeds with use of selective herbicides and can reduce the consumption of pesticides as well (Crossan and Kennedy 2004; Tribe and Kalla 2005; Day 2006). According to Carpenter & Gianessi (1999), improvement in weed control with the use of herbicide-tolerant crops has contributed to the initial adoption and continuation of CT technology. Especially with the introduction of Roundup Ready soybeans, US acreage of no-tilled full-season soybeans grew by nearly 70 % between 1996 and 2008. A 2001 Survey of Canadian farmers who grow both GM and non-GM varieties of Canola has shown that 26 % of them have increased their usage of CT due to use of GM variety (Serecon Management Consulting Inc and Koch Paul Associates 2001). Moreover, it has been well documented in scientific literature that the root system architecture of the plant has an important role to provide anchorage in the soil Di Irio et al. 2005). The deep and voluminous root system ensures efficient utilization of scarce agricultural input (Vittal and Subbiah 1984). Thus, for effective utilization of conserved soil stocks, impetus has been given on plant root characters (Skaggs and Shouse 2008). Genetically modified crops have been developed to increase the branching density as well as deeper and more diffuse root systems (Quisenberry and McMichael 1996; Basal et al. 2003; Seiler 2008). Therefore, GM crops having longer and voluminous roots will be beneficial for binding and absorbing nutrient particles with the soil. For example, the gene Arabidopsis HARDY has the effect of increasing the water efficiency of rice plants by increasing the strength and amount of root structure of the plant. Moreover, a recently discovered gene, DRO1, has been observed to enhance the root depth of the plant, thereby making the plant more drought resistant (Uga et al. 2013). Wheat can also be genetically modified to have deeper roots by extending the vegetation period of the plant through selection for later-flowering genotypes. Deeper root systems promote more water uptake, which means the plants require less irrigation and perform better under drought conditions.Footnote 5 GM crops having this specific root structure would be needed in no-till farming in the situation if the conserved moisture and nutrients are in variable depths of the soil. The present paper introduces a new approach in the traditional soil management system of conservation tillage through the involvement of herbicide-tolerant GM crops with specific root characters, using a dynamic economic modeling, as soil management is a dynamic process. The pioneering contribution in the area of dynamic economic modeling of soil conservation is by Burt (1981) who applied dynamic optimization technique in the economics of soil conservation. Taylor et al. (1986), however, criticized Burt’s work as he did not consider the conservation tillage or other structural activities as decision variable in erosion control. McConnell (1983) formulated a theoretical model of optimal control to the derive the optimal inter-temporal path of soil use and suggested that in presence of an efficient capital market and equal private and social discount rate, the private inter-temporal path of soil use will converge to that of the society. McConnell’s work has been criticized on the ground that in presence of market imperfection or non-existence of market in developing countries or even in presence of perfect market the private and social discount rates may not be equal (Kiker and Lynne 1986). Walker (1982) formulated a damage function to evaluate the profitability of conservation tillage over the erosive activities of a single crop growing farmer and later incorporated the long-run cost of erosion in that function and also its empirical application to evaluate conservation tillage (Walker and Young 1986). Barrett (1991), LaFrance (1992), Clarke (1992) and Hu et al. (1997) extended McConnell’s model to examine whether the change in output or input price affect the farmer’s optimizing behavior for soil conservation. With the proposition that the rate of soil loss can be curbed by having a diversified production system (without mentioning criteria of choosing a crop in terms of any specific soil-conserving feature), Goetz (1997) have derived “the optimal private and social inter-temporal path of soil use” and the determined the optimum crop mix. A rather recent work of Lanoskhi et al. (2006) examines both theoretically and empirically the private profitability and social desirability of conventional tillage and no-till farming by taking into account crop yield, production cost and nutrients and herbicide run-off damages. The prominent empirical works showed (1) the implications of the of agricultural policies on land degradation and soil quality improvement from input–output data via a dynamic production model (Kim et al. 2000), (2) the role of sustainable agricultural practices with respect to soil conservation (Castano et al. 2005), (3) the need to incorporate the role of output diversification, land tenure, and human capital formation as effective instruments in increasing farm income, determined simultaneously by farmer’s decision to adopt soil conservation, while framing the investments in natural resource management projects by governments and multilateral development agencies (Bravo-Ureta et al. 2006), (4) the importance of the policies for efficient land-use and management through technology development (Pannell 2009). In the existing literature on the economics of soil conservation, the use of environment-friendly features of GM crop cultivation as part of output diversification has not been taken under consideration. In the present paper, it is assumed that farmers cultivate both GM and non-GM variety of different or of the same crop in specific situations. Such an assumption of coexistence of GM and non-GM crop is not an unrealistic one given the fact that the overall real world experience shows that GM crops have successfully coexisted with conventional and organic crops (Brookes 2004). Coexistence implies the economic consequences of adventitious presence
Footnote 6
of material from one crop in another and the principle that farmers should be able to cultivate freely the agricultural crops they choose, be it GM crops, conventional or organic crops (Timpo 2012). Different countries adopt different regulatory approaches for coexistence and segregation of GM and non-GM crops either through legislation or through providing proper guidelines to the farmers regarding cropping practices for maintaining the purity of non-GM crops which are grown in GM planting farms. North America, Spain, UK are probably the most successful examples where GM and non-GM crops have coexisted successfully with appropriate protective measures (Refer to Brookes and Barfoot (2003a, b, 2004a, b) for empirical evidence). Brookes (2004) has also shown that GM and non-GM crops (including organic) have successfully coexisted without causing any economic/marketing problem since GM crops were first grown commercially in 1995. The main motivation of the current paper is to investigate whether introduction of GM crops with conservation tillage and voluminous roots can help to reduce soil erosion and increase water/moisture content of soil in drought-prone areas. Applying Goetz’s model of crop diversification, we attempt to determine the optimum cropping pattern of a farmer who cultivates a mix of both GM and non-GM varieties of the same or different crops, highlighting the important role of the R&D investment in genetic modification as well as the soil-conserving features of GM crop. Though any specific area of operation is not mentioned here, this theoretical model is applicable to rain-fed and irrigated soils for both conservation and efficient use of conserved stock. However, we have ignored the cost of coexistence. The paper is structured as follows. “The economic model” and “Producer’s optimization” sections present the economic model and the producer’s optimization exercise, whereas “Stability analysis” and “Policy analyses” sections contain the stability and policy analyses, respectively. “Empirical validations” section contains empirical validation of the findings. The conclusion is in “Conclusions” section.",1

Mamgain,Shivakar Tiwari,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Accounting for a population of over 333.4 million in 2011, the youthFootnote 1 represent 27.5 % of the Indian population (GoI-RGI 2012). India is among the few countries having the advantage of being home to a relatively higher proportion of younger population. Across the world, every fifth youth is an Indian. This demographic dividend of a rising share of the working age population (15–59 years), which started in the early 1980s is likely to remain till 2025 (ILO 2013; Aiyar and Mody 2011). Such a huge proportion of a relatively young population in India is expected to add to both its economic growth and the consequent demand for goods and services (Bloom and Canning 2004; Aiyar and Mody 2011). However, this ‘demographic dividend’ can turn into a ‘demographic nightmare’ if opportunities are not created for the all-round development of the youth, including decent employment (Chandrasekhar et al. 2006). The information technology (IT) revolution and increasing use of social media have facilitated an unprecedented mobilisation of the youth to reflect on issues of their concerns (World Bank 2013a). Uprising in the Middle East, called the ‘Arab Spring’, and the voices criticising corruption and demanding clean governance in India are examples of mobilisation of the youth to bring about a change in the existing systems. The major issues that confront the youth include the high incidence of unemployment as well as underemployment, limited opportunities for remunerative jobs, low levels of education and skills, and the quest for identity and dignity (ILO 2013; FES 2012; Mitra and Verick 2013). All this applies to India as well. The youth suffer disproportionately more than others from slow growth in employment opportunities and during economic slowdown (ILO 2013). Moreover, the growth process in India has also resulted in rising inequality in incomes and human capital formations, which, in turn, has caused significant disparities across various social groups and regions (Planning Commission 2013). The marginalised sections of the population, such as Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs) still remain at the bottom of the social hierarchy in terms of various socio-economic indicators of development (Mamgain 2013). Much of their slow development is increasingly being attributed to social exclusion and discrimination which they continue to face in their daily lives in various forms (World Bank 2013b; Thorat and Newman 2010). Growing mismatches in the demand and supply of education and skills is yet another dimension that affects the overall employability of youth in India and several other countries as well (ILO 2010; Chadha 2000; Mamgain 2010). While on the one hand, employers complain against shortages of skilled manpower that pose hurdles in their expansion (India Skills Report 2014; ILO 2013), on the other hand, there is a very high rate of unemployment among educated youth, particularly women (Dev and Venkatanarayana 2011). Employers find a large number of job-seekers unemployable due to insufficient exposure of the latter to practical aspects of education. Given this brief background, we examine the questions of unemployment, employment and human capital formation of Indian youth belonging to various social and religious groups across different regions since the advent of economic reforms in the early 1990s. The second section of the paper examines the pattern of participation of youths in the labour force. Section III analyses the nature and pattern of employment among youth with a focus on its quality. Section IV analyses the situation of unemployment among the youth. Section V examines the human capital base of the youth population and its quality and shows how a large section of the youth is still characterised by low levels of educational attainment and skill training. The determinants of youth employment are discussed in Section VI, while the policy implications are discussed in the concluding section. The paper is based on National Sample Survey Organisation’s (NSSO) large sample unit level data on ‘Employment and Unemployment’ for the years 1993–1994, 2004–2005 and 2011–2012, highlighting the post-economic reform scenario with regard to youth employment in India. The data pertain to usual activity status (UPSS) of persons.Footnote 2 The analyses in the paper have been presented across the following five socio-religious groups: (1) Scheduled Tribes (STs), (2) Scheduled Castes (SCs), (3) Other Backward Caste-Muslims (OBC-Muslim), (4) Other Backward Caste-Others (OBC-Other), (5) Other Caste-Muslims (OC-Muslims) and (6) Others (OCs). The OCs include Hindu, Christian, Jain and Buddhists excluding first five categories of Indian population. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the situations pertaining to youths belonging to various socio-religious groups and the inter-group disparities among them.",5

Globalization leads to structural change in the economy and contributes to economic growth. It often affects the environment in ways similar to the impact of economic growth on the environment. This highlights a clear relationship between globalization, economic growth and environmental damage. One of the defining features of globalization is trade liberalization that globally eliminates quantitative restrictions on trade among countries. However, trade liberalization comes with its own set of environmental costs, the extent of which depends on many factors including the nature of pollution, i.e., whether it is local, transboundary or global. It also depends on whether the country, which liberalizes trade, is a ‘clean’ country or ‘dirty’ country (Fung and Maechler 2007). In the context of trade liberalization, the export of ‘dirty industries’ from developed countries to developing countries due to their weak environmental standards leads to environmental degradation (Aggarwal 2006). There are conflicting evidences as to the exact environmental impact resulting from trade liberalization as many empirical studies have shown that trade liberalization leads to a decrease in the rate of environmental degradation in the global level (Peridy 2006) and country level, particularly in developing countries (Alam 2010; Kyophilavong 2011; Strutt and Anderson 2000; Verburg et al. 2009; Yang 2001a, b). Like the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand, Malaysia is a relatively open economy. It has been a member of the WTO since 1957 and participated in the Uruguay Round. One of the conditions of Malaysia, as a member of WTO, is the reduction in tariffs and non-tariff barriers on environmental goods and services. Moreover, the rapid development in Malaysia, which has been associated with trade liberalization, has produced various environmental problems. Malaysia’s rapid economic success has included a high consumption of domestic and imported energies along with rising environmental degradation. This environmental degradation includes the pollution of water, air systems and ground. The environmental degradation might not all have a monetary cost; it may also lead to some benefits for the economy such as economic growth (Murad et al. 2009; Shen 2008). Malaysia must therefore be aware of the environmental problems from trade liberalization and regard the relationship between trade and environmental policies, a major concern in the designing of development strategies. As the third largest economy in Southeast Asia, Malaysia is also the third largest CO2 emitter among ASEANFootnote 1 countries. This level of greenhouse gas presents the important contemporary challenge to contain the growth in pollution. As a result, questions have arisen regarding the possible impact of trade liberalization on pollution given that a major concern of trade liberalization is that it may help accelerate environmental degradation in developing countries, due to less stringent standards. However, the recent report on annual average concentration of air pollution from industries shows a decline in pollution of some air pollutants, such as NO2, SO2 and CO (see 2014 Malaysia environmental quality report). During the same period, Malaysia import tariffs declined. These concurrent trends have led to conclude that trade liberalization may cause the shift in Malaysia industries to clean industries. Therefore, these issues raise the importance of investigation of whether the trade liberalization in Malaysia increases the level of more global pollutants compared to the emission level of more local pollutants. Unfortunately, this area has been largely ignored by researchers, especially the issue of employing actual tariff reforms in the Malaysian context (See Ivanova and Angeles 2006; Ali 2009; Murad et al. 2009 for details). Since the linkage between trade liberalization and the environment, in recent years, has become a significant policy issue, the current study investigates whether further trade liberalization will raise the Malaysia’s pollution more. The core objective of the study is to analyze the economic and environmental impact of trade liberalization in Malaysia. In comparison with the previous studies on the effects of trade liberalization on the Malaysian environment, the current study uses a comprehensive method, a computable general equilibrium model, to analyze the economic and environmental impact of trade liberalization in Malaysia. We analyze the impacts of a decrease in import tariffs on key indicators such as output, household consumption, employment, investment, imports and exports, energy consumption and emission of 5 air pollutants, namely particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO
x
), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). We conducted simulations related to a decrease in tariff reforms and performed sensitivity analyses on the results with regards of the values of behavioral parameters. The paper is structured in the following order. Section 2 overviews the economic and environmental conditions of Malaysia. Section 3 presents a brief review of associated literature. Methodology, data and the experimental design are detailed in Sect. 4. Section 5 analyses the economic, poverty and environmental impacts of trade liberalization on Malaysia, while Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",5
18,1,Journal of Social and Economic Development,04 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-016-0022-y,Regional disparity in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar: a disaggregated level analysis,October 2016,Reena Kumari,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Regional economists have long been concerned with uneven regional development or investigating the issue of why the process of economic growth does not lead to similar levels of prosperity, employment and welfare across space. It is also a matter of debate whether inequality is positively or negatively related to the level and pace of development—with the rate of development picking up, the regions with better pull-off capacity tend to develop at a faster pace, while the lagging regions lag further behind. In this context, many studies highlighted the relationship between per capita income and economic development and introduced as inverted ‘U’ hypothesises (Kuznets 1955; Williamson 1965) that as development process starts it increases disparity, but after a growth stage disparity decreases. Solow (1956) first proposed the convergence thesis that economic growth leads to convergence, i.e. as economic growth takes place, different geographical areas move closer to each other. Solow’s idea of convergence was further empirically tested by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) in their pioneering study using a variety of data sets that include a large cross-section of 110 sub-samples of countries. The empirical study reflected that during the 1980s, except for the large cross-section of countries, there was strong evidence of σ-convergence (the dispersion of the real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) levels of nations tended to decrease over time) and absolute β-convergence (poor economies growing faster than rich ones). A number of studies advocated that ‘growth intensifies regional disparity’ and tried to identify the driving forces and facts behind the widening disparity. At the same time, theoretical studies also tried to find out that how development progresses across regions affect the gap in two regions (backward and forward regions). Myrdal (1957) explained the impact of the growing region on the rest of the economy with the help of two opposite kinds of forces: backward and spread effects. The former refers to all adverse effects such as movement of labours, capital and trade from the backward regions to developed ones as development takes place. Hirschman (1959) with the model of forward and backward linkage discussed the nature of modern development that causes disparity across regions. The best-known regional/spatial manifestation of this approach is Lipton’s ‘urban-bias’ thesis (Lipton 1977), in which he argues that the natural advantages of metropolitan regions are heightened by a series of policies concerning the exchange rate—making the import of industrial machinery cheaper and the export of agricultural commodities dearer—trade, food pricing, etc., and jointly creating urban and metropolitan bias. The dependency theorists (Baran 1957; Frank 1967; Timberlake 1987) have also argued that the spatial impress of modernisation is manifested in deepening class polarisation and geographical inequality. The dependent periphery state (elite) assists the capital owners from the developed core to extract surplus, and the underdevelopment of the regional and international periphery is a necessary condition for the development of the core. The development of the centre at the cost of the periphery occupies a significant place. Lipton and Michael (1982) identified urban biases in the development approaches as the main factor in widening regional disparities. They argued that industrially advanced nations and regions of the world developed and consumed at the cost of resources and surpluses exploited from many developing and underdeveloped nations and regions. Apart from the theoretical debate on regional disparity relating to the centre exploiting the periphery or the capitalist nations exploiting the poor nations or capitalist economies ultimately converging, there are lots of empirical work that emphasises the evidence of regional development at a cross-country level, national level, state level and intra-state level. The empirical works related to disparity are those that in general attempted to measure the extent of disparity across regions and also test how disparities have evolved or evolve with the passage of time in different nations. What is more regrettable or distressful is the widening of inter-state inequality in recent years where the richest states in the country in general have grown faster than the poor states (Ahluwalia 2000; Dev and Ravi 2007; Bhattacharya and Sakthivel 2004). A number of approaches have tested the convergence hypothesis in India during the reform period at the state level—we have the works of Dholakia (1994), Cashin and Sahay (1996) and Nagaraj et al. (1998, 2000), and a few others have tested conditional and absolute convergence by including a number of alternative variables and have observed that there has been conditional convergence for the Indian states. Bajpai et al. 1996, Aiyar 2001, Singh et al. 2003 and Das and Barua 1996 have claimed that there has been a divergence between states in the post-independence era. A large extent of studies have analysed district-wise disparity not only in terms of income, but also in social and human development perspectives (Chaudhary 1992; Manna 1998; Bhattacharya 1998; Dubey 2009; Gupta 2010; Chakravorty 2009). Many studies have been carried out in recent times on the trends of poverty, inequality and level of living in Indian states during the post-reform decades. Among them, some have highlighted the reduction in poverty (Mahendradev 1987; Sundaram and Tendulkar 2003; Bhanumurthy and Mitra 2004; Sengupta et al. 2008; Kannan and Raveendran 2011), while some others have expressed anguish over the rising economic inequality (Deaton and Drez 2002; Sen and Himansu 2004; Krishna 2004; Bakshi et al. 2015) and dealt with the disparity at state level and sector-wise (Himansu 2010; Chattopadhyay and Maithi 1993; Thorat 2010). Many studies have identified the problem of uneven development of India’s bigger states and suggested suitable interventions to handle unevenness. They argue that some states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat are growing by 7–10 %, others, particularly Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar, have lagged behind (Dreze and Gazdar 2006; Parker and Kozel 2007; Shand and Bhide 2000; Raychaudhuri and Haldar 2009). In growth pattern, they are the least developed and are categorised as low economic performers (Ahluwalia 2001), though recently Bihar’s economy has made a remarkable improvement that can be seen from Table 1. The average annual growth rate of Bihar is the highest (13 %) among the all states with the highest poverty ratio (33.7 %). At the same time, UP and Bihar account for two-fourths of the nation’s population. Per capita state domestic product is as low as Rs. 25,263 in Bihar and Rs. 33,872 in UP, much less than the national average of Rs. 68,418 in 2012–2013. Bihar’s per capita state domestic product is less than one-fourth of Maharashtra’s (Rs. 100,909). To design appropriate policies and strategies for accelerating economic and social development in UP and Bihar, it is imperative to identify the level of development of different districts in which wide disparity has persisted in different socio-economic parameters. While enormous efforts have been made to document the diverse patterns of economic growth in India (Ghosh 2008; Parker and Kozel 2007), little systematic works have been done to understand the different growth patterns within the state at the disaggregated level. The focus has often been on micro-issues, overlooking the broader structural and policy matters that shape the patterns of development (Thakur et al. 2000), while economic research has produced a little analysis on the cause and factors of regional inequality at the disaggregated level or district level for the destitute of deprived regions of the nation, i.e. UP and Bihar. The situation of Bihar is contextualised in terms of core-periphery mapping, conceptualised by Myrdal most appropriately in the politico-economic perspective of regional development and disparity to distinguish between advanced and backward regions, where the core develops at the cost of periphery that is left impoverished (Bhattacharya 2009; Gupta and Ghosh 2009). This notion is further intensified in the context of UP where law and order, share of non-farm income and health indicators found to be significant factors influenced the level of development at the district level (Kumari 2014). Diwakar (2009) analysed dimensions of intra-regional disparities, inequality and deprivation in the poorest households of UP, while Tsujita et al. (2010a, b) examined wide and glaring disparities at grass root level in Bihar. The findings of disparity and inequality at district or regional level have been contested by many studies in the form of different development indicators, for instance, per capita income (Patnaik and Chattopadhyay 1975; Shastri 1988; Patel 1991; Suryanarayana 2009) and social sector (Reddy and Rao 2003; McDougal 2000; Debapriya and Mohanty 2008; Ahmad and Shamim 1998; Chakravorty 2009; Bhattacharya 2009; Kalaiyarasan 2014), while others have tried to measure disparity in overall indicators (Iyenger and Sudershan 1982; Debroy and Bhandari 2003; Shaban and Bhole 1999). However, studies related to disparity for UP and Bihar are not only scant but also have not dealt with disparity by using several indicators. This paper tries to fill the gap in the economic literature, by expanding the discussion on disparity beyond income and social sector to a different dimension overall. This paper identifies the poorest pockets of districts or regions that are spread across the two adjoining states and have low levels of economic development. UP and Bihar are the two states that have lots in common in a number of parameters, i.e. both are basically agrarian economy, huge resource base and marred by caste conflict and have linguistic similarity and political indifference. In this context, the issue of regional disparity in these two and the most populous states of India assumes critical importance. First, although the political subdivision of the state is generally considered to be the appropriate unit representing a region, yet, UP, with 199 million people, is large enough to become the sixth largest country in the world; Bihar, with about 108 million people (Census of India 2011), would also be among the largest country in the world—larger than any nation in Africa with the exception of Nigeria. Second, these two states are closely linked and have lot in common. Besides the demographic features, the states are similar in availability of natural resources, historical antecedent, agricultural background, climatic conditions, etc. Both fall in the highly fertile region of the Indo-Gangetic plain. They have poor human resource base and poor infrastructure; low levels of living and lack of enterprise; misallocation of public resources; deficiencies in administration; and weaker bargaining power. The states have a number of territorial entities with definite identities superimposed on a formidable hierarchy of castes. They share the similar non-responsive, non-committed and apathetic governance, inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy, unassuming and unconcerned intelligentsia and caste feuds, social tensions and law and order problem. Apart from their economic stagnation, their cultural insularity accounts for the dichotomy of their split personality. Third, an important cause of regional tensions which lead to popular agitations and at the same time militant activities is wide regional disparities which exist. The creation of some of the states in the past was in the wake of popular agitations based on perceived neglect of certain backward regions in some of the bigger states which were politically dominant. The political boundaries of states in India were carved out on linguistic basis (which was thought to also represent economic peculiarities to a reasonable extent), but for UP and Bihar this was not the dominant factor. Thus, as the two states came up, they had regions which were similar but located across states and regions vastly different, but put in the same state. It would be worthwhile to note that a number of districts within a state, while they vary from other districts of the state, are similar to some districts of adjoining states. If this is the case, the central planning body needs to identify similar districts across the states and devise a similar set of policy intervention for these, i.e. planning at sub-state level can be theoretically and practically used. In this context, a set of questions have been pointed out as follows: what is the extent of disparity and how different districts of the two states have performed in economic and social sector over a period of time? Why for two states with lot of commonalities extent of disparities differs? How is a disparity destabilising the two economies and what policy measures could be implemented to do away with such disparities in future? These are the issues that the proposed study seeks to address. The first step in this process is, however, to find out pockets or a cluster of districts spread across geographically close space between different states. Thus, UP and Bihar poses a serious development challenge not only for India, but also for the global community because India’s achievement of millennium development goals (MDGs) will be difficult unless disparity is reduced substantially in these two states (Rasul and Sharma 2014). The rest of the paper is organised as follows: in section two, we describe methodology and database. Inter-district disparity in UP and Bihar has been examined in section three and four, respectively. Section five is focused to find clusters of districts of regions which have a great degree of similarity within and dissimilarity between clusters. Conclusion and policy implications are stated in the last section.",12

To achieve the most rapid rehabilitation and to bring back the economy to working conditions, the first post-war governments made a wide use of policy instruments so as to regulate the pattern of resource use according to the most pressing socio-economic priorities. The policy instruments used at this time by most governments included the elaboration and implementation of centralised macroeconomic development plans. The most significant problem that appeared in the process of planning was to cope with socio-economic and environmental disparities which already existed in their territory or developed and exacerbated as a consequence of the implementation of development plans. To deal with these problems, regional policies and regional planning received a tremendous interest, which was mostly followed through national development plans. Indeed, they mainly attempted to set off this shortage of the conventional national planning system. In Iran, similar to the majority of developing countries, planning for development started after the Second World War. Since then, ten development plans have been implemented, and the planning initiatives may be divided into two periods: the pre-revolution period (1949–1978) and the post-revolution period (since 1979). During the pre-revolutionary era, there were five plans. The implementation of the Sixth Plan was interrupted by the episode of the Islamic Revolution. During the post-revolution period, after a plan holiday (1979–1988) five plans were formally implemented (1989–2014). The fourth and fifth plans were mostly coincided with the presidency of Ahmadinejhad, who immediately dissolved the Organisation of Plan and Budget and made a great attempt to reorganise the country’s planning administration and to intervene in the content and implementation of the plans. These developments had several consequences. First, as some senior officials and experts stated (Mardokhi 2014), due to the government’s unethical initiatives, in practice the Fourth came to a standstill, in the sense that what have been done was totally different from the plan’s provisions and projections. Similarly, the Fifth plan cannot be seen as a conventional planning. Its main concern was to focus on cultural concepts such as proposing a conceptually vague model of the Islamic–Iranian development, rather than paying attention on the country’s actual and fundamental development issues such as differences in regional development. Second, owing to the reorganisation of the country’s planning administration as well as the government’s higher tendency to show that its initiatives in the process of designing and implementing the plans were successful, most reports and data concerned to the plans’ evaluations, if any, are neither accessible nor reliable. Hence, the Fourth and Fifth plans are not included in this study. In general, due to the existence of regional disparities, regional policies and planning have been a major plank of the country’s development plans. In fact, Iran is one of the few among the developing countries, where the problems of attainment of balanced development and regional equality have been a major development concern and an explicit policy objective, since the introduction of the planning process in 1949. As a consequence, regional planning in all development plans both in their national contexts and for individual regions has been greatly emphasised. The objective of this paper is twofold: (a) to study the status and nature of regional policies, particularly in relation to the conformity between these policies and the country’s existing planning system and (b) to examine the extent to which this objective has been achieved. Taking into account that regional problems and planning are subject to continuing changes regarding the context in which a particular regional policy assumes significance, it intends to seek out how regional policies in Iran have changed from time to time to cope with the regional inequality problem in the country. In order to scrutinise these points, this paper is divided in four parts. The first part briefly discusses conceptual dimensions and dominant patterns in the literature of regional planning. The second part examines the main characteristics of the pre-revolutionary development plans, with respect to their dominant approaches and goals pertaining to regional planning. The third part, similarly, discusses major features of the post-revolutionary plans in relation to regional planning. The final part draws conclusions and evaluates the plans for possible policy outcomes.",2

It is worth understanding why in a competitive scenario, the contribution of manufacturing sector to the total industrial employment has almost stabilized from 11 to 11.4% in 1999–2012. Many economists have confirmed the period from 2005–2010 to be a jobless phase of manufacturing with declining industrial employment, 12.2% in 2004–2005—11.4% 2012. This joblessness is even more caustic given the fact that India homes the most number of jobless people in the world, while, being shining, with 8–9% GDP growth rate, 1999–2012 (Economic Survey 2012). A preliminary investigation shows Indian manufacturing sector has concentratedFootnote 1 more than 60%Footnote 2 in terms of market share, from 1999 to 2013 and it is currently heavily dominated by the top four firms. In 2008, the top four firms in chemical and consumer goods industry collectively owned 68 and 40% of the market share up from 38 and 21% in 1999, respectively (Chaudhari 2008). A few firms are growing very rapidly in size, and they hold substantial amount of capital required for output and economic growth. This trend seems to have favoured our economic growth in the recent decade where our growth average was 6–6.5%. While on the other hand, ‘Joblessness’ in the manufacturing sector is on its peak (Papola 2012). The growth of three million manufacturing jobs from 2001 to 2012 has been fuelled by the use of contract labour in organized manufacturing which increased from about 1.21 million in 2000–2001 to about 3.40 million in 2011–2012 (Annual Survey of Industries 2012). The share of contract workers in manufacturing as a whole has increased rapidly from 20.28% in 2000–2001 to 34.63% while the growth of regular employment has almost stagnated. Higher use of contract labour is not a welcome development as a wide gulf has emerged between the wage levels of contract employees and workmen of principal employers, doing the same or similar work, thus propelling economic inequality. According to Labour Bureau data, contract workers in the organized sector (ASI units) were paid on an average about 70.98% of the wages of directly employed workers per workday worked during the period 2008–2009 to 2011–2012. According to the labour ministry’s 27th Quarterly Employment Survey of eight employment-intensive industries (Textiles, Leather, Metals, Automobiles, Gems & Jewellery, Transport, IT/BPO and Handloom/Powerloom)—there were 43,000 job losses in the first quarter of FY 2015–2016.",

The urban population in this region grew by 130 million between 2001 and 2011, and it is expected to increase by 250 million more in the next 15 years (Ellis and Roberts 2016). On the global level, the UN projection indicates that the world’s urban population will grow by more than a billion between 2010 and 2025 (United Nation 2008). Rapid growth of urban population means an increasing demand for food especially high-value crops as well as land for expansion of basic infrastructure that ultimately affects the rural–urban fringe areas (Aguilar 2008). As urban space expands, the rural–urban frontier experiences new challenges like reduction in landholding size, increase in wage rate and difficulty in access to natural resources. The land use for agricultural purposes has been declining due to urbanisation along with infrastructure expansion and high population growth (Sharma 2015; Kalamkar 2009). For example, in India the area under for non-agricultural purposes, mainly for housing, infrastructure and industry has increased from 21.3 million ha in 1991–1992 to 26.3 million ha in 2011–2012 (23% increase) (GOI 2015), while a total of 3.16 million ha agricultural land was lost. In addition, land fragmentation and declining landholdings along with low levels of technology have kept agricultural productivity at low levels. Simultaneously, the share of consumers (not producing food) is likely to increase while the number of producers will decline (Satterthwaite et al. 2010a, b). As a result, the gap between demand and supply of food may increase, pushing food prices higher. High food prices have a negative impact on the livelihoods of rural as well as urban poor and increasing hunger and deprivation. The demand for high-value products like milk, meat, egg, fish and fruits has been increasing due to urbanisation accompanied with high income growth (Delgado et al. 1999), and on the other hand, the demand for labour has also been increasing. Acharya and Mitra (2000) argued that due to high demand for labour from urban space, the wage rate in rural sector is rising over the years. The high wage rate induces mechanisation to address the labour problem. For example, the use of technologies like combine harvester or thresher has been increasing considerably to save labour costs during harvesting. On the other hand, there has been declining the use of animal power for land preparation. Thus, there has been a change in the interdependence between crop–livestock farming system as well as livelihood dependency. It calls for an attention to inspect the interdependency between crop–livestock that dominates in South Asia.Footnote 1 Two-thirds of the rural population in this region depend on mixed-farming systems for their livelihood despite an emerging trend towards more specialised forms of farming. The importance of this mixed-farming system is also increasing as global demand for animal products especially milk, meat and egg is on the rise due to increasing incomes. For example, this farming system contributes 90% of milk and 70% of ruminant meat to the total world output (Costales et al. 2007). It is being argued that smallholder livestock operations will continue to be an important part of the milk and meat supply chain and contribute significantly to the food supply in the developing world for the coming years, despite the trend towards specialised as well as intensive livestock production (Thornton 2010; Costales et al. 2007). Mixed-farming systems contain several subsystems including crop, livestock and sometimes fish. The synergetic interactions have a greater total effect than the sum of individual effects on total farm income (Edwards et al. 1988). Combined production also helps farmers to mitigate risks including climate variability, as it provides a greater number of options (crop, livestock and fish). Thus, the ecological and economic sustainability of this farming system is achieved by the synergetic interactions between the resources like land, water, crops and livestock. In an integrated farming system, crops and livestock interact to create a synergy, with recycling allowing the maximum use of available resources. In South Asia, while the crop component provides feed (grain and residues) to the animals, the livestock component supplies manure which enhances agricultural productivity by supplying nutrients that improve soil fertility while reducing the use of chemical fertilisers. Also, fodder crops might improve soil fertility besides producing feed for livestock and animal power for land preparation. Beyond physical relationships, livestock ownership is considered an important savings option as well as an important source of cash income that enables farmers to purchase agricultural inputs, food and other goods and services (Christiaensen et al. 1995; Fafchamps et al. 1998; Moll 2005). Obviously, crop–livestock farming systems have both advantages and disadvantages. For instance, farmers have to divide their attention and allocate resources over several activities. This may reduce the economies of scale and reduce the profit per hectare as it limits specialisation and allows less concentration on the most profitable activity. The benefits and interactions between crop and livestock vary over time and intensification level. At low levels of population density, the interaction between crop and livestock production is often low because land is abundant. With growing population, the system generally moves towards intensification (and increased interactions) due to changes in relative factor prices and preferences (Valbuena et al. 2012). Then specialisation sets in with increased market integration and greater requirements of knowledge and capital. The farming systems in South Asia have undergone an evolutionary process that has developed as a response to economic and environmental dictates, especially food shortages, un-economic land holding sizes, rainfall, urbanisation, farm intensification and population growth. These farming systems are facing challenges and constraints like modern technology, input and output markets and capital requirements along with competing demands for natural resources. The situation is becoming worse due to increasing climate variability and growing population. Urbanisation along with population growth in these countries has brought significant change in land utilisation patterns. Land converted to urban uses is increasing while reducing the crop land (Kalamkar 2009; Sharma 2015). Demand for land, included for urban development, has led to privatisation and cultivation of rangelands. The reduction in grazing available for livestock has led to increased demand for agricultural by-products such as crop residues and greater interdependency between crops and livestock. On the other hand, increased food demand calls for specialisation in farming involving a high use of agrochemicals, as well as a focus on mono-cropping and mechanisation. Urbanisation provides a number of opportunities to those who move to cities and as well as to those who stay in rural areas. People who migrate to urban spaces have better employment, housing and education opportunities, while people remaining in rural area have better access to modern knowledge and technologies as well as a ready market for their agricultural products and access to non-farm income. This paper attempts to explore the impact of urbanisation on crop and livestock farming systems in the changing economic space and the livelihood impacts of these changes in South Asia. Urbanisation affects the rural economy in various ways like increasing demand for crop and livestock products, increasing land prices, enhancing non-farm income and improving access to input and output markets. Bhagat (2015) argued that urban centres provide vital links to the rural areas and are instrumental in rural development. This paper analyses the differentiation in income share, use of livestock by-products for crop production, crop by-products for livestock production and future strategies for livelihood improvement in the study area. The study is based on a trans-regional household-level survey in three regions across India and Bangladesh. It does not claim to have discovered full answers to what are the impacts of urbanisation on crop–livestock farming systems in India and Bangladesh. However, it does offer a window for partial understanding of the changes in farming systems due to urbanisation in South Asia that induce migration (seasonal or permanent) to district/state headquarters or megacities. The paper presents a descriptive and comparative analysis of diverse crop–livestock farming systems across three sites in terms of farming system, importance of crop residues (CR) in livestock feeding, importance of manure for soil fertility, contribution of crops and livestock in total household income and future strategies to livelihood improvement in different urban set-ups. Households income (farm, non-farm income, remittances and own business) was calculated to assess the importance of crop and livestock income in respect to urbanisation. The paper is divided into five sections including the present one. Section two discusses the development of crop–livestock farming systems in India and Bangladesh and relates to urbanisation. Section three discusses the sampling methods used for primary data collection and the methodology used for analysis. Section four interprets and discusses the results while section five concludes.",12

The literature on trade and growth theories suggests a number of channels through which trade may affect an economy’s economic performance. The seminal work by Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991) emphasize the role of endogenous growth in the presence of R&D investments in examining the relationship between trade and growth. There is another strand of literature which talks about the export-led-productivity hypothesis (Bonelli 1992; Haddad et al. 1996; Weinhold and Rauch 1997; Yean 1997; and Sjoeholm 1999). This hypothesis explained that firms use to learn advanced technologies via exports and implement them to compete in the foreign market (Balassa 1978; Krueger 1980; Nishimizu and Robinson 1982). Besides trade itself, some authors argue that composition of trade might also be important for economic performance (Amable 2000; Crespo-Cuaresma and Worz 2005; Hausmann et al. 2007a, b; and Bagci 2010). Although standard international trade theory postulates that specialization helps countries to gain from trade through comparative advantages, the acceleration of global trade in recent years has seen patterns of trade vastly differing from those predicted by classical trade theories built around perfect competition, comparative advantage and constant returns to scale (Krugman 1980). In the literature, it has also been argued that poor countries grow faster than the rich countries, it is important to modify the composition of their exports (Prebisch–Singer Hypothesis). Similarly, Redding (1999) argues that a country may face a trade-off between specializing in the existing products that country produces and entering in sectors where it lacks a comparative advantage, since in the second case a country may acquire an advantage as a result of the potential for productivity growth. Therefore, to attain higher productivity growth, an economy requires diversifying its export basket. In recent years, export diversification has become one of the important economic issues for maintaining high and sustainable growth particularly for developing countries. This is because of three reasons first, a diversified bundle of export products protects a country against frequent price variation in the global commodity markets and shocks in specific product markets (Bertinelli et al. 2006; Levchenko and di Giovanni 2010). Second, expansion of production basket resulting from exports reduces unit production prices and eventually increases productivity and economic growth (Helpman and Krugman 1986; Hausmann et al. 2007a, b; Bagci 2010; Cadot et al. 2011; Hammouda et al. 2010). Third, further study by Hatemi-j and Irandous (2001) argue that the export diversification lead to improving the skill and technology, which further increase the total factor productivity growth either through learning by doing or through technical efficiency. They claim that export diversification is an integral part of productivity growth and justifies the reduction of trade barriers to facilitate export as potential sources of productivity growth in the context of Germany, Italy, Sweden France, and UK. Unsurprisingly, there have been large number of studies which examine the impact of export diversification on the economic growth (Lederman and Maloney 2007; Hesse 2008; Cadot et al. 2011; Minondo 2011; Parteka and Tamberi 2013; Poncet and de Waldemar 2013). From the export perspective, diversification has been analyzed as a factor reducing risk and exposure to idiosyncratic shocks (Hesse 2008). Cadot et al. (2011) examine the evolution of export diversification patterns along with economic development path for 156 countries and they found a hump-shaped pattern of export diversification. Literature has also shown that the export diversification prevents the instability in export prices of the commodities and help to reduce the fluctuation in reducing economic growth. Export instability in most of the Less Developed Countries (LDCs) is shown as a consequence of higher sectoral and geographic concentration which would eventually affect the overall growth process. There are few empirical studies which found that not only the level of export affects economic growth but also the diversification of exports that matters in boosting the productivity growth (Bagci 2010; Hammouda et al. 2010). Apart from export diversification, many studies used human capital which considered as a factors with export diversification of TFP (Berthélemy and Chauvin 2000; Hatemi-j and Irandous 2001; Tahari et al. 2004; Herzer and Nowak-Lehmann 2006; Naude and Rossouw 2008; Hesse 2008; Hammouda et al. 2010; Cadot et al. 2011; Parteka and Tamberi 2013; Hamed et al. 2014). Although the bulk of the studies focuses on examining the impact of export diversification on economic growth, there are hardly any studies except Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997) and Hammouda et al. (2010) which systematically examine the linkage between export diversification and TFP growth. Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997) agues that “given countries’ production patterns, low bilateral trade costs lead to greater export diversification which consequently leads to productivity growth.” Hammouda et al. (2010) found that export diversification has a significant positive impact on total factor productivity growth and the contribution of TFP growth to output growth are high in case of countries which come under more diversified regimes. The present study differs from the earlier literature in threefold. First, though there are abundant literature relating trade diversification and economic growth, only a few studies that emphasize on the potential impact of export diversification on TFP growth. The South Asian region is considered to be one of the high population growths with increased per capita income over the years. High domestic demand for goods and services and relatively slower export growth in the European Union and China has helped South Asian region for raising their share in world merchandise exports. This region has been relatively successful in diversifying its export market particularly in Asian and African regions. According to World Bank, export diversification by types of products has increased in emerging countries including South Asian region. These preambles motivate us to examine whether the increase in export diversification in South Asian region has any positive impact on TFP growth. We consider this region because of continuous efforts by SAARC for better trade and for emerging as the leaders of global economic growth. Second, a little is explored in the literature about the long-run and short-run relationship between productivity growth and export diversification. Thus, this study examines the cointegration and causal relationship between TFP growth and export diversification in South Asian region. Export diversification might have a different or same impact on productivity growth both in the long-run as well as in short-run. Developing countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal could boost the productivity growth by diversifying their exports. Third, to best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which examines the long-run and short-run relationship between export diversification and TFP growth using panel cointegration and panel Granger causality test, which is a methodological contribution to existing literature. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: section “Methodology”, we present the measurement of TFP and methodology for examining the long-run and short-run relationship between export diversification and TFP growth. The data sources and measurement of variables are discussed in section “Data sources and measurement of variables”. Section “Empirical results” describes the econometrics results and finally, section “Conclusions” concludes.",9

Education and health (components of human capital) matter for personal development, social inclusion, labour market prospects and economic performance. Interestingly, investment in education and health is considered as a fundamental driver of economic growth globally and by existing empirical literatures with reliable and verifiable estimates. Globally, investment in education and health is considered a prolific tool for growth and development as encapsulated by United Nation in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For instance, the Millennium Development Goals one to four which expired in 2015 centred on education and health outcomes. At the expiration of the Millennium Development Goals, United Nations and world leaders carried out an assessment and when it became obvious that most countries especially developing nations were yet to make significant progress in some areas of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), they came up with seventeen (17) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 2030) in which education and health still occupy key positions in the realisation of the goals. More so, the Human Development Index (1990) and the recent modified New Human Development Index (NHDI) considered education and health indicators such as enrolment rate, male and female literacy rate (education indicators), life expectancy, under-five mortality (health indicators) as measures of growth and development. Thus, world leaders and development economists have projected education and health as key determinants of growth and development. Empirically, studies such as Omojimite (2010), Ajayi and Awe (2010), Omotor (2004), Olaniyan and Okemakinde (2008), Lawanson (2009), and Dauda (2004, 2009) were convincing in their analysis that education and health impact positively on economic growth. In other words, the more the level of investment in education and health, the more the economic growth. Further decomposition of these human capital components by some researchers revealed a positive relationship between them and economic growth. For instance, Dauda (2011) and Idowu (2014) found a positive correlation between health and economic growth when expenditure on education was taken as controlled variable, whereas others (see Gabriel 2014; Eric et al. 2008; Glewwe et al. 2007; Anthonia 2012; Hilaire et al. 2015) found a similar relationship between education and economic growth when health expenditure was taken as controlled variable. Economic growth responds positively to investment in education and health when their impacts are considered jointly or disintegrated; however, there are possibilities of contrary outcomes. For instance, findings by Olukayode (2009) revealed that government expenditure on education and health could have retarding effect on economic growth likewise Inuwa (2012), Tuban (2010), Emmanuel et al. (2013) which concluded that government expenditure could have a negligible or negative influence on economic growth. Whichever direction it is viewed from either globally or empirically, investment in education and health is generally believed to be a key driver of growth and development of the citizenry and the economy. This justifies the call for human capital investment in less developed countries including Nigeria. More education investment implies better health outcomes and more health investment means better education outcomes. In other words, the direction of flow is not one-way traffic. More health investment means better health outcomes and this impact education positively. According to Bratti et al. (2004), when life expectancy at birth increases, the level of secondary and tertiary education increases. In addition, the healthier a child is, the better the level of performance at school and improvement secondary completion rate. Poor health is capable of preventing learning, lower workers productivity and growth. The level of growth and development of an economy is affected by health status of it citizenry. Investment in education on the other side produces outcomes (primary, secondary and tertiary enrolment as well as adult literacy rate among others) which impact on health and produces health outcomes (such as infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, life expectancy rate and mortality rate) which have multiplier impact on economic growth. The impact of education on health could have different implications. In one direction, education is considered to be a long-term investment that provides the avenue for individuals to live healthy and realise the gains accruing from such investment. When viewed from another perspective, education is regarded as a vital input in health production function which may aid or improve individual’s status because they now have improved knowledge of health matters, access to available information and improve their reasoning skills (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2006). There is a strong positive relationship between the level of educational attainment and higher pay as result of better job opportunities and social networks, which in the long term is expected to translate into higher health expenditure and better health outcomes (see Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2006). In the same vein, individual’s health status has implication for employment opportunities and productivity. Health also determines the quality of workforce and economic growth of a nation. Thus, the more educated and healthy one is, the higher the opportunities for better job and more income to spend on their health and education, thereby improving their health and education outcomes, increase productivity, improve present and potential human capital and the overall economic growth and development. The relationship between education outcomes and health outcomes and their impact on economic growth is fundamental as expounded by the central importance accorded education and health by world leaders, United Nations and development economists. From empirical literatures, even though there are varying outcomes, a good number of the studies concluded that education and health impacted on economic growth positively in Nigeria. However, most of papers reviewed for this work such as Omojimite (2010), Ajayi and Awe (2010) and Dauda (2009) centred basically on the relationship between education expenditure and economic growth or health expenditure and economic growth in Nigeria or their joint impact on economic growth but failed to establish the relationship between education outcomes and health outcomes and their impact on economic growth as the basis of government allocating resources between education and health. Compared to these studies, empirical investigation from this paper differs in the following ways: first, this paper focused on the outcomes of education and health by X-raying the channels through which education outcomes and health outcomes relate and their multiplier impact on economic growth in Nigeria. Secondly, the interaction between education outcomes and health outcomes and their impact on economic growth is explored to determine whether or not there is a trade-off between investment in education and health. The overall objective of this paper therefore is to examine how education outcomes and health outcomes interact and how their interaction impacts economic growth in Nigeria. Education and health are considered as fulcrum to drive the realisation of growth and development in Nigeria and therefore should be considered key by policy makers in pursuing growth and development agenda. Both are closely related and investment in them is recognised to produce outcomes which impact on economic growth of all countries of the world including Nigeria.",5

Duraisamy,Bruno Jérôme,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"A large number of studies have examined the incumbency advantage in the US House of Representatives elections (Jacobson, 1987). Levitt et al. (1997) indicate that 90% of incumbents seeking re-election to the US House of Representatives have been successful. Gelman and King (1990) observed a positive incumbency advantage in the US Congressional elections for most of the years since 1900, and the effect was found to be much larger in the latter half of the twentieth century than it was in the past. Lee (2008) finds the incumbency advantage to be 40–45%. Uppal (2010) reports that incumbents are 30% more likely to win an election in the US state legislatures and gain 5.3% more votes. Hainmueller and Kern (2008) shows that incumbency leads to a gain of 1.4–1.7% points in proportional representation vote share in Germany’s mixed electoral system. Lemennicier and Katir-Lescieux (2010) show evidence of a significant positive incumbency effect in French National Assembly elections, and their results indicate that a 10% increase in the margin of votes in 2002 raised the probability of winning in 2007 by 8.9%. In an earlier study, Linden (2004) examined the incumbent advantage in the Indian parliamentary elections from 1951 to 1999 using Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and found that incumbents had about 37% advantage over non-incumbents in the elections held before 1991. This trend was reversed post-1991 when incumbents suffered a 14% disadvantage in comparison with their non-incumbent counterparts. This change has been attributed to a decline in the dominance of the Congress party, emergence of coalition or multiparty rule and an increasing awareness among the electorate. In a recent work, Uppal (2011) studied the incumbency effect in state assembly elections in India from 1975 to 2003 and found an incumbency disadvantage of 9% in the post-1991 elections. An earlier study by Duraisamy et al. (2014) on the 2004 and 2009 parliament elections using Regression Discontinuity Design found evidence of anti-incumbency effect in both the years and a decline in the effect in 2009 elections. Dutta and Gupta (2014) used regression analysis and found a positive incumbency effect on vote share in the 2009 parliamentary election. However, the study is confined to 478 (88% of the total) constituencies in 19 major Indian states. They also show evidence that the share of votes obtained by a candidate increases (decreases) with the candidate’s wealth (criminal charges). A major drawback of this study is that increase in the vote share does not always lead to victory in an election. The determinants of the probability of winning an election are more important than the vote share per se in the First-Past-Post election systems like the one prevailing in India. Aidt et al. (2011) and Chemin (2008) examined the impact of criminal charges on the margin of victory using RDD. The study shows evidence that political parties are more likely to field candidates with criminal charges when confronted with greater electoral uncertainty and in parliamentary constituencies where the population exhibits lower levels of literacy. Further, they argue that candidates with criminal record intimidate voters and depress the electoral turnout and the incumbency disadvantage stems largely from the better performance of the criminal candidates. The RDD methodology is a nonparametric approach, and it takes into account only the narrowly defined margin of victory in the estimation. The method assumes that the differences in other characteristics of the candidates are negligible at the narrowly defined margin of victory (say 1% or less). This study uses a parametric approach (regression model) which is considered to be a better method when information on control variables is available for estimation. The present study differs from the earlier works on the determinants of election outcome in the Indian elections. First, the study is based on data from all the constituencies. Second, the effects of criminal charges, wealth, incumbency status and education are examined on the two election outcome indicators, namely the probability of winning and vote share and the results are compared. Last, the covariates are modelled based on a parametric approach and the model is estimated by maximum likelihood and regression methods.",5

Provision of higher education to all irrespective of socio-religious differences, therefore, remains a key pillar of policymaking. But mere provision of higher education in terms of more higher education institutions may not increase participation as it is highly influenced by family background variables such as parental education, household economic factors, family size, religion, caste, gender and other social and cultural factors. Strong influence of parental background on an individual’s higher educational attainments may cause persistence in inequalities, especially in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society like India. The existence of high positive correlation between parents and child’s socioeconomic status as an adult is considered as violation of the principle of equality of opportunities as proposed by the proponents of social justice. They argued that equality of opportunity is achieved in a society when individuals can achieve their desired objective, solely determined by their choices and personal effort rather than determined by circumstances beyond their control (Arneson 1989; Cohen 1989; Roemer 1993, 1998). One aspect of equality of educational opportunities is that there should be equal opportunities irrespective to one’s socioeconomic background, in case of access to any level of education. Although equality of access to higher education serves as a prime policy initiative of various governments of the world, but still several analyses worldwide have found that individuals with high socioeconomic status are over-represented among students enrolled in tertiary institutions and India is not an exception. Unequal access to higher education is a much serious issue in case of India as it is highly diverse in terms of class, caste and religious group. The Sachar Committee Report 2006 revealed that the growth process of India including expansion of higher education has not benefitted all religious communities and social groups (hereafter socio-religious communities-SRCs) equally. It clearly highlighted the extensive deprivation of Muslims, the largest minority community in the country, constituting 14.2 per cent (Census Report 2011) of the population on various human development indicators including education. The literacy rate among Muslims in 2001 was 59.1 per cent which is far below the national average (65.1 per cent) and also below than other SRCs which show the literacy level of 70.8 per cent except for scheduled castes (SCs)Footnote 1 and scheduled tribes (STs)Footnote 2 (Census Report 2001).Footnote 3 The report also suggested that the literacy rates of Muslims are not increasing sufficiently to match with literacy rates of other major SRCs. In fact, in recent years, as per the report, the growth in literacy rates among SCs/STs has been higher than for Muslims. Other reports using nationalized data sets also reveal the same situation, wherein Muslims have the lowest literacy rates among all social and religious group (Human Development in India 2010; Indian Human Development Report 2011). Further, the discontinuation rate at each educational level is higher for Muslim and SCs/STs in comparison to forward castes (Human Development in India 2010). In case of participation in higher education by attainment and enrollment, recent studies using various rounds of NSS have found that participation of Muslims in terms of both the measures is less than other socio-religious communities (Hasan and Mehta 2006; Azam and Blom 2008). The education attainment rate (EAR) among Muslims is only 5.8% as compared to 12.3% for Hindus and an all India rate of 11.6%. The data for higher educational gross enrollment ratio (GER) also reveal that Indian Muslims lag behind other religious groups and account for only 12.9% of the total population enrolled in comparison to all India GER of 22.4% (see Table 1). The Muslims, whose proportion in urban areas is relatively higher, have displayed the least levels of achievements at the higher levels of education and the gap between the Muslim community and all others is increasing by the day. The alarming fact is that there is a net decline in higher education participation instead of improvement in case of the Muslim-general category over the years as revealed by studies (Borooah and Iyer 2005; USIPI Special Report 2013). Besides this, studies have found that probability of participation of Muslims in higher education is quite low as compared to other social and religious groups (Sachar Committee Report 2006; Basant and Sen 2010). This situation will pose an important problem since barriers in access to higher education for socially disadvantaged individuals may widen the social and economic gap between groups and within societies. The present paper keeping the backwardness of Muslims in mind attempts to evaluate the dynamics of higher education participation of Muslim minorities in India vis-à-vis other socio-religious groups. Basically the paper would explore how an individual’s participation in higher education is dependent on her socio-religious affiliation which would facilitate towards understanding the hierarchy of participation in higher education. The paper addresses the following questions: What is the impact of socio-religious background on the probability of attending higher education by a Muslim vis-à-vis other SRCs? How parental education, gender of household head and family income affects this probability? Whether this probability varies in terms of gender and native place of an individual? Lastly, what is the hierarchy of participation in higher education based on these probabilities?",

Arokiasamy,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many economists, demographers, and policymakers have debated the influence of population change on economic growth. There were three sets of such ideologies proving that population growth either restricts, promote or is independent of economic growth. Moreover, proponents of each explanation can find evidence to support their cases. However, recent studies (Bloom et al. 1999, a, b; Malmberg 1994; Lee 1980; Lindh 1999) debate a new dimension by empirically proving that population age structure has a more significant contribution to economic growth. These studies examined the history of population growth and economic growth. These studies helped in silencing the views on the relationship between population growth and economic growth and create a new debate that population age structure is more important. These studies also enhanced understanding the level of education, health care, and employment in a country. The concept of demographic dividend also accounts the significant contributions of female labour force participation in many studies.
 Ever since from the time of Malthus, there was only one debate that whether the population has an impact on economic growth or not. Neo-Malthusian ideologists were of the opinion that population growth restricts the economic growth (Ehrlich 1968). Other economists and demographers were of the view that population is a net advantage for economic growth (Boserup 1981). Others like socialist thinkers took a neutral stand on this issue. However, they all missed an important component, age structure. In recent times, age structure is central to population and economic growth (Bloom and Williamson 1998). The demographic dividend is a time-specific mechanism. It is not going to last forever. The term demographic dividend is understood as the eventual rise in the economic growth due to a rising share of working-age people in the population. Demographic dividend occurs as a result of an increase in the workforce which if employed productively can give rise to demographic dividend. This phenomenon occurs when the birth rate starts falling and age structure shifts towards the working-age group. As India is experiencing a decline in fertility, it is expected to be optimistic that demographic dividend will lead India to new economic heights. Demographic dividend in case of India has been a point of discussion in recent years, as the country has started witnessing the phenomenon of changing age structure that is resulting in an increase in working-age population. India, with 29 states and seven union territories, has an advantage over most of the countries. While most of the world is getting older, India is becoming younger. The prospects of getting younger are going to have a booming effect on India’s economy. Not only India’s economy will see a rise in the coming future, but also India will emerge as one of the leading markets of the potentially global workforce. It will also help in freeing up the resources for investment in economic development and family welfare and ultimately will lead to a rise in quality of human capital. Transition in age structure creates a bulge in the rise of working-age population that in turn can lead to the demographic dividend. After looking at the brighter side of India’s demographic dividend, let us put our eyes on the nerve-ending facts of India’s demographic dividend. Critics are of the opinion that it is not the demographic dividend but demographic disaster waiting to happen. To go with critics, one can see the abysmal standards of education, human development, poor female work participation rate, a higher number of marginal workers and lesser opportunities for the job creation in the country. While the critic’s concerns may be genuine, no one can discount the overwhelming potential of India’s demographic resources. It is worth noting fact that demographic dividend is a time-specific window of opportunity and is not going to last forever. The demographic dividend is delivered through three important mechanisms namely labour supply, savings, and human capital (Bloom et al. 2001). Merely increased in labour supply cannot assure the demographic dividend but to employ that workforce productively is important to reap the benefits from the demographic opportunity. Savings is another important aspect that can lead to the window of demographic dividend. With the decreasing dependency ratio and increasing life expectancy, savings tend to grow as the dependent decreases and individual gets more to save. The third mechanism is human capital that is also giving rise to demographic dividend. With the decline in fertility, economic burden reduces that allows parents to invest more in improving the quality of health and education of children that lead to the creation of quality human capital.",9

According to United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), more than 6.2 million of primary school age children in India were out of the school in 2014. The number increases to 7.7 million in lower secondary and 42 million in upper secondary school age. Equal opportunity of education begins with equal access to schools. However, non-enrolment of eligible children and drop out of a considerable number of students before they complete elementary and secondary grade remain a major challenge for achieving universal access to basic education. Several studies have pointed out a plethora of household-level factors (poverty, parental education, gender disparity, social exclusion, disability, conflict, displacement or other emergency situations, etc.) and supply-side factors (distant location of schools, lack of qualified teachers, drinking water, latrines and other facilities or a different language of teaching than spoken at home, etc.) contributing to high numbers of non-enrolment and drop out. A study by Azim Premji Foundation (2013) among 773 out of the school children in Yadgir District of Karnataka has found mother’s literacy, and below-poverty-line status of household has a strong association with drop out. Another study by Indian Institute of Education (2006) in rural Maharashtra found lack of basic infrastructure in schools, lack of qualified teaching staff particularly non-availability of female teacher, cultural gap between teachers and community, physical environment at home in which the child is brought up to play a major role in determining the school attendance of children. Dreze and Kingdon (1999) have found that school participation, especially among girls, responds to a wide range of variables including parental education and motivation, social background, dependency ratios, work opportunities, village developments, teacher postings, teacher regularity and midday meals. Shiva Kumar and Rustagi (2010), a higher percentage of parents are interested in education of sons than daughters as they hope their sons, if educated, have better employment opportunities. Kambhampati and Rajan (2008) have found that the presence of very young female siblings in the households worsens the probability of girls going to school or even working. The presence of older female sibling improves the chance of girls for schooling, while the presence of older male siblings increases the probability of girls doing household chores (ibid.). In India, there are considerable disparities in access, retention and completion of school education across various groups that results from discrimination and biases which pervades the social–culture–economic fabric of India that acts against weaker and marginalized sections (Batra 2009). These traditional biases often permeate the educational space and affect the way they are functioning. In the context of Jharkhand, Kumar and Das (2004) have pointed towards the complex nature of interaction between functioning and governance of schools; class and ethnic issues; hunger and malnutrition as major barriers for access and universalization of school education. Sujatha (2002) has argued that despite constitutional guarantees and persistent efforts, tribal communities continue to lag behind the general population in education due to inherent deficiencies in policies, planning and implementation, which originates from the failure to understand the complex realities of tribal life and the expectations of tribals from the system, little consideration for local context and cultural divide. Borooah and Iyer (2005) found that in the Indian context, the size or effect of community factors such as religion or caste on school enrolment of children depends considerably on the non-community or individual circumstances in which the children are placed. Thus, in case of favourable non-community circumstances (e.g. when parents are literate) the effects of community affiliations like religion or caste can be small (ibid.). A considerable number of studies have been conducted on experience and challenges faced by developing countries to address the problem of enrolment and drop out among school children. A UNICEF study (2014) covering four countries of south Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) have found late entry into schooling or enrolling children at an older age than grade-appropriate age put children at high risk of drop out. A study by Sabates et al. (2010) in Bangladesh also found that the children who start school late are more at the risk of dropping out than those who enrol at the appropriate age. In a study among primary school children in rural western Kenya, King et al. (2015) have shown malaria, menstruation and lack of money are most important determinants of drop out and absenteeism among girls. An MDG Achievement Fund (2011) study among Roma families in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of a larger study of non-enrolment and school drop out have found that Roma children do not enrol in primary school as they do not exist in the eyes of law because their parents due to their nomadic nature do not register the birth of their children. There is lack of awareness of importance of education among parents and also lack of opportunities for education in their mother tongue which contributes to poor rate of completion of primary schooling among Roma people. Filmer and Pritchet (1999), in their study based on demographic and health survey of 35 countries, have shown that enrolment and educational attainment of poor children have a distinct regional pattern. The authors found that there exists a significant difference in median years of schooling of children between poor and rich families in south Asian countries compared other developing regions of the world. The objectives of this paper are threefold—first, to study the recent pattern of school attendance across socio-economic groups. We hypothesize that even if there is substantial progress towards universalization of basic education in recent years, there exists a considerable social disparity in terms of access and participation in school education as it is the children belonging to lower castes, lower-income strata and labourer class who are still disproportionately affected by non-enrolment and non-completion of school education. Second objective is to understand the reasons behind non-participation and non-completion of school education across these groups. We ask the question—do these reasons vary substantially across gender and socio-economic groups or there exists a common set of vulnerability that explains differential access and participation for some groups over others? Finally, we analyse the economic activities of out of the school children—specifically, their level of labour force participation, pattern of sectoral and industrial distribution of out of school child labourers, the gender divisions in work and domestic duties using latest unit-level data of a representative countrywide survey.",2

Cities are their engines of growth. They present unprecedented opportunities to accelerate structural transformation, economic development and poverty reduction by facilitating the collocation of economic activities. The clustering of firms, households and institutions in dense urban environments leads to the external economies of agglomeration, networking and human capital formation. Cities act as centres of learning, innovation and knowledge-led growth. They generate multiplier effects and present the clearest path to prosperity in developing countries. Yet cities in India suffer from a serious mismatch between their functions and finances. As a result, they have been consistently neglecting core urban infrastructure and services, needed to augment agglomeration economies and mitigate congestion diseconomies. The problem is partly due to the constraints of fiscal federalism, and partly due to poor fiscal management in cities. Municipal finances in India are in an abysmal state. Thus, core infrastructure facilities like water supply, sewerage, storm drainage, roads, public transit, lighting, local area development and renewal get routinely neglected year after year. Paradoxically, it is cities that generate the revenues of central and state governments. If cities are neglected, resources for rural development and poverty alleviation cannot be mobilised. The issues of financing cities are amongst the key policy concerns of national, state and local governments in India (McKinsey Global Institute 2010; High Powered Expert Committee (HPEC) 2014; Ahluwalia et al. 2014; Mohanty 2014, 2016). The gross neglect of urban infrastructure in the normal budgetary process has serious implications for economic growth. A well-known, though controversial principle of public finance, is that when the required expenditures for core sectors are not forthcoming due to reasons such as populist priorities, political considerations, poor articulation of demand for services by the public, market imperfections and externalities leading to incorrect signals to policy-makers, etc., earmarking of appropriate revenues could be considered as a correction mechanism. This is advocated for public expenditure areas that are most critical for growth or welfare. Urban infrastructure is one such area, having many backward and forward linkages and spillover effects that facilitate agglomeration economies and productivity growth. Countries across the world have used earmarking as a strategy to finance critical infrastructure, including highways and public transit. This principle is particularly valuable in the context of local self-government, being based on the theory of ‘benefit taxation’. It has led to paradigms such as ‘users pay’, ‘beneficiaries pay’, ‘polluters pay’, ‘congesters pay’, ‘exacerbaters pay’ and ‘growth pays’. However, due to various reasons the benefit principle has not been harnessed by urban local bodies in India. This is intriguing as benefit taxation is the hallmark of local public finance. This paper is concerned with the application of the principles of benefit taxation and earmarked benefit taxes to local government in India. It aims at drawing lessons from research in urban economics and local public finance for the strategy of financing urban infrastructure. In particular, it advocates the model of ‘Tax Increment Financing (TIF)’ followed in developed countries like the USA under which tax revenues generated from value-creating projects are earmarked to finance the debt incurred for such projects, creating further revenues and supporting a self-sustaining process of planned urban development. This paper is organised as follows. ‘India’s urban fiscal crisis’ section portrays the dimensions of India’s urban fiscal crisis. ‘City externalities and tax bases’ section deals with the externalities of cities which create many benefits to many actors and have significant implications for the strategy of financing infrastructure. ‘Case for benefit taxation’ section refers to the principle of benefit taxation and its implications, drawing from Wicksell (1896) and Lindahl (1919). ‘The earmarking principle’ section dwells on the relevance of earmarking and earmarked benefit taxes in financing urban infrastructure and services. ‘Case for tax increment financing’ section describes the TIF model, combining benefit and earmarking principles. ‘Strategy of urban infrastructure financing’ section makes a case for financing urban infrastructure in India based on benefit taxation, value capture, earmarking, borrowing, tax-sharing and tax increment financing. ‘Conclusion’ section concludes with suggestion for future research.",2

However, the last decades in an increasingly global world we see the return of regulation and rise of its significance in both economic and social areas with key trends being allowing competition and private investment, and, creating markets through unbundling of the previously vertically integrated sectors of national economies. Mitnik (1980) defines regulation by independent agencies as state “within the frame of a law delegating certain decision-making regulatory powers to independent regulatory agencies and monitoring their application”. The key trends in the contemporary de-centered paradigm of regulation have been allowing competition and private investment, and, creating markets through unbundling of the previously vertically integrated sectors. Another defining feature is the proliferation of the number of independent regulatory agencies in the last several decades that have stripped away from governments important functions hence de-politicizing the role of the regulations. Such a de-centered paradigm of regulation through independent regulatory agencies (IRA) has become a universal model and spread globally in the last several decades moving the concerned sectors outside parliamentary control and oversight since the decisions are made quickly and often at expert level as they demand specialized information and skills. Such an autonomy–initially given to sectors such as electricity, gas, transport (economic regulation)–has in an increasing manner spread to number of societal segments that it governs and regulates such as health and education (social regulation). These new modes of policy making, including the importance of experts and trans-nationalization of policy making, suggest that the democratic political control through elected officials is removed thus necessitating other forms of social control or oversight over the independent regulatory agencies. These regulatory changes have been converging globally across many countries toward this proposed model based on the success of such transfer of regulatory powers from governments to independent agencies originally in the developed countries and then into developing countries too (Sumkoski 2017). As Moran (2001) explains, this shift reflects a fundamental alteration in the balance of state responsibilities such as movement away from attempting to manage the whole economy through command and control hierarchies with disaggregated and loosely coordinated regulatory agencies. In addition to this Moran (2001) further links these developments to the rise of the liberalization, privatization and the rise of the New Public Management concept. The traditional theories of regulation ranging from public interest to private interest theories and various in between sub-variations focused solely on the economic and political analysis of regulations as instruments for setting rules and norms for areas that affect both the economic and social life (Stigler 1971; Peltzman 1989). This shortcoming is partly addressed by the consequently introduced institutional theory of regulations that enshrines into the framework the principles of independence and accountability of regulatory agencies. Building on both the institutional theory of regulation and current practical experience of the regulation in both developed and developing countries, the recent thoughts and empirical research results is converging toward attempting to capture the empirical and theoretical aspects of inclusion of additional key societal principles that are enabling good regulation such as participation, inclusion, credibility, and ultimately legitimacy. The current theoretical thinking and practical approaches to regulation go beyond the basic principles of efficiency, regulatory independence, and accountability and into the wider area of participation, inclusion, legitimacy and credibility of both the content and processes of regulation. Such attempts have led to introducing social aspects notions into regulation embedding them in all its aspects from design and institutions to the processes and content of regulatory policy. This has given an impetus to conducting deeper analysis of the impact of social capital on regulation in order to explore what bestows the regulation with sustainability and credibility that are conducive to higher investment and higher output in infrastructure, beneficial for both businesses and citizens. The recent theoretical and empirical research have been focusing on the impact of social capital on particular aspects of development such as productivity, innovation, compliance at the firms’ level (Granovetter 2005) and on Weber’s (1924) observation of the need for decisions of public administration to be legitimate in order to be accepted by the key stakeholders. The key trends in the regulatory governance in last few decades have been the de-centered paradigm, deregulation, allowing competition and private investment. In the infrastructure, in addition to these features, a key component of regulatory agencies has been creating markets through unbundling of the previously vertically integrated infrastructure sector. These regulatory changes globally have been converging across many countries toward this proposed model based on the success of such removal of the regulatory powers from governments to independent agencies in the developed countries of OECD and most notably USA and UK. One other example of such processes of stripping down of the powers that were previously solely in the remits of the states was the worldwide proliferation of independent regulatory agencies that marked a process of taking away from governments significant parts of their mandate they had in managing number of important economic aspects of their countries. This process has been described by Bevir and Richards (2009) as a de-centered policy networks approach that is challenging the state-centric governance model. Bevir and Richards (2009) finds theoretical basis for this process in the individuals acting in accord with their beliefs and against the specific traditions. Current theoretical approaches to theory of regulations already venture beyond the basic principles of efficiency, regulatory independence, and accountability and into the wider area of participation, inclusion, legitimacy and credibility of both the content and processes of regulations. The need for establishing wider socio-economic foundations of the regulation stems from number of different reasons such as the one identified by Majone (1997) as a major challenge in producing a sustainable regulatory governance systems, that of legitimacy. Such socio-economic approach to regulation should also solve are the problems of regulatory capture by the elite that can be addressed by social participation as a balancing act against the risks of capture (Stigler 1971). Another subtle shift that has taken place in the semantics from ‘government’ to ‘governance’ in itself marks a move away from the old command and control modes of “hierarchical, classic bureaucracy to a world of negotiation within, and between, self-steering networks” (Moran 2001). Hence, if this is a move toward governance, then this new paradigm has to also encompass the key issues of good governance such as participation, inclusion, and thus legitimacy. Moran’s explanation of regulatory model as being modernizing from “above” and based on specialized expert knowledge is too narrow and in order to address the need for obtaining legitimacy from “bellow” it should be broadened by introducing the requirement for participation and inclusion in regulation. The expert approach to regulation, meaning that such issues should be solved by experts since they are too complex for “common” citizens to comprehend, risks creating a new mystifying black-box of regulation that can backfire down the line if citizens do not feel included, consulted or being part of the process and of the monitoring and evaluation of the regulatory outcomes. The regulatory experts should indeed be able and should also have a duty to convey such complex notions in a clear and understandable manner to both professional and non-expert audiences in order to get the stakeholders fully informed, on board, consulted and included as integral part of the regulatory process. Trust-centered explanations are more persuasive and credible than explanations centered on expertise and policy credibility when one considers their applicability to social regulation such as health and safety, environmental issues and consumer protection. Yet if this gap between the popularity of independent regulatory authorities in social and economic spheres is only temporary, and similar levels of regulatory reform will be observable in the sphere of social regulation, it will be possible to argue even more forcefully for the importance of trust in understanding the institutional design of the regulatory state (Jordana et al. 2011). Thus, in contrast to images of withdrawal and hollowing-out of the state (Levi-Faur 2011), with a transfer of power to international agencies and domestic actors that is emphasized by other concepts of the regulatory state, the change described by Moran is one of a “vigorous regulatory state whose central ambitions have not diminished”. Levi-Faur (2011) argues that on the contrary, it uses command and control regulation to colonize new areas, develop new agencies and reform old ones and the tools it applies are entirely congruent with “standardization, central control, and synoptic legibility to the centre” (Moran, 2001). Exploring the regulatory governance in developing countries Badran (2010) for example explores why governments in the developing countries delegate their authorities to the IRAs? Adopting an institutional framework of analysis Badran investigates the creation of the IRAs in Egypt with initial findings showing that the creation of the IRAs in Egypt particularly in the telecommunications sector can be explained on “functional and practical grounds rather than any other factors of democratic governance or political uncertainties”. Dubash and Morgan (2012) similarly focus on regulatory agencies in the Global South identifying three entry points for exploring the distinctive nature of the regulatory state. They identify the distinctive genesis of regulatory agencies in developing countries and secondly, the extent and channels that interface between the domestic and the international shapes the regulatory state in the South. Thirdly they identify the issue of how does the practice of regulation and the political opportunities created by state-society interactions in regulatory agencies shape regulatory outcomes on the ground, particularly in relation to the much higher levels of unserved citizens and informal service providers. This socio-economic model of regulation integrates the economic and regulatory theory with aspects from theories of sociology to account for social norms in addition to the traditional economic and technical handles that are now key components of the regulation. This extended model explains how existing regulation and regulatory compliance are expected to improve the regulatory outcomes by introducing the requirements of participation and inclusion in the theory and practice of regulation. The social contract for good regulation also necessitates going beyond the traditional command and control model in trying to promote regulatory compliance, legitimacy and acceptance in a complex interaction between stakeholders such as citizens, businesses, and, governments and agencies (Feld and Frey 2007). This is even more important since if the citizens perceive their interests and preferences to be properly represented in the regulatory process and outcomes they will be more likely to legitimize them and comply with them thus increasing the chances for establishing and maintaining a sustainable and successful regulatory governance system. Or as Bird et al. (2007) argue, having societal institutions for better regulatory compliance represents having a meaningful voice of citizens in influencing the affairs of the state. Regulatory reforms are more likely to be accepted by citizens when the regulatory process is perceived to be not only fair but also inclusive and participatory making the regulatory policy outcomes legitimate. In such cases, citizens perceive their acceptance of regulatory regimes as a “greater good” and comply with it even if they do not personally receive a full public good equivalent from their compliance. Public choice theory and psychological theories also argue that legitimacy depends not only on the regulatory agency ability to provide favorable outcomes, but that stakeholders place great importance on the processes it employs (Tyler 1990). Tyler (1990) in his study finds that the perception of legitimacy and regulatory compliance is closely linked to people’s views of the fairness of the procedures used and demonstrates that the people comply more with the law if the procedures (more important) and distributive justice (less important) employed by the regulatory authority are perceived to be fair. The effectiveness of the regulatory outcome is the extent to which regulation is implemented and an individual is made better off and the perceived distributive justice of the outcome is the perceived fairness of how the benefits or losses are shared in the society. In regards to the efficiency of the regulatory process, this involves the participation and inclusion through that people perceive that the regulatory authority is giving to them in the process of delivering on its mandate, and, how fairly regulatory agency treats citizens and businesses that are affected by the regulatory processes and outcomes. Tyler (1990) concludes that the positive outcomes matter less in promoting legitimacy than procedural justice and distributive justice. The willingness to comply stemming from social norms is based on the perceived legitimacy of the regulatory agencies that are mandated to implement regulations and evidence suggests that a key determinant of perceived legitimacy is the principle of fairness being built into the procedures for developing and implementing regulation. Hence, regulatory authorities should determine what processes and practices are judged fair by those segments of the population affected by the regulations. Additionally, the regulatory compliance is affected by legitimacy of regulation that is in turn impacted by the outcomes achieved and by processes employed in the regulatory governance. Once the regulatory system obtains legitimacy, an individual compliance is expected to be affected by the behavior of others via the nature and extent of social influence exerted in the community that depends on the larger community’s perception of the institution’s legitimacy (Sutinen and Kuperan 1999; Young 1979).",1

Capabilities, in turn, are the set of vectors of functionings that reflect a person’s freedom to lead one type of life or another (Sen 1992). The expansion of the so-called capability set is a way in which society flourishes. Health capabilities (Ruger 2010a, b), the corresponding freedoms in the health domain, can be used to evaluate people’s health-related quality of life (HRQL). From an economic perspective, they represent a great opportunity to construct indicators that may be used in economic evaluations of health interventions (EEHI). Although capabilities more broadly have been considered for use in resource allocation in the health sector (Cookson 2005; Lorgelly et al. 2008, 2010; Coast et al. 2008; Al-Janabi et al. 2012), there are good reasons to use specifically health capabilities (Ruger 1998, 2010b). The next section argues that a holistic definition of health is needed within the CA by considering Ruger’s definition of health capabilities. Then, considering health to be a type of internal capability, a synthesized health capability set is proposed in Sect. 3 that can be used to select the final dimension. Here, it is argued that this set can be used to design an instrument with which to construct an index of health capabilities. Because the purpose is to use this index in EEHI, this section also explains how this can be done in large-scale projects as well as aggregated at individual and collective levels. Finally, the main implications of and concluding remarks on the proposed framework are discussed in Sect. 4.",1

Therefore, to understand contemporary insurance as well as the overall response of various societies and communities to present-day insurance institutions, it is important to understand the principal philosophical structures behind the origin of such institutions. For this purpose, the present study aligns its arguments to religions, for the following reasons: primarily in the social sciences, religions have often been referenced to understand any phenomena linked to human evolution, as religions are considered to contain the oldest accounts of events in the past.Footnote 1 Another important reason to choose religion as a basis to study insurance is the striking similarity between the fundamental concept of the “evolution of insurance” and the “evolution of religions” in terms of seeking protection against various kinds of risk. Stark and Bainbridge (1985, 1996) argue that religiosity increases when people actively seek the rewards that religions provide. In this context, protection of various basic needs against different kinds of risk is the most fundamental reward sought by ancient human beings. Some examples of such rewards include safety from natural phenomena, attacks from foreign entities, curing diseases, safety of material possessions, and protection from many similar types of risk that evolved over time. This is also reflected in the fact that many religious texts start with simple hymns adulating natural powers for bestowing protection. Later, with the evolution in human needs and societal development, these hymns broadened to encompass risks and dangers that arose from the many facets of practical daily life (Table 1). From the perspective of the scientific and historical evidence for risk as a tradable economic unit, insurance is as old as Babylonian civilization.Footnote 2 However, contrary to such scientific accounts, even today the economic evolution of insurance institutions has significant religious influences. The effect of religious affinity in the evolution of insurance institutions is evident from the remarkable growth in Takaful societies in the last decade of the 20th century. These developments reinforce the need for studies focusing on the history and evolution of financial arrangements, to understand the impact of religions on the development of insurance institutions. Therefore, the present work broadly aims to understand the role of religious institutions in the evolution of insurance mechanisms, from simple prayers, rituals, and performances in the religion to the system of complex mechanisms used in modern protective arrangements. This study navigates these themes using religious scriptures. Such scriptures are instrumental for understanding the concepts and practices of insurance, due to their epitomic authority and significant influence upon social systems (Lehrer 2004). In addition, religious connotations of God have further strengthened the cohesive prosocial behavior of these institutions (Shariff and Norenzayan 2007). Therefore, even today, the perspectives of most people are generally embedded in the values of the religion they follow. Although awareness and education currently make a significant contribution to the shaping of human thought, McCauley and Lawson (2002) argued in the theory of cognitive science of religion that even the arrival of literacy had little impact on the way religions present themselves. Various religious institutions differ in terms of their philosophical orientation, and their development also shows various degrees of affinity with different religions. In this context, all religious institutions have provided arrangements for protection, providing a notion of quasi-insurance formats. The current study found that there are four broad themes along which such protective arrangements can pass, viz. religious insurance, political insurance, mutual insurance, and institutional insurance (Fig. 1). Within the religion, these four concepts of risk sharing revolve around religious laws and the strength of rituals to deal with various aspects of protection. This study also focuses on the roles played by small religious communities in creating the structural differences among modern protective arrangements. Provision of protection has passed through four main evolutionary stages and three intermediary stages. Note: This figure describes the four main stages of protection, but many evolutionary stages of development may exist within each of these. According to the concept of religious insurance, the power to protect someone against any risk is vested in supernatural powers, whereas earthly beings are at the receiving end only. In this stage, protection is limited to natural phenomena. Political insurance refers to the protective arrangement via which a king/ruler class emerges. By this stage, many manmade perils have evolved, including theft, robbery, and risks due to various battles. To some extent, kings used to maintain the high ethics of religions. Mutual insurance refers to protective arrangements whereby protection evolved into mutual arrangements. In this stage, the class distinction between protectors and the protected disappeared. Small religious communities used to manage such protective arrangements based on moral laws. Institutional insurance corresponds to modern arrangements governed by a well-established legal system mentioned in religious texts In some regards, the current study extends the work of Scheve and Stasavage (2006), who found that a high degree of religiosity hinders insurance-buying behavior, while at the same time, welfare spending and religions have substituted each other. Generally, in the domain of insurance, there is scant literature on studies of religious customs and philosophies to understand the evolution of protection arrangements. However, the causal relationship between religion and insurance has been studied by many authors.Footnote 3 Earlier work on the origin and history of insurance mainly rested upon certain passages found in the histories of Livy and Suetonius and the letters of Cicero (Vance 1908). The concept of bottomry is contemporary to the Code of Hammurabi (Trenerry 2010; Vance 1908), and evidence of marine insurance is found around 916 BC in Rhodian Law (Benedict 1909).",

Instead, they move mostly into the informal service sector (Newman et al. 2016: 13). In Africa, only about one in five workers has found employment in industry after leaving agriculture (McMillan and Harttgen 2014: 2). Overall only 3.2% of the total sub-Saharan workforce was employed in the formal industry in the early 2010s (Losch 2016: 15). Many of those who stay behind in rural areas face harsh livelihood conditions (FAO 2016: 14) and widespread underemployment (McCullough 2015). Overall, staying behind as well as moving out resulted in high rates of vulnerable employment, especially in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (see Fig. 1). This is even true for countries which have seen accelerated economic growth in the first decade of the third millennium. The growth champions in Latin America experienced premature deindustrialisation; the ones in Africa barely maintained their earlier low level of manufacturing activities. That these countries were nevertheless growing fast was explained by a team led by Dani Rodrik (Diao et al. 2017). In the Latin American case, growth was driven by an international commodity boom and manufacturing employment was hit on the one hand by overvalued exchange rates and on the other hand by manufacturing’s labour productivity increases. A significant amount of workers were forced out from high-productivity sectors into low-productivity activities. The African growth champions profited from the same commodity boom, remittances, and productivity increases in agriculture. In Ghana, for example, the boom in mining and oil extraction created only a few more jobs in these sectors (Baah-Boateng 2015). The labour force shifting out of agriculture, however, was not absorbed in an expanding sector with globally competitive productivity levels; hence, the overall labour productivity in the non-agricultural sector declined (Diao et al. 2017). India reached its peak manufacturing level in 2006 at 17.4% of GDP. By 2016, it had fallen to 15% (Marlow and Beniwal 2018; for a general discussion of its manufacturing sector, see Jha 2018).Footnote 2
 The recent growth champions’ experiences differ from the rapid export-oriented industrialisation of East Asian countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China. They are, therefore, considered to be less sustainable. If productivity does not increase in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy, then overall growth will be limited (Diao et al. 2017). As the service sector in Africa has absorbed workers faster than the rate of increase in its output, its relative productivity advantage vis-à-vis the rest of the economy has diminished (Newman et al. 2016: 11). Manufacturing seems to be better suited to stimulate productivity increases rather than the service sector for catching-up economies. The formal sector manufacturing can absorb large number of relatively unskilled workers (i.e. those coming out of agriculture), allows for learning by doing, and provides for spillover effects into the rest of the economy (Rodrik 2013). However, even successful catching-up countries like China have reached their key share of manufacturing employment at much lower levels of GDP per capita than the early industrialisers (see Fig. 2). In addition, the share of low-skilled workers employed in manufacturing has decreased across countries of the Global North and South since the late 1990s (Rodrik 2016: 36). A recent report on the impact of automation underlines the threat of unemployment in the manufacturing sector in developing countries (Oxford Martin School and Citi 2016). Therefore, the capacity for manufacturing to absorb the rural surplus population seems to be limited. Why is this the case? Source: Rodrik (2016:25).

Easterly and Levine (1997) shared this point of view and suggested that apart from growth determinants such as labor supply, physical capital and human capital, particular attention should be given to institutions in Africa. Recently, debates at the international level have recognized that beyond the economic growth concept, inclusive growth is the path that African countries should follow now. Indeed, recent data show that in the last few years, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been experiencing high rates of economic growth. Moreover, human development indicators have registered a tremendous progress. Nevertheless, compared to other regions of the world, poverty and inequality in SSA are still high. Employment opportunities are limited as well. Furthermore, during the BRICSFootnote 1 summit held in South Africa in July 2018, Tao Zhang, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Deputy Managing Director, stated that in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, Africa needs to promote inclusive growth. For example, due to the fact that their economies are oil-driven, Angola and Nigeria are two African countries which must face the challenge of inclusive growth (Igbatayo et al. 2017). While most discussions are favorable to the notion of inclusive growth, there is no consensus regarding its definition. International institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) have provided a definition for inclusive growth. The World Bank’s definition puts emphasis on rapid pace of economic growth, broad-based growth, sector-based growth, productive employment, absolute poverty reduction and equal opportunity. The Europe 2020’sFootnote 2 definition of inclusive growth is not only related to a mechanism leading to high levels of employment and poverty reduction but also to investment as well as the modernization of the labor market. This paper follows these definitions of inclusive growth. Indeed, in the African context, the issues identified in the previous definitions are important challenges of African countries. Specifically, we focus on inclusive growth that increases the size of the economy and creates opportunities for different groups of people in terms of the creation of jobs. In fact, absolute poverty can be reduced through the promotion of inclusive growth. According to Murray and Press (2017), economic freedom is essential to the development of Africa. With a view to the recent improvements in the human development indicators and in growth rates in SSA, promoting economic freedom appears to be a solution for achieving inclusive growth. According to the Heritage Foundation (2018), inclusive growth is driven by economic freedom based on rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. This is because there exists a direct link between economic freedom and inclusive growth in that the former plays an important role in helping people to work and to adopt a production and a saving behavior. Economic freedom can be measured using four main categories: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency and open markets. Gwartney et al. (1996) and the Fraser Institute state that: “Individuals have economic freedom when the property they acquired without the use of force, fraud, or theft is protected from physical invasions by others and they are free to use, exchange, or give their property as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others.” In a free economy, individuals are able to make decisions on their own. Strong property rights and low taxes enable them to engage in productive activities. Furthermore, when the possibility is given to individuals to participate and compete in markets, gains related to production efficiency can be observed (Gwartney et al. 1999). On the basis of the definition of inclusive growth that was previously given and on which this study will focus, the potential link between economic freedom and inclusive growth seems to be emerging and has an economic rationale that further justify the need of this study. We base our justification on the subcomponents of economic freedom, namely property rights, judicial effectiveness, government integrity, tax burden, government spending, fiscal health, business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom, trade freedom, investment freedom and financial freedom. A work done in freedom conditions is likely to allow economic agents to be even more productive. Therefore, labor freedom seems to be important in that everyone can participate in the process of economic production. In reality, a free work environment is likely to attract and to involve more people. Moreover, the freedom to invest without constraints, financial freedom and the freedom to trade are important factors in economic activities. For example, once they earned their income, individuals could use their gains not only to consume but also to invest, put their gains on the financial markets or use them to finance other income-generating activities. All these economic activities would contribute to the increase in the national product. In addition, a conducive institutional environment, in particular as represented by a high integrity of the government and the protection of property rights are engines of inclusive growth. Such a link is reported in the empirical literature. In this regard, Kumah and Sandy (2013) demonstrated the role of institutions and the business environment in creating jobs and achieving inclusive growth. Yet, the Fraser Institute data show that Africa is the region of world with less economic freedom compared to the other continents. One example is that Africa is ranked as a region where there are more difficulties to start a business than other regions. Miller and Kim (2017) argued that economic freedom leads to economic success. For example, Chile’s economy liberalization in the 1980s helped in increasing growth. Economic freedom’s components such as property rights are particularly strong in European countries such as Ireland and Estonia. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea are cases of Asian countries which, thanks to economic freedom, are today among the richest economies of the world. Considering the specific case of South Korea, Byeon et al. (2017), in an attempt to propose inclusive growth solutions to South Korea, argued that structural reforms in terms of labor market, financial reform and greater social protections are important. The increasing interest in both economic freedom and inclusive growth in Africa is at the core of the motivation of this study. In this paper, we contribute to the debate on economic freedom and inclusive growth in three ways. First, there is a lack of empirical study, on SSA, related to the relationship between economic growth and economic freedom. Furthermore, the focus of the literature in other regions of the world has, so far, been on economic growth. Second, the relationship between economic freedom and inclusive growth will be analyzed using a dynamic framework and by taking into account cross-sectional dependence. The reason is that, generally, macroeconomic models have dynamic features (Phillips curve, aggregate demand and aggregate supply), and cross-sectional dependence may be an issue in panel data analysis. Third, examining the causality between economic freedom and inclusive growth in SSA by taking into account cross-sectional dependence should contribute to the literature in this field. This study uses yearly data on thirty (30) SSA countries, and it covers the 1996–2016 period. The countries of the sample are: Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Inclusive growth is measured by the GDP per person employed (in Purchasing Power Parity), and the Heritage Foundation economic freedom index is used to measure economic freedom. The stochastic properties of the series are tested through recent panel unit root tests which take into account cross-sectional dependence. In fact, not considering cross-sectional dependence in the analysis of the stochastic properties may lead to wrong results regarding the presence or absence of unit roots. Moreover, the model used in this study is a growth equation estimated by the mean of the system GMM (generalized method of moments) developed by Blundell and Bond (1998). The use of this approach is justified for the following reasons. First, it allows to deal with the endogeneity issue that arises with the estimation of a dynamic model. Second, the system GMM provides better results—lower bias and standard errors—than the difference GMM (Windmeijer 2005). The econometric estimation procedure also involves accounting for cross-sectional dependence. The Dumitrescu and Hurlin’s (2012) panel causality test is used to address the causal relationship between economic freedom and inclusive growth. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section two presents a literature review. Section three discusses the methodology and describes the data and descriptive statistics. The focus of section four is the discussions of the results. The conclusion is presented in section five.",10

It was a Portuguese colony for four and a half centuries from 1510 to 1961. After attaining political liberation, it became a part of India in April 1962.Footnote 1 After liberation, mass education was extended to children in Goa regardless of caste and class background. Democratization and distribution of educational opportunities increased enrolment in schools. A section in paper on social context of school education in Goa explains the growth of schools over decades after liberation from colonial rule. In the context, three secondary schools were studied against backcloth of introduction of mass education in Goa. School careers of fifty students have been considered in paper.Footnote 2 Synchronic study of three schools allowed diachronic understanding of students’ careers and biographies. Bourdieu’s (1971, 1973, 1974, 1997, with Passeron 1977, 1979) views have been useful to understand and analyse ethnographic facts about schools in Goa.Footnote 3 In context of mass education, in teaching pupils of diverse castes and social classes, transformations in pedagogic communication occur. It is said “the structures sociology deals with are the product of transformations” (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977: 88). When system of education deals with public that perfectly meet its expectations, as is usually the case in schools meant for the middle class and higher social classes, then educational knowledge that is conveyed and its reception by students is well matched. It depends on “quality of its public” (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977: 99), but when students in schools are drawn from diverse social classes then as was the case in Goa, there is mismatch between implicit demands of education system and ability of students to meet demands that encourage “transformations of pedagogic relationships” (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977: 90). Bourdieu says “pedagogy can fulfil its function of inculcation only as long it addresses itself to students equipped with linguistic and cultural capital” (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977: 99). Real observations in situations in schools are about transformations that are explained in pedagogic communication in schools. The education process entails situational adjustments and accommodation with modified interpretation of teaching and learning. The style of teaching makes learning congenial to masses and helps tides over examinations and meet up other procedures of assessment. However, the logic of education system remains intact through examinations that bring about elimination of students who do not meet expectations of education system. Recent rules of Goa Right to Education Act (Official Gazette, Government of Goa 2012) allow promotion to higher school-classes. The paper shows how this happens in some schools in Goa. Subjective school experience of students and their scholastic achievement determine their objective class futures. Reproduction of class structure comes into effect. Students do not go far in educational careers. School careers of students show reproductive allocation to class locations. Schools act as conservative force by which de facto inequalities are de jure (Bourdieu 1974) and label students as low achievers. The ideological function of schools is to legitimize the established order (Bourdieu 1974) that is confirmed in conclusion of paper.",
21,2,Journal of Social and Economic Development,08 August 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-019-00080-2,The consequences of exchange rate trends on international tourism demand: evidence from India,December 2019,Akhil Sharma,Tarun Vashishat,Abdul Rishad,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In the most recent decades, a remarkable growth has been witnessed by tourism across industrialised and emerging economies as one of the foremost drivers of socio-economic progress. The global tourism sector is now worth over US$ 1.6 trillion in terms of total export value, which is accounted for 10.4% to the global gross domestic product. Additionally, 7% of world exports are associated with tourism, which ranks third after chemicals and fuels (UNWTO Tourism Highlights 2018). Due to its growing importance, there is no surprise that multifarious studies have been conducted on different aspects of the tourism domain (De Vita 2014; Lee et al. 1996; Song and Li 2008; Prideaux 2005; De Vita and Kyaw 2013; Carey 1991; Garín-Muñoz 2006; Law et al. 2004; Lee 1996; Wang 2009; Chatziantoniou et al. 2013; Chao et al. 2013). Broadly speaking, the variables in the international tourism studies are divided into qualitative and quantitative variables (Peng et al. 2012). Song and Turner (2006) pointed out that the latter is more prevalent in the empirical literature. Qualitative factors such as safety issues, cultural issues and socio-political instability play a significant role in influencing the tourist flow (Patsouratis et al. 2005). It is not easy to measure the impact of such qualitative factors, but their impact is clearly visible in the pattern of tourist flow. Apart from this, quantitative factors such as disposable income, transportation cost, cost of living and exchange rate fluctuations influence international tourism demand (Dwyer et al. 2002). Modelling these economic factors with suitable econometrics framework can help to explain the intensity of influence of these factors on tourist flow in an economy. Despite the above, other significant determinants which have been discussed in the literature include foreign direct investment flows (Abbott and De Vita 2011; Abbott et al. 2012), climate change (Lise and Tol 2002), destination promotion (Crouch et al. 1992; Law et al. 2004; Lee 1996), level of income distribution and inequality (Morley 1998), education level of tourist (Alegre and Pou 2004) and rate of unemployment (Cho 2001). However, earlier tourism demand studies focused on conceptualisation and identification of exogenous variables (Witt and Martin 1987; Martin and Witt 1988; Uysal and Crompton 1984), whereas recent studies are more inclined towards econometric modelling and forecasting techniques (Song and Li 2008; Shen et al. 2011; Dogru and Sirakaya-Turk 2016). The growth of tourism in the last few decades has made a radical shift in the employment pattern and the sectoral contribution to the gross domestic product of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) including India. With the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime to supplement new economic policy in 1991, India witnessed a remarkable growth in terms of foreign tourist earning. However, despite its potential as an exotic destination, India ranks at the 17th position globally in terms of international tourist arrivals with 27.3 US$ billion tourism export which accounts to 5.8% of the total export of India (UNWTO 2018; WTTC 2018). As tourism is the third highest contributor to India’s foreign exchange earnings (Kaur 2017), acceleration of tourism activities improves the non-debt portion of country’s reserve and helps in stabilising the exchange rate which further accelerates the trade and capital flow. Thereby, it is necessary to attract more foreign tourists towards India which in turn bring excess foreign currency that can help in reducing Balance of Payment (BoP) and boost the tourism export for the country. In the last few years, exchange rate has emerged as one of the widely used indicators for measurement of the international tourism flows alongside other economic and social determinants (Patsouratis et al. 2005; Song and Li 2008; Zhang et al. 2009; Santana-Gallego et al. 2010; Kah and Lee 2013; De Vita 2014; Agiomirgianakis et al. 2015b). The changes in exchange rate not only garner responses from the potential travellers, but also the absence of hedging market forces the business to be shifted from an economy with high exchange rate instability to an economy with low exchange rate instability having a more stable currency rate for managing economic exposure (Crouch 1994d; Agiomirgianakis et al. 2015a). Exchange rate fluctuation influences the potential travellers to change the destination or reduce the length of the holidays which results in revenue loss to the economies. This may cause changes in the travel itinerary of tourists while visiting a particular country (Webber 2001). Therefore, there is a need to monitor, track and predict these exchange rate fluctuations and formulate effective mechanisms (WTTC 2016). In the case of emerging Asian economies, the introduction of a more flexible exchange rate regime and devaluation of currency is attracting more foreign tourists (Chang and McAleer 2009). Such a radical shift in exchange rate regime brings countries to the list of international destinations. From the international trade point of view, countries keep their currency devalued for competitive advantages. But this competitive advantage on exchange rate elasticity in the case of tourist inflow depends on the risk-taking behaviour of the agents and the exchange rate of the destination country as well. For instance, the South East and South Asian currencies are relatively cheaper for tourists originating from Western countries. Therefore, small fluctuations in the exchange rate of these currencies may not be much influential in impacting the travel decision of the tourists. For understanding such dynamic relationship between exchange rate and international tourist inflow, the previous studies have used the nominal exchange rate as a proxy for measuring potential risk in tourism demand model which may not be adequate as it neglects the relative price level at the destination. In order to rectify this issue, studies such as Kim and Lee (2017), Eilat and Einav (2004) and Edwards (1995) were given more emphasis on the relative price level in the destination countries. But including exchange rate and consumer price index simultaneously may cause multicollinearity in the model (Zhang et al. 2009). Following the arguments of Chen (2008), this study fortifies that exchange rate is the key contributing factor of international tourism demand. By investigating in seclusioning the impact of exchange rate on global tourism inflow to India, the present study explains how this factor influences the international tourism demand. A unique combination of real effective exchange rate within an ARDL framework explicates elasticity of exchange rate in explaining the global tourism demand to ‘Incredible India’. The next section of this paper provides an overview of the relevant empirical studies followed by the methodological aspects adopted in the study along with details of the data. There on, the outcomes of the empirical research are discussed. The penultimate portion concludes the research and lays down the policy recommendations.",2
21,2,Journal of Social and Economic Development,15 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-019-00086-w,An investigation of intrastate income disparities and regional convergence in Odisha,December 2019,Pratap Kumar Mahakur,Narayan Chandra Nayak,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Persistence of regional disparities is one of the critical challenges for many developing countries including India. Needless to say, unequal regional development has many adverse consequences including deceleration of growth, rise in public costs, wastage of resources, rise in poverty level, social injustice, political instability, ethnic tensions and above all, threat to national integration (Friedman and Alonso 1964; Kanbur and Venables 2005; Myrdal 1957). Overcoming structural forces that propagate extreme inequality is one of the effective ways for achieving both Millennium Development Goals (UNDP 2005) and Sustainable Development Goals (UNDP 2019). In India, regional disparities are all-pervading. While states diverge considerably from one another on income, human development, poverty, consumption, etc., rising regional differences within states have also turned out to be far serious challenges. Though in recent years, the studies on disparities across Indian states have attracted significant attention (Cherodian and Thirlwall 2015; Mishra and Mishra 2018; Sanga and Shaban 2017; Sofi and Durai 2015, 2017), attempts to examine intrastate disparities are limited. In a vast country like India, regional diversities within a state carry as much significance as that across the states. It is these intrastate diversities, which appear to be the driving forces behind increasing demands for regional autonomy, carving out of new states, rising social unrest and economic blockade across different parts of the country. Consequently, various states, of late, have formed region or community-specific governing units like creation of separate revenue divisions in Odisha, development boards in West Bengal, autonomous councils and development councils in Assam, etc. From the policy standpoint, one may, thus, argue that intrastate disparities need as much attention as interstate disparities attract. Odisha, a major state in India’s eastern region (ninth largest in population), is a case in point. The state experiences a distinct phenomenon of becoming one of the BIMAROU (BI: Bihar, MA: Madhya Pradesh, R: Rajasthan, O: Odisha, U: Uttar Pradesh) states of the country experiencing extreme backwardness (Mishra and Mishra 2017; Rajan 2013). Odisha has 30 administrative districts equally distributed across three revenue divisions, namely central, northern and southern. Evidently, it witnesses stark disparities among its districts on several vital development indicators both within and across administrative divisions. The state continues to be in the headlines for poor resource endowments in certain regions, lopsided economic development and associated ethnic and political unrest. Odisha is predominantly rural and is heavily dependent upon agriculture for livelihoods. With population of 41.9 million (3.47% of India’s population), Odisha’s demographic pattern is unique in the country as among the major states, it is home to a large proportion of tribal population (22.85%). Ironically, the tribal population is heavily concentrated in the less developed regions of the state. The southern and northern regions of the state account for more than 4/5th of its tribal population. Little less than half of the scheduled caste population of the state also inhabit these two regions (Census of India 2011). Evidently, the incidence of poverty is very high in these regions only. In recent years, Odisha’s growth achievements have, however, been remarkable. The annual growth rate of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) has recorded an exponential rise from a meager 2.45% in 1998–1999 to about 8.08% in 2014–2015 (advanced estimate) with a staggering 12.85% achieved in 2006–2007Footnote 1 (GoO 2015). The annual average growth rate (AAGR) of GSDP during the last 6 years (2012–2013 to 2018–2019) has been a high of 8.10%Footnote 2 (GoO 2019). Despite such achievements, Odisha is still relegated to the bottom on many critical development parameters (Rajan 2013). This raises the following pertinent questions: (a) Is Odisha’s underdevelopment common to all the districts and regions or is it the persistent backwardness of some regions or districts that puts the state at this precarious position? (b) How has Odisha’s growth been reflected in its intrastate income distribution? The purpose of this study is, thus, to examine the absolute and conditional income convergence across the districts of Odisha and find out how its different regions contribute to its observed income disparities. It examines the intrastate income differences across the districts of Odisha over the period from 1995–1996 to 2010–2011 and identifies the factors contributing to such disparities. In effect, it explores the existence of both σ-convergence and β-convergence (absolute and conditional) in the context of Odisha. While σ-convergence signifies the decline in regional income dispersion, β-convergence focuses on the growth performance of the initially poorer regions within the state (Lessmann and Seidel 2017). Needless to say, a study on intraregional disparities carries as much significance as the studies on interregional disparities. While one may argue that both move in the same direction, the possibilities of their trade-off cannot be ruled out. The public policies aiming at reducing interregional inequalities could influence intraregional inequalities in a reverse way, leading to certain novel forms of spatial inequalities (Artelaris and Petrakos 2016; Wei 1999). Under the circumstances, an investigation of the intraregional income disparities would pave the ways for formulating appropriate region-specific measures. Besides, one may also be eager to know if the regions which are less developed today were less developed in the remote past. If the backwardness tends to persist through time, it may require an understanding of the specific nature of the problems for direct intervention (Sala-i-Martin 1996). Though there is no denying that a large body of literature exists on regional income disparities in the context of India, such studies at the intrastate level are, however, limited and to the best of our knowledge, not much attempts have been made to study the intrastate disparities on Odisha so comprehensively. The growing divergence within the state necessitates an in-depth study. There are empirical studies estimating both absolute and conditional convergence. However, the studies integrating several pertinent underlying factors like economic structure, human capital, institutional quality, spillover effects and infrastructure availability are limited. Moreover, introducing σ-convergence measures to find out within and between regional inequalities is also rare at the state level. This study, thus, attempts to fill this research gap. Accordingly, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. “Methodology and sources of data” section outlines the methodology and sources of data for the study. “Results” section presents the results. In “Discussion” section, the findings are discussed. “Conclusion” section concludes the study.",3

This is consequent on the fact that the economies of oil-net-exporting nations are often exposed to macroeconomic shocks caused by volatility in the prices of crude oil and are often bedevilled by mismanagement of oil rents. Again, the recent crash in the international crude oil price between 2013 and 2016, which threw many net-oil-exporting nations into recession, calls for practical fiscal actions. For instance, oil price fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016 from $100 per barrel in 2013 and stood around $70 per barrel in November 2018 (BPS 2018). More importantly, resource-rich developing nations lack the governance mechanisms to translate resource wealth to economic progress, thereby giving credence to the resource curse and Dutch disease syndromes. Hence, their fiscal deficit management situation is critical in shaping the effect of natural resource on growth. Deficit financing can be very crucial for resource-rich nations to translate their huge resource earnings to economic growth (Farzanegan 2011). The experience of countries like Norway, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Kuwait attests to the fact that effective fiscal response from resource-wealthy nations can help to reduce the resource curse syndrome and lower the effect of the Dutch disease on the lagging sectors of the economy. According to Usui (1997), Indonesia escaped wisely the expansionary impact of booms in crude oil earnings by sterilising part of its oil largesse. It also hedged against the Dutch disease by spending its oil wealth on a tradable non-oil sector like manufacturing and agriculture, which formed the productive base of the nation. This made it possible to spread the growth of the booming sector to the lagging sectors and provide an escape route from economic instability that is caused by increased crude oil earnings. Similarly, Mehrara and Oskoui (2007) affirmed that Indonesia’s structural reforms in diversifying its economy provided stability against oil shocks and made it possible to absorb the unexpected shocks that would have retarded output growth severely. The study also stated that Kuwait and Norway established savings and stabilisation fund to stabilise their economies against oil shocks and boost output growth. Meanwhile, macroeconomic changes in both Iran and Saudi Arabia were caused by crude oil price shocks because their fiscal responses fell short of those in Indonesia, Norway, and Kuwait. Thus, the experiences of these resource-wealthy nations mean that the fiscal actions taken to manage resource wealth can provide the missing link between natural resource abundance and output growth. Furthermore, the resource curse advocates argue that resource-rich nations are often submerged in crisis around every resource-rich zone of their countries. This means that owning resource brings great curses to the nations and inhibit economic progress (Allcott and Keniston 2017; Doro and Kufakurinani 2018; Charles et al. 2018). The crisis witnessed in the oil-producing region in Nigeria’s Niger Delta attests to the resource curse syndrome. Also, the situation in several oil-producing areas in African countries like Angola and Libya reinforces the resource curse syndrome in Africa. However, the inability of the resource-wealthy nations to translate abundant resource earnings to growth might not rest solely with such social and economic unrests, but might also depend on the efficiency of their fiscal policy rules. Studies like Bulte et al. (2005), Gylfason and Zoega (2006), Perry and Olivera (2009), and Eregha and Mesagan (2016) associated resource-rich nations with a high level of corruption and mismanagement of resource rents. This means that there is a tendency for government expenditure to outweigh revenues in most of these countries. Moreover, the recent crash in the international crude oil price threw many of the net-oil-exporting countries into recession with massive job losses. Evidence from the African Development Bank (2018) shows that the losses were massive in countries like Angola,Footnote 1 NigeriaFootnote 2, Egypt,Footnote 3 Algeria,Footnote 4 Libya,Footnote 5 and Equatorial Guinea.Footnote 6 Therefore, without enough oil revenues, African countries resort to budgeting for deficits, thereby necessitating fiscal expansions. To this end, this paper examines the extent to which deficit financing is utilised by resource-rich African nations to manage their economies by employing the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) to analyse the country-specific data for the selected five countries between 1980 and 2017. The reason is that past studies have often omitted discussions on deficit financing (Bulte et al. 2005; Gylfason and Zoega 2006; Allcott and Keniston 2017; Ben-Salha et al. 2018; Mesagan et al. 2019). However, it is interesting to note that the ways by which nations finance deficit (i.e. composition of fiscal deficits) matters for growth enhancement. This is because the impact may be different if the fiscal deficit is financed by borrowing within the economy, outside the economy or through debt monetisation. For instance, financing deficits from local sources may crowd-out private investment and inhibit economic growth (Omojolaibi et al. 2016; Mesagan and Bello 2018). Also, financing deficits through debt monetisation by selling domestic debts to foreign nations signifies fiscal expansion, which is growth enhancing. When debt monetisation arises from the purchase of government bonds by the apex bank, the resultant increase in money supply can trigger inflation depending on the domestic productive capacity (Eregha et al. 2015; Mesagan and Shobande 2016; Rieck and Schuknecht 2018). When the local productive capacity increases to meet the rising inflation, it leads to economic boom and growth results. Hence, examining such phenomenon in resource-rich African countries is very important since they are prone to the Dutch disease and resource curse syndromes. More so, previously related studies have employed mostly panel analysis, which does not reveal much about the individual country effects. This informs why this present study conducts a time-series analyses on the selected five African nations representing each sub-region in the continent. We choose these countries because they earn the highest revenue from either crude oil or gold (i.e. total natural resource rent) in their respective sub-regions (World BankFootnote 72019). Hence, it is a comparative study on Angola, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania. This allows analysing the situation in every nation rather than just combining them as one entity, through panel analysis, since they have their respective fiscal management systems. Therefore, to achieve our broad goal, the study determines the effect of natural resource rent on output growth. It examines the impact of deficit financing on output growth and then analyses the growth effects of exchange rate in these countries. The first and third objectives help to determine the problems of resource curse and Dutch disease syndromes, respectively, in these countries. Also, this study makes a major contribution to the natural resource literature by considering an important issue like deficit financing in the resource-growth link. More importantly, since African countries are usually found at the lowest scale of translating resource wealth to economic progress, the study is vital for the continent. With this contribution, the study has thrown up an important topic that should interest researchers in further deepening the discussion on deficit financing in resource-richFootnote 8 countries. Hence, the findings show that the resource curse syndrome is only found in South Africa but absent in Angola, Egypt, Nigeria, and Tanzania, while the sign of the exchange rate in our subsequent analysis indicates that Dutch disease is not a problem in Egypt, Tanzania, and South Africa, but it is a problem in both Nigeria and Angola. The deficit financing result suggests that both Angola and South Africa have been able to translate fiscal deficit into growth, unlike the case in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Egypt. Therefore, these findings provide an eye-opener that could be explored further in the literature.",10
21,2,Journal of Social and Economic Development,08 August 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-019-00079-9,Gender pay gap in the workplace: the case of public and private sectors in Nigeria,December 2019,Taiwo Aderemi,Ibrahim Alley,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The need to reduce the gender pay gap has been an ongoing concern in developing countries. Although, evidence points to marginal narrowing of gender differentials in educational attainment, political appointments, economic participation and health survival over the years (WEF 2015), little is known about the gender pay differentials that exist in the public and private sectors. The structure and ways of employee entry and selection into these sectors differ significantly, and therefore, gender pay gap would also differ. Since the extent to which an individual participates in the labour market and remunerated can determine the status of the household and the risk of poverty (Ogwumike et al. 2010), it is worthwhile examining this topic. The gender gap in Nigeria has improved only marginally over the years as shown by the gender gap index computed by the World Economic Forum (2015). It increased from 0.610 in 2006 to 0.638 in 2015.Footnote 1 Components of the index show that there has been improvement in the economic participation and political empowerment index over the years. Educational attainment and health index are also approaching the equality line of 1. The economic participation index has as a sub-index, the wage equality for similar work which scored 0.76 in 2015. Although this score is gradually approaching the equality line, the index does not give information on the gender pay gap by work sector. This information is relevant for policy formulation. At the point of entry into the labour market, women are confronted by selection into a particular sector or the other (Bargain and Melly 2008). While some selections are self-imposed, others are imposed by the system. The self-imposed constraints include factors such as location of spouse’s workplace, human capital qualities, while system-imposed factors take the form of family-friendly policies, culture, regional resource allocation and marriage. It is well established that married women consider such factors when taking decisions on job and sector choice (see Nwaka et al. 2016; Guven-Lisaniler et al. 2018). The non-random allocation of workers into sectors, as an evidence of heterogenous labour market in Nigeria is documented by Guven-Lisaniler et al. (2018). System-imposed selection is more prevalent in the Nigerian private sector, where some categories of women are discriminated against. Some private sectors do not permit new employees to take maternity leave or conceive in the first 2 years of securing a job, while some occupations are naturally biased against women. This is not often so in the public sector.Footnote 2 It is generally believed that government is less discriminatory against women in employment (Bargain and Melly 2008). Jobs in the public sector are, however, often rationed, stricter, based on regional allocation and more often on personal connections. This often leaves out potential women workers who would want to want work in the public sector. All these factors play significant roles in influencing the gender pay gap in the private and public sectors, such that different outcomes could ensue. Despite women’s increasing educational attainment as shown in Table 1, overall gender wage gap is still widening and persistent both in the public and private sectors. It is surprising that women’s high performance in educational attainment, which is supposed to increase earnings capacity, has not significantly helped in closing the gender pay gap. This reinforces the need to examine the unexplained component of the wage gap. This is the focus of this present study, which aims to provide estimates and the decomposition of the wage gap in 2008/2009. The periods after the transition to a democratic system of government have been marked by series of reforms to promote gender equality. By doing so, this study adds to the handful of the literature on this topic in Nigeria and other developing countries. Related studies on Nigeria have only examined pay differentials in the private and public sectors, wage inequality in rural farm versus non-rural farm segment and gender wage dichotomy arising from employment type (see Aminu 2011; Hertz et al. 2008; Nwaka et al. 2016; Guven-Lisaniler et al. 2018). Although, Nwaka et al. (2016) observed a gender wage gap in paid employment, which is largely attributed to discrimination effect particularly at the upper spectrum of the wage distribution, the authors did not distinguish between public and private sectors. Further extension of their research in Guven-Lisaniler et al. (2018) also implicitly noted the possibility of a gender wage gap in the private and self-employment sectors, reflected by the negative and significant female coefficient in the analysis. This, however, does not suffice for policy guidance. Examining the existence and magnitude of gender pay gap, separately for the public and private sectors as is the focus of this present study, will reveal how much of the observed earnings gap is attributed to observable characteristics which are rewarded by the labour market and discrimination effects. This would give policy makers specific direction on addressing the wage gap in employment, rather than adopting a one-cap-fits-all approach. The authors used the General Household Survey (GHS) 2012/2013, which is a panel longitudinal data. This survey, although nationally representative, is limited in scope as it covers only 5000 households. It is also a sub-sample of the cross-sectional GHS.Footnote 3 We used the most current wave of the Nigerian Living Standards Survey (2009), a more comprehensive data than the GHS. We do not expect our results to be compromised due to the choice of the survey year adopted in this study, as our interest is not in tracking the longitudinal nature of households’ characteristics overtime. Similarly, this would allow for comparison of our findings with related existing studies. Furthermore, findings from this study will give policy makers a direction on the relative importance of factors requiring immediate policy action in order to narrow the wage gap. It would also facilitate a better policy target in addressing gender inequality. Studies of this nature could also show that that the one-cap-fits-all policy intervention measures in addressing gender pay gap in the country may not be appropriate, due to inherent differences in private and public sectors structure. Two objectives are set in this paper. The first is to examine the gender wage gap in the private and public sectors, separately at the mean in 2009. The second objective aims at investigating the role of discrimination at workplace in influencing the gender gap.",4

In the dynamic perspective, whether public expenditure accelerates economic growth, which components of government expenditure are more productive and how fiscal policy becomes sustainable in the long run are very crucial issues in the context of public finance and policy (Meltzer and Richard 1981; Aschauer 1989; Alesina and Rodrick 1994; Barro1990; Devarajan et al. 1996; Bruce and Turnovsky 1999). Aschauer (1989) examines the effect of public expenditure on growth via its impact on productivity, and his empirical study shows that stock of non-military public capital, specially roads and highways, airports, water management system are very important in determining productivity and growth. Barro (1990) shows in his paper on endogenous growth with government spending that public expenditure enhances growth by increasing efficiency of labour. However, growth rate increases up to a certain level of taxation, and thereafter, growth rate declines with increase in tax rate. Meltzer and Richard (1981) have defined size of the government by the ratio of public expenditure to GDP assuming that public expenditure is equal to taxation. Using Median Voter theory, this study shows that if inequality is high in the society, there will be demand for larger government. To finance greater spending of the government, tax burden will be higher on the people and this will adversely affect investment and growth. Similar argument has been put forward by Alesina and Rodrick (1994) and Persson and Tabellini (1994). Their argument is that taxation and public expenditure are considered to be important instruments of redistribution in the society. So, if inequality is high, greater taxes will be imposed on income and capital, and this will cause hindrances to economic growth. However, taxation and government spending may not be the only mechanism for redistribution. Marjit et al. (2006) demonstrated that informalization of the economy can be an alternative route to redistributive politics and it can adversely impact economic growth by hampering activities in the formal sector. Besides, the idea of optimal fiscal policy (OFP) does not always mean aiming at maximization of growth. The government very often adopts distributive policies and spends more on unproductive or less productive heads ignoring long-term growth just to ensure its electoral gain (Sasmal 2011; Marjit and Maity 2006). Whether such distributive policy is sustainable in the long run is a pertinent question. Sarkar (2006) shows that political stability can very well coexist with economic stagnation in the society. Citing examples from the state of West Bengal in India, Sarkar (2006) shows that there is stability of the government for a long period despite stagnation in the economy. However, a different kind of political culture and election machinery may be necessary for that purpose. There are counter examples also. Sasmal and Sasmal (2018) demonstrate that the government depends on public debt for distributive policies in addition to taxation, but if public expenditure fails to generate sufficient income and tax revenue fiscal policy becomes unsustainable in the long run. So far as the effect of government spending on economic growth is concerned, the common wisdom suggests that expenditure on the development of infrastructure like road and railways, power generation, irrigation, telecommunication, etc., which are lacking in the developing countries is necessary to accelerate economic growth (Sasmal and Sasmal 2016). On the other hand, public expenditures on health, education, social welfare and cultural activities are generally of distributive nature and it takes time to get reflected in growth and productivity in the country. Distributive expenses like pension, subsidies, allowances and direct transfers are necessary for social welfare, but they are generally considered as non-developmental expenditures. Banerjee and Newman (1993) and Galor and Zeira (1993) have argued that if redistributive policies and social development expenditures can enhance human capital, they can accelerate growth. Conversely, if the implementation of welfare schemes becomes difficult due to poor governance, corruption and leakage of funds, distributive policies fail to bring desired results. In the analysis of the effect of public expenditure on economic growth, what will be the composition of public expenditure and which components of government spending are more productive are important questions. Several important studies have addressed these issues and obtained mixed results. Devarajan et al. (1996) have conducted an important study in this regard. Their study theoretically shows that capital expenditure may not raise economic growth if its initial share is high. The current expenditure of the government has been found more productive than capital expenditure in their empirical study based on cross-country data. Ghosh and Gregoriou (2008) have found similar results. These results have contradicted the findings of Barro (1991) and Chen (2006), which have shown that capital expenditure of the government has positive impact on growth. Agenor (2008) establishes the importance of infrastructure and demonstrates that government expenditure helps economic growth if human capital is formed by the development of necessary infrastructure for schooling and skill formation. In respect of distributive politics, Sasmal (2011) shows that the government allocates greater share of funds on less productive heads at the cost of long-term growth to maximize its political gain. Marjit et al. (2013) have shown in a study in the Indian context that capital expenditure of the government and public expenditure on infrastructure have significant positive impact on economic growth, whereas revenue expenditure has negative impact on per capita income. To meet the growing requirement of funds for populist and somewhat unproductive schemes, the government very often resorts to the policy of public borrowing. Bruce and Turnovsky (1999) question the long-run viability of such policy. Sasmal and Sasmal (2018) also express doubt on the sustainability of fiscal policy when distributive policies are financed by public borrowing, but public expenditure fails to generate growth and revenue collection. In the literature of public expenditure and economic growth, we get two types of studies—country-specific analysis over time and cross-country analysis using panel regression. Leeper et al. (2010), Afonso and Furceri (2010), Zhang (2015), Magazzino and Forte (2016) and Kalaitzidakis and Tzouvelekas (2011) have conducted country-specific studies and included some additional factors in explaining the relationship between public expenditure and economic growth. Leeper et al. (2010) have theoretically examined the effect of public investment on growth in a neoclassical framework. Admitting the importance of public capital in growth, this paper shows that delay in implementation of public projects or distorted financing of public projects may have contractionary effects on growth. Afonso and Furceri (2010) have shown that size and volatility of government revenue and spending have negative impact on growth. Kalaitzidakis and Tzouvelekas (2011) have demonstrated using a theoretical model how optimally the government fund is allocated among different public investments to maximize growth. Magazzino and Forte (2016) have shown that the relationship between the share of public expenditure in GDP and economic growth is inverted U-shaped. The implication of the result is that in the initial stage, growth increases with increase in expenditure share and after a certain point, growth declines with higher share of public expenditure in GDP. Zang (2015) has developed a multi-sector growth model with public expenditure. The model shows that public expenditure unevenly affects the productivity of different sectors. In effect, ratio of factor prices changes leading to structural change in the economy. The implication is that output elasticity of public expenditure is different in different sectors. Marrero (2010), Saez et al. (2017) and Gnangoin et al. (2019) are important cross-country studies in the recent time. While analysing optimal fiscal policy in OECD countries over time, Marrero (2010) has examined the relationship between tax-mix and composition of public expenditure in the growth process. There are two types of taxation in the economy—direct tax on income and indirect tax on consumption. On the other hand, public expenditure includes public investment and public consumption. The study concludes that over the years, the tax system has been more intensive in direct tax, while public expenditure has been more intensive in public consumption. That means, as growth takes place, the country is depending more on direct tax for revenue collection and spending more on public utility. In the study of Saez et al. (2017), the impact of public expenditure on growth is not very clear. Gnangoin et al. (2019) showed in a study on 19 Asian countries that current government consumption reduces economic growth, while domestic investment and quality controls are helpful for growth. This paper aims at analysing the composition of public expenditure and its impact on per capita income in the major states of India incorporating the political economy of government spending. Some important works are available on the relationship between public expenditure and economic growth in the Indian context. Mahapatra and Giri (2016) show that non-developmental expenditures and revenue expenditure have no significant effect on growth in India, while the study of Gangal and Gupta (2013) finds positive impact of total public expenditure on GDP in the country. The time-series analysis of Ahmad (2014), however, shows that public expenditure and GDP in India are cointegrated. But in the test of causality, it found that GDP causes public expenditure, not the other way around. The work of Seshaiah et al. (2018) in the Indian context shows that general government expenditure has positive impact on economic growth along with FDI and dummy variables capturing economic crisis and economic reforms. The studies have analysed the impact of public expenditure on growth for the country as a whole and without any theoretical framework. The present study tries to contribute to the literature by conducting the study across major states of India and using theoretical structure to explain growth in a balanced budget framework. The existing literature has considered various aspects of public expenditure and their impact on economic growth. However, the political economy of government spending is almost absent in the existing studies. Where does the government spend and why is a big question in public finance and public economics. The government is not always guided by the goal of maximizing growth. The decisions in public expenditure are different under different political systems. In a democratic set-up or under a competitive political situation, the government definitely aims at increasing the welfare of the people, but at the same, it protects its political interest and takes decisions on the budgetary allocations accordingly. One important objective of this paper is to address this political issue. The motivation of this paper comes from the fact that the government may deliberately or consciously allocate greater share of funds to less productive or unproductive heads and adopts populist measures to strengthen its electoral base. It may resort to distributive politics ignoring the problems of growing fiscal deficit, and low rate of economic growth. The justification of choosing India for empirical verification of the theoretical propositions is that India is a vast country with federal structure and multi-party democratic set-up. Moreover, there is single-party majority rule or coalition government in the states at the same time. So, political decisions may be different. And also, there are anti-incumbency factors in election. On the other side, there are various interest groups including poor, rich, farmers, workers, business groups, government employees and so on. The party in power has the compulsion to consolidate its vote bank by providing facilities and concessions to different groups. The components of public expenditures in the literature are described as public capital and public consumption, public investment and public services, and disaggregated components of expenditure on health, education, nutrition, etc. As per the norms of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the expenditure of the government is broadly classified into two categories: revenue expenditure (RE) and capital expenditure (CE). The share of revenue expenditure in the total spending of the government has increased over time in India and in the Indian states. Revenue expenditure includes a wide variety of expenditures like salary and wages, payment of interest on public debt, subsidy, pension, allowances and expenditures on the schemes of social welfare many of which are less productive or unproductive. The capital expenditure, on the other hand, generally makes investment for capital formation and development of infrastructure necessary for economic growth. The government is myopic in the sense that it aims at retaining power by strengthening its majority support. The electorates too prefer direct and immediate benefits from government because they are not sure about their gain from long-term growth. To sum up, this paper will analyse the nature of public expenditure and its impact on per capita income in the major states of India taking the political aspects of government spending into consideration. It will also try to explain why the government allocates greater share of funds to revenue expenditure. The whole study will be supported by theoretical arguments and results of econometric analysis. In econometric analysis, the technique of panel regression has been used to estimate the impact of various components of public expenditure on per capita income. Some variables have been included as controls in the regression equations. Since data from major states of India have been used for this study, heterogeneity among the states is much less compared to cross-country data and this is likely to give better results. To avoid endogeneity problem, the data on per capita income have been taken in forward lag as in Devarajan et al. (1996). The paper has been arranged as follows: the theoretical framework of the work has been presented in section two. Data and Methodology have been discussed in section three. The results of the econometric analysis have been presented and explained in section four. Section five gives the conclusions of the study.",6

Farmers constitute a major portion of the subaltern population in agrarian economies like India (Dhar 2018). Sustainable agricultural practices are claimed to be the key to the social and economic advancement of subaltern farmers in India (Asiabaka 2002; Brown 2018). Analyzing the sustainable agricultural practices, through farmers’ networks, has yielded some generalizable inferences in the past (Kumbamu 2009). Narratives presented by farmers are often used in rural developmental studies (Rai and Smucker 2016). Such is the objective of the present study. On the evening of December 6, 2016, a process of long interview (following, Nelson 2001) was undertaken with the State Marketing Manager, of the state of West Bengal in India, regarding the progress of a special project of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO). The aforementioned project was on the “Soil Health Rejuvenation and Productivity Enhancement” (SHR-PE) in the district of Murshidabad, in the state of West Bengal in India. “The dedicated team of IFFCO, for the special project, has enabled the substantial progress that has been made in the last couple of years,” was the proud and passionate affirmation by the State Marketing Manager. The positive influence of this project seems to have spread over numerous villages in the district of Murshidabad, and there appears to be a manifold increase in the number of beneficiaries. Murshidabad district of West Bengal is often considered the “crop museum” of the state because of its favorable agro-climate and soil conditions with a diversified cropping pattern (Mukherjee 2018). The district has an agrarian economy, as more than 85% of the population directly or indirectly depends upon agriculture and agri-allied sector (Biswas 2017). Cropping intensity of the district is 234 percent, while only fifty five percent of the cultivable land is under irrigation (Biswas 2017). Although the agriculture in the district recorded some achievements, still more than thirty percent of the population lives below the poverty line (Chattopadhyay 2010). Figure 1 shows the location of Murshidabad district. The present experiment is aimed at understanding the impact of the special project of IFFCO on socioeconomic development of the intended subaltern beneficiaries in rural Bengal. Since the present study was intended as an experiment, a control group of farmers in neighboring villages, the ones where no project interventions were made, were also interviewed (control group).

Effiong,Godwin E. Esu,Chuku Chuku,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"As African countries await the birth of the African Monetary Union and the adoption of a single currency, this move no doubt raises numerous challenges, which among others include the potential economic adjustments, and more importantly, the relationship between economic policies and the real economy.Footnote 1 Primary among such issues is that monetary policy changes of the proposed African Central Bank will become even more difficult with possible asymmetric impact across countries. Therefore, a better appreciation of this issue requires deeper understanding of the fundamental determinants of monetary policy effectiveness on economic activity in the continent. In this paper, we focus on financial sector development as a plausible determinant, and thus examine whether the financial development exert considerable influence on the effectiveness of monetary policy for macroeconomic stabilization in Africa. Current views on the monetary transmission mechanism assign a crucial role to financial sector development—and the overall financial structure—in understanding the effectiveness of monetary policy actions on output and prices. Essentially, monetary policy transmission is a financial process with the financial system as the conduit through which monetary policy impulses affect the real economy. In fact, both the traditional money and credit channels of monetary policy transmission operate through the financial system. The credit channel, in particular, predicts a strong monetary transmission mechanism due to financial market imperfections in the financial system, and thus an amplified effect of monetary policy on the real economy (see Bernanke and Gertler 1995). Hence, the degree of financial sector development is considered important in explaining monetary policy effectiveness as the efficacy of monetary policy crucially depends on the structure and condition of the financial system (Carranza et al. 2010; Mishra et al. 2012; Ma and Lin 2016). Although the relationship between financial development and monetary policy effectiveness is complex, the general consensus is that a well-functioning financial system is a prerequisite for effective monetary policy transmission. However, differences in countries’ financial structure can lead to substantial differences in the monetary transmission mechanism, and in turn, possible asymmetric effects of monetary policy. For instance, increased financial innovation in an economy with a developed and competitive financial sector tends to reduce monetary policy effectiveness, since it provides an insurance mechanism for private agents against unanticipated monetary shocks and expenditure volatility, whereas it could be stronger for economies with a weak financial system but high dependence on bank credit. With undercapitalized banks, credit expansion is significantly constrained, and monetary policy may become less effective or at best have a long-time staggered effect on the real economy (Carranza et al. 2010). Thus, both positive and negative relationships can be rationalized for the nexus between financial development and monetary policy effectiveness.Footnote 2 So far, empirical analysis on the relationship is relatively nascent as only a limited number of studies have examined the question of whether financial development influences the effectiveness of monetary policy. Most of these studies are dominated by micro- and macro-analysis of the relationship for developed economies such as the Euro area and the USA, with few exceptions including some developing countries in their samples (see e.g. Carranza et al. 2010; Ma and Lin 2016). Overall, empirical evidence on the relationship is mixed and inconclusive. This paper contributes to the stream of existing literature by investigating the effects of financial development on monetary policy effectiveness vis-á-vis output growth and inflation in Africa. Although there are several discussions on monetary policy in Africa as well as the role of the financial system (see e.g. Ncube 2008; Kasekende and Brownbridge 2011; Heintz and Ndikumana 2011; Khan 2011), empirical evidence on the relationship is considerably lacking. To the best of the our knowledge, only Saxegaard (2006) has examined the relationship within the context of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and with particular focus on excess liquidity and its consequent effect on monetary policy effectiveness. Hence, there is need for further empirical analysis to shed more light on the effects of financial development on monetary policy in the African continent. Such analysis has wider implications for both monetary and financial stability in the region as African economies become increasingly interdependent through financial markets integration and the various initiatives for regional economic and financial cooperation. Hence, annual data from 1990–2015 period for a panel of 39 African countries is used to estimate the relationship between financial development and the effects of monetary policy on output growth and inflation. The empirical evidence shows that there is a weak statistical relationship between financial development and monetary policy effectiveness in Africa. Specifically, no evidence of the relationship is observed for output growth, while a negative contemporaneous relationship exists in the case of inflation. The balance of this paper is organized as follows. Second section provides a background literature on the nexus between financial development and the effects of monetary policy. Third section develops the estimation strategy vis-á-vis the econometric model and data description. Fourth section conducts the empirical analysis and discusses the estimation results, and fifth section concludes.",3

V. Subba Rao,Asit Ranjan Mohanty,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"With increasing decentralization, Indian states are entrusted with more responsibility to provide public goods and services, investment in physical and social infrastructure. To fulfill these objectives, they need more fiscal flexibility in the form of public expenditure. Financing infrastructure and developmental expenditure through fiscal deficit could stimulate private sector investment. However, this may lead to both rising interest payment and debt burden through accumulation of outstanding debt, and if left uncontrolled then it can cause macroeconomic instability. India faced an acute financial crisis in 1999, and average fiscal deficit of central government was over 6% of GDP during 1994–1999. At the end of FY 1999, Central government’s liabilities were about 50% of GDP. At the end of 1998–1999, total Central government liabilities at Rs. 875,625 crores outstripped its total assets at book value of Rs. 528,399 crores at the end of FY 1999. This gap was due to accumulation of debt to finance revenue account.Footnote 1 High fiscal deficit, rising interest burden and huge debt burden triggered fiscal unsustainability and macroeconomic instability in India. In order to address this fiscal stress and macroeconomic shock, a set of fiscal rules were legislated in 2003 as Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBMA) Act. The major objective of FRBMA is to bring in fiscal sustainability by containing fiscal deficit. The states in India had started implementing this rule-based FRBMA since 2003 to improve fiscal discipline. The rule-based FRBMA has prescribed a cap on fiscal deficit at 3% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) for the states in India. However, the states can make an upward revision of fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio to 3.5% if interest burden ratio and debt burden ratio are below fifteen percent and twenty-five percent, respectively, provided there is no deficit in revenue account. Now, question arises whether limiting the fiscal deficit at 3% is delivering required economic growth for Indian states. Certain observations invoke this curiosity, some of which are noteworthy. The state’s expenditure share in central government’s total expenditure is showing an upward trend, rising from 93% in 2007–2008 to 2011–2012 to 110% in 2012–2013 to 2016–2017. Further, states total expenditure to states own revenue has increased from 204% in 2007–2008 to 2011–2012 to 213% in 2012–2013 to 2016–2017. This suggests that states require more revenue to finance their expenditure demand. This can be done through increasing fiscal deficit. Thus, the above figures suggest that states now have greater fiscal burden which necessitates higher fiscal deficit. So, restricting states within 3% limit is unlikely to deliver desired level of economic growth. In view of the above, this study makes an attempt to examine whether the fiscal deficit limit of 3% as prescribed by the FRBMA is justified. In nutshell, the study estimates a threshold level of fiscal deficit which boosts economic growth in Indian states. Toward this objective, a threshold regression approach due to Khan and Senhadji (2001) is employed for 16 non-special category states of India. This study is envisioned to contribute the existing literature in the following ways. Firstly, this study is first of its kind to estimate a threshold level of fiscal deficit for sixteen states taken together. There is no study that examines the impact of fiscal deficit limit set by FRBMA on the economic growth. Secondly, there are different income categories of states which have their different spending needs. For instance, middle- and low-income states would likely to spend more to achieve higher economic growth, so as to match up with high-income states. So, estimating a single threshold level may not serve the purpose, and therefore, threshold level of fiscal deficit is estimated for high-, middle- and low-income categories of states. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section “Link between fiscal deficit and economic growth” discusses the link between fiscal deficit and economic growth. Section “Stylized facts” provides some stylized facts about state fiscal deficit. Section “Literature review” presents relevant past studies. Section “Data and variables” gives description about data and variables. The model specification details and methodology are given in the section “Empirical methodology.” Section “Empirical findings” presents the empirical results. Finally, concluding remarks are offered in the section “Conclusion and policy implication.”",2
22,2,Journal of Social and Economic Development,17 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-020-00103-3,A new perspective into the relationship between CEO pay and firm performance: evidence from Nigeria’s listed firms,December 2020,Clement Olalekan Olaniyi,Olaolu Richard Olayeni,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"CEO pay as one of the most intensely researched and debated corporate governance mechanisms has continued to pull academic scrutiny (Bao et al. 2020; Abudy et al. 2020; Shang et al. 2020). Studies have identified and established the possible two-way causal relationship between firm performance and CEO pay (Aslam et al. 2019; Al Farooque et al. 2019; Elsayed and Elbardan 2018; Olaniyi et al. 2017; Buck et al. 2008; Choo and Tan 2004). On the one side, some studies make CEO pay to be a function of firm performance. This explains that the pay is based on performance. Where CEOs are paid based on changes in firm performance. Thus, CEO pay is seen as a reward for performance (Bhuyan et al. 2020; Buck et al. 2008). On the other side, firm performance is modelled as a function of CEO pay (Olaniyi and Obembe 2015). It suggests that CEO pay is an incentive or motivation for CEOs to pursue an increase in firm value which triggers better performance (Olaniyi et al. 2017a). Meanwhile, all the extant studies were based on the assumption of no asymmetric structure in the causal link between CEO pay and firm performance. A myriad of previously published works have acknowledged the importance of asymmetric structure in the nexus (Olaniyi 2019; Cordeiro et al. 2016; Bell and Van Reenen 2016; Campbell and Thompson 2015; Canarella and Nourayi 2008; Harford and Li 2007; Nourayi 2006; Garvey and Milbourn 2006; Leone et al. 2006a, b; Dechow 2006; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001). It is, however, observed that this has not been extended to the causal link between CEO pay and firm performance. Thus, symmetric causality was assumed in existing studies. Previous studies believed that the causal impact of a positive shock and a negative shock in CEO pay and firm performance are the same in absolute terms and magnitudes (Olaniyi 2019). Provisions were not made for the separation between positive and negative shocks in the causal inference. This assumption might be unrealistic as there are many cases where there is potentially an asymmetric structure in the causal relationship (Hatemi-J 2012, 2019; Hatemi-J et al. 2016, 2018a, b). Previously published works covertly assumed that reactions to positive and negative shocks in CEO pay and firm performance are the same in the causality testing. It has, however, been argued and tested in the recent literature that people react differently to a positive shock compared to a negative one of the same magnitudes (Olanipekun et al. 2019; Hatemi-J 2019; Olaniyi 2019; Shahbaz et al. 2017; Hatemi-J and El-Khatib 2016; Hatemi-J 2012). People tend to react more to a negative shock than to a positive shock (Hatemi-J 2019). Shareholders are prone to react more to negative shocks in firm performance (Olaniyi 2019). While executives are prone to react more to negative shocks in their pay (unanticipated wage cut), shareholders tend to react more to positive shocks in executive compensation (unanticipated increase in pay), most especially when performance is poor. It has also been documented that executive pay packages are more sensitive to negative stock returns than to positive stock returns (Olaniyi 2019; Leone et al. 2006a, b). According to Hatemi-J (2012) and Hatemi-J et al. (2018a, b), another reason for the potential existence of asymmetric causal relationship could be due to the asymmetric information phenomenon. Following the tenet of agency theory, executive compensation contracts are designed to reduce the likelihood of exploitation of asymmetric information by professional managers so as to align the conflicting interests of managers with those of shareholders (Zhang et al. 2019; Bentley et al.2019; Omoregie and Kelikume 2019). Meanwhile, empirical studies, within the context of managerial power theory, have shown that executive compensation itself is not only seen as a solution to provide efficient incentive to executives but also part of the agency problem (Chen et al. 2019; Vo and Canil 2019; Choi et al. 2019; Hill et al. 2016; Bebchuk et al. 2011; Bebchuk and Fried 2003). It is argued that executive pay contracts often reflect some elements of managerial rent-seeking power where board politics favour executives to influence their pay packages (Olaniyi 2019; Conyon et al. 2019; Hoi et al. 2019; Cho et al. 2019; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001). This shows that the processes of designing appropriate and optimal executive pay package are often characterized by asymmetric information phenomenon (Lyu et al. 2018). In addition, studies had shown that there could be cases where CEOs were rewarded for good performance but not punished for bad performance (Olaniyi 2019; Geys et al. 2017; Sheikh et al. 2018; Campbell and Thompson 2015; Feriozzi 2011; Garvey and Milbourn 2006). This implies there is high likelihood that compensation contracts can be rigged by powerful CEOs by meddling the board affairs to extract additional rent (Cho et al. 2019; Agrawal and Nasser 2019; Song and Wan 2019; Choi et al. 2019; Fung and Pecha 2018; Morse et al. 2011). Thus, asymmetric information phenomenon needs to be captured while linking executive pay to performance (Nourayi 2006), most especially in the atmosphere of weak institutions and poor corporate governance practices (Olaniyi 2019). Several studies have confirmed that the sensitivity between executive compensation and firm performance is asymmetric (Cordeiro et al. 2016; Bell and Van Reenen 2016; Canarella and Nourayi 2008; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001). Hence, the assumption of no asymmetric structure and opportunistic behaviour in executive compensation contracts is not tenable. There is tendency for executive compensation to aggravate agency problem instead of mitigating it (Vo and Canil 2019; Olaniyi and Obembe 2015; Bebchuk and Fried 2003). Thus, limiting the empirical examination of the causality between CEO pay and firm performance to symmetric approach may be suboptimal and inappropriate. Moreover, there are other reasons which show that asymmetric structure in the causal link between CEO pay and firm performance cannot be neglected. Empirical studies have established the likelihood of nonlinear relationship between CEO pay and firm performance (Olaniyi 2019; Rasoava 2019; Kourtzidis and Tzeremes 2019; Kuo et al. 2014; Ferrero-Ferrero et al. 2014; Leone et al. 2006a, b; Nourayi 2006; Barkema and Pennings 1998; Kaplan 1994; Wilson et al. 1992) but none examined the causality between the two variables within the framework of nonlinearity and asymmetric structure. Meanwhile, it has been argued that decomposing variables into positive and negative shocks reveal nonlinear relationship better (Hatemi-J 2019; Hatemi-J et al. 2018a, b; Schorderet 2004; Granger and Yoon 2002) and it equally portrays asymmetric structure in their trends (Olaniyi 2019; Hatemi-J 2012; Garvey and Milbourn 2006). Similarly, the prevailing symmetric approaches of causality in subsisting studies cannot reveal the behaviour of various pairs of sensitivities of shocks, both negative and positive, in executive compensation and firm performance. It could be difficult to detect such symmetrically. It may require a more sophisticated methodology. This is tenable because there is a tendency for powerful CEOs to be insulated from bad performance, while they are rewarded for good luck (Pan et al.u 2020; Shang et al. 2020; Olaniyi 2019; Davis and Hausman 2018; Francis et al. 2013; Jouber and Fakhfakh 2012; Garvey and Milbourn 2006). Also, there are cases of CEO compensation stickiness in empirical studies where CEOs use previous pay as an excuse not to accept pay cut when performance is poor (Olaniyi 2019; Raithatha and Komera 2016; Lu et al. 2015; Junxiong 2009; Garvey and Milbourn 2006). All these points justify the need to incorporate asymmetric structure in the causal link between CEO pay and firm performance. Premised on the reasons highlighted above, this study contributes to the general discussion by making the first empirical effort to examine asymmetric causality between CEO pay and firm performance following the footsteps of Hatemi-J (2011, 2012) and Hatemi-J et al. (2014). In specific term, the study is the first to examine asymmetric causality between CEO pay and firm performance. All the existing studies only considered asymmetric structure in the context of pay-for-performance principle. These studies were restricted to the asymmetric effect of firm performance on CEO pay. Similarly, a recent contribution by Olaniyi (2019) only examined asymmetric effect of firm performance on CEO pay without considering the possibility of asymmetric effect of CEO pay on performance of Nigeria’s listed firms. There is a need to explore whether firm performance also responds asymmetrically to changes in CEO pay. This was not examined by Olaniyi (2019). The study limits asymmetric analysis to the effect of one variable on the other neglecting the possible feedback effect. This may lead to model overestimation and simultaneity bias which could result in spurious estimates (Olaniyi et al. 2017a, b; Wintoki et al. 2012; Buck et al. 2008; Roodman 2008; Wooldridge 2002). Empirical studies, within the framework of symmetric approaches, have established two-way causal link between CEO pay and firm performance (Aslam et al. 2019; Olaniyi et al. 2017a). The cases for possible asymmetric structure and opportunistic tendencies in the nexus between CEO pay and firm performance have been argued in the managerial power theory (Bebchuk and Fried 2003; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001). Thus, this makes the assumption of symmetric responses between CEO pay and firm performance questionable. Thus, this study is refreshingly different from previous studies by considering asymmetric causal link between CEO pay and firm performance which has not been considered. This present study is significantly and substantially different from the study of Olaniyi (2019), which was limited to the asymmetric effect of firm performance on CEO pay, by exploring the asymmetric causality between the two variables. Olaniyi (2019) considered only one-way dimension of asymmetric structure ignoring the probable feedback effect from CEO pay to firm performance. The main contribution of this paper lies in testing and applying the asymmetric approach to the causal link between CEO pay and firm performance rather than asymmetric effect of one on the other prevalent in previous studies. The previous studies have been restricted to symmetric approaches. Also, studies have adopted a more robust two-step generalized method of moments developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) to estimate the causal relationship within the context of panel vector autoregressive model (Olaniyi et al. 2017a, b; Abrigo and Love 2016; Chen et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2011; Buck et al. 2008; Rousseau and Wachtel 2000). They argued that the approach captures and deals with the problem of endogeneity. Studies on the relationship between CEO pay and firm performance have identified the necessity of capturing the endogeneity problem (Khan et al. 2019; Olaniyi et al. 2017a; Buck et al. 2008, Lilling 2006). Also, it has been argued that the dynamic generalized method of moments performs better in the situation of small sample size and endogeneity, most especially when there are few periods with many cross-sectional units (Chen et al. 2014). Aside from the issue of endogeneity, this estimation technique also addresses the problem of unobserved heterogeneity and potential simultaneity bias between pay and performance (Aslam et al. 2019; Amewu and Alagidede 2019a, b; Lilling 2006). Thus, this study innovatively utilizes a more robust two-step dynamic panel generalized method of moments to estimate a dynamic panel vector by pairing the shocks in CEO pay and firm performance to capture the asymmetric structure in the nexus. In this regard, this study also contributes to the extant studies by extending this approach to asymmetric causality which has not been previously adopted. Annual data on Nigeria’s listed firms are adopted in this study. The choice and decision to utilize Nigeria’s data are strategic and appropriate. In a more recent time, stakeholders have raised concerns over the exponential increase in executive compensation and poor returns on investments in Nigeria’s listed firms (Olaniyi 2019; Olaniyi et al. 2017a; Olaniyi and Obembe 2017). This may have compounded the problem of poor corporate governance practices and weak institutional environment within which listed firms operate in Nigeria (Mbanyele 2020). The code of corporate governance practices for listed firms in Nigeria mandates the board of directors to determine the executive compensation. Meanwhile, weak institutional framework in the country tends to allow executives to exhibit opportunistic behaviour by making moves to influence the decision of the board so as to have say in what they earn in terms of salaries and bonuses. Weak quality of bureaucracy and widespread cases of corrupt practices in the country may also abet and aggravate the exploitations of asymmetric information which could result in executive pay packages that are not matched with performance. A more recent study has also reported asymmetric structure in the sensitivity of CEO compensation to changes in firm performance in Nigeria (Olaniyi 2019). Similarly, reckless and flamboyant lifestyles of professional managers in Nigeria have become worrisome to shareholders and scholars (Mbanyele 2020; Olaniyi 2019; Ojeka et al. 2019; Olaniyi et al. 2017a; Omoregie and Kelikume 2019, 2017; Olaniyi and Obembe 2017, 2015; Yusuf and Abubakar 2014). Thus, these characteristics have made Nigeria a compelling candidate for a separate study on the asymmetric structure in the causal relationship between CEO pay and firm performance.

Without the slightest doubt, migration has become the most visible symbol showing that North African people who migrate are suffering inequality, whether in terms of income, job opportunities, public service accessibility, well-being, or freedom. As a matter of fact, people move out of North Africa each year, seeking out opportunities in developed destination countries for narrowing the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Honestly speaking, inequality and lack of access to good quality services brought about a worsening of living conditions and serve as repellent factors in North African sending countries, and hence migration is a last resort for many North African people who look forward to gaining greater access to resources and opportunities in the receiving countries. A very crucial point to highlight is that a good number of migrants could stay in their home countries at home if they had equal rights and access to good-quality basic services, which in turn can be secured by enhancing institutional quality and fostering good governance practices that have a potent role to play in affecting the way wealth, income, political power, opportunities and public resources are distributed (Black et al. 2005). By the same token, it is worth bearing in mind that inequality also has a key role to play in deciding who should migrate, because not all poor people have the ability to migrate, and even those poor who may migrate illegally will endure harsh living conditions and face severe difficulties in getting jobs; contrariwise, highly educated and skilled people are not only more likely to migrate legally, they are also twice as likely to move to countries with more generous welfare benefits, and have better opportunities in the destination country’s labor market (Lucas 1997; De Haas 2011; Giulietti and Wahba 2013). Obviously, inequality is one of the most pressing challenges facing North African countries. Despite measurement issues, it is generally accepted that inequality has further widened, rippling throughout the region. Tremendous inequality can cause a general social dysfunction by narrowing the poor’s access to health care, education, and job opportunities and hence compounding poverty and putting further pressure on the lower social strata. It can also foment class hatred and sedulously preach the class war, adding to the unfolding political turmoil that threatens to engulf the entire region and inevitably frustrate economic growth. Much of the literature examining the skilled–unskilled wage gap has somewhat ignored the crucial role played by good-quality institutions and efficient resource allocation, but things are in fact quite distinct. The harsh effects of inequality can be mitigated by good governance that literally ensures equal access to publicly provided goods and services for all segments of the population, especially through policies explicitly prohibiting discrimination against the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in society (UNRISD 2010). From the early nineties to the present, the bloated public service, linked with chronic decline in the accessibility and affordability of basic health and education services, has contributed powerfully to growing inequality within the North Africa region. As a matter of fact, gender gaps, rural–urban divides, regional and socioeconomic disparities became even more pronounced (Tiliouine and Estes 2016). In the majority of North African countries, inequality is tightly linked with unsuccessful regional development initiatives that have certainly contributed to putting limits on market-oriented reforms and socioeconomic development. Moreover, weak and substandard anti-corruption regulations are coterminous with a deterioration in the quality of public service delivery, thus anchoring and giving teeth to inequality in most North African countries. In fact, North African governments have demonstrated willingness to crackdown on corruption and ensure more efficient delivery of public services in their efforts to alleviate inequality, but unfortunately, these countries’ efforts to adopt market-driven public sector reform policies and private sector promotion programs, yielded futile outcomes primarily because of utter unseriousness, planlessness and the choice of turning a blind eye to blatant corruption (Tiliouine and Estes 2016; Belhaj Hassine 2015). Obsolete educational systems and endemic corruption associated with an excessively swollen public sector, are the root causes of the stark inequality in the North Africa region. A pronounced urban bias in North African countries’ development strategies has reinforced endowment differences, making the poor poorer and further hollowing out the middle class. The deteriorating living standards, outrageous corruption, massive unemployment, poor-quality public services and glaring inequality were the main catalysts for the Arab Spring. Furthermore, the thunderstorm of social unrest and political tension rolling across the North Africa region has provoked economic dislocations, political upheaval, social unrest and harsh inequality (Shelley 2014; Salih 2014). The rising tide of popular indignation placed the blame on the wide political dereliction. The wave of Arab uprisings forced politicians across the region to radically rethink their current policies toward inequality. Egalitarian standpoints made institutional quality and governance the North Africa region’s overwhelming top priorities. Indeed, inequality turned out to be a rather long, drawn-out and challenging affair. Thus, enhancing the quality of governance must be in the forefront of the endeavor to improve public service delivery, transparency, accountability and distributive justice that do bring tangible benefits and open up new opportunities for people living below minimum living standards. The North Africa region is in the midst of a deep institutional crisis, many North African countries still lack the capacity to effectively address governance issues. So far, however, insufficient effort has been made to overcome institutional weaknesses; and it is worth noting that institutional reforms are not progressing with sufficient speed; further, they are less than has hitherto been expected, leaving plenty of room for inequality to persist and replicate itself. Many countries in the North Africa region rank consistently at the very bottom of governance indicators, painting a gloomy picture of the region’s future. Indeed, inadequate access to quality education was the straw that broke the camel’s back, in other words the limited access to education is the main contributor to the rise in inequality. Rather, greater access to high-quality education helps increase earning capacity and improves social outcomes. Additionally, well-educated people are empowered to claim their rights and are granted a powerful voice in appraising public services, and they can exercise control over public resources. In a nutshell, ensuring broad access to high-quality education is the most potent weapon in the battle against corruption and inequality. Yet the empirical evidence on the impact of corruption, public services and inequality on North African migration are still lacking. Therefore, the present paper aims: on the one hand, to investigate the impact of public service delivery and inequality on North African migration to developed countries; and on the other hand, to zoom in on the role of education and good governance in mitigating migration flows from North African countries (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia) over the period 1996–2015. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. “Theoretical and empirical review on the triptych migration public service delivery inequality and the role of education” section presents the theoretical framework and reviews the literature on the relationship between public service delivery, inequality and migration. “Migration, inequality, corruption and the quality of public service delivery in North Africa” section discusses migration, inequality, corruption and the quality of public service delivery in North Africa. “Data and empirical results” section describes the data, explains the methodological approach, and analyzes the main empirical results. “Conclusion” section draws concluding remarks.",1
22,2,Journal of Social and Economic Development,30 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-020-00102-4,The imperative of social sector development for achieving the goal of inclusive growth in India: an analytical study,December 2020,Vikram Chadha,Ishu Chadda,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At independence, India inherited a galloping population, food deprivation, rampant poverty, ignorance and illiteracy and an overall unbalanced and decadent socio-economic antecedent of an eastern society. Nevertheless, the planners were conscious of the reality that unless the fruits of economic growth percolate down to the lowest sections of the society, sustained development and welfare would be a far cry. India did experiment with trickle down approach to development for achieving the objective of income redistribution and social justice but floundered on that by the end of fourth plan. Since then the focus is on human welfare and development approach. Indian planners targeted the removal of poverty and inequality as the goal and the fundamental element of their growth strategy. Following Sen’s approach, the planners contemplated to build the capacity and capability of the people by reinforcing social sector development and adopting the people centred approach. Economic policy of India asserts the deepening and widening of welfare in the society and expands the participation of people into the growth process of the country (Government of India 2012). Thus, the emphasis came to hinge on strategies based on equity, employment generation and poverty alleviation and thus growth inclusivity. However, with the motive of reining in overall poverty, incomes are increasing accompanied by disparities and economic instability. The solution itself resides in accelerating the process of inclusiveness with economic growth (Klasen 2010). The focus must be on percolating the fruits of benefits to the disadvantaged groups particularly scheduled tribes and scheduled caste, minorities and disabled (Government of India 2007). The strategy for inclusive growth aimed at achieving the growth process with the objectives of inclusiveness and sustainability. This inclusive growth model necessitates the social sector development, an approach which is an adjunct to the capability approach of human development and also ensures rapid and sustained growth (Government of India 2007). The concomitance of social sector development and inclusive growth came into prominence because of the concern of policy makers towards rising unemployment and poverty. Social sector development and inclusive growth both are interdependent and synergetic in nature. Social sector development stimulates the achievement of inclusive growth, while the realization of inclusive growth manifests in social sector development. World Economic Forum proposed the measure of wellbeing called Inclusive Development Index. The dimensions of inclusive growth include the productive employment, economic infrastructure, poverty eradication, human capabilities and social protection. Mckinley (2010) constructed a composite inclusive growth index by selecting four indicators of ‘growth, productive employment and economic infrastructure; income poverty and equity; human capabilities and social protection’ using the method of assigning weights. The constructed inclusiveness index ranges from 1 to 10 on the score card. This constructed index was further tested out on few selected countries like India, Cambodia, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh, Philippines and Indonesia. Ramos et al. (2013) classified the concept of inclusive growth in three dimensions, i.e. poverty reduction, equal access to employment opportunity and social and economic inclusion in the growth process. The study examined cross-country analysis using 43 countries for the time period of 1996–2016. The inclusiveness index was constructed on 0–1 scale representing better performance if index’s value was skewed more to lower side. Thus, the closer the value of index to 0, the more inclusive the country is. The low index indicates a high level of inclusiveness. If the indexes range between 0 and 0.2 classified as a very high level of inclusiveness; from 0.2 to 0.4 as a high level; from 0.4 to 0.6 as a medium level; between 0.6 and 0.8 as a low level and from 0.8 to 1 would be the case of extremely low inclusiveness. Tripathi (2013) also constructed a composite index of inclusive growth for the period of 2004–2010. The study carried out analysis of urban India by selecting components like ‘poverty, inequalities, economic growth, education, employment, unemployment and standard of living. These components further have sub components. The overall inclusive growth of 52 cities was measured by using Baroda ranking. Higher urban growth linked with the reduction in growth rate of urban poverty and escalated the growth rate of urban inequalities. The study found that urban growth is not inclusive as it has lower level of inclusiveness’. The present study intended to construct the composite index of growth inclusiveness for India by deploying principal component analysis (PCA), which has not been attempted in earlier studies. There are also a number of studies in the existing literature that examine the role of economic growth and reduction of poverty. The expenditure incurred on education, public health, medical, family welfare, water supply and sanitation, welfare of marginalized classes, rural development and food subsidy is evidently imperative for fostering inclusive growth both at micro village level and the macro level of whole economy. The inclusive growth focused on benefit to all sections of society including the poor, the near poor, middle income groups and even the rich and this growth defined as disadvantaged people reducing growth. More access to labour market, increased education attainment rates along with the better health and health facilities induced the rapid income growths, but government policies have many flaws and deficiencies and need to have good governance (Klasen 2010, Anand et al. 2014). Kakwani and Pernia (2000) also stated that to dent the problems like abject poverty, widespread unemployment and rampant inequalities; only pro-poor growth strategies were not sufficient. Thus, due to gnawing poverty and deprivation of masses, social sector development had been given the prime importance since independence; so, the pro-poor growth strategy was reoriented to promote democratic inclusive growth. Kundu and Varghese (2010) investigated the trends and pattern of inequalities among Indian states by constructing composite indices of economic growth by including economic, basic amenities and social dimensions. These dimensions further had selected set of sub indicators and found out that eradication of poverty was moderately low in less developed states. A strong correlation between social development and basic amenities with constructed indices of economic growth was found. The basic research question manifesting in the study is whether the growth strategies based on human development approach, i.e. social sector development would render growth inclusive. So, we, in the present study, intended to explore the association between social sector development and inclusiveness of growth strategy. The majority of earlier studies consider the relationship between economic growth and government spending in India, but none of the studies look at relationship between social sector development and inclusive growth in India at macro level. The study also attempts to examine the relationship between government spending on different components of social sector and inclusiveness of growth in India, using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) Model. In this light, the objective of the study is: Explaining and measuring inclusiveness of India’s economic growth by constructing the composite Index; To analyse the impact of social sector development on the constructed index of inclusive growth in India. This paper is structured into five sections. After introducing the theme in ‘Introduction’ section, the analytical framework and model estimation with econometric specifications is presented in ‘Database and methodology’ section; the construction of the composite index of India’s inclusive growth is described in ‘Empirical findings: composite growth inclusiveness index’ section. ‘Relationship between components of social sector and inclusive growth in India’ section attempts to examine the relationship between components of social sector and inclusive growth in India and ‘Conclusion and policy implications’ section puts forth main policy implications and conclusion of the study.",1

The promotion of good governance has also been a major element of such transformation (Devas 2001). The fundamental transformation towards promoting good governance was emerged in two ways: first, through the perceived success of market economies and by reducing state enterprises’ inefficiencies, and second, through a recognition of the abuses of authoritarian regimes (Rondinelli 1981). In this conflicting arena, the literature has put forward various means for promoting good governance through democratic decentralisation (Devas 2001; Bardhan & Mookherjee 2005; Rumbach 2015). This can be accomplished by allocating authority, resources and functions from central to local governments. In this paper, the form of decentralisation being analysed is based on the organisational arrangement of decentralisation identified by Devas (2001), which can be explained in four ways: namely as deconcentration, delegation, devolution and privatisation. The success of decentralisation highly depends on improving local government accountability. There are various forms of accountability, according to the context. In respect to decentralisation, accountability mainly involves the relationships between local and central governments and these entities’ relationships with their citizens. Problems in accountability vary with the practiced forms of decentralisation, particularly within local governments in terms of both upward and downward accountability. For example, the issue of the funding and financial dependency of local bodies is a major concern that has affected the quality of accountability, particularly within developing countries (Devas 2001). Evidence shows that central governments use their financial power to influence local governments (Devas 2001). Common accountability problems include corruption and lack of transparency, among others. When there is no accountability then it is natural for corruption to take hold in all forms of decentralisation (Bardhan et al. 2005). Other problems of accountability can be explained as the reduction of local government performance in the context of effectiveness and efficiency, especially in its service delivery functions (Devas 2001). The urge to establish good governance in Bangladesh does not come from an urge for democratic decentralisation; rather the constitution lays out the devolution of power beyond the central government. Common forms of decentralised organisations include local urban government bodies, such as city corporations and municipalities. Although the devolution and delegation process exist in Bangladesh, accountability is a major challenge for urban development. In this context, this paper attempts to identify the upward and downward accountability issuesFootnote 1 that are associated with urban development. It also identifies whether the organisational arrangement of decentralisation has an impact on accountability and its promotion in urban development practices in that country. This paper is the first to attempt to analyse the upward and downward accountability issues of urban development practises in Bangladesh. These practises include service delivery and plan preparation and implementation. This paper explores whether different organisational arrangements produce different outcomes in respect of promoting accountability in urban development practises. In this context, this paper is based on a study that was conducted on Khulna City Corporation and Jessore Municipality, two similar decentralised organisations in terms of their organisational arrangement (devolution). However, their context varies as Jessore is a municipality and Khulna is a city corporation. In addition, analysing the accountability issues of Khulna Development Authority provides another lens for this study, as this is a delegated form of organisation and the issues related to this entity differ from those of Khulna City Corporation and Jessore Municipality. Thus, a look at Khulna Development Authority and its issues as they relate to urban development provide another lens with which to observe the topic of urban development. Therefore, this paper is significant in that it identifies which form of organisational arrangement is more functional in promoting accountability issues in urban development practises of Bangladesh.",

M. Keynes, wherein fiscal policy could be used as a potent tool to achieve the macroeconomic stabilisation (Khundrakpam and Pattanaik 2010). Despite an assumed magic bullet, the associated fiscal deficit, its level, composition and the resulting current account deficit are always major concerns for policy makers, irrespective of whether the affected country is developed or developing (Jalil et al. 2014). Owing to its severe overall macroeconomic ramifications such as crowding in/out of private investment, change in level of competitiveness via exchange rate gyrations, capital flight and inflation dynamics, a continuous fiscal expansion is deemed to be problematic (Jalil et al. 2014; Manohar Rao 2000; Darrat 2000; Kumhof and Laxton 2013; Aisen and Hauner 2013; Catao and Terrones 2005; Evans 1987; Singh 2017). In addition, a historical anatomy of the literature on fiscal policy and macroeconomic linkages gives a clear idea that most important variables supposed to be affected by the fiscal policy actions are interest rate, inflation, private investment, output and external balance. Not only due to diversity of theoretical arguments about the nature of possible interaction between fiscal deficit and other macroeconomic variables, but the established association is also believed to be sensitive to the alternative modes of financing the deficits. Empirically, though a plethora of studies have been conducted in developed and developing economies, the evidence reported is largely inconclusive. The importance of fiscal policy as a stabilization tool cannot be undermined in a developing country like India. Despite the reforms during 1990s where many sectors of the economy are liberalised, privatised and globalised, still government plays an important role since many core sectors of the economy such as defence and development of railways, especially in rural areas, are still under the preview of government. More importantly, to overcome with the malaises of poverty and income inequality, fiscal policy enjoys upper hand in the Indian context in terms of achieving egalitarian economic growth. However, the associated problems of fiscal deficit cannot be ignored. To avoid any unfavourable outcome, certain measures like Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) (2003) have been taken from time to time to control the level of fiscal deficit. In spite of that, Indian economy continues to struggle with the high and persistent level of fiscal deficit. Thus, tracking the macroeconomic linkages of fiscal policy, more specifically in terms of fiscal deficit and its impact on overall macroeconomy, is of utmost importance. The present study is an attempt towards it. Although the issue has been repeatedly discussed in empirical literature, considerable uncertainties still exist about the nature of relationship between the fiscal deficit and overall macroeconomic performance. Unlike the existing literature on fiscal policy macroeconomic nexus, the present study differs in following important ways. First, to capture sectoral heterogeneity we specify separate production function, investment function and price function for agriculture, manufacturing, service and infrastructure sectors. Second, given the simultaneous operation of various channels of fiscal policy transmission, we have constructed and estimated an eclectic structural macroeconometric model using generalised method of moments (GMM), to analyse the impact of fiscal policy shocks on overall macroeconomy. Third, given the fact that due nexus is sensitive to modes of financing the deficit, the study analysed the nexus under alternative modes of financing like Reserve Bank credit to government and borrowing from market. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the analytical frame work of the model and its major features. Section 3 discusses data, model estimation and its simulation performance. The results of policy simulations are discussed in Sect. 4, and the paper concludes with discussion of results and policy implication in Sect. 5.",1

At the same time, annual fish consumption of the average Indian is only 5 kg per capita, which is one of the lowest in the world and a mere quarter of the global average (FAO 2018Footnote 1). And yet, for many Indian households, fish appears to be an important and relatively cheap source of nutrition. Its contribution is strikingly under-researched. While fisheries researchers have tended to focus on fish production and fisheries management, the scholarship on food and nutrition security has been tilted toward agriculture and other animal protein sources. Our ignorance of the role of fisheries for food and nutritional security poses a challenge for a country like India that ranks number one in terms of wasted and stunted children (Global Nutrition Report 2018).Footnote 2 Within fisheries, the literature on consumption behavior is scanty at the disaggregate level, especially as far as it pertains to the urban poor. There are several reasons why it is important to understand the fish consumption behavior of the urban poor. First, it is generally well established in literature that fish is a prominent source of not only protein but other micronutrients essential for addressing malnutrition (Hicks et al. 2019). Second, a significant proportion of poor and malnourished people reside in and migrate to urban areas. Therefore, fish provision might, in principle, play a role in addressing urban malnutrition. Third, fish is a highly traded commodity globally as well as locally (Kawarazuka and Béné 2010) and hence is often characterized by an evolved market system. Unlike in rural areas where fish production and consumption can sometimes be intertwined to address nutritional security (for a comprehensive schematic see Table 1 in Kawarazuka and Béné 2010), urban areas more often exhibit a de-linked scenario in production and consumption. Given that it is a highly traded commodity, it is important to understand how the urban poor interact with market forces to bridge their nutritional needs. Such knowledge could provide insights into how market infrastructure could be strengthened. There are important studies available on urban fish markets and trade in Japan (Bestor 2004), New York (Graddy 2006), Melbourne (Aljohani and Thompson 2018), Pescara and Giulianova (Giulioni and Bucciarelli 2011). While market-centric studies throw light on various dimensions of fish availability and accessibility, they may not specifically address the urban poor’s needs. In view hereof, the objective of this paper is to understand fish consumption behavior of low-income households in two contrasting South Indian cities, one located along the shoreline and the other inland. The paper is organized as follows. Section two highlights the theoretical underpinnings of this study. Section three contextualizes the study by presenting an overview of fish consumption patterns in India at large. Section four introduces the geographies of the cities in focus, while section five provides the methodological approach of this study. The next two sections compare the fish consumption patterns of the two cities, as well as the character of the market relations involved. Section 8 discusses these findings in light of the lead question and concludes.",1

Globally, the increasing proportion of women in the labour market remains one of the most noticeable economic and social trends in recent times. Women constitute about 40% of the global labour force (World Bank 2012) and the rate of their participation has improved significantly to be almost at par with their male counterparts. With the average rate of approximately 50%, the Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) ranges from 21% in North Africa and the Middle East, to about 63% in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank 2013). Although the traditional role of women as home managers is gradually fading out in favour of market work, females still lag behind their male counterparts in terms of their labour market participation (Baah-Boateng et al. 2013). Women with or without children still tend to be dominant in the household, seeking after the interest of family members (Codjoe et al. 2016). This could imply that, one potential factor that can influence mothers’ labour supply is the responsibility of providing care to young children, especially when they are unwell. Available data in Ghana show rather worrying percentages of reported childhood illnesses. The 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) indicates that approximately 21.8%, 68.5% and 78.3% of under 5 children were reported to have suffered from ARI, Diarrhea, and fever, respectively. In addition, estimates from the sixth round of Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS 6) indicate that out of the 14% of the population who reported to have suffered from illness, children aged 0–5 years accounted for 20.3%. Taking cognizance of the role of women as primary caregivers within families, the allocation of maternal time inputs to market and non-market production is most likely to be affected. Essentially, this study is motivated by the fact that child health problems place both time and financial constraints on mothers, which may influence their desire for labour market activities. Whilst the time commitment involved in caring for a child in poor health may restrain mothers from participating in the labour force, additional financial burden may compel the mother to enter the labour market to enable her acquire the health resource required by the child. In such situations, it is imperative for one to think that ownership of health insurance by the child can lessen the mother’s huge financial obligation. Whereas the ability of health insurance in reducing out-of-pocket payment is widely recognized (see Jung and Liu 2015; Aryeetey et al. 2016), some researchers argue that in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) where health insurance is co-paid, the insured sometimes incur high out-of-pocket payment (see; Akazili et al. 2011; Nguyen et al. 2011). By extension, the effect of poor child health and child’s health insurance ownership on maternal labour market activities is not certain, thus subject to empirical investigations. This study raises three essential questions for answers: Does child health affect mothers’ decision to participate in the labour market? Does child ill health influence the choice of maternal weekly hours of work? How does the effect of child health on maternal labour market engagement differ with health insurance ownership? Though a number of studies have been carried out on female labour force participation (see Baah-Boateng et al. 2013; Ackah et al. 2009; Sackey 2005), there is noticeable lack of empirical information on how, and to which direction poor child health affect maternal labour market engagement in Ghana. Again, existing studies outside Ghana that tried to examine the effect of child health on maternal labour market attachment have either failed to investigate the bi-causal relationship between the two variables or showed mixed evidence (Salkever 1990; Lu and Zuo 2010). As such, one cannot be very certain about the exact relationship between these variables in the Ghanaian context. This study seeks to bridge this gap and contribute to the literature by highlighting the evidence from the Ghanaian case.",

Roads are essential elements to produce value chains, augment ‘competitive edge’ and long-term capital asset with ancillary support to various factors of production (Storper 1997; Scott 1998; Fujita et al. 1999, Prud’homme 2005, Baldwin and Dixon 2008, Ghani et al. 2016). In underdeveloped regions, roads in particular enhance the quality of life with socio-economic integration, poverty alleviation, employment and livelihood generation (Perz et al. 2014; Nandy 2014; Sharma and Kundu 2016). Roads moreover signify power and legitimacy of a state, whose objective is to control space and territory, and symbolize national integrity by ‘winning the hearts and minds of the people’ including various far-flung, remote, peripheral and mountainous areas of a country (Skeldon 1985; deGrassi 2005; Conover 2010; Dzuvichu 2013; Demenge 2015). Road infrastructure therefore establishes both economic, political and strategic links across geographical regions, while their transcendent quality propels national development and social change (Harvey and Knox 2015). The aim of the paper is to study the road project in one of India’s remote and mountainous regions, the Northeast, which has been stereotyped as ‘cut-off’ and peripheral during the post-Independent period. Inadequate road infrastructure in the region was justified by the earlier planning model with both topographical and geo-strategic challenges (NTDPC 2013). However, this stark spatial isolation, which propelled economic underdevelopment of the Northeast, was acknowledged in India’s post-liberalization programme. Creating a logistics infrastructure became primary, and road projects were invigorated at the policy level to transform this prolonged perceived sense of isolation and connect the region to India’s mainland. This physical mechanism of road infrastructure, as argued by Harvey and Knox elsewhere, is largely understood as a technology for integration, while a visible and expressible presence of roads influences people’s lives and imagination at local level that helps to attain a resilient territorial state (see Harvey and Knox 2015). This paper largely aims to understand the role and objective of the developmental state on road project in the Northeast. The central objective is to examine the relationship between road and economy of this underdeveloped region for the past one and half decades.",1

Indirectly, religion could influence poverty because it has a relationship with most of the key factors that underlie wealth creation such as education, fertility, marriage, parental work behavior, income generation, and schooling (Keister, 2003). For example, religious denominations that are pro-natal will most likely accumulate less wealth, but those that place more emphasis on higher educational achievement will have their members accumulating more wealth (Keister, 2003). Apart from this indirect effect, religion could also directly affect wealth creation and poverty in several ways. Religious values transmitted by parents to children or through the pulpit will form the basis of one’s action and influence decisions on the key antecedents of wealth creation such as savings, investment, and even health decisions. (see Keister, 2003). Religion could also provide social contacts which may provide information and direct support in decision making and actions on savings, investment, health, and education or during income shocks (Poggi, 2018; Keister, 2003). Again religious values such as hard work and trust have a very important effect on the economy. Trust can foster capital accumulation (Knack and Keefer, 1997); trust and hard work can enhance earnings (Bowles et al., 2001); and trust can foster entrepreneurship (Keister, 2003; Guiso et al. 2003, 2006). Religion also provides meaning in life and self-control. Self-control and meaning in life can enhance savings (Shefrin and Thaler, 1988) and asset accumulation (Keister, 2003) as well as earnings (Bowles et al. 2001). Religion also encourages altruism. Altruism ensures that each is responsible toward the other. Altruism as a tool to alleviate poverty is well known. In fact, in some religions, giving to the poor has been institutionalized. For example, in Islam and Judaism, there are the zakat and tzedakah, respectively, where the gift to the poor has been made a religious obligation (Beyers, 2014). This practice helps redistribute wealth and resources to ensure that the poor can be lifted to a certain acceptable minimum standard of living. In Ghana, some studies have examined some aspects of religion on socio-economic variables. For example, Beck and Gundersen (2016) examined the effect of religious affiliation on earnings. Heaton et al. (2009) also considered the effect of religious affiliation on educational attainment in Ghana. However, so far, little space has been given to the relationship between religious orientation and poverty. In the literature, psychologists maintain that individuals with intrinsic religious orientation internalizes their religious beliefs and live them in their everyday life and seek to maintain a close relationship with God. Contrarily, an individual with extrinsic religious orientation uses religion to his own gain and participates in religious activities for some ulterior, self-centered purpose (Allport and Ross, 1967; Stark, 2001; Ryan and Fiorito, 2003; Banister, 2011). In the literature, intrinsic religious orientation has been found to be associated with positive outcomes such as better mental health (Forthun et al., 2003) and lower adolescent depressive symptoms (Pössel et al. 2011). Galbraith and Galbraith (2007) have shown that intrinsic religiosity is positively associated with economic growth via its effect on entrepreneurship. In Ghana, almost always, when the effect of religion on development is questioned, it is people’s religiosity as measured by the religious affiliation that is considered (see Beck and Gundersen, 2016; Heaton et al. 2009). But, unlike religious affiliation, religious orientation gives more information about the level of individual religiosity. In the literature, religious orientation has been linked to mature and immature faith (see Banister, 2011). Consequently, studies that assess the effect of religion on development from the prism of individual religious orientation would provide more illumination to design better faith-based policies to help reduce poverty. So far, no study has examined the impact of religious orientation on poverty in Ghana. The major objective of this study was to determine the effect of religious orientation on poverty status. Data were collected from a representative sample of household heads in Ghana through multi-stage random sampling. The data were analyzed using logistic and probit models. Instrumental variable estimation and structural equation modeling were used to address reverse causality and assess mediated effect, respectively. The study found that intrinsic religious orientation has a negative effect on poverty, particularly in urban areas. The study also found that the negative relationship between intrinsic religiosity orientation and poverty is partially mediated by the propensity to save. The basic implication of our finding is that personal religiosity/religious commitment needs to be complemented by church programs that take advantage of the rich and diversified religious network that exists in urban areas to facilitate poverty reduction. In what follows, we provide an integrated theoretical framework for the effect of religion on poverty and state the hypothesis to be tested in the study in see section two. The method used for the study is provided in see section three. The results and discussion are presented in section four. Section five summarizes, concludes and draws the policy implications of the study.",1

As Quraishi (2014) notes voting enrich its quality and credibility where a mass of well-informed citizens, willing to exercise their right to vote wisely, can help create a conducive environment for free and fair elections. The ability to vote puts immense power into the hands of the people allowing them to ascertain the future of an economy. India adopts the First Past the Post Electoral system. First-past-the-post voting is a simple majority voting system, wherein the candidate with the highest number of votes is declared the winner. For instance, during the General elections in 2014, the Bhartiya Janata Party won 282 seats receiving only 31% of majority votes. The adoption of a parliamentary system of governance and the FPTP electoral system are the result of influence of the British colonial legacy. Lop-sided trends in voter turnout tends to be associated with the citizens lack of interest in the legitimacy of democratic politics. Despite this, the turnout trends since 1952 have observed a sharp increase from 61.17% in 1952 to 69.5% in 2019. Turnout increase is attributed to the increased surge in political competition that has swayed voter behavior and been responsible for their participation. In this article, the authors seek to analyze the determinants of voter turnout in India by regionalizing Indian states. The Indian case is interesting because elections in India are no less than a festive event for Indian households such that citizens uphold their political sovereignty. Given that electoral outcomes have vital policy implications, it is necessary to analyze the factors causing vote differentials, a study less mentioned in the literature. Indian elections are considered remarkable due to the enthusiasm and zeal witnessed in electoral process. Studies by Banerjee (2008, 2017) have shown that in India, voting is not a compulsory act, yet lakhs appear at polling booths to exercise their votes. Powell (1986) found turnout to be higher in countries with nationally competitive districts and strong party linkages. Similarly, Blais and Dobryzynska (1998) hypothesized that economic development fosters turnout. Rational Choice Theory (RCT) is foremost among several other theories explaining the rationality in human behavior. RCT deals with market preferences and behavior where consumers aim in maximizing utility. The underlying premise provided by the link between voter turnout and Rational Choice Theory (RCT) is to relate economic parameters with electoral behavior (Arrow 1951). In Down’s economic theory (1957), rationality is the assumption that voters and political parties act directly according to their own interest hence validating that the axiom of self-interest is applicable to actions of all political parties. Similarly, Herbert Simon’s Bounded Rationality model (1957) argues that people are ‘intendedly rational but only limitedly so’. All voters understand their single vote is not going to change the future of the nation/country. However, they still exercise their vote as they derive the utility of a feeling of sovereignty toward their nation. Empirical literature has tended to emphasize more on explaining correlation between turnout trends and the character of elections. Election rallies and speeches turn around rise or fall of economic growth, slumping growth parameters, poor household economic conditions, perpetuation of poverty and others. Herrera et al. (2016) use a contest success function, introducing a power sharing or proportionality parameter and observe that the effect of the institutional differences on turnout depends on the distribution of voter’s preferences for the competing parties, or the ex-ante preference ‘evenness’ of the election in a non-obvious way. The reason may be the understanding that while a modest economic development does determine voter turnout, beyond a threshold the former fails to influence high voter turnout. Socio-political factors such as population size, age, educational attainment, political interest and economic backwardness hold immense power to affect the election outcome in many regions. Exploring the unique case of India and its voters Meyer and Malcolm (1993) using a two-variable model i.e., changes in economic conditions and new party votes explain the prevalence of such factors in determining vote conditions. In their study Meyer and Malcolm (1993) used Pearson’s correlation to study the relationship between PCI and vote change and showed a significant correlation of + 0.91 with vote change suggesting that PCI was a better predictor of vote change than GDP. Developed democracies are stimulated by arguments and evidences that voters reward incumbents as a result of implementation of effective policies, provision of stable government, good economic conditions and likewise punish in situations of adversity foremost among them being corruption. Blattman et al. (2018) show that forward-looking voters may also be swayed by effective government programs. Every ruling party, be it at the center or in the states introduce and implement policies primarily targeting individuals at the grass root level. Revenues in a voter’s pocket are equally responsible in determining his/her political inclination. Moving along similar lines, Lunnerdal (2014) too, show that the correlation results provide an indication that turnout is an important factor for election results and consequently income shocks affect election outcomes by influencing (decreasing/increasing) overall turnout levels. Denny and Doyle (2008) using longitudinal data from the National Cohort Development Study investigate the correlation between turnout trends and education levels. Using a bivariate probit model, they identified a positive correlation between education and electoral participation. Education increases cognitive ability and enables to process complex information thereby reducing costs of voting and increasing its benefits. Using data sets that are cross-sectional and time series in observation Diwakar (2008) studied that a 0.22% increase in turnout was the result of a 1% increase in literacy rate which confirmed the positive impact of an improvement in education. Again, observing the results from the regression analysis Diwakar (2008) reports that close elections and higher literacy lead to higher turnout, while larger electorates result in lower turnout. The results also suggest that the presence of a larger urban population depresses turnout in the Indian states, and that social heterogeneity variables are not significant i.e., a 1% increase in urban population was associated with 0.08% reduction in turnout suggesting an inverse relation between the same. Scholars study the influence of weather conditions on voter turnout (Matsuaska and Palda 1999; Fujiwara et al. 2016). Handmer and Dovers (2013) in their study note that much, of the Indian population is exposed to climate change impacts, including changes in the timing and intensity of monsoons and changes in the frequency as well as severity of droughts, heat waves, and cyclones. Rainfall that fell precisely on current and previous Election Day affects turnout. Providing a link between monsoons and voter turnout Lunnerdal (2014) using reduced-form OLS specifications reports the main source of income for a large portion of the population in India is rain-fed agriculture where during years with low levels of rainfall, harvests of rain dependent crops become smaller consequently reducing revenue of farmers. For instance, most southern and northern states which have been home to agricultural revolution have more conscious voter. However, the Indian economic scenario has changed particularly since the last 25 years, with prevailing economic issues continuing to perpetuate and impact everyday life of an average Indian citizen. In contrast to existing studies which examine turnout in India with reference to specific social factors for a particular election year, our study focuses on the economic factors impacting turnout for a range of elections years from 1991 to 2014. Since our data included cross-sectional (states) and time series (election years) observations, the approach taken in this study is to use panel data methods such as Fixed Effect Model (FEM) to model unit level heterogeneity. Turnout trends since 1952 show a sharp increase from 61.17% in 1952 to 69.5% in 2019 as shown in Fig. 1 below. The trends show that over the years, turnout trends have grown only modestly. Voter turnout in national elections grew at a relatively modest clip over the years. The rates too have fluctuated within a relatively defined band from a low of 55.3% percent in 1971 to 64.1% in 1984 increasing further to 69.5%. Source: Election Commission of India Voter turnout trends in India. Table 1 shows the summary statistics of turnout in Indian states by election year. Turnout is defined as percentage of eligible voters participating in an election. The average turnout in the Indian states was 48.4% in during the 1991 elections and thereafter it has increased to 70.7% in 2019. Turnout was especially low during the period 1996–1999; this period was extremely turbulent where we saw three prime ministers and two governments. The government elected in 1998 was so weak such that it got defeated by a single no confidence motion in 1999. Fortunately, the period following 1999 was marked by stability such that there were five general elections and three prime ministers. Elections in 2014 and 2019 witnessed a large increase in turnout with issues such as corruption and rural distress being key electoral issues. Table 2 presents turnout in Indian states for election years from 1991 to 2019. There is a wide variation in turnout trends. States in the north-east (Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Assam), including West Bengal and Kerala have turnout rates above the national average while states such as Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh have turnout rates below the national average. Figures 2 and 3 analyze turnout trends across social categories. The paucity of data is clear in the information provided on SC and ST voters. There has been little attempt to understand whether the Dalits tend to participate in the electoral arena en bloc or otherwise (Verma 2009). SC voter turnout Source: Election Commission of India ST voter turnout. Turnout trends during the election years have not changed much with their proportion being high in states including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. A similar trend is observed in the participation of scheduled tribe voters. The Indian political environment is plagued by not just social and economic factors but also geographical factors such as turnout trends in rural and urban areas. Urbanization in India is a new phenomenon and has accelerated especially since the 1990s suggesting that urbanization is concentrated in certain pockets of each state. The 2011 Census shows that urban population grew to 377 million showing a growth rate of 2.67% per annum while decadal growth rate (2001–2011) increased from 27.2% in 2001 to 31.1% in 2011 as compared to the decade of 1991–2001. Table 3 shows the poll percentage in urban cities ranked (high to low) on the basis of Ease of Living Index 2020 released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Results indicate that cities in Tamil Nadu (Chennai and Coimbatore) and Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat) including Indore register high turnout.  For the purpose of the study, the dependent variable at the state-level is voter turnout while the independent variables include socio-economic characteristics (Table 4). The study is a panel of 40 observations. General elections of 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019 are taken into consideration (Table 5). Excluding the union territories, 31 states are included in the analysis. States in India are divided into five regions namely—North, South, East, West and Central (Table 6). The independent variables are discussed below. We use gross enrolment ratio, poverty levels, per-capita income, monsoon and employment as independent variables as affecting voter turnout in Indian states. Education has a direct impact on an individual’s political participation and preference. Education is central to economic development and progress such that educated citizens possess strong civic sense and cognitive ability. According to Kumar and Rustagi (2010) the GER at the primary stage that had stagnated in the 1990s went up from 94.9% in 1999–00 to 111.2% in 2006–07 where the gap between boys and girls at the primary level, which was 19 percentage points in 1999–00 dropped to 7 percentage points in 2006–07. Between the two general elections (from 2014 to 2014) enrolment ratios at primary level declined from 110.6 to 102.7. However, given the positive impact of literacy, we assume a positive relation between the two variables. Proportion of poor reeling under conditions of poverty is an effective means to help analyze voter turnout. Poverty as a condition can sway the choices of voters in favor of or against their decision to vote. Ahuja and Chhibber (2012) observe that the poor vote because it is their right while the non-poor report they vote because they expect material benefits from the state, access to the state, or because voting is their civic duty. Accordingly, proportion of poor people is included as an independent variable in our study. Income shocks alter voter turnout on account of factors such as reduced benefits of voting, increased opportunity cost to vote, lower utility derived from voting and others. Studies exploring relationship between income and voter turnout is limited. Arceneaux (2003) hypothesizes that economic adversity can increase turnout, but only when people blame the government for economic outcomes. Burden and Wichowsky (2012) observed that higher levels of unemployment stimulate more people to vote. However, there have emerged several other studies that have reported contrary findings. This suggests that a sour economic performance invigorates voter turnout in large proportions. In the Indian context, weather conditions have an impact on voter turnout as they can cause positive or negative income shocks. Handmer and Dovers (2013) say that much of the Indian population is exposed to climate change impacts, including changes in the timing and intensity of monsoons and changes in the frequency and severity of droughts, heat waves, and cyclones. And, therefore we show in our empirical results the impact of monsoons on turnout trends during the elections. Again, several studies explore the links between employment and turnout trends. For Schur (2003) being employed increases an individual’s political activities by more than one-third, primarily through increased income, civic skills, political efficacy and recruitment at work. Contrary to this, are the arguments that employment levels are capable of increasing information costs and thereby reducing turnout levels. This should probably explain low turnout levels incessantly observed in urban areas among professionals (for instance 49% in Bangalore, 51% in Mumbai etc.). Charles and Stephens (2013) report that increased labor market activity increases time costs, which should make citizens less willing to bear the logistical costs of voting and thus make them less likely to vote. In addition, a low motivation to vote among the employed is attributed to good economic conditions. In our study, we include the number of employed citizens in the respective states. Table 5 presents the summary statistics for the independent variables. We regress log of per capita income (pci), poverty, monsoon (ms) and employment. Logarithmic transformation is convenient in transforming a highly skewed variable into a more normalized dataset. Dependent variables and regressors can vary over both time and individual. Within variation is variation over time or given region (time variant), while between variations is variation across regions (time invariant). In the case of gross enrolment ratio (GER) and log of per-capita income most of the variation is between than within. For the remaining variables (log poverty and log employment) variation is within than between.",

Mahapatro,Renu Choudhary,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Research studies paying attention to intergenerational mobility among the Scheduled Castes (SC) in India have been increasing in number as this social group has undergone significant changes as a result of various socio-economic and policy reforms. The low socio-economic mobility of SCs in the Indian society often entails greater social exclusion, inequalities, and impoverishment (Dreze and Sen 2002; Deshpande 2001, 2004; Thorat 2009; Desai and Dubey 2012) of these groups compared to the broader population. The historically persistent social exclusion and discrimination have limited their capability formation and alienated them from mainstream development. This has had a spillover effect on the successive generations by lowering their intergenerational mobility. To bring convergence in socio-economic opportunities, reduce caste-based inequalities and enhance the capabilities of the low castes, various welfare-oriented measures have been implemented over the past decades. Such initiatives at different level making, as being claimed, a dent in their lifestyle; especially through making them striving for becoming part of the mainstream life. The economic transformation, underway in parallel with the state initiatives, is assumed to trigger socio-economic mobility of the SCs. Some scholars argue that the post-reform rural economy has expanded income-generating opportunities and created a demand-driven labour market, resulting in a reduction in exclusion (Deshpande 2011; Iversen et al. 2014). Others contend that technological development and the widening economic inequality have wider ramification on increasing caste inequalities (Gang et al. 2017; Borooah et al. 2015; Sinha 2018; Mosse 2018), which means that the benefits of development may not be reaching all the subsections of SCs alike. For instance, while the overall literacy rate of SCs in Bihar was 28% in 2001, among Musahars—one of the SC subgroups, it was only 4.6% (GoB 2012), which is the lowest. The inequalities in the socio-economic indicators, thus, raise the question whether the developmental opportunities are accessed equally by all among the SCs. The argumentation made above lends credence to the need for investigating intergenerational mobility within SCs as they appear to be at crossroads. Intergenerational mobility is conceptualised as the relative change in the socio-economic status of the present generation over the previous generation. Examining intergenerational mobility will show whether the interaction of the market, institutions, and public policies creates opportunities for successive generations or if it only perpetuates and reinforces the existing inequalities. Unlike developed countries, intergenerational mobility is an under-researched area in India due to the absence of adequate panel data that captures information on families across generations. Sociological studies, while emphasising on social barriers such as exclusion and discrimination, have not adequately investigated intergenerational mobility. Using the available cross-sectional data and data from the India Human Development Survey, which has been collecting panel data since 2004, a limited number of studies have examined mobility gaps across caste groups (Majumder 2010; Motiram and Singh 2012; Azam and Bhat 2012; Hnatkovska et al. 2013; Reddy and Swaminathan 2014; Reddy 2015; Iversen et al. 2017). By considering SCs as a homogeneous group, these studies have not sufficiently addressed the heterogeneities within SCs. Besides, they have mostly analysed mobility at the national level, with only a limited focus on the regional context. The present study contributes to the literature by examining whether the intergenerational mobility within SCs is homogeneous. The objective of the study was to examine the pattern and correlates of intergenerational mobility within SC households in rural Bihar. To measure intergenerational mobility, two indicators of socio-economic status—education and occupation—were considered.",

Amoateng,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Ensuring equity in income distribution has been a topical research issue over decades and a central focus of many governments world-wide. Due to the high and persistent nature of income inequality globally, it is currently considered a defining challenge and in recent times, there is a growing public concern in many countries for governments to ensure that everybody gets a fair share of the national cake. The significance of reducing income inequality makes it imperative to be captured in the Sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is worth noting that ensuring equitable income distribution is imperative to achieving sustainable economic growth, macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction and political stability (Anyanwu et al. 2016; OECD 2015; Cojocaru and Diagne 2014; Ostry, Berg and Tsangarides 2014; IMF 2014). Empirical evidence in Africa (see Shimeles and Nabassaga 2018; Fosu 2015), for instance, suggests that no amount of growth in GDP per capita income would be sufficient to reduce extreme poverty unless there is a corresponding decline in income inequality. High levels of income inequality destroy social cohesion and make it difficult to gain public support for growth-enhancing reforms and may also cause political instability (Anyanwu 2016; Claessens and Perotti 2007). The key concern of this paper is to identify the appropriate policy tools which will be adequate to address the widespread economic disparity in Africa. African countries have the highest Gini coefficients falling just behind Latin America and the Caribbean in the global income inequality distribution table (UNDESA 2019; Odusola 2017; World Bank 2016). Also, UNDP (2017) asserts that ten out of the world’s nineteen most unequal countries are located in Africa. This notwithstanding, several empirical studies (see Asongu et al. 2020; Kunawotor et al. 2020; Shimeles and Nabassaga 2018; Adeleye et al. 2017; Anyanwu 2016) have unmasked income inequality as highly persistent on the continent. Fiscal policy according to IMF (2014; 2015) is a primary and potent policy tool that impacts income distribution by affecting household welfare through monetary payment in the form of taxes and transfers and also through the provision of in-kind benefits such as spending on free education and health services. Similarly, Gupta (2018) argues that fiscal policy (taxation and spending) is the most powerful policy tool used by governments in advanced economies to achieve equitable income distribution in both the short and long terms. However, this policy tool has not been very effective in developing countries because they have lower tax-to-GDP ratios in the range of 15–20 percent while advanced countries have over 25 percent. Therefore, this limits the availability of funds for social spending on education and health. Fiscal redistribution is less effective in developing countries such as African countries because there is more reliance on indirect tax. Several empirical studies (see Salotti and Trecroci 2018; Cevik and Correa-Caro 2015; Muinelo-Gallo and Roca-Sagalés 2013) are available on the redistributive effects of fiscal policies albeit primarily focused on advanced and emerging market economies. In this line of thought, Odusola (2017) argues that the central role of fiscal policy in addressing income inequality has long been acknowledged in the literature but there are few empirical studies in Africa to back this assertion. A few of these studies in Africa include Odusola (2017) and Inchauste et al. (2015). But while Inchauste et al. (2015) focuses on South Africa, Odusola (2017) provides a narrative without econometric evidence. Consequently, there is a need to delve into the distributional effects of fiscal policy in the African context. This study thoroughly examines the effects of fiscal policy on income distribution in Africa by using variants of tax indicators as well as government expenditure indicators including spending on education at all levels. It should be noted however that the empirical literature on income inequality in Africa so far has been skewed towards the proximate determinants of income inequality (Hundenborn et al. 2018; Adeleye et al. 2017; Anyanwu et al. 2016; Anyanwu 2016; Dabla-Norris et al. 2015). Some of these determinants include trade openness, human capital, GDP per capita, globalization, government spending and resource rent. Other strands of literature (see Kunawotor et al. 2020; Chu and Hoang 2020; Sulemana and Kpienbaareh 2018; Berisha et al. 2018) tend to focus on institutions and governance with more particular attention towards corruption controls in addressing income inequality. In addition to the distributional effects of fiscal policy, this study also focuses on the unintended distributional effects of monetary policy in Africa. This is because, even though fiscal policy is considered a primary tool in addressing income inequality and has more empirical evidence pointing towards that direction, recent trend of inequality studies are beginning to pay some attention to the potential distributional effects of monetary policy albeit so far focused on the advanced economies (see Furceri et al. 2018; Coibion et al. 2017; Mumtaz and Theophilopoulou 2017; Davtyan 2016; Villarreal 2014). In particular, Furceri et al. (2018), Coibion et al. (2017) and Mumtaz and Theophilopoulou (2017) find that contractionary monetary policy increases income inequality in the USA and UK, while Davtyan (2016) and Villarreal (2014) find a negative effect in USA and Mexico, respectively. The foregoing arguments show that the effects of fiscal policy is quite clearly established in the extant literature, while that of monetary policy seems complicated, and the complexity is due to various channels of impact (Aye, Clance and Gupta 2018; Mumtaz and Theophilopoulou 2017). In terms of the channels of impact, Coibion et al. (2017) show 5 channels by which monetary policy affects inequality. The first channel is the income composition channel which is due to the fact that there is heterogeneity in primary income sources among different households. While some depend on labour income, others rely on business income, financial, or transfer income. Monetary policy does have a heterogeneous impact on these different income sources and may have redistributive effects. The second is the financial segmentation channel. This channel applies to agents who trade frequently in financial markets. Monetary policy tends to redistribute income in favour of these agents than others during expansionary monetary policy shocks. The third channel is the portfolio channel. Poor households who mostly tend to hold currency suffer more disproportionately from inflationary impact stemming from monetary policy than high-income households. The fourth channel is the savings redistribution channel which explains that an increase in interest rate will be of more benefit to savers than borrowers and savers are generally considered to be wealthier than borrowers. The final channel is the earnings heterogeneity channel. Monetary policy shocks affect high-income labour earnings and low-income labour earnings quite differently. The novelty and strength of our paper lie in the fact that we are one of the few in Africa to comprehensively study the redistributive roles of both fiscal and monetary policies. We also use various indicators of fiscal and monetary policies. The rest of the paper comprise the methodology in Sect. 2, results and discussion in Sect.3 and ends with summary and recommendations in Sect. 4.",1

Eregha,Arcade Ndoricimpa,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Monetary Policy stance in Nigeria has always been contractionary in a bid to combat rising inflation and ensure sustainable output growth as the economy is exposed to global commodity price shock due to undiversified economic activities. This has called for concern from stakeholders on the need for policy stance to support real sector growth, especially in a low growth era but the monetary authority always argues that the Nigerian case is a paradox where output growth is low and dwindling amidst rising inflation and alarming unemployment rate (CBN 2015; Eregha 2021). It is therefore imperative for empirical study to gauge the dynamic linkages among inflation, output growth, and their uncertainties in Nigeria to provide evidence for policymakers. This is the focus of this study and to the best of our knowledge, there is dearth of such studies in Nigeria. In Nigeria, the oil sector’s contribution to GDP hovers around 10.0% while non-oil sector contributes a significant 90.0%. Paradoxically, the same non-oil sector that contributes this significant share in domestic production only accounts for less than 10.0% of export earnings while the oil sector takes a lead of approximately 90.0% (Eregha et al. 2019). Also, fiscal position depends so much on oil revenue as the government often treats positive oil price shock as permanent. Thus, the economy is susceptible to global uncertainties and terms of trade shock that affect the fiscal position and impact on domestic prices. This is aggravated by supply constraints resulting in rising cost of production and a crowding-out effect on private investment as public debt rises uncontrollably (DMO 2018; Eregha et al. 2016). Consequently, real growth has been fragile hovering on an average of roughly 2.0% prior to 2020 amidst a population growth of around 3.0% (DMO 2018). This characterizes both real and nominal uncertainties and the imperativeness to empirically underscore the dynamic relationship among real output growth, inflation, and their uncertainties in Nigeria. Interestingly, the dynamic linkages between inflation and output growth and their uncertainties have been controversial both theoretically and empirically (Bhar and Malik 2010). While there is a plethora of studies on these connections, the consensus in the literature is unclear and the evidence is mixed (Narayan and Narayan 2013). Theoretically, Friedman (1977) and Ball (1992) showed that rising inflation causes nominal uncertainty which invariably becomes a drag to output growth due to price distortionary effect that engenders inefficient resource allocation. However, Pourgerami and Maskus (1987) opined for a negative effect. They suggested that rising inflation only leads to a decrease in inflation uncertainty as economic agents utilize more resources in forecasting future inflation. Cukierman and Meltzer (1987) and Holland (1995) provided support for the reverse causality running from nominal uncertainty to inflation as policymakers create surprise inflation to spur growth. On the effect of inflation uncertainty, while Friedman (1977) supported a negative effect on output growth, Dotsey and Sarte (2000) opined for a positive effect, arguing that increasing nominal uncertainty may cause precautionary savings that later boost investment and thereby spur growth. On the effect of real uncertainty, Black (1987), and Blackburn (1999) suggested a positive effect on output growth, while Pindyck (1990), and Ramey and Ramey (1991) supported a negative effect, and Friedman (1968) suggesting that there should be independence between output growth and its uncertainty. On the effect of real uncertainty on inflation, Devereux (1989) showed a positive effect, and on the relationship between inflation uncertainty and output growth uncertainty, Taylor (1981) and Fuhrer (1997) showed a trade-off between them due to stabilization objective of the policymaker, while Logue and Sweeney (1981) insinuated a positive effect of growth uncertainty on inflation uncertainty. On inflation-growth nexus, Bruno and Easterly (1998) provided support for a positive effect, while Jones and Manuelli (1995), De Gregorio (1996), supported a negative link. From the empirical literature, Grier and Perry (1998), Bhar and Malik (2010), Mehrara and Tavakolian (2010), Hasanov and Omay (2011), Heidari et al. (2013), and Narayan and Narayan (2013) showed empirical evidence supporting rising inflation to spur inflationary uncertainty. On the other hand, Karanasos et al. (2004), Narayan and Narayan (2013), and Ndoricimpa (2015) showed inflation uncertainty to raise inflation while Grier et al. (2004) found otherwise. Fountas (2001); Fountas et al. (2002) and Heidari et al. (2013) found evidence of a drag on growth from inflation uncertainty, Ndoricimpa (2015) found a spurring effect on growth. Caporale and Mckiernan (1998), Grier and Perry (2000) and Narayan and Narayan (2013) found a positive effect of real uncertainty on growth but Henry and Olekalns (2002), and Ndoricimpa (2015) found a negative correlation while Fountas et al. (2002) found no evidence. The literature is replete with mixed and imprecise results (Bhar and Malik 2010) and Heidari et al. (2013) called for more studies. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on the connection between nominal uncertainty and real uncertainty and their effects on inflation and output growth for Nigeria by using the Grier et al. (2004) asymmetric multivariate GARCH-M modeling approach for generating uncertainty as also used by Ndoricimpa (2015) for the South Africa case. This is at variance with previous studies, especially in Nigeria that used the one-step approach in GARCH-in-Mean model (Olayinka and Hassan 2010). While Bhar and Malik (2010) and Heidari et al. (2013) among others employed this same approach but this present study is significant as it focuses on the Nigerian economy that is characterized by fragile real growth and dwindling inflationary trend due to terms of trade shock and supply constraints to unravel the dynamics for similar economies. The choice of the Grier et al. (2004) asymmetric multivariate GARCH-M approach is not farfetched as it allows one to jointly generate the uncertainty measures of inflation and output growth and analyzed their effects simultaneously while overcoming the misspecification problem arising from imposing diagonal and symmetric restrictions on the variance–covariance matric of output growth and inflation. The rest of the paper is organized thus. Section 2 highlights the methodology used; Sect. 3 presents the empirical analysis while Sect. 4 concludes the study.",

This leapfrogging in the economic structure has bypassed the domestic manufacturing revolution, which has the potential to absorb a large labor force displaced from the agriculture sector. The lower significance of domestic manufacturing activity is also attributed to the emergence of global production networks that have resulted in a rapid division of labor-intensive activities in the backdrop of globalization. The consequent fragmentation of the production process across countries of the world has changed the paradigm of international trade with a greater share of the trade in intermediate inputs. The intermediate inputs—parts and materials—are imported to make products for consumption domestically as well as abroad. In fact, trade in intermediates is recognized as a growing force in the world trade. In India, the exports of intermediate goods account for 52% of non-fuel exports, while intermediate imports have a much higher corresponding share of 73% (WTO-IDE-JETRO 2013). The contribution of intermediates in the non-fuel imports is much stronger than the world average of 51%, underscoring their importance for economic activity. A predominance of trade in intermediates also supports access to the factors of production—labor and capital—as the inputs for production, even though the factor of production itself may be non-transportable between the trading partners. In effect, this is expected to relax the domestic shortages on certain factors of production (e.g., capital in the Indian context) leveraging from the changing composition of trade which is increasingly dominated by intermediates. At the same time, a labor displacing effect of import utilization cannot be ruled out due to the cost competitiveness of labor-intensive imports from low-wage countries. Thus, the emerging pattern of trade has the potential to impact the use of domestic factors of production in the economy.
 It is not incidental that the job creation concerns in the Indian economy have increased over time. The declining use of labor has received much attention in the recent policy debate, due to its impact on income inequalities despite the overall economic growth. In fact, issues related to increasing unemployment and low employment generation have been existing even prior to the outbreak of the recent pandemic, hinting towards an underlying structural problem. This is reflected in the fact that despite being the fastest growing economy and abundant endowments of labor, India has not been able to make a headway in the labor-intensive manufacturing which has huge employment potential (Das and Kailta 2010). Measures such as easier FDI norms, trade openness, and the introduction of a market determined exchange rate regime are observed to have limited effects through employment opportunities in the past, particularly in the labor-intensive sectors. Also, the use of capital-intensive inputs has increased, which are sourced through imports. Thus, benefitting from the greater use of capital in the increasingly mechanized methods of production, the structural transformation is also expected to have impacted the factor-mix in the economy in favor of capital use. Further, the rising wage-to-rental ratio in the economy, which reflects upon the changing relative use of the factors of production, is a prime reason for declining employment intensity (Sen and Das 2015). With increasing wage rates relative to the change in the price for capital, it just might be the case that factor proportions (i.e., the relative use of factors of production) have transformed, if not reallocated completely, contributing to changes in the production structure and the income shares of labor and capital. A secular decline in the income share of labor has been substantiated across developed and developing economies challenging the Kaldor thesis of constant shares of the factor incomes (Diwan, 2001). In India, a greater emphasis on investment is evident from the capital formation, in proportionate terms that has remained above the world level since 1994.Footnote 1 However, despite a low domestic capacity utilization of 60–70%, the import dependency of capital goods is estimated high between 40 and 45% (GOI, 2016). Thus, taking into account the impact of the trade channel, through easier access to capital (goods) in the process of industrial upgradation, is important for an open economy as also advocated by Ju et al. (2009). The increasing cross-border mobility of capital (goods) ensures access to international technology through the use of imported inputs (even though at an intermediate level). Trade in intermediates can potentially equalize technology between countries even though technology transfer does not occur. The use of imported capital compensates for the domestic deficit on indigenous technology and innovation, reflecting upon the inadequate national R&D ecosystem. On the labor front, the utilization of imports often gets criticized for an employment displacing effect, although the improved availability of (imported) inputs may also support domestic production in the material using industry. The net effects of the domestic policy as well as the emerging pattern of trade on the changing price and technology, however, are realized through changes in the intensity of the use of a factor of production. Even more, the high-tech imports contributing to automation of the production process embody higher level of skills during the production process. The access to technology and skills, as embodied in the imported intermediate inputs, advantages from better quality with implications for the importing country, like India. While the labor substituting effect of capital is well noted (Pollin 2000), capital-skill complementarities have been suggested by Acemoglue (1998). Therefore, the job creation challenge is of greater concern for the low-skilled workers that constitute a significant proportion of labor as a key factor of production. Although labor-intensive activities have existed traditionally in the Indian economy, the proportionate use of capital (relative to labor) remains underestimated (Tandon 2020). This suggests for a more inclusive assessment by taking the intersectoral relationships into account. In fact, the proportionate use of capital has increased even in the not so capital-intensive sectors, such as textiles, due to the technology upgradation drive, one-time capital subsidy, and reduced credit rates (Gulhane and Turukmane 2017). In the backdrop of India’s emerging pattern of trade, this paper makes an assessment of the changing intensity of use of the two key factors of production, viz., labor and capital, in the economy. The analysis aims to provide an estimate of the impact of import utilization on the use of labor and capital. Incidentally, the existing studies on India have a constricted view of the economy on at least three key aspects. First, most studies have a partial equilibrium approach that confines to select sector(s) and/or a specific factor of production. While employment-related studies are more common in the literature, capital as a factor of production has remained under-researched due to the measurement related difficulties. Although the declining share of labor, as representing lower use of labor, has been registered across regions of the world, there is a void with regard to studies that simultaneously analyze both—labor and capital—income shares. Second, the existing studies also fall short in their accounting of factor usage due to the intermediate inputs required in preceding stage(s) of production. It is pertinent to note that sectors (or activities) do not only use factors of production for self, but also have an induced effect on other sectors due to their input and supply relationships. With growing trade in intermediate goods, as compared with the trade contribution of finished goods, the factor demand is affected in industries that use imported intermediates, in addition to the import-competing industries. Thus, a net effect on factor use that is manifested through the changes in factor intensity is difficult to predict ex-ante due to the difference in production technology of the trading partners. More particularly, the sector-level differences in employment, nature of employment, and trade exposure are likely to have a differentiated effect across sectors of the economy. Given the difference in employment sensitivity of the sectors, it becomes important to empirically test for the effect of trade on factors of production through a study of the changing use over time. Third, among the already scarce literature, studies on India overlook a differentiated factor use between the domestically produced and imported inputs. For instance, imports from advanced countries are likely to be more capital-intensive than if produced using domestically available technology, thus inducing a (likely) downward bias in the estimated capital intensity of the economy. It would be interesting to note the effect of capital imports on capital use and also on the use of capital relative to labor. Since imports are mainly intermediates, which are also more capital-intensive than final goods, this amounts to weakening of linkages within domestic production. The present paper addresses these shortcomings through improving the scope of measurement for the two factors of production, namely labor and capital. Considering the coexistence of labor- and capital-intensive activities in the Indian economy, and their interactions with each other further strengthens the need for a comprehensive assessment of use of factors of production in the Indian economy. In the backdrop of the expected change in the use of factors of production, and also their changing relative use, the present research findings will be of significance for the policy makers in understanding the differential impact of import utilization across sectors of the economy.Footnote 2 Remaining part of the paper is structured into five sections. The following section in paper presents the framework of analysis. Successive sections elaborate the methodological formulation; cover the scope of analysis, data sources, and reference period. This is followed by the section presenting the results and discussion. The final section concludes with policy implications. The appendices are arranged at the end after the list of references.",

The green revolution technology changed the scenario of wheat cultivation during the late sixties and seventies. With the introduction of improved seed and fertilizer technology and improvement in irrigation methods, there has been considerable expansion in the area and production of wheat in India (Bhalla and Singh 2001). The area under wheat cultivation increased from 9.75 million hectares in 1950–51 to 123.94 million hectares in 2018–19, production of wheat in all India increased from 6.46 million tons in 1950–51 to 102.20 million tons in 2018–19, and all India yield of wheat also increased from 663 kg per hectare in 1950–51 to 2299 kg per hectare in 2018–19 (Government of India 2019–20). Kannan and Sundaram (2011) found an increase in the share of the value of wheat crop from 7.25 per cent to 10.17 per cent and reported a significant increase (2.45 per cent) in the compound annual growth rate of wheat yield during 1967–68 to 2007–08. The performance of trend in the productivity growth of wheat is overwhelming; the contribution of agriculture to the Gross Value Added (GVA) was reported 16.5 per cent in 2019–20 which was 16.1 per cent in 2018–19 (Government of India 2019–20). The agricultural sector in India, despite the vast growth potential, is showing a decline in terms of productivity due to irrational exploitation of resources, improper adoption of technology, anomalies in policy formulations, continuously increasing cost of cultivation and attaining of saturation in the green revolution belts (Singh 2007a).The average size of operational holdings in India has declined to 1.16 hectare in 2010–11 which was 2.28 hectare in 1970–71 and 86.21 per cent of the farms are less than 2 hectares (Govt. of India, 2018); Moreover, the fragmentation of farms reflects from the fact that the number of farms increased by 194 per cent while the rural population by 189 per cent between 1970–71 and 2010–11 (Chand et al. 2011). There has been decline in the growth rate in agriculture GDP in India in recent years. In Punjab, the agriculture GDP growth rate is just 1.6 per cent per annum during 2005–06 to 2016–17. Food grain production constitutes the major portion of agriculture sector in India and among food grains wheat is produced and consumed in northern India by the vast number of people. Chand (2007) reported that the wheat production went down in 2005–06 and predicted that downward trend in wheat production would lead to food insecurity to the large section of the population. Nair and Eapen (2012) attributed the mismanagement of the MSP prices and decrease in wheat allotment offtake by the government has resulted in the wheat price inflation in the contemporary period while Chand (2009) pointed out that poor intervention of the government has caused distortion in the market as there is frequent fluctuation in the prices of the wheat stocks in India causing imbalance between demand and supply of wheat. Dev and Rao (2010) examined the effectiveness of agricultural price policies, for rice and wheat crops, in ensuring profitability and food security to the farmers by studying rice and wheat prices and found the similar trends in the significant growth rate in the yield of wheat crop in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and all India from 1981–82 to 2006–07. Krishnamurthy (2012) reported that there is negligible role of the government to buy wheat crop from the buyers in Madhya Pradesh, besides a poor record on distribution of food through the Public Distribution System (PDS). Mann (2017) found a drastic change in the cropping patterns in the aspects of production basket in Punjab, which resulted in decrease in the area under wheat production from 3,510 thousand hectares in 2010–11 to 3,505 thousand hectares in 2014–15, hence, the share of area under wheat production remained stagnant for the same period. Chand (1999) measured the profitability of major crops in Punjab agriculture during the 2000s and reported emerging crisis in the sector and suggested diversification of cropping patterns in order to increase the farm income whereas Singh et al. (2009) found that small and marginal farmers in Punjab leave farming in distress owing to lack of institutional support such as demonstration and training for the skill development among the small and marginal farmers is almost nil in the state. The wheat farms in Haryana exhibit 53 per cent inefficiency in the use of agro-chemicals (Singh 2006), low level of education, low access to institutional credit for farmers and continues fragmentation of farm holdings are chief concerns for low profitability of farmers (Singh 2007a) and the yield of wheat can be increased by 15 per cent without increasing the level of inputs, if the inefficiency is reduced (Singh 2007b). Under this context, the paper aims to examine the trends in profitability of wheat cultivation in major wheat-growing states of India in the groaning of rising cost of cultivation and inadequate profit from crop cultivation and agricultural crisis. In this backdrop, the study is a fresh attempt to measure the profitability of wheat crop amid rising farmer’s suicides in India especially in major wheat-producing states. More specifically, the paper deal with the issue of agrarian crisis and profitability of wheat crop in five major wheat-producing states for the period 1970–71 to 2016–17 and further categorizing the period into Agrarian Crisis Pre 1990s and Agrarian Crisis Post-1990s. The paper continues as follows. Section 2 deals with methodology adopted in the course of the study, while Sect. 3 highlights the enduring agrarian crisis in the country. Section 4 analyses the growth rate and profitability of wheat crop in the selected states in India and Sect. 5 pertains to the conclusions and policy suggestions.",

In-migration to Kerala is a relatively recent phenomenon compared to out-migration from the state, and this has received relatively less attention among administrators and policy makers. The out-migration and return migration into Kerala have served to mask the volume of inter-state migration. Keralites with better education and higher literacy found it challenging to find concurrent skilled and professional jobs in Kerala, resulting in massive out-migration in search of skilled employment and better wages (Rajan 2014). This out-migration along with the demographic transition in Kerala have resulted in a situation where migrants from other states fill the existing labour shortage (Rajan et al. 2018). The inter-state migration patterns into Kerala have changed over the past two decades, with more long-distance migrants sharing a significant quantum of in-migration into Kerala (Peter and Narendran 2017). Initially, inter-state in-migrants were mainly from neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and these migrants worked in plantations of Idukki and Wayanad (Surabi and Kumar 2007). In the early 1990s, migrants from Odisha and Assam started working in the wood industry in Kerala after the crisis in plywood industries in their source areas (Peter and Narendran 2017). Now, a significant number of migrants travel to Kerala from the north and north eastern states. These long-distance migrants embody added layers of vulnerability as they mainly hail from disadvantaged locations (CMID 2019). This understanding of the changing pattern, numbers, socio-cultural ethos and inherent vulnerabilities associated with inter-state migrants will serve towards designing migrant inclusive welfare programs in Kerala. Both Census and National Sample Survey (NSS) provide information on in-migration. In the Census, migrants are classified as ‘Migrants by birth place' and ‘Migrants by place of last residence'. ‘Migrants by birth place' are defined as persons who were enumerated in a place different from the place where they were born, and ‘Migrants by Place of last residence' are defined as persons whose place of the last residence is different from the place of enumeration(Census 2011a). Till 1961, census migration data was collected by place of birth only. Since 1971 migration data is being collected for ‘place of birth' and ‘place of last residence'. The NSS defines migrants only by place of last residence criteria (Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation 2010). The data on migration collected in the Census and NSS fails to capture the real volume of migration with any degree of accuracy as they exclude seasonal migration, temporary and circular migrants (Bhagat 2005). Another concern with the existing sources of data for migration is its timeliness. The NSS survey on migration was conducted during 2007–2008, while the latest Census was conducted in 2011, and data was made available only in 2019. This delay in data availability has resulted in novel approaches by academicians and others to estimate the interstate in-migration to Kerala. In a train travel -based study in 2013, domestic migrant labourers were estimated to be 2.5 million (Narayana and Venkiteswaran 2013). Another study estimated the volume of interstate migrants using total employment data as 3.14 million in 2017–18 (Parida and Raman 2021). Migration scholars have critiqued the earlier train travel-based study for overestimating migrants. However, similar methods have been employed by the Economic Survey of 2016–17 to provide estimates of labour migration across the country (Economic Survey 2016–17). The Census data on migration is compromised by the definitions used but it still provides a comprehensive description of the volume and patterns of migration. While the volume of migration is disputed, the patterns of migration offers insights as regard regarding the source states and therefore enables identification of potential vulnerabilities with respect to health. The host state requires information about its migrant population to bridge the information gap about the number of migrants working, their distribution and details of their sending states. This understanding could eventually be used for planning, provisioning for health and welfare activities, sensitization of host communities, and developing migrant inclusive policies (Parida and Raman 2021). This exploration in particular tries to describe the patterns of in-migration into Kerala, significant reasons for in-migration and identifying the distinguishing characteristics of internal migrants by comparing them against non-migrants in Kerala. This analysis proposes to describe the mobility into Kerala state by examining the inter-state and inter/intra-district migration streams, identifying the reasons for migration across the districts of Kerala and describe the migrants in terms of their characteristics including marital status, literacy and employment, using the data from the 2011 Census of India.",

T. M. Hasibul Islam,Syed Abul Basher,A. K. Enamul Haque,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since its inception in the Philippines in 2001, mobile money has become a lifeline for millions of poor people who have limited access to a formal banking system. However, the rapid growth of mobile money services in developing countries results from the successful implementation of M-PESA, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya. Incorporated in 2011, Bangladesh's equivalent of M-PESA is called bKash.Footnote 1 Mobile money services have revolutionized the lives of the poor in several ways. Starting from simply sending and receiving money, mobile money is used to “buy” free mobile airtime and saves precious time for women in rural areas that would otherwise be spent traveling. As we elaborate in the next section, the economics of mobile money services encompasses benefits like women empowerment, risk sharing, improved labor market outcomes and reductions in poverty. The academic interest in mobile financial services (MFS) stems largely from its potential to address a number of market failures (e.g., banking the unbanked, transaction costs) and the resulting impact on poverty, among other outcomes. By now, a burgeoning branch of literature empirically analyzes the economic impact of mobile money. In reviewing the literature, Aron (2018) developed an analytical typology table that summarized the findings of nearly 20 empirical studies, whereas Aron (2017) offered a more in-depth analysis of micro-empirical studies. One conclusion arising from these reviews is the underlying data and the methodological challenge of ensure that appropriate data are used to separate the broader effect of mobile money on rural livelihoods. How does mobile money help reduce poverty? To reduce poverty, mobile money must address the problems that the poor so often encounter. One such problem concerns the capability of surviving unexpected expenses such as purchasing livestock or buying farming equipment at the right times. In such situations, reliance on cash is tricky because it is easy to lose or spend. Having access to a bank or mobile money helps people take control of their money and financial lives (Klapper 2018). Moreover, it also softens the impact of sudden health-related expenses and thus prevents people from falling into poverty. Jack and Suri (2014) found that households without access to mobile money account suffered a 7% drop in consumption compared with households with access to mobile money. Mobile money may not be the solution to extreme poverty, but mobile money and bank accounts enable poor people to effectively confront the problems that keep them stuck in poverty. The main goal of this paper is to develop an empirical framework for quantifying the impact of the bKash mobile money service on poverty in the 63 districts of Bangladesh. Identifying the causality from mobile money to poverty reduction is not without problems. Some challenges include potential reverse causality from poverty (the lack of it) to greater use of mobile money services, and omitted variables, as many observed and unobserved factors affect poverty. We address this potential endogeneity bias through the use of an instrumental variable regression model, where, following earlier approaches in the literature, a suitable instrument (i.e., “agent density"") was chosen. The average marginal impact for bKash transactions across all the districts is 0.71% point decrease in poverty rate being associated with every 1 billion Taka (approximately US$ 11.76 million) mobile money transaction via the bKash system. The effect is statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Districts categorized into different quintiles as per their 2010 poverty rates have different effects. The largest impact of bKash mobile money on poverty which is statistically significant is found for quintile 5, which comprises of the poorest districts in 2010. A byproduct of our analysis shows a rather persistent effect of the previous poverty level on today's poverty in Bangladesh. The estimated coefficient on lagged poverty suggests a half-life of poverty of 4.5 years. Taken together, our results complement the existing literature which suggests that mobile money promotes the welfare and well-being of the poor. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the legal and economic environment of MFS. Section 3 briefly reviews empirical studies on the connection between mobile money and poverty reduction. Section 4 discusses the data and offers some summary statistics of the variables of interest. Section 5 outlines the econometric methodology and the model specification. Section 6 presents some graphical analyses as well as the main empirical results. Section 7 concludes the paper.",1

Alao,Andrew A. Alola,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How severe are the poverty and the income inequality in Africa? Despite the recent economic growth experienced in some regions or countries in the continent (Asongu and Kodila-Tedika 2018), appropriate answers are yet to sufficiently underpin the seemingly regenerative cause of this dilemma in Africa’s poor. The rising profile of poverty and inequality in the poorest region and in some developing countries has been a source of worry for governments, policymakers, and intergovernmental agencies (Choi 2021). Thus, the goal of driving the poverty reduction agenda of the United Nations is paramount in the organization’s 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) declarations. According to the United Nations (UN) (2000), eight (8) Millennium Development Goals (MDG) were set up. The MDGs rolled out by the UN were committed to building a safer, more prosperous, and more equitable, egalitarian world. From the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the 8th plenary meeting in New York, USA, September 8, 2000, the United Nations Millennium Declaration, under the caption (III) envisioned Development and Poverty Eradication where “UN will spare no effort to free people and especially the vulnerable groups such as children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected”. The declaration roadmap set out eight time-bound and measurable goals achievable by 2015. Goal one (1) was to create No-Poverty world latest by 2015. Others include: achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women; reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability while goal (8) focus on how to develop a global partnership for development (United Nations 2015a, b). There is a growing negative relationship between foreign aids and poverty mitigation in the recipient countries (Akobeng 2017; Vacaflores 2018; Gharleghi and Jahanshahi 2020). In contrast, Chong et al. (2009) and Briggs (2017) found that aids are ineffective. While Allen et al. (2021) explored the role of science in sustainable development, the current study is investigating the drive toward attaining sustainable development by looking at the effect of aid and inequality on poverty in fifty African countries. Though with different scope, the closest paper to the study is Vacaflores (2018). Questioning whether remittances are helping to lower poverty and inequality levels in Latin America, Vacaflores (2018) uses dynamic GMM to examine the effectiveness of aids in reducing poverty and inequality and found that increases in aids have a negative and significant impact on poverty and inequality in the region. Additionally, Akobeng (2017) found that aid flow to Africa reduces poverty but the size of the poverty reduction depends on how poverty is being measured. To solve the rigidity of static models, a new dynamic tool was introduced in the 2000s to subdue the endogeneity of variables of models using instrumental variables and to also take charge of heterogeneity of the individuals. In the context of dynamic panel data analysis, mention must be made of Baltagi and Levin (1986) followed by the increasingly popular Baltagi (2005), Baltagi (2008), Arellano and Bond (1991), and Arellano and Bover (1995). The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of foreign aids on poverty-inequality in Africa covering fifty selected African countries from 1990 to 2016. The research question is: do United Nations Development Programme funds and OECD’s Official Development Assistance matter in poverty-cutting in the poorest region? The quest for answers to this question formed the basis of the research and paved the way for the objective which is to explore the effect of aids on poverty and inequality in Africa. It is crucial to provide pragmatic answers to these questions because it is projected that many most vulnerable countries are will not achieve any of the SDGs target (Moyer and Hedden 2020), and financing the SDGs is one of the biggest challenges of development today (Barua 2020) The current study is designed to advance a related study of Gharleghi and Jahanshahi (2020). On the novelty, the current study contributes to the literature by examining the effectiveness of aid from the United Nations (UN) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Official Development Assistance to Africa. Although a handful of studies have examined the potential mitigating drivers of poverty and income inequality in Africa, the conceptual framework adopted in the current study is the first in the literature. Assessing the effect of aids from different donor agencies is vital. The criteria of aid allocation could be responsible for the kind of relationship between aids and poverty in the recipient countries. This is because both donors and recipients countries are primarily concerned about the optimal allocation of the aids. In this regard, aid agencies set up guidelines, quantitative criteria (formulas), or formal models for the allocation of their resources to different developing countries. Meanwhile, the formula is the most conventional criteria, which corresponds to Performance-Based Allocation (PBA). However, different donors use different formulas. Hence, the difference in criteria might result in the different effects of aid on poverty. This study includes aids from different donors and also accounts for income distribution to evaluate the effects of the aids on poverty in Africa. The paper is made up of six sections. The other sections are arranged such that “Synopsis of poverty, inequality, and aids in Africa, 1990–2016” section presents a synopsis of variables of interest, “Literature review” section briefly highlights the literature review while the methodology is presented in “Methodology” section. The fifth and sixth sections discuss the results and concluding remarks with policy direction, respectively.",2

Amoateng,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Climate change according to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) encompasses all forms of climatic variability on time scale that spans over a decade and can be observed through changes in the average weather patterns all over the world. Climate change poses a threat to global prosperity, survival of future generations and it is currently ranked by the World Economic Forum (2019) as the greatest threat to the planet. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global temperature will increase by about 2.8 °C over the next century if the necessary emission control and remedial measures are not taken seriously (IPCC 2007). This is projected to increase not just the severity but also the frequency of extreme weather events in the twenty-first century (IPCC 2012, 2007). This is particularly true because the records of the WMO indicates that 14 of the 15 warmest years have all taken place in the twenty-first century. There is enough available scientific support (see Kireyev 2018; Lis and Nickel 2010; IPCC 2007) to back the assertion that the rise in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events are due to climate change disruptions. Also, the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (2017) asserts that more than 90 percent of disasters that have occurred globally in the last two decades emanates from climate-related causes. Extreme weather events are a special type of natural disasters, particularly meteorological, hydrological and climatological that may require a declaration of a state of emergency or a call for international assistance. In Africa, extreme weather events are mainly caused by storms, extreme temperatures (heat wave or cold wave), floods, wildfires landslide and droughts. According to the Global Climate Risk Index report (2017), more than half a million people died due to 11 thousand extreme weather events between 1996 and 2015. This resulted to a damage cost of three trillion dollars due to floods, storms, heatwaves and other climate-related disasters. In Africa, about 51,569 people have been killed and 412 million people adversely affected due to 1,381 different forms of weather events over the period 1990 to December 2019 as recorded in the emergency events database maintained by Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). This has led to a total damage cost of over US$ 19.78 billion to property, crops and livestock. Climate change and extreme weather events have led to loss of human life, destructions to property, human capital and may have stalled productivity. Available evidence (IMF 2017) indicates that an increase in average temperature by 1 °C can reduce GDP per capita by about 1.5 percent in sub-Sahara Africa. Other studies (see Cashin et al. 2017; Hallegatte et al. 2016) indicate that extreme weather events have detrimental effects on economic activity in Africa. Few others such as Bachner et al. (2019); Melecky and Raddatz (2015); Noy and Nualsri (2011); Lis and Nickel (2010) claim that natural disasters and extreme weather events can have serious issues for public finances and budget balances. This presupposes that climate change and extreme weather events have dire consequences for fiscal policy all over the world. This is very evident in the billions of dollars committed by developed and developing nations alike to adapt to climate change impacts and also to mitigate future climatic disruptions. An important illustration is the pledge made by developed countries as enshrined in the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2009 to support developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change with about 100 billion USD per annum until 2020. The fiscal implications of climate change and extreme weather events cannot be denied and a cause for major concern. This concern is very real in most African countries because they already have limited fiscal space and run on high fiscal deficits (see Fig. 1). Source: Authors construct from IMF data (2019) Regional distribution of fiscal balance for the period 1990–2017. Moreover, there are urgent and burgeoning issues with poverty and inequality that require critical attention within the limited fiscal space. It is even more threatening for Africa because the continent is considered to be the most vulnerable to climate change impacts (Farid et al. 2016; World Bank 2014) and further inactions will have severe repercussions. That notwithstanding, most African governments prioritize job creation and poverty alleviation at the expense of environmental concerns as alluded to by Mburia (2015). Available evidence can be found in the 2017 ranking of countries with strong adaptive capacity to climate change by Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN). Countries such as Norway, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden and Australia ranked highest in that order, while African countries such as Niger, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Eritrea, Chad and Somalia completed the list in a descending order. When it comes to country’s preparedness and resilience to climate change impacts, only Mauritius, Morocco and South Africa garnered an average score in the rankings by Notre Dame. This makes most African countries very vulnerable to climatic disruptions. It is necessary to consider the fiscal aspect of climate change because it may have serious implications for debt sustainability and the economic survival of future generations. More so, when the United Nations Climate Change (UNCC 2018) says that, climate change is gradually increasing the cost of capital and recent projections indicate there will be an additional USD 168 billion in debt payments over the next decade especially among countries that are very vulnerable to climate change. Consequently, our study investigates the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on fiscal balance in Africa and the implications for fiscal policy formulation. Our study departs from the general trend of finding the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on growth (see Mendelsohn 2013; Dell et al. 2012; Cavallo and Noy 2010), estimating the economic cost of climate change (see Mekonnen 2014; Stern 2006) and the fiscal implications of natural disasters (see Bachner et al. 2019; Ouattara and Strobl 2013; Noy and Nualsri 2011). Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which institutions and adaptive capacity modulate the impacts of extreme weather events and climate change on fiscal balance. Our study is the first attempt to study these phenomena in a more comprehensive manner in the context of Africa. The subsequent sections discuss the literature, methods, results, conclusion and policy recommendations.",1

In order to curb the spread of the virus, many countries implemented a variety of public health policies, such as travel bans, social distancing, quarantine in hospitals and government-designated areas, strict limits on the size of public gatherings and curfews. In the same frame of mind, Hartley and Perencevich (2020) asserted that these measures aim to reduce the spread of further infection and prevent health system strain. The implementation of these restrictive measures has produced varying results across sub-Saharan African countries. In some cases like in South Africa, the lockdowns seemed to have reduced COVID-19 cases (see Fig. 1). In other sub-Saharan African countries, for example in Cameroon, there were no clear results indicating a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases (see Fig. 2). Source: Authors’ computation and illustration based on COVID-19 data obtained from Johns Hopkins Restrictive measures and lockdowns in South Africa during COVID-19. Source: Authors’ computation and illustration based on COVID-19 data obtained from Johns Hopkins Restrictive measures and lockdowns in Cameroon during COVID-19. Given this caveat, socio-economic indicators could be used to study the differences in COVID-19 outcomes between sub-Saharan African countries. Applying socio-economic indicators can potentially aid in understanding the trends of the spread of the virus and could also assist in the formulation of strategic policies to mitigate the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesise that there is an interplay between socio-economic indicators and COVID-19 cases (confirmed and death cases). It has been suggested that the pandemic might be particularly detrimental in less-developed countries. There are two strands of literature studying the correlation of COVID-19 cases and socio-economic indicators. The first strand is the literature focusing on the spread of COVID-19, like those of Mihoub et al. (2020). The second strand of literature describes correlations between socio-economic status, demographic factors and COVID-19. For example, the relationship between demographic factors such as old age and COVID-19 was investigated in the study of Applegate and Ouslander (2020). The socio-economic implications of COVID-19 were investigated by Alsafi et al. (2020). Other studies have investigated non-socio-economic indicators and explored the interplay of COVID-19 with ethnicity, for example, in the study of Pareek et al. (2020). However, it has to be understood that these individual factors are likely to be influenced by various country-specific parameters including lockdown policies, public expenditure in health and other country-specific determinants such as level of sanitation, healthcare support, number of acute care beds, hospital beds and number of physicians. Our paper adds to the growing body of literature on COVID-19 trends and socio-economic indicators. In comparison with existing literature, this study conducts a multilinear regression and correlation between COVID-19 cases and seven socio-economic indicators in a set of 40 sub-Saharan African countries. The 40 countries used in this study were selected based on data availability for the socio-economic indicators. We accessed publicly available COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins. The country-specific socio-economic variables were obtained from the World Bank.",2
24,2,Journal of Social and Economic Development,19 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-022-00183-3,"Stronger together? Shocks, educational investment, and self-help groups in Tanzania",December 2022,Francisco M. P. Mugizi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economists have long recognized that investment in children’s education—human capital development—is an indispensable determinant of economic growth and development (Schultz 1961; Becker 1962; Lucas 1988; Mankiw et al. 1992; Jensen 2000). Investment in human capital also plays a pivotal role in enhancing human welfare by reducing poverty and its intergenerational transmission (Jensen 2000; Ferreira and Schady 2009). Moreover, evidence shows that private and social returns to education are not only large (Psacharopoulos 1981, 1994; Schultz 1993; Card 2001; Psacharopoulos and Patrinos 2018), but also are observed in both self- and wage-employment labour markets and for both men and women (Vijverberg 1993; Glick and Sahn 1997). Notwithstanding the numerous benefits attributed to educational investment, households in developing countries invest sub-optimally in schooling, even when the returns exceed the costs (Kazianga 2012). One of the reasons could be that households in developing countries are exposed to several shocksFootnote 1 (Hoddinott and Kinsey 2001; Dercon 2002, 2005; Kazianga and Udry 2006), which may disrupt their financial stability. Coupled with imperfection and incompleteness of financial and insurance markets, shocks may affect parents’ abilities to invest optimally in their children’s schooling. In this paper, I examine the relationship between income shock and educational investment—an important parental input into the learning process. I also examine whether self-help groups or Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) help members to cushion against shocks. The paper contributes to two strands of literature. First, it complements the existing literature on shocks and child schooling in developing countries by examining the effect of income shock on both per school-age child educational expenditure and budget share of education. Its unique contribution is the use of 1-to 3-year-lagged income shocks (past income shocks) to examine how persistent the effects of shocks on educational investment are. To my knowledge, this has never been examined at least in the context of Tanzania. Second, the study contributes to the literature on household buffering mechanisms against shocks. This study is important, in particular, for a country like Tanzania were most households face risks of exposure to shocks and lack means to buffer against the shocks. I use the nationally representative household panel data from Tanzania and exploits temporal variations in exposure to shocks. I also exploit the panel nature of the data and use household fixed effects model with region-specific time-fixed effects. The former helps to control unobserved household-specific time-invariant characteristics that would affect both shocks and educational investment. The latter eliminates aggregate region-year specific unobservable characteristics that would affect educational investment as well as shocks. I find that income shock is negatively and statistically correlated with per school-age child educational expenditure. Regarding the role of self-help groups and SACCOs in buffering against shocks, neither membership in self-help groups nor SACCOs is found to offset the effect of income shock on educational investment. Like other investment ventures, educational investment demands financial resources. More importantly, because educational investment is not a one-time investment, parents must be financially stable to afford schooling costs throughout their children schooling cycle. Income shocks can disrupt parents’ financial stability and ability to afford school expenses. Shocks—unexpected events within households and communities such as weather shocks, commodity price shocks, crop diseases, severe illness or death of a bread earner or other household members—can have deleterious and irreversible effects on children’s schooling and development. For example, as a coping strategy to shocks, parents may withdraw their children from school to work in the household or elsewhere. Shocks can also affect or delay enrolment of prospective pupils if parents become unable to afford school expenses. Studies have documented the harmful effects of shocks on various measures of schooling such as poor attendance of pupils (Jacoby and Skoufias 1997; Jensen 2000; Beegle et al. 2006; Bandara et al. 2015) and delayed enrolment (Jensen 2000; Gertler et al. 2004; Cogneau and Jedwab 2012; Björkman-nyqvist 2013; Shah and Steinberg 2017). Similarly, shocks such as severe illness, death or unemployment of a bread earner or household member have been associated with a high likelihood of school dropout (Duryea et al. 2007; Mottaleb et al. 2015; Glick et al. 2016) and poor performance in school (Duryea et al. 2007). Shocks have also been found to cause child labour (Jacoby and Skoufias 1997; Beegle et al. 2006; Duryea et al. 2007; Bandara et al. 2015). Elsewhere, droughts and commodity price shocks have been found to cause malnutrition, stunt and morbidity (Jensen 2000; Cogneau and Jedwab 2012). Most worryingly, these effects may have long-lasting negative implications. While studies have examined the effects of shocks on various outcomes such as enrolment to school, child labour, school attendance and performance, little is known as to whether shocks affect parents’ financial abilities and decisions to invest in education, particularly in Tanzanian context. Income shocks may reduce household’s ability to afford school-related costs such as school fees, uniforms, books and other expenses which are important inputs in child schooling. This is a topic worthy of examination since investment in human capital development is widely recognised as one of the key drivers of economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. Although income shocks can negatively affect parental investment in the education of their children, access to credits or insurance markets can mitigate the potential effect. Nevertheless, in Tanzania like in most developing countries, formal financial and insurance institutions are not readily available, particularly in rural areas. Moreover, even when they are available, most of the poor do not save in these institutions. In addition, the poor hardly borrow from these institutions because of stringent collateral requirements. If households cannot borrow or save, they must finance a given period’s educational investment out of current-period’s income. However, not all households can manage to make educational investment by relying on their current-period’s income, more so, when they experience shocks. Because of imperfection and incompleteness of financial markets, households normally use a number of strategies to cope with shocks. In Tanzanian, such coping mechanisms include self-help groups and SACCOs.Footnote 2 Both are increasingly gaining popularity especially among the poor.Footnote 3 While SACCOs are more formal than self-help groups, in most cases, both cover a small geographic area. A key feature shared by both arrangements is that loanable funds are mobilised by members through monthly contributions (savings). In addition, funds accumulate through interest on loans and fines for late payments or violations of other by-laws. Members can borrow money to meet their financial needs. For some self-hep groups, members can also get financial support especially when they are in serious financial hardships resulting from unexpected negative events. Unlike formal financial or insurance markets, funds are more affordable and easily accessible (Abay et al. 2017); except for one’s personal savings, no other collateral is required to get loans. The major goal of these associations is to improve the economic wellbeing of members. However, they can also play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of income shocks on educational investment. This potential role has not been researched. This paper fills this void in the literature. The paper proceeds as follows. “Tanzania’s education system” section provides a brief explanation on Tanzania’s education system. “Data and descriptive statistics” section describes the data and descriptive statistics. The estimation strategy is discussed in “Estimation strategy” section. “Estimation results” section presents and discusses the empirical results. “Conclusion and policy implications” section concludes and provides policy recommendations.",

However, the increase has been unequal among social and religious groups. The question is, what factors determine participation in higher education and to what extent do caste and religious background play a role in determining inter-group inequality in higher education? The economic analysis of education goes back to the human capital approach by Schultz (1961), Becker (1964), and Mincer (1958). Schultz (1961) argued that expenditure on education is an investment bearing a return in terms of high earnings and leading to the formation of capital, namely, human capital. Becker (1964) viewed investment in education as a rational decision based on cost–benefit analysis. The contribution of Mincer (1958) lies in terms of education–earning relations, wherein earning is a function of schooling and experience. Studies have documented the role of family income in educational achievement (Cameron and Heckman 2001; Carneiro and Heckman 2002) through cognitive ability and improved purchasing power, particularly in situations where higher education is costly. Educational achievement through peer groups and social networks is also affected by the family background. There are a few studies at all India level analysing unequal participation in higher education by social, religious, and income groups (Barooah 2017; Khan 2015; Khan 2017; Tilak and Choudhary 2018; Thorat and Khan 2017). However, the difference across course type is rarely captured in any study. The nature of higher education notably varies across course type. The students from privileged background have a higher chance of getting into job oriented professional courses, thereby, displacing the students from the underprivileged background to general courses (Khan 2022). Further, there is a rarely any study assessing the relative contribution of different factors in determining participation in higher education. This study adds to the existing studies by analysing gap in the probability of participation in higher education attributed to the caste and religious background on the one hand and endowment on the other hands. Furthermore, the analysis at all India scenario does not capture the state specific factors. There is a wide variation in the performance of different states. For example, the GAR, defined as the percentage of population in 18–23 years attending higher post higher secondary education is 40% or above in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttrakhand and below the national average in Odisha, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, and MP (Table 7). The special emphasis on a particular state is needed in order to capture the impact of states specific characteristics on different economic outcomes. This paper focuses on one the largest and the most populous state of India, Uttar Pradesh. It is one of the low performing states in terms of higher education. Furthermore, it houses a significant number of people belonging to the underprivileged groups, namely, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Muslims. As per the Census 2011, SCs comprise 4.13 crore people, with a share of 20.7% of the total population of the state. Muslims account for nearly 3.8 crore people in the state, accounting for 19.3% of the total population. A significant proportion of people are below the poverty line (NSS 2011–2012). Based on the authors calculation of percentage of population below the poverty line using National Sample Survey data on Consumption Expenditure, 2011–2012, it is observed that almost 30% of population of the state below the poverty line. This figure is nearly 41% among the SCs, 31% among the Other Backward Caste (OBCs), and 13% among the high caste. Religion-wise, 29% of Hindus and 35% of Muslims are below the poverty line. Thus, a notable share of people among every social and religious group are below the poverty line. So, improving the performance of the state will affect the national performance significantly. In this regard, equitable expansion of higher education may play an instrumental role due to its close relationship with employment, as mentioned before. Also, improving the participation of underprivileged groups, namely, SCs, OBCs, Muslims, and Economically Weaker Section (EWS) among different groups including high caste may hold the key to achieving the target of doubling the enrolment in higher education by 2035 as envisaged in the National Education Policy, 2020. The paper presents the issue of unequal participation in higher education in the human capital framework. The policy to ensure equal participation in higher education can be seen as a tool for income redistribution as a higher level of education results in higher earnings for the individuals getting it. To ensure equality of opportunity in the labour market, equality in participation in higher education is inevitable. There is an advantage in vocational courses in terms of the transition from school to work. Becker (1964) distinguished between general and firm-specific human capital. Vocational education has a relative advantage in the short run as it may simplify the transition from school to work (Mane 1999; Fersterer et al. 2008; Wolter and Ryan 2011). General skills, at least in the short run, may indicate a slow transition from school to work. Studies highlight ability level and family background as the two major factors determining choice of courses. It is generally believed that vocational education is more attractive for low-ability students. However, students from advantaged backgrounds are more likely to perform well, and children are more likely to make more ambitious educational choices. Furthermore, students from poor families have a higher chance to leave schools and earn money (Khan 2022). Although education augments natural abilities that are subsequently sold in the labour market, there is a cost associated with higher education, direct cost in terms of expenditure incurred and opportunity cost as forgone earnings while at college. The expectation of a higher return after graduating from higher education leads to the creation of demand for higher education. However, this expectation might be lower for students coming from disadvantaged groups in the presence of labour market discrimination. Further, the impact of direct cost would be higher upon them due to their low affordability. Thus, the underlying social structure affects both the cost of and benefits from higher education. Thus, the hypothesis in the background is that there exists inequality in participation in higher education due to family background affecting demand for higher education differently among different social and religious groups, and this demand is further affected in professional education, which is relatively costlier. With this hypothesis in mind, this paper examines higher education participation and the impact of social and religious affiliations as well as income background on participation in higher education in Uttar Pradesh.",
25,1,Journal of Social and Economic Development,28 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-023-00235-2,Climate policy and the concept of co-benefits in India,June 2023,Theresa Stahlke,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Developing countries are striving for development up to the standard of living in industrialized countries. Economic growth and poverty reduction are therefore the first priorities in policy-making (Ürge-Vorsatz and Herrero 2012). Closely related to this is the increase in energy demand due to higher economic output and population growth. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that if policies remain unchanged, India’s energy demand will double by 2040 (IEA 2020a). If there is no change in the development path, the increasing energy demand and population growth will lead to higher emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). The GHG emissions of a country are positively dependent on carbon intensity, energy intensity of the gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, and on population (Parikh and Parikh 2002). It is very likely that the GDP and population will continue to rise in developing countries. From 1990 to 2018, India’s population grew by 55% while the GDP per capita has increased 4.5-fold (World Bank 2020). Without an adjustment of policy objectives, emissions will inevitably rise if there is no massive technological progress (Parikh and Parikh 2002). Climate change harms all countries. However, it is often the developing countries that are affected severely by the consequences due to their geographical conditions or dependence on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture (Leichenko and Silva 2014). Climate change can therefore seriously constrain their development objectives in the areas of poverty alleviation, access to clean water and energy, food security, etc., and thus jeopardize the future prosperity of developing countries (Beg et al. 2002). Consequently, the mitigation of climate change is another policy objective for developing countries that has become increasingly important over the years. Such policies can have negative impacts on development targets, especially in the short term, which is why governments are often unambitious about taking mitigation measures (Pearce 2000). On the one hand, negative effects can result directly from mitigation policies; for example, the promotion of renewable energies can lead to higher electricity prices and thus come in the way of poverty alleviation. On the other hand, there are opportunity costs, since financial resources spent on mitigation cannot be invested in development measures. So, mitigation policy is closely linked to development policy, and it is necessary to find strategies that are not contrary to the objectives. An optimal policy would address and positively reinforce both. In other words, it would include measures which serve one objective and simultaneously benefit the other objective. Industrialized countries have the incentive to emphasize the positive link between development and mitigation goals, as this could make climate protection more attractive for developing countries. However, developing countries like India are reluctant to follow the approach of co-benefits of mitigation because of fears that co-costs, which slow down development, might predominate (Jakob and Steckel 2014). In the area of climate financing,Footnote 1 on the other hand, the link could be valuable for developing countries, as it offers the opportunity to achieve development goals through financial support of mitigation by industrialized countries. The co-benefits approach has become increasingly relevant to international negotiations over the years and influenced decisions in climate finance. Whether mitigation of climate change or development goals are of greater importance is a recurring concern in the design of international agreements and climate financing instruments. In this paper, the relationship between aiming for development and aiming for mitigation of climate change is analyzed from the perspective of India as a developing country. For this purpose, the national climate policy is presented and placed into the context of the co-benefits approach. By means of a literature and document study, the development of the conflict of interest is analyzed from the beginning of climate policy activity. Thus, the research questions of this paper are (1) what is the relationship between aiming for development and aiming for climate change mitigation in India’s policy and (2) what influence does the conflict of interest between development and climate change mitigation have on international climate policy. The study examines development and climate policy strategy papers and action plans of the Indian government since 2006, as well as international climate policy documents including the IPCC Assessment Reports since 2001 and the outcomes and agreements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Parties (Conferences of the Parties) (COP) since the UNFCCC was developed in 1992. The content of the policy documents was examined for linkages between development and climate policy and for references to the term “co-benefits”. In the next section, we will look at the evolution of the co-benefits approach, demonstrating the ambivalent relationship between mitigation and development using examples from India. This is followed by a presentation of India’s political stance on mitigation and development objectives, and the meaning of the co-benefits approach in the developing country’s policy-making. The paper shows if and when India’s policies have moved more toward the mitigation objective. The last section concludes.",

However, high labor market participation rates do not automatically mean increased well-being. With the one-child policy, educated women’s incomes have increased which makes them more empowered not only in their families but also in society. Women’s empowerment conflicts with the traditional Confucian culture, leading to gaps in well-being among men and women (Chen and Wen 2019; Hannum et al. 2013; Maslak 2011). Improvements in women's education levels lead to changes in their relative incomes which in turn lead to changes in empowerment within families (Chen and Wen 2019). Whether and how these changes affect people’s well-being is an important research question. One can also ask about extent to which education influences women’s well-being in China. How is their well-being different from men’s well-being? This research provides empirical evidence on the relationship between education and well-being from a gender perspective.
 Subjective well-being is a personal answer to what individuals feel about their well-being. Most research on economic well-being is related to the relationship between the physical quality of life and subjective well-being (Bertrand et al. 2015; Stutzer 2004). Subjective well-being is also called economic welfare. However, economic well-being slowly adapts into a comprehensive concept which can be viewed as a feeling of fairness or sense of social identity which can then be transformed into a capability that enables people to achieve the functioning capacity that they think is important (Silber 2007). The second measure is parametric and multidimensional which also includes information on identity, capabilities, and material well-being.
 There have been rapid social and economic changes in Chinese society through its open door and reform policy and post-reform developments. This has resulted in not only heterogeneity in regional development, but also growing interest in analyzing well-being and the changes in it (Bian et al. 2020; Chen 2018; Cindy and Huang 1998). Economically, at one time China experienced a period in which agriculture was the main source of livelihood. With gradual industrialization, China entered the post-industrial period and today the tertiary industry is playing the main economic role in the country (Canrong 2001; Connelly et al. 2018; Yu and Sarri 1997). As China’s economic transformation progressed, women’s incomes, identity, and values were also influenced leading to changes in their well-being. Philosophically speaking, gender differences also crept in gradually. According to Fung (1948), the traditional philosophy was far removed from the original Taoism which started around BC 722 according to which nature created females and males for the same reasons so people should follow the principle of nature. The Chinese believed that this would result in a universal phenomenon. Even though the gap between females and males was not large and shifted over time, people still followed the natural principle of living happily (Fung 1949; Harrison 2001). However, the biggest change started in the Song dynasty (starting AC 960), with the ancient Chinese empire expressing an increasing need for political intentions to use the official philosophy of Confucianism. It maintained relations between females and males and believed in man’s superiority with the female’s job being obeying the man. During this time, women’s status deteriorated (Crowell 2005). From the Song dynasty till the 1900s, people followed Confucianism which resulted in women become their husbands’ appendages. Women did not get a chance to be educated and their feet were banded so that they had no way of escaping (Chen and Wen 2019; Feng et al. 2013; Harrison 2001). This was the identity or value of women in society during the ancient time which is still partially followed (Fung 1948; Ji et al. 2017). A direct result of this is that families prefer to have male children rather than female children because they believe that only the male can inherit the family’s culture or wealth as a female is only an appendage to a male from another family in which she marries. However, according to Harrison (2001), around the 1900s women’s education became popular. The revolutionary governor’s goal was unbinding women’s feet for the labor force and educating all people for labor quality and women got the first chance to be educated equally with men (Liu 2017). After World War II, the People’s Republic of China emerged as a political system in 1949 and it encouraged people to give birth and fill the gap in labor shortages caused by the war. It also had a slogan: ‘Woman rising as half of the sky,’ which means women had equal power and they had equal rights to work as men (Aitsi-Selmi et al. 2013; Liu 2017). Without denying women’s rights, government and population experts realized that there was a very large and growing population which was making the country short on resources.
 Hence, the one-child policy was introduced which led to high abortion rates of girls (Srivastava and Cheema 2019; Summerfield 1997). Female children who survived gained higher education (Liu 2017), while the traditional concept of women’s identity still played an important role (Feng et al. 2013; Shui et al. 2020; Yu and Sarri 1997). Recently, women’s average educational levels have become higher than men’s and the returns on education too are higher for women than for men in urban China (Hannum et al. 2013). Education levels influence incomes which are also attached to empowerment and capabilities which change the hierarchy in a family (Bittman et al. 2003). Thus, there is a natural philosophical conflict between Confucianism and women’s identity and increasing empowerment and capabilities. Confucianism asks women to play an obeying role in the family while increased capabilities enables women to take on more responsibilities in their families and in society. The purpose of this research is estimating women’s well-being and comparing it with their male counterparts in China. It estimates the relationship between education and well-being accounting for influential factors like marriage and Confucianism. Inclusion of Confucianism in the analysis can have a significant role in associating the sociocultural and religious context in which well-being is influenced by the level of education. It uses two measures of well-being—self-assessed unidimensional subjective well-being and parametrically estimated multidimensional objective well-being. The aim is investigating how education influences well-being. The empirical part estimates and compares the well-being of 34,054 women and men using the Chinese General Social Surveys in 2012, 2013, and 2015. The multidimensional objective well-being index is estimated using a principal component analysis. The different domains of the index include identity, capability, and material well-being. The findings suggest that education influences well-being positively, even conditional on marital status and Confucianism. The multidimensional well-being index differs from subjective well-being in ranking individuals by different characteristics. Marital status has a deep influence on females but not on males’ socioeconomic conditions. Confucianism has negative effects on women’s well-being but not on males’ well-being.
 The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the relationship between well-being and education. Section 3 describes the data and variables. The method used is presented in Sect. 4. The empirical analysis is discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 gives the conclusion. The final section gives the implications of the results and the limitations of the study.",

Unfortunately, the expected positive income impact of temporary migration on child schooling may be swayed away by dismal returns, increased work responsibilities for the child, lack of parental care (Jingzhong and Lu 2011), and as such. Shimada (2017) investigated parental migration and paid child work simultaneously, showing a detrimental impact of parent migration on child labor. However, this study, like most empirical works, fails to distinguish between temporary and long-term migrations, coping and income-maximizing strategies, and paid and unpaid child work. Parental migration can have a long-term impact on the development of children left behind. As the household structure changes and child responsibilities for households and their farms increase, children become less interested in schooling. Lack of parental supervision also hinders their schooling. Parental migration can transfer the leadership of the family to less educated and less aware elderly people (Ginther and Pollak 2004). Ultimately, the short-term improvement in income can be canceled out by the long-term detrimental effect on child education. Our study concerns strategies taken by hard-to-reach people in Bangladesh in response to a common climate shock such as floods, assuming that these people have rare access to most public and private subsidies along with diversified employment opportunities. Hard-to-reach people in Bangladesh are part of ‘remote geographical locations and slipping population from all sorts of development activities (National Strategy for Water and Sanitation Hard to Reach Areas of Bangladesh, 2011; pp. 4, sec. 4) living in six different geographical categories: Barind tract (the Barind Pleistocene with extreme temperature variations), Wetland (Haors and Beels), Char (sand bars emerging as islands within the river or as attached land to the riverbank), Coastal areas, Hilly areas, and Urban slums spread over 257 Upazilas in 50 districts in Bangladesh. These people stay at the end of the line in receiving the benefits of any development activity. We learned about distressed people in Urirchar, a small island in the Bay of Bengal, only after almost 90% of them had been washed out in a cyclone in 1985. The same is true for 40,000 causalities in Banshkali who were hit by the 1991 Bangladesh Cyclone, the people in Sharankhola who were hit by Sidr (Cyclone) in 2007, or the people of Sunamganj hit by the flash flood in the Kangsha, Jadukata, Sarigowain, and Someshwari Rivers in 2019. Our study concerns two remote villages in Sunamganj. Sunamganj is the largest host of haors, baors, and beels in Bangladesh. However, it also has the lowest population density in the country due to extreme living conditions, single cropping, unpredictable flash floods, siltation, lack of job opportunities, and weak infrastructure, resulting in low access to health, education, and financial facilities. The poverty and the lack of educational facilities multiply the havoc of communication and natural calamities that drive children from schools in this area. The drop-out rate in Sunamganj is alarmingly high (27.8% in Sunamganj compared to the national rate of 19.2%, Directorate of Primary Education, DPE coordinated Annual Primary School Census, APSC, 2016). Many school buildings become damaged or stay water-logged during the monsoon, while approximately 30% of schools become shelter centers during any medium-scale disaster (The Daily Star, 10 August 2019). As a result, people in hard-to-reach areas possess low human and social capital, very few assets other than their homesteads, and scarce means to earn their livelihoods. They live on a single crop and fish. Insignificant social capital portrays weak support for household survival within the community in the wake of a climate shock. Temporary migration to adjacent stone mine areas is the most lucrative alternative for them in slack seasons when they are not fishing. However, seasonal workers in stone mines are not well paid (Joarder et al. 2005). Additionally, commercial fishing and overharvesting have made open fishing less profitable. Unauthorized school absenteeism increases with extreme weather conditions, family shocks, diseases, and man-made troubles that can have lasting impacts on hard-to-reach poor families. Some studies also relate truancy to different family obstacles, such as income deficiencies (Zhang et al. 2007), low parental education (Henry 2007), parental unemployment (Walls 2005), and lack of supervision (Henry 2007). Some highlight students’ frustration (Wilkins 2008; Tobin 2009), addictions (Henry 2007), physical and mental health issues (DeSocio et al. 2007), and barriers to schooling. Henry (2007) showed that most truanting students work part-time. Truant students tend to drop out early, have poor schooling outcomes, have difficulties getting employed, and, at worst, become involved in illegal activities (Ahmad and Miller 2015). Kumar and Saqib (2017) found that more than a quarter of rural children aged 7–14 years in Bangladesh were missing at least one day of school per week. Almost 4.3% of 5- to 14-year-old children in Bangladesh had full-time involvement in the labor market, while 6.8% of children aged 7–14 years were working in addition to school enrollment (Child Labor Survey Bangladesh, CLS, 2013). The easiest work responsibilities for these child laborers include agricultural works such as farming, harvesting and processing crops, raising poultry, grazing cattle, fishing, and drying fish along with domestic work (CLS 2013; Hossain and Rahaman 2011; Chaudhari et al. 2013; Islam et al. 2013). Although there are public policies in Bangladesh to protect migrants’ rights and safety, their children and families left behind are poorly focused on these policies. The Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment Policy (2016) of Bangladesh, the Overseas Employment and Migrants Act (2013), and the Immigration Rules (2002) had no measure or initiative for children left behind. Moreover, the National Child Labor Social Cost of Migration on Children Left Behind Due to Labour Migration 11 Elimination Policy (2010) also missed any actions required to prohibit the labor market involvement of such children. From this perspective, we aim to relate parental temporary migration from families in hard-to-reach areas to child school absenteeism in the wake of a one-time climate shock, which will provide deep insights to economists, policymakers, and academicians. The next section justifies the methods focusing on the theoretical background and sample selection. A conceptual model is derived using a simple qualitative inquisition followed by a formal estimation model and quantitative testing. The findings and conclusion are the last two parts.",1
25,1,Journal of Social and Economic Development,06 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-022-00214-z,"Saving structure, housing speculation, and economic growth in the Iranian economy",June 2023,Yousef Mohammadzaheh,Arash Refah-Kahriz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Macroeconomic theories maintain that saving is a financial resource and could contribute to economic growth. These theories, however, do not pay particular attention to the saving behavior of households as well as the factors formulating their saving behavior. Many of macroeconomic theories (e.g., Solow 1970) argue that saving can enhance investment and economic growth, and therefore, recommend it as an effective strategic financial resource for economic growth. However, the positive function of saving could be challenged if it is directed to unproductive sectors in economy such as speculation in land and housing market. This study investigates the direction of saving to unproductive economic sectors that could be a hindrance to economic growth. In macroeconomics, the resource cycle among households, firms, government, and the world outside is a significant discussion. Households save their income, spend it on purchasing products, or pay it as taxes to the government. In this cycle, saving is leakage and it could be invested in economic activities (Dornbusch et al. 2011). Saving is an amount of money saved by households for various purposes such as life-cycle coverage, intertemporal substitution, inheritance, and a future time of need (Attanasio 1993; Browning and Lusardi 1996; Friedman and Warshawsky 1990). Scholars attribute the saving behavior of households to factors such as macroeconomic uncertainties (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2006; Chamon et al. 2013), their financial intelligence, economic literacy, or perceptions toward economic sectors (Lusardi 2008), and their characteristics or recognition abilities (Ballinger et al. 2011). The sociocultural structure of a community could determine the saving behavior of its households as well. This factor is discussed in detail in this investigation. Regardless of the above factors, saving is leakage in the economy and its re-injection to the economy in the form of investment is an argument in macroeconomics (Mankiw 2010). However, the pressing question is that “to what extent, could a community perform saving behavior?” Sinha and Sinha (2008) divide saving into three categories: (1) household, (2) public, and (3) corporate savings. Research has investigated the effects of these types of saving on economic growth, but it is not obvious whether economic growth contributes to a rise in the saving level and the other way around (Agrawal 2001). However, it is clear that the saving rate is usually high in countries with high economic growth and income levels (Ogaki et al. 1996). In simple words, saving enormously increases economic growth in nations with high income levels (Gavin et al. 1997). In a country, saving behavior largely depends on the economic structure and the function of its economic organizations such as banks and financial institutes. Banking and financial systems could determine the saving behavior of households since they can largely manage and direct the saving level (Athukorala and Sen 2004). Therefore, saving is a pressing argument in the development of theories elaborating on economic growth. Some countries experience a high rate of economic growth, and this could be probably assigned to the reason that these nations enjoy a high proportion of saving in their economies. This suggestion is emphasized by some theories of economic growth including Solow’s (1970) growth theory. However, the following questions are posed here: to what extent, could the constant rise in saving promote economic growth? Is there a favorable level of capital that could demarcate saving amounts in a particular economy? These questions motivate economists to propose the Golden Rule theory. According to this theory, saving is desirable to an extent that it can increase the level of consumption and social welfare (Romer 2012). John Maynard Keynes explained the Great Depression in 1929 from the perspective of the Golden Rule theory. He argued that the continuous flow of saving toward investment is not possible in the long term since the necessary investment for saving absorption could raise the capital level and thus promote production capacity. This capacity can increase production and income levels in the subsequent cycles. However, more increase in income level leads to more increase in the saving rate, which requires further investment. To increase the total income of society, households need to raise saving by a large proportion because a remarkable saving rate is saved in each new level of a higher income. To continuously compensate for the saving leakage, the investment level should be increased more than the income level. Furthermore, the essential facilities for investment are usually limited in every market-based economy, and therefore, it could be challenging to find sufficient capital resources simultaneously during the process of economic growth. Otherwise, the investment level will be lower than the saving amount, and thus the total costs of goods and services will also be lower than the value of their production. Accordingly, companies cannot sell all their products and they need to continuously reduce their production level in the subsequent periods (Hunt 2003). Research has generally investigated the consequences of inadequate or excessive savings and its optimal level, but their structure has received little scholarly attention. In developing nations such as Iran, research has not provided insights on whether saving flow toward speculation could disturb the markets. There is also no evidence to understand whether saving can lower the financial resources of production if it is directed into unproductive investment. Theoretically, saving can thus contribute to high economic growth in subsequent economic cycles, but its structure and direction toward the investment sector need investigation. If the saving structure does not permit saving flow into an investment, then, can we consider saving as a key factor for rapid economic growth? Or will economic growth not be challenged with serious obstacles if saving is directed toward unproductive economic sectors? This study aims to answer the paradox that currently exists in the Iranian economy by examining the flow of savings. The paradox is that the Iranian economy is usually ranked in a low position concerning its economic growth and investment despite its high level of the saving rate. Iranian households considerably spend their time and money on purchasing houses and land to protect the value of their money. This saving behavior could be considered the main factor causing deficiencies in various economic sectors in Iran, which raises this question: does this behavior result in prices leap (which are higher than the total price index) in the Iranian land and housing market? Previous investigations have probed the impact of housing prices on households’ savings (e.g., Disney et al. 2002; Engelhardt 1996). However, to the best knowledge of the researchers, no study has investigated the effect of Iranian households’ savings on housing prices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section “Literature review” reviews the relevant literature. Section “Saving structure in the Iranian economy” describes the saving structure in the Iranian economy. Section “Data and methodology” elaborates on the data and the methodology.

25,1,Journal of Social and Economic Development,13 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40847-022-00210-3,Spatial analysis of the effect of microfinance on poverty and inequality in Ghana,June 2023,Eric Fosu Oteng-Abayie,Kofi Amanor,Anthony Kofi Osei-Fosu,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the past two decades, remarkable growth in the demand for microfinance services has been observed around the globe. Statistics show that between 1997 and 2013, the demand for microfinance services has grown by at least 19%, generating an excess of 3,000 microfinance institutions and 200 million borrowers by 2016 (Buera et al. 2018). According to the Microfinance Barometer report in 2019, a total of 139.9 million borrowers benefited from microfinance worldwide in 2018 alone, representing an annual growth of 11.5% since 2014. Despite the rising microfinance market, the literature suggests an enduring income disparity and poverty (Hisako and Shigeyuki 2009) across the globe. Reducing poverty and inequality has been the central focus of global development efforts, and microfinance has been one of the flagship developmental tools that have been deployed by policymakers to achieve this objective. Sub-Saharan Africa is acknowledged as one of the world’s economic zones with the highest income inequality and poverty (Agyire-Tettey et al. 2018), albeit also one of the regions with a growing microfinance market (Microfinance Barometer 2019). Rogerson and Nel (2016) argue that spatial economic disparities remain fixed rather than disappearing, despite developmental efforts. This has raised serious concerns for policymakers, particularly due to the socio-political problems that can originate from spatial socio-economic imbalances. For instance, a high level of spatial disparity may lead to conflicts over resources, which will likely undermine economic, social, and political developments (Østby et al. 2009), fuel a contraction in long-run aggregate demand, and lead to structural violence, crime, and social injustice (Hseih and Pugh 1993; Roelen, Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux 2016; Featherstone 2016). In the context of Ghana, Cooke et al. (2016) observe an upsurge in income inequality despite rapid economic growth. However, Ghana is the second biggest West African economy after Nigeria. However, the majority of the national wealth is concentrated within the 10% rich population, who consume 32% of the total share of consumption. This is more than the consumption of the bottom 60% of the population. The very poor 10% of Ghanaians, on the other hand, consume 2% of the total household consumption (OXFAM 2019). The poverty trends also suggest a rising poverty rate since 2006 (Cooke et al. 2016). This has induced several concerns among policymakers about the optimal national approach to tackle inequality and poverty in the country. Despite this, one cannot fail to recognize the growing size of the microfinance market in the country (Appietu et al. 2020; Yeboah et al. 2022). For instance, between 2000 and 2013, the total number of microfinance clients in Ghana grew at an annual compound rate of 16 percent, while deposits and loans grew by 21 percent and 25 percent respectively  (GHAMFIN 2014; World Bank 2016). Given the social intermediation mission of microfinance interventions, it is instructive to examine the extent to which trends in microfinance activities contribute to the observed disparity in poverty and income across and within districts in Ghana. To address this spatial poverty and inequality, it is important to understand the factors that account for its occurrence and persistence. Until now, researchers have generally attributed the enduring spatial differences in economic activity, poverty, and regional development to globalization (Ezcurra and Rodriguez-Pose 2013), decentralization (Kyriacou et al. 2015), government quality (Rodriguez-Poze and Ezcurra 2013), and the uneven distribution of population-centred policy interventions (Pallares-Barbera et al. 2012; Rogerson and Nel 2016). However, the influence of microfinance on spatial inequality and poverty has attracted no attention. While several studies have examined the effect of microfinance on inequality and poverty, adopting either a microeconomic or macroeconomic perspective (Bangoura et al. 2016), none of these studies has explored the spatial effect of microfinance delivery on income inequality and poverty. Yet, there are two economic reasons why the spatial analysis of the effect of microfinance on poverty and income inequality is important. First, regional shocks (eg. infrastructural development, conflicts, etc) can affect the application of microfinance products and the intensity of economic activity (Ganle et al. 2015). Second, differences in regional attributes can leverage the effectiveness of microfinance service delivery. Spatial analysis can capture these interactions and provide an accurate account of the effect of microfinance on poverty and inequality, relative to a non-spatial outlook. Ganle et al. (2015) also argued that the environmental context can limit the impact of microfinance delivery. Perhaps, this might explain why the results of extant studies do not converge. For example, Bakhtiari (2006); Hadj Miled and Rejeb (2018); Imai et al. (2012); and Bhuiya et al. (2018) suggest that access to microfinance services reduces poverty and, by extension, income inequality. However, Duvendack et al. (2011), Banerjee et al. (2010), Ganle et al. (2015), and Seven and Coskun (2016) found that there is a positive relationship between microfinance, poverty, and inequality. The mixed empirical findings, plus the fact that these studies employ non-spatial methodologies, make it difficult to tease out any meaningful conclusion about the potential contribution of microfinance to the spatial distribution of income, economic activity, and poverty. This begs for an empirical investigation. The expected findings will be particularly significant to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since tracking and measuring spatial decompositions in socio-economic inequalities and poverty is a useful step in addressing regional inequalities and poverty, a key component of the SDGs (Smith and Rey 2017). Such empirical findings are also necessary to inform the pursuit of an appropriate interventionist spatial policy approach to microfinance delivery. The conclusions gleaned will also benefit policymakers’ understanding of how to ensure spatially optimal microfinance service delivery, improve the quality of life among subpopulations, and minimize spatial socioeconomic disparities.
 There are two transmission mechanisms under which access to microfinance can correlate with spatial differences in socio-economic conditions. First, the development of microfinance services can directly affect the intensity and growth of economic activities, thereby affecting community-level productivity and output. This expresses a homogeneous economic value for all members of the population. The possible outcome is between-region variations in wealth and development. Second, by targeting specific vulnerable groups, that is, the poor, the income level of the poor can be increased. This affects within-region income distribution and poverty levels. (Bangoura, Diaw, Lessoua, and Mbow 2016). In either of these two channels, it is expected that microfinance will have an impact on the spatial distribution of income and poverty. Moreover, microfinance service delivery is undertaken with a spatial strategic outlook based on either a group-targeting model or a location-based model. Thus, its intensity can play a key role in shaping spatial imbalances in economic welfare and living standards. In the light of no existing research on these spatial inter-linkages, plus the policy relevance of such an empirical investigation, we sought to examine the impact of microfinance on spatial consumption poverty and income inequality. In our contribution to the existing literature, the question we try to answer is whether the scope and intensity of microfinance activities influence the spatial differences in socioeconomic development in Ghana. We relied on district-level data extracted from a national representative survey on living conditions in Ghana. The data we used is unique because, like most other developing and transitional economies, a growing sense of rising spatial and regional inequalities in living conditions is being observed in Ghana. Again, since the use of microfinance among households is also context-driven, the nationally representative survey on living standards is a reliable source for tracking the outcomes of microfinance access across communities and localities. It is also intuitive that differences in poverty and inequality levels across space originate from differences across households. Until now, an increasing level of regional imbalance and poverty have been detected in the country, and this coincides with a growing microfinance industry and economy (Annim et al. 2012). Nonetheless, it is not clear the extent to which microfinance contributes to this development. Due to this, the current paper adopts a family of spatial econometric models to examine the effect of microfinance on poverty and income inequality. A key advantage of this approach is that the study can control for both the exogenous and endogenous interactions that might affect poverty, inequality, and microfinance service delivery in Ghana. Our findings reveal that there are significant differences in poverty, income inequality, and microfinance activities between districts in Ghana. We also find that the level of microfinance intensity significantly and negatively contributes to spatial poverty and inequality in Ghana. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the literature review is presented in Sect. 2. We present the details of the study design and empirical strategy in Sect. 3.

Indeed, climate change impacts such as flooding, droughts, soil erosion and pests and diseases have led to drastic reduction in crop yields in Africa (IPCC, 2018; African Union, 2017; Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 2018). These climate change impacts have disproportionately affected smallholder farmers’ food and income security (McDowell and Hess, 2012; Sanchez and Swaminathan, 2005); since smallholder farmers depend almost exclusively on rain-fed agriculture (Adebisi-Adelani and Oyesola, 2014; Asare-Nuamah and Botchway, 2019) and are largely subsistence with low adaptive capacity (Harvey, et al. 2014). Yet, these farmers constitute 80% of the labor force in the agriculture sector (Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, 2018) and food supply (FAO, 2013) in Africa.
 In Ghana, smallholder farmers take major decisions regarding resource use and exercise management control over land area of sizes that are less than 2 acres for arable crops and less than or equal to 5 acres for tree crops (Ghana Statistical Service [GSS], 2020). Farming is often their primary source of revenue, making them vulnerable to price fluctuations and extreme weather events (Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa [AGRA], 2020; United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 2021). Nonetheless, they are crucial in the agriculture sectors contribution to the national economy. In 2019, for example, Ghana’s agriculture sector contributed 19.7% to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounted for over 30% of export earnings and served as a major source of inputs to the manufacturing sector (Embassy of Isreal, 2020). As the second largest employer in 2019, the agriculture sector absorbed 33.5 percent of Ghana’s labor force. Ghana’s agriculture sector is highly informal, mostly composed of smallholder farmers, and rain-fed (Embassy of Isreal, 2020). This makes it vulnerable to climate change impacts. In fact, Ghana’s agro-ecological zones, especially those in the northern regions, are climate change vulnerability hotspots (Riede et al. 2016; Yiran & Stringer, 2016)—with projections of frequent and intense droughts, coupled with rainfall variability and rising temperatures (Cobbinah, 2021; Adu-Prah et al. 2019). Non-climatic stressors such as complex land tenure systems, land degradation, land-use planning and management, limited ready markets and poverty systems aggravate existing climate change vulnerabilities (Antwi-Agyei, et al. 2017; Nyantakyi-Frimpong & Bezner-Kerr, 2017; Stavi, et al. 2021). To confront climate change impacts, many farmers adopt short- and long-term strategies. The former is often referred to as coping strategies while the later referred to as adaptation strategies. Yet, these distinctions are emerging as fluid as perennial coping strategies can be construed as adaptation strategies. Antwi-Agyei & Nyantakyi-Frimpong (2021), for instance, note that some short-term practices classified as coping practices often have long-term ramifications and can also be described as adaptation strategies—making adaptation an advanced form of coping—and the best approach for addressing the threats posed by climate change for developing countries (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2012; Adger et al. 2003). Similarly, Adzawla & Kane (2019) conception of climate adaptation as an anticipatory, reactive and/or proactive measure to reduce climate impacts embody coping strategies; it includes strategies that provide short-term and localized benefits to households and helps to safeguard farmers’ livelihoods and ensure food security (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2012). Yet, adaptation is considered nascent (Epule et al. 2017). In Ghana, studies have focused on the impacts of climate adaptation on food production (Firdaus et al. 2019; Kotir, 2011), gender and climate change (Addaney et al. 2021; Wrigley-Asante et al. 2019; Damptey & Essel, 2012), and general adaptation approaches in the agriculture sector (Tangonyire & Akuriba, 2020; Antwi-Agyei, 2012; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2014). Other studies have shed light on adaptation practices of smallholder farmers (Aniah et al. 2019; Kumasi et al. 2019; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Guodaar et al. 2017); farmers’ perceptions and climate change adaptation (Callo-Concha 2018); and barriers to climate change adaptation (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015). This growing stream of the literature tends to emphasize the specific climatic characteristics of an area, some variations and diversities in agro-ecological zones and the adaptation strategies peculiar to localities and ecological zones (Aniah et al. 2019). Nonetheless, there is limited empirical research that explicitly examines the prioritization of smallholder farmers’ adaptation strategies through participatory ethnographies. Participatory ethnographies are some of the best methodological approaches to use in exploring smallholder farmers lived experiences to climate change impacts and their responses (Nyantakyi-Frimpong & Bezner-Kerr, 2015). Tangonyire and Akuriba (2020) asserts that several studies have only concentrated on the adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers and reported a wide range of adaption options. These studies are however limited in the extent to which smallholder farmers prioritize one specific adaptation strategy over another. It is also unclear how short-term practices of smallholder farmers to tackle climate change impacts can be leveraged to build sustainable adaptive capacities in semiarid savannah agro-ecological zones such as northeastern Ghana. This is because climate change adaptation operates within numerous uncertainties and unknowns (Watson et al. 2016). Berrang-Ford et al. (2015) therefore argues that the complications and uncertainties in vulnerable agro-ecological contexts demand localized case studies on the lived experiences of resource dependent smallholder farmers and communities in responding to climate changes. In other words, a better understanding of smallholder farmer adaptation practices—and for this research their prioritization—is necessary to integrate local experiences in efforts to combat climate change impacts on livelihoods (Cunningham et al. 2021). This paper contributes to narrowing this research gap by offering empirical insights on the lived experiences of smallholder farmers responses to climate change impacts. By employing pairwise ranking as a technique to understand smallholder farmers’ prioritization of climate adaptation strategies, this study also contributes to participatory appraisal methodologies in climate change adaptation research as entry points for knowledge co-production in climate change adaptation planning in vulnerable agro-ecological zones. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. ""Response to climate change: coping and adaptation"" section presents a conceptual understanding of response to climate change in terms of coping and adaptation, while ""Agro-Ecological context of the study area: Talensi district"" section details the agro-ecological context of the study area. ""Research methodology"" section presents the research methodology. The results and discussions are presented in in ""Results and discussions"" section. Finally, ""Conclusions and policy recommendations"" section entails the conclusion and policy recommendations.",
