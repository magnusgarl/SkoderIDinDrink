The experience of the EU expansions to the South and to the East provides compelling evidence for the accession process as an impetus for rapid and far reaching institutional reform in states seeking EU membership. On the economic front, as Berger et al. (2007) note, one of the strongest arguments for an early enlargement of the EU to Central and Eastern Europe was that the accession process would provide an external anchor for macroeconomic policies. In addition, the run-up of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was also associated with major changes to policymaking. In the 1990s, following the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the goal of EMU membership provoked strenuous efforts to meet the strict criteria governing entry. Meeting the inflation and exchange rate criteria required a substantial reduction in inflation rates in many countries, and on the fiscal side the need to comply with the debt and deficit criteria of the Maastricht Treaty led to a concerted and historically exceptional period of fiscal retrenchments across many countries.Footnote 1
 This paper analyses whether the recently completed accession process fostered a similar improvement in fiscal policymaking alongside the political and institutional reforms already mentioned. This “accession period” is defined to be from 1996 to 2004. By 1996, all aspiring members the bulk of reforms concerning privatisation, property rights, banking and other market institutions had been made and all eight countries had lodged applications to become accession candidates. This process concluded on May 1 2004 with the full accession of 8 New Member StatesFootnote 2 (NMS) from central and Eastern Europe. There are no fiscal, monetary or exchange rate criteria for joining the EU. The only economic criteria are a functioning market economy plus commitment to the single market for labour, goods and capital. However, all the NMS are committed to joining the Euro as part of the accquis communitaire. This means that unlike the original Maastricht signatories, the accession phase and the run-up to EMU membership may not be two distinct and very separate epochs. For the NMS these two epochs will overlap to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the speed with which policymakers target membership of the single currency. Thus one might expect so see some of the economic policy gains associated with the run-up to EMU occurring prior to May 1st 2004. Previous theoretical and empirical work suggests various factors which may have influenced fiscal policy in NMS between 1996 and 2004. Empirical work on the first wave of EMU entrants (von Hagen et al. 2004; Hughes Hallett and Lewis 2007) suggest there was a marked improvement in fiscal discipline in the run up to EMU, followed by a loosening after EMU entry was assured. Smaller countries tended to make greater efforts to consolidate than larger countries, which is generally attributed to the fact that smaller countries have less political power. This means that they are easier to exclude from the initial union, and, after joining, are easier to take sanctions against, which makes threatened punishments for fiscal laxity more credible. This was similar to the argument advanced by Berger et al. (2007) who find a significant loosening in the larger central European economies fiscal policy post-1999, once they believed their membership was assured. These authors’ preferred explanation is that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were of greater geopolitical importance, and that having joined NATO, they believed they could not be excluded by the EU; whereas the Baltic states had to maintain discipline, because their lesser geopolitical importance made the threat to exclude them credible. A well developed strand of literature on exchange rate regimes (see for example, Canzoneri et al. 1998) suggests that currency boards or hard pegs are only successful if fiscal policy is sustainable and thus governments are “forced” to run sound fiscal policies.Footnote 3 The argument is that if a currency board works successfully, then the hands of the monetary authorities are tied, and therefore, in the language of Sargent and Wallace (1981), there is “monetary dominance.” Fiscal authorities do not believe they will be bailed out by looser monetary policies, and are hence constrained from running up unsustainable deficit and debt paths. These considerations suggest a natural split between the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and the large central European countries—Large Hapsburgs—(Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland). The Baltic states have are characterised by fixed exchange rate policies, although the institutional arrangements and the currency to which they are fixed has varied across time and between countries.Footnote 4 The Hapsburgs have followed a variety of looser exchange rate regimes. In addition, within-group trading patterns, linkages to the Former Soviet Union as well as country size, suggest a natural division between the Baltics and Large Hapsburgs. Such a distinction is also drawn elsewhere in the literature, see for example Hughes Hallett and Lewis (2007), (Kopits and Székely 2003). A third group of Small Hapsburgs (Slovakia and Slovenia) is also identified—who, like the Baltics are of small size, but who are more similar to the bigger Hapsburgs in economic terms. Accordingly, this geographic classification is used alongside time specific variables as a potential determinant of fiscal policymakers behaviour. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 considers fiscal policy in terms of a Taylor-type rule, where fiscal policy responds to the output gap, adding in additional variables to capture regime effects.

One result was a debate on how to adapt policy in emerging economies and strengthen international financial markets. Contributors to the literature on what came to be called reforming the international financial architecture quickly sorted themselves into two camps.Footnote 1 The first offered proposals for radically reshaping the international system. The second, less ambitiously, emphasized the need for limited policy adaptations, mainly in emerging economies, and for even more limited changes in the structure and governance of international financial markets. In the end it was that second approach that carried the day. The global credit crisis of 2008 places both the assumptions underpinning that earlier exercise and its achievements in a new light. The presumption, reflecting the fact that the 1997–8 crisis hit emerging markets but not the U.S. or Europe, was emerging markets should emulate the advanced countries. They should build securities markets like those in the advanced countries. They should regulate their banks in the manner of the advanced countries. More generally, when determining how to reform domestic monetary and financial arrangements, they should look to the high-income world. The 2008 crisis clearly shattered this presumption. It revealed the inadequacy of transparency in the high-income countries. It laid bare the inadequacy of supervision and regulation, failures in the coordination of macroeconomic and regulatory policies, the pervasiveness of regulatory arbitrage, and incentive problems associated with compensation practices in the financial-services industry. It dissolved any notion that prevailing practice in the high-income countries is an appropriate standard for emerging markets. But it offered little guidance as to what other standard to put in its place. Another product of the crisis was a second round of calls for a new international financial architecture. These came from Gordon Brown, were echoed by Nicolas Sarkozy, and were embraced by George W. Bush. Here, however, calls to action were not accompanied by details. It was not clear whether leaders intended to emulate their predecessors by proposing modest changes to the prevailing architecture or whether they envisaged a more radical approach. A new round of architecture discussions is clearly in the offing. Both to avoid reinventing the wheel and prevent, predictable mistakes it may be helpful, therefore, to understand the dynamics and limitations of the earlier exercise.",9

These so-called Maastricht Criteria (EU, 1992, article 109 j (1)) provided fiscal convergence criteria in terms of inflation, interest rates, debt and deficits for the countries to qualify for entrance into the EMU.Footnote 2 Depending on the amount of effort that countries invest in complying with these entrance criteria there is a certain degree of freedom in choosing the exact point in time at which to enter. In the fastest track e.g. countries would comply immediately and enter the euro area in the second half of 2006. In fact, Slovenia entered as the first new EU member state on the 1st of January 2007, while Malta and (the Greek part of) Cyprus did so on the 1st of January 2008, and Slovakia on the 1st of January 2009.Footnote 3 Bohn (2004) rightly asserts regarding the prospective acceding countries: “However, care must be taken to avoid recession or overheating effects, in case interest and exchange rate impulses reinforce one another (instead of exhibiting trade-off effects). The right timing for joining a monetary union (MU henceforth) is crucial, if policymakers want to make sure that conditions are advantageous for all countries involved.” Moreover, it is very unlikely that a single strategy could be recommended to all acceding countries regarding macroeconomic stabilization on the road to the euro. Arguments in favor of adopting the euro as early as possible include a smaller financial risk due to the elimination of a currency mismatch in the balance sheets of banks and firms, interest rate convergence and overall gains in monetary credibility, while arguments for a slower pace to the euro include the need to remove financial distortions creating moral hazard and therefore raising the country’s default risk, easier relative-price adjustment without the need of costly nominal wage and price adjustments and the need to make fiscal and financial policy sustainable and compatible with a fixed exchange rate before participation in the EMU. The European Economic Advisory Group at CESifo recommends in its 2004 Report on the European Economy (p. 135) that: “Delaying participation in ERM II is a realistic option for countries that are currently unable to sustain hard pegs and have large domestic imbalances. The magnitude of domestic imbalances varies considerably across countries, so that ERM entry may be desirable at different times. Yet in all cases, the policy priority is achieving a sustainable fiscal situation and stabilizing inflation at the correct relative prices, a task that requires both institutional and policy reforms.” Several studies have analyzed the degree to which the accession countries may form an OCA with the current euro area. In terms of trade interdependence and business cycle convergence with the E(M)U, the accession countries reach comparable scores like current member countries (see e.g. Boone and Maurel (1999)). On the other hand, the degree of symmetry of shocks is generally found to be lower (see e.g. Fidrmuc and Korhonen (2001)). The latter finding may be problematic in the sense that the accession countries by acceding to the euro area give up national monetary policy independence and in particular the possibility of exchange rate adjustment vis-à-vis the euro area in case they experience asymmetric shocks. Upon accession, their monetary policy will be set by the ECB. In addition, the accession countries will adopt the fiscal policy cooperation and surveillance procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. During the recent years, monetary policy in the accession countries have displayed a large variation ranging from very strict euro pegging in the form of a currency board in small accession countries such as Estonia to informal euro target zones in larger accession countries like Poland (see European Parliament (1999) for a detailed account). As a consequence of fixed bilateral exchange rates, asymmetric shocks have long been seen as the major problem for the EMU (see Favero et al. (2000)). It is generally argued that this kind of externalities can be coped by structural reforms that have been advocated to improve flexibility on product and labor markets. However, an alternative way resides in the adoption of coordinated policies among EU member countries. This paper is based on the results from an extensive research project on macroeconomic policy coordination in the presence of an MU.Footnote 4 The detailed coverage of research techniques and outcomes can be found in Plasmans et al. (2006) and on the internet.Footnote 5 In this analysis we aim to shed some more light on issues of macroeconomic shocks in the monetary area and the effects of its enlargement. To take into account spillovers, externalities and strategic behaviour of different (self-oriented) players, we construct a multi-country continuous-time model of 5 countries and 4 central banks. Moreover, we solve the resulting differential game for some (the most plausible) coalition structures in order to model effects of various cooperative arrangements between players.Footnote 6 Such arrangements, in pre- and post-accession stages, may have substantial impact on profitability of accession. Finally, we compare the (optimal) losses caused by the same shock in the pre-accession stage and in the post-accession stage. The differences between both stages need to be completely attributed to the accession of the MU by a new member. In this way we can also directly calculate in the model the net benefits of accession for each player. The analysis is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a n-country dynamic macroeconomic model that underlies the analysis in this paper. Section 3 analyzes the policy coordination issues that arise in an MU. In particular, we focus on the institutional setup and cooperative mechanisms in the MU. Section 4 introduces main issues related to the enlargement of the MU. Numerical simulations in Section 5 illustrate the functioning of the model using specific examples. The conclusion summarizes the main insights.",1

A threshold cointegration analysis,October 2009,Tigran Poghosyan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Measuring financial integration between the “new” EU member states and the Eurozone ranks high on the agenda of policymakers and researchers. To begin, both theory and empirical findings suggest that financial integration contributes to a more efficient capital allocation, which, in turn, fosters economic growth (see Levine et al. 2000). Several studies find that financial integration in the “old” EU member countries resulting from the introduction of the euro is beneficial for economic development and growth (see e.g., Guiso et al. 2004). In addition, the extent to which financial markets in the “new” EU member states are integrated with the Eurozone countries is an important factor in the recent debate on the appropriate time to adopt the euro in these countries (see Brada et al. 2005; Kutan and Yigit 2005). Although the benefits from giving up monetary autonomy and adopting a single currency are considered to be proportional to the degree of financial integration already achieved, the financial integration itself can be promoted by the elimination of currency risks following the expansion of the Eurozone. Finally, financial integration has an important implication for international investors and portfolio managers. More integrated financial markets offer greater opportunities for agents to diversify portfolios and share idiosyncratic risks across countries (Baele et al. 2004). However, the more integrated financial markets can also lead to spill-overs of negative systematic shocks originating in the “old” EU countries to the “new” EU member states. Despite the importance of financial integration for monetary convergence and economic development in the “new” EU member states, only few studies provide a quantitative account of the degree and development of financial integration in these countries. Most of the existing studies focus on various aspects of financial integration in the most developed “new” EU member states, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, for which the information on various financial indicators is more readily available, although some recent studies cover more countries and financial markets. A popular approach for studying financial integration is based on the so-called β-convergence and σ-convergence measures borrowed from the economic growth literature (see Baele et al. (2004) for an application of this methodology to “old” EU members and Babetskii et al. (2007) for a recent application to the “new” EU member states). The β-convergence detects catching-up tendencies across countries, while σ-convergence identifies the state of the convergence for a particular period in time. Both measures are based on the law of one price, which disregards the presence of market frictions and transaction costs. Another widely used technique employed in the financial integration literature is based on the co-movement of interest rates across countries. The workhorse methodology in this type of empirical work is cointegration analysis (see MacDonald (2001) and Voronkova (2004) for a recent application of this methodology to “new” EU member states). However, similarly to the previous measures, a simple linear cointegration methodology is too restrictive since it does not take into account the impact of transaction costs and market frictions that restrict the adjustment of interest rates towards long run equilibrium (Balke and Fomby 1997). In addition, a direct application of cointegration methods in the context of “new” EU member countries, most of which evolved through the transformation process from a planned to a market economy during the 1990s, is problematic as during the transformation period relationships are changing (Brada et al. 2005). Given the wide variety of empirical strategies employed for studying financial integration in the “new” EU member states, it is not surprising that the evidence coming from these studies is controversial (a more extensive discussion is provided in the next section). In this paper, we address the issue of financial market integration in the “new” EU member states using the threshold cointegration methodology. This methodology has been developed recently to take the possibility of discontinuous adjustment to the long-run equilibrium due to market frictions into account and thereby overcome some of the disadvantages of the standard cointegration approach (Balke and Fomby 1997; Hansen and Seo 2002). Threshold vector error-correction models (TVECM) have not been integrated into standard software packages thus far, which explains why their application is limited. The only study we are aware of that applies the TVECM methodology for studying financial integration in the “old” EU member countries is Poghosyan and De Haan (2007). To our best knowledge, the present paper is the first attempt to apply the threshold cointegration methodology for studying financial integration in the “new” EU member countries. Our conjecture is that various market frictions, including different types of legal and economic barriers and situations of asymmetric information, result in transaction costs that hamper arbitrage across financial markets in different countries. These market frictions can be subdivided into two broad categories: frictions due to legal and administrative issues, such as differences in tax regimes and regulatory rules, and frictions due to technical issues, such as the absence of harmonized market conventions on security settlement procedures, business days and other operational prerequisites for efficient financial market functioning (Baele et al. 2004). In both cases, domestic and foreign investors are treated unequally, which imposes additional transaction costs for cross-border arbitrage and hampers financial integration. The pre-accession reforms in the “new” EU countries aimed at harmonization of national market conventions should eventually result in a diminishing role of market frictions and in establishing more integrated financial markets (Thimann 2002). In order to test our hypothesis, we evaluate the transaction costs related to the mentioned frictions explicitly from the data. For this reason, we employ threshold cointegration analysis on interest rate data for the “new” EU members and corresponding Eurozone rate. The TVECM model is applied to fixed, seven-year samples, using a moving window approach, enabling us to take into account structural changes that took place in these countries during their economic transformation from a planned to a market-based economic system. For each window, a transaction costs parameter (labeled as “transaction costs band”) is estimated and its significance evaluated. By plotting the transaction costs parameter over time and taking into account its significance, we provide a measure of the financial integration dynamics for each country under research. Our estimation results suggest that financial markets in “new” EU members gradually became more financially integrated with “old” EU members. However, the degree of integration differs across financial segments: money markets appear to be the most integrated ones due to lower transaction costs, while loan markets display the lowest degree of integration. In addition, significant differences exist across financial segments within “new” member states. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

This crisis erupted in America in the summer of 2007 and the shock waves radiated out from there. The crisis was rooted first and foremost in lax regulation and skewed incentives in U.S. financial markets.Footnote 1 But within a few months it had engulfed the entire world. It thus has important implications for high-, medium- and low-income countries alike. In this paper I focus on the lessons for middle-income countries, what are popularly called emerging markets. Given the origins of the crisis a large literature has already developed around the lessons for the advanced countries.Footnote 2 And organizations from the International Monetary Fund to the United Nations and the Overseas Development Institute have focused on the plight of the poor countries.Footnote 3 The implications for middle-income countries have received less attention for reasons that are not entirely obvious. For a time there was the belief that emerging markets might decouple from the advanced countries and consequently that the crisis had no first-order repercussions for them. While decoupling proved to be a mirage, important emerging markets, starting with China, have bounced back smartly from disruptions to their exports and growth. Again this may have created a subconscious tendency to minimize the implications. The lessons for the United States and the other high-income economies are clear. They need to strengthen supervision and regulation and address agency problems in their financial markets. They need to finish repairing their broken financial systems. When growth resumes they will have to address their gaping budget deficits and rising debts. For low-income countries the implications are also clear. They need to continue investing in education, health care and other basic human services and building the physical and organizational infrastructure needed to penetrate foreign markets. There may be no question of the desirability of more help from outside, but they must be prepared to do these things on their own insofar as the more slowly growing advanced countries may now be less forthcoming with aid. But what about emerging markets? More than the fact that the impact on their economies has been relatively muted, there is a lack of clarity about the policy lessons. How, in light of recent events, should emerging markets modify their terms of engagement with global trade and finance? What are the implications for supervision and regulation of their financial systems, given that supervision and regulation in the high-income countries, traditionally regarded as role models in international standard setting, have been revealed as deficient? Should monetary, fiscal and exchange-rate policies be rethought in light of new evidence on what has and has not worked? Now that recent events have given emerging markets more influence over reform of the international financial architecture, for what specific changes should they push? The crisis also reminds us that it is appropriate for pundits from “advanced” countries to show modesty and restraint when sketching lessons for emerging markets. But I won’t let that stop me.",24

The first book containing these terms was the book The Transition to Sustainability. The Politics of Agenda 21 in Europe, edited by Timothy O’Riordan and Heather Voisey, published in 1998. This book was followed by two other books which similar titles: Our Common Journey: A transition toward sustainability by The Board on Sustainable Development of the US National Research Council (NRC 1999) and Sustainable development: The challenge of transition edited by Jurgen Schmandt and C.H. Ward (2000) contained contributions from Frances Cairncross, Herman Daly, Stephen Schneider which came out in 2000. In all three books the term transition is used as a general term, not as a theoretical organizer. In the last 8 years various articles appeared in which the term transition is explored and used in a more theoretical sense. The new literature consisted of historical studies looking back at past transitions using a multilevel perspective (Geels 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007), theoretical deliberations about transitions (Geels 2002, 2004; Berkhout et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005; Geels and Schot 2007; Genus and Cowes 2008), and deliberations about steering societies towards more sustainable systems of provision and associated practices (Rotmans et al. 2001; Grin 2006; Kemp and Loorbach 2006; Kemp et al. 2007a, b; Loorbach 2007; Shove and Walker 2007, 2008; Rotmans and Kemp 2008; Smith and Stirling 2008; Holtz et al. 2008; Foxon et al. 2009). People in this literature are concerned with transformative change (system innovation), drawing on a co-evolutionary perspective, with technology and society mutually shaping each other, instead of one more or less determining the other.Footnote 1 This article will do two things: a) it will describe transition thinking (Section 2) and b) it will describe attempts by the Dutch government to apply transition thinking in the area of energy (Section 3).

While the suitability of individual countries or country groups under OCA criteria was widely explored in the academic and policy literature in the 1990s and again as the new member states approached EU membership,Footnote 2 it plays no formal role in decisions on Eurozone entry. Neither exposure to asymmetric shocks nor the ability of exchange rate movements to address such shocks nor the strength of alternative adjustment mechanisms – factor mobility, price and wage flexibility - capable of substituting for the devaluation option surrendered through Eurozone membership are included in the formal criteria. Notwithstanding the endogeneity of the fulfillment of the criteria to the adoption of a single currency,Footnote 3 the degree to which a potential member state meets OCA criteria retains informational value as the adjustment unfolds over an extended period.Footnote 4 Notably, the commitment against using the devaluation option through Eurozone membership has not triggered sufficient adjustments in wage setting and labor market policies in some member states to prevent the recurrence of the significant cumulative unit labor cost deviations characterizing the pre-membership period, then addressed by periodic devaluations. In light of the – at best – slow adjustment, adding a formal assessment of pre-membership adherence to OCA criteria stands to improve the ability to assess the readiness of future Eurozone applicants to thrive under the single currency.Footnote 5

J. Welfens,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The crisis management of Berlin and Paris is rather confusing and the European Council—not controlled by a parliament or critical discussions—has made many doubtful and inconsistent decisions in 2011. The EU Council of December 8 made doubtful results because the move towards a fiscal union could not be implemented within the revision of the Lisbon Treaty—the UK did not want to participate in this whole project and demanded special derogations in the field of financial market regulation. As the EU partner countries did not want to yield to British pressure, the Euro 17 countries plus nine other countries decided that they would embark upon a separate new treaty on the principles of a fiscal union. However, it is unclear which rules will be relevant for deficit control in the future as there should both be the Lisbon Treaty—with Article 126 and its focus on deficits and debts—and a new treaty on principles of a fiscal union. Another problem concerns the role of the IMF, whose capital basis EU countries want to reinforce while the US is apparently quite reluctant to give additional funds to the IMF. As rating agencies, S&P and Moody’s, have put Euro countries on watch in December 2011, the problem of critically high interest rates will play a critical role within the next few months. The high interest rates for Italy and Spain are largely due to the strange double Greek haircut decision for which Germany’s government has pushed for unclear reasons. While the first haircut of July 21 might be defendable to some extent, the decision to adopt a 50% haircut in October 2011 is extremely doubtful as it suggests not only that the value of government bonds of EU countries could fall very strongly, it also makes clear that the decisions of the European Council cannot be trusted (in the form of the Euro group). Instead of making a clear and well-founded decision—in this case referring to private sector involvement and the Greek haircut—and sticking to it, the heads of the Euro member countries have revised decisions within a few months and the impression was created that the Council’s agenda and decisions were two steps behind instead of providing leadership with at least one step ahead. The Merkel government has emphasized that a strategy of making small steps would be the right way to make progress with respect to solutions of key problems. In Berlin, politicians initially had big plans for a very big rescue umbrella but government had weak analytical foundations right at the beginning in 2010 and would rather follow the advice of rating agencies that would pursue a distinct strategy based on its own thorough analysis. At the end of 2011 it is clear that the rescue umbrella EFSF is too small to accommodate the potential needs of countries such as Italy and Spain. The latter has a debt-GDP ratio which is below that of Germany but the interest rate to be paid for long-term debt is much higher than that of German bonds. Interest rates of 6% forced Ireland and Portugal to go under the EFSF rescue umbrella; the 7% that had to be paid by Italy in late autumn is not sustainable for Italy in the long run and as soon as capital markets anticipate that Italy will be unable to get lower interest rates in the medium- and long term, the country will face default. This is one potential equilibrium towards which the German-Franco crisis management and Greek contagion effects are leading and in the end this could destroy the Euro zone. A second equilibrium solution is the setting of a low interest rate that can be brought about by ECB intervention. The ECB could guarantee all countries with a minimum primary surplus that it would buy at a maximum 5% interest rate any amount of bonds offered by the respective countries. This would stabilize Spain and Italy and the banking systems in the Euro Area; this strategy is adequate since Spain and Italy are not insolvent unless there is an overshooting of interest rates at 7% (or above) and a vicious circle of downgrading certain countries takes place, higher CDS prices and rising interest rates are accepted by indifferent policy makers. To control a potentially strong liquidity expansion, the ECB should create its own ECB euro bonds which would require some backup by Euro countries. The apparent approach of the German government in 2011 was to push Italy and Spain towards desirable reforms through the pressure of market forces and very high interest rates. However, this strategy is very risky in a very nervous market environment. Germany’s government and its Euro partners might soon face a Tsunami in financial markets, whose seed has been planted by certain governments in the monetary union. At the bottom line, it is clear that there are very few viable euro stabilization options and certainly short-term adjustment and crisis management should go along with a clear view on required long-term structural reforms in many EU countries. The Euro Area faces a serious problem following the crisis in Greece where governments have not been encouraged by the double haircut to adopt comprehensive privatization and structural change. Athens stands for policy failure and distinct political risk within the Euro Area, due to the weak supervision of the EU in the past. Hence in order to resume growth in Greece, the EU—not only the Euro Area—should launch a Marshall Plan with conditions attached with respect to broad privatization, the introduction of a flat rate tax and other reforms for Greece. As regards the UK and the US the enormous Quantitative Easing (QE) programs which made the Bank of England and the Fed acquire government bonds of about 20% of GDP and 15% of GDP in 2008–2011, respectively, have brought about three main short term effects, which can be analyzed with a portfolio model and a modified Mundell Fleming model with QE (Welfens 2012; for the first time, a modified Branson model is also combined with the Solow model and debt dynamics): a fall in the interest rate, a depreciation of the currency and a parallel expansionary fiscal policy. Without QE in the UK, the US and Japan the euro would have depreciated considerably in 2010/2011. Moreover, the British economy looks rather weak, as the combination of QE and a 9% deficit-GDP ratio in 2011 could not bring about a strong recovery. While the crisis management of the EU/Euro council has been miserable in 2011, the Euro Area economy looks fairly robust compared to the UK and the US. The deficit-GDP ratio is lower than in the UK and the US in 2011 and the overall debt-GDP ratio is lower than in the US and close to that of the UK—a point which has been emphasized along with considerations referring to the required reforms in the 2011 Brussels Manifesto of Jean Monnet Chairs, which was jointly initiated by Alberto Alemanno (Paris), Sylvester Eijffinger (Tilburg), Cillian Ryan (Birmingham) and myself (Brussels Manifesto, 2011). Finally, adopting QE in the Euro Area should be considered carefully. While starting QE is not difficult, particularly in the form of an expansionary open market operation in which the central bank acquires long run government bonds, the issue of finding an exit option, which does not undermine economic stability, is rather complex. Once the situation in Greece has been stabilized and an intelligent form of creating Euro ECB bonds has been defined—possibly along with a conditional interest rate cap for euro countries achieving a certain primary deficit-GDP surplus—the Euro Area crisis should be overcome provided that national debt brake rules and a fiscal union plus necessary structural reforms are adopted.

J. Welfens,Jens K. Perret,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The EU2010 agenda emphasized the importance of information and communication technology (ICT) and the role of digital networking for improving international competitiveness. In the US the government continues to emphasize the role of ICT for economic growth and publications by the World Bank (World 2012) also highlight the critical role of ICT for economic development (Kelly and Minges 2012; Qiang et al. 2012a, b; Yamamichi 2012; Youngman 2010; Sudan et al. 2010; Singh and Raja 2010); this includes digital network expansion projects in Africa and Latin America financed by the World Bank. The adoption of modern ICT in the economy is not possible without some adaptation and learning on the side of firms as well as individuals and it raises the important question of how ICT can be integrated in a basic growth model. A specific trait of the ICT sector is the continuous fall of ICT prices in most OECD countries and indeed worldwide. The implications of this specific trait of ICT are, however, not well understood. For example the fall of ICT investment expenditures relative to the nominal gross domestic product—a phenomenon observed in several OECD countries since about 2005—has been interpreted as indicating a declining role of ICT for economic growth. As we will show real ICT investment relative to real GDP indicates a different development: this ratio continues to increase and it is indeed this ratio which matters for growth in general and for assessing the economic relevance of ICT. It is unclear to what extent the ICT investment and ICT output shown in official statistics reflect true value added—the calculation of ICT investment in real terms could be addressed in various ways. A simple approach is to assume that the deflator for ICT investment is the same as for ICT products, a more refined approach used here is to focus on the ICT investment price index which is falling in almost all OECD countries. The implication is that true ICT investment and hence true real GDP is higher than stated in statistics that do not consider adequate price indices for calculating real figures. Moreover, the internet—as an important field of ICT—is a crucial digital element that stands not only for consumption on the side of private households, rather because many individuals use the internet at home and are active as “prosumers” (a hybrid role of consumer and producer) a part of the time budget of private households can even be interpreted as labor input for production. A growing number of old and new services can be availed of via the internet and the creation of certain services relies on the active involvement of digital users—this could even include certain digital entertainment activities in which users of digital networks cooperate in providing joint services to each other. This digital self-service value-added is increasing in many countries of the world. In the following analysis we highlight standard views on the ICT sector and the official scope of the ICT sector (Section 2); and we look at the importance of ICT investments for growth (Section 3). Moreover, we focus on price level developments of ICT and the crucial implications in selected OECD countries (Section 4); the role of ICT in the economy is much underestimated in official statistics— – our estimate is in the range of 2–5 % where this is split up into an underestimation of real ICT investment and the non-coverage of “internet value-added from households” (Section 5). The policy conclusions are presented in Section (6).",12

Tuerck,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The U.S. federal tax code has undergone major changes since the last important attempt at tax simplification in 1986. In the intervening years, Congress has enacted legislation to raise and then lower income tax rates, reduce the tax rates on capital gains and dividends, increase deductions for IRA contributions, create both Individual Retirement Accounts and Medical Savings Accounts, increase the Earned Income Tax Credit for the poor, and make other changes. The result is over 70,000 pages of tax code, rules and rulings that continues to swell by a thousand pages annually (see U.S. Congress. Congressional Budget Office (1992), U.S. Congress. Joint Committee on Taxation (1995), U.S. Government Accountability Office (2005)).Footnote 1 Additionally, the existing tax code continues to discriminate against saving, thus imposing a drag on capital formation, production and economic growth. Taxation remains at the heart of the policy debate. In the Economic Report of the President 2014 (CEA 2014), Barack Obama starts his “opportunity agenda” with the statement that “Number one is more new jobs,” and goes on to say that companies should be encouraged to hire “by closing wasteful tax loopholes and lowering tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home” (p.2). Thoroughgoing tax reform plans have been proposed form time to time. The President’s Commission on Federal Tax Reform made recommendations for widespread changes in its 2005 report.Footnote 2 Hall and Rabushka proposed a flat tax in 1983 – an idea that was subsequently promoted by presidential candidate Steve Forbes (2005), and has been embraced in one form or another by several Eastern European countries. In this paper we analyze the effects of the FairTax proposal, a cousin of the flat tax proposals. The archetype of radical tax reform, the FairTax would repeal all federal direct taxes (on personal and corporate income, capital gains, payroll, estates, and gifts) and replace them with a national retail consumption tax (the “FairTax”) levied at a tax-inclusive rate that, to ensure revenue neutrality, would be set at 23 % (Bachman et al. 2006). An interesting and important feature of the FairTax proposal is that it would include a universal “demogrant” that would provide a payment to every individual large enough to offset any tax payments on spending up to the poverty line. Boortz and Linder (2005), who advocate adoption of the FairTax – Linder filed H.R. 25, the FairTax Act, in 2005 – claim that in the first year after the FairTax becomes law the economy would grow by 10.5 %, exports by 26 %, and capital spending by more than 70 %. Jokisch and Kotlikoff (2005) predict that output would be 10.6 % higher and the capital stock 83.3 % higher in 2100, and the real wage would rise by 13 %, rather than decline by 5 % (as it would under current law) by the end of the century; national income would be 6.25 % higher and the capital stock 41.4 % higher. Arduin et al. (2005) find that the FairTax would increase total economic output by 11.3 % 10 years after implementation: investment would be 41 % higher and employment 9 % higher. Our study is designed to evaluate these extravagant claims, using a custom-built computable dynamic general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy that allows us to arrive at our own estimates of the economic effects of the FairTax proposal. We sketch out the model in section 2, discuss the relevant parameters in section 3, present the results in section 4, and draw the main conclusions in the final section.",4

Also, reusing and recycling of materials is fundamental to achieve a global resource efficiency in consumption and production as aimed by the Sustainable Development Goals. Understanding the role that specific resource flows and prices can have on the wider economy and trade patterns is essential when deciding how to implement policies to achieve such goals. The resource nexus concept considers broad categories of energy, land, water, biomass and food, and materials. Resource efficiency can pertain to the improved use (achieving the same output with less inputs) of any of these resources in the production of goods and services in a sustainable manner. The circular economy concept often goes hand in hand with resource efficiency, and refers to an economy in which waste and pollution are reduced to zero or negligible levels through increased recycling and better management. It requires movement away from the make, use, dispose incumbent cycle of production towards a method of production which achieves maximum value from resources for as long as possible. Therefore a circular economy should improve resource productivity as well as reduce waste and pollution and tackle scarcity price volatility issues. Altogether this is expected to have positive impacts on competitiveness and economic performance, yet all such impacts need to be assessed preferably at an international scale. Resources use interlinkages and interdependencies are complex issues which require understanding across countries, sectors and resources with scarcity, volatility and politics being important issues (Chatham House 2012). Material and mineral use in economic activity is an area which is often studied within a partial equilibrium framework or from the perspective of a specific economic sector or industry e.g. iron and steel. However, there is often knock-on and indirect effects of changes in materials through prices and policies as well as technology change, and the full extent of these effects can only be captured through multi-sectoral modelling representing the whole economic system. Therefore the development of economy-wide or integrated modelling frameworks with a focus on materials is important. Recently materials and minerals have been seen through the concepts of resource efficiency and the circular economy (CE and BioIS 2015; Meyer et al. 2015; Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey Center for Business and Environment 2015). In this paper we outline the motivation for, and give details of, the development of a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model which will enable global analysis of changes in materials throughout the supply chain and allow us to properly consider the resource efficiency and circular economy impacts of different policy, political and technology futures. In particular we describe the development of modelling capability which can focus in greater detail on the areas of resource extraction, industrial processes and material recycling, all of which are essential aspects of understanding how to improve the circular economy. The global CGE model – ENGAGE-materials - will allow us to consider the economic and sectoral effects of policies and shocks which affect materials and resources, and a global analysis is a requirement in order to identify any leakage of resource use as well as understanding trade patterns and economic interdependencies. In the first instance we focus on the inclusion of steel into the model. We consider steel – including its supply chain along iron ore, steel applications and re-use of scrap steel - as relevant because (i) steel production, consumption and trade matter for a macro-economic perspective and (ii) steel is seen as environmentally intensive, yet is also allows for almost infinite recycling and thus offers a perspective to innovate. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to include steel in such perspective into a global CGE model. However, future work will extend the process to include other metals and potentially non-metallic minerals in a similar manner. This paper details the novel contribution of our model development and efforts which will allow for a greater understanding of the role that global material flows from specific industries, such as steel, can have on major economies and international trade as well as their role in achieving resource efficiency and circular goals. Section 2 provides a literature and model review of macro-economic analyses focussed on resource efficiency and the circular economy as well as more specific iron and steel modelling. Section 3 details all the elements of the ENGAGE-materials model development including data sources, regional and sectoral coverage, steel sector disaggregation and main characteristics of the model production structure. Section 4 then provides results from an example circular economy policy scenario. Section 5 concludes with an overall summary and perspectives on future applications and research questions related to international economics, economic policy and sustainable resources.",35

This paper concentrates on the SDGs related to the environment. Environment-related goals such as water quality, climate and living on land (SDG No. 13 to 15) are highly related to providing necessary access to energy and safe drinking water (SDG No. 7 and 8), which in itself is a key to improving the health situation (SDG No. 3). All this is tied to the future of cities and infrastructures (SDG No. 9 and 11), with consumptions patterns interacting with production (SDG No. 12). Most clearly, the markets for green technologies will also provide opportunities to create new jobs (SDG No. 8). Indeed, the projections in this field show a substantial increase in the past, which is projected to continue. And all this is tied to development perspectives of the North and South, with regard to reducing inequalities within and between generations (SDG No. 10). The policy debate has put high hopes into technology transfer from North to South, especially with regard to low carbon technologies. Indeed a lot of negotiations around the Paris agreement dealt with questions about how to finance such a transfer. At the same time, economic and inclusive development requires that countries of the South increasingly develop their own capabilities. Innovation scholars have emphasized that development of technologies co-evolves with their socio-economic environment, and have pointed out the importance of building systems which enhance innovations, competence building and learning. However, what is the stage of development of building such systems for environmental innovations? Will enough innovations be generated to reach the green SDGs? And where will they be generated - are the innovations more likely to come from the North as in the past, or will we see a new pattern of innovation generation with an increased or perhaps leading role of the South? This paper aims to look at existing empirical evidence. In section 2, we introduce the methodological background for our empirical study, which is based on various innovation indicators. In section 3, we look at the positioning of countries with regard to general innovation capabilities. This requires national comparisons of the capabilities of the countries. In section 4, we look at technology specific capabilities for green innovations. We analyze the innovation dynamics on the one hand, but also the positioning of countries on the other. In section 5, we turn towards the issue whether the innovations are dominated by one paradigm which puts emphasis on implementing cutting edge knowledge, or if there is also an indication that regionally segmented markets for green technologies are emerging. Finally, the discussion and conclusions of the analysis will be presented in section 6.",40

The authors show that that currencies of countries with persistent current account surpluses and high foreign-currency denominated assets, such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, are under persistent appreciation pressure, particularly when the centres of the world monetary system follow expansionary monetary policies. This limits the choice of exchange rate regime. Given flexible exchange rates, a negative risk premium on the domestic interest rate can emerge. Their empirical estimations, however, provide mixed evidence for a negative impact of net foreign asset positions and exchange rate uncertainty on interest rates of international creditor countries at the periphery of the world monetary system. Valentyna Ozimkovska studies the relationship between real financial market exchange rate volatility (RFER) and US cross-border equity flows. She finds strong evidence that causality goes from real financial market exchange rate volatility to equity flows. In particular, real financial market exchange rate volatility negatively influences purchases of foreign equity. This finding is in line with the portfolio optimization theory. The impact of real financial market exchange rate volatility on sales of foreign equity also turns out to be negative. This result is consistent with the behavioral finance approach, which suggests that investors are reluctant to realize losses of their portfolios and therefore investors decrease sales of assets when the riskiness of these assets increases. The impact of the real financial market exchange rate on net purchases of foreign equity is positive. It follows from these results that sales of foreign equity decrease more strongly than purchases of foreign equity when the riskiness of foreign assets increases. In his contribution Joseph P. Joyce investigates the role of external balance sheets as countercyclical buffers. The external balance sheets of many emerging market countries are distinguished by their holdings of assets primarily in the form of foreign debt and foreign exchange reserves, while their liabilities are predominantly equity, either foreign direct investment or portfolio equity. Taking this as a starting point, the paper investigates the claim that this composition served as a buffer for the emerging markets during the global financial crisis of 2008–09. The author uses data from a sample of 67 emerging market and advanced economies, and several indicators of the crisis are utilized: GDP growth rates in 2008–09, the occurrence of bank crises and the use of IMF credit. The empirical results show that those countries that issued FDI liabilities had higher growth rates, fewer bank crises and were less likely to borrow from the IMF. Countries with debt liabilities, on the other hand, had more bank crises and were more likely to use IMF credit. Joyce concludes that the “long debt, short equity” (hold debt assets, issue equity liabilities) strategy of emerging markets did mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis. In the next contribution, Ansgar Belke and Christian Fahrholz dwell on emerging and small open economies, unconventional monetary policy and exchange rates. Since the outset of the Great Recession, in 2007, central banks of major-currency economies have adopted non-standard monetary policies. The authors examine whether and to what extent these measures pose a challenge to central banking in emerging and small open economies. In particular, they assess how global liquidity spillovers caused by major central banks affect the economic dynamics of emerging and small open economies. In this respect, economies which are close to, or even at, the periphery of major-currency economies are particularly prone to “unbalanced” real exchange rate dynamics. In the short run, corresponding level and volatility effects in key relative prices may endanger financial stability in the recipient country. The long-term effects include a metamorphosis of the anchoring of private-sector inflation expectations into a perilous tightrope act in central banking of these economies. Stephanos Papadamou, Eleftherios Spyromitros and Nikolaos A. Kyriazis consider the effects of Quantitative Easing (QE) on commercial bank liability and government yields in the United Kingdom. During the recent financial crisis, the Bank of England has taken quantitative easing measures by buying public as well as private assets in order to strengthen the economy via liquidity injections. This paper investigates the dynamic relationship between unconventional policy measures reflected in central bank’s assets, and government versus commercial bank liability curves in a non-linear framework. By adopting a threshold cointegration methodology the authors provide evidence against linearity in gilt and commercial banks’ yield responses to asset purchase facility (APF) activity with policy rate being near the zero lower bound (ZLB). By estimating a momentum-TART model, evidence for a uni-directional long run causality from the Bank of England’s assets to both curves is present.",

Firstly, volatile exchange rates induced more uncertainty. Secondly, countries could lift capital restrictions because they introduced the floating exchange rate regime. As a result, since the 1970s, the growth of capital flows has exceeded the growth of GDP. In particular, gross cross-border transactions in bonds and equities for the United States (US) were equivalent to 4% of GDP in 1975. In the early 1990s, this share increased to 100% of GDP and had grown to 245% of GDP by 2000 (Hau and Rey 2006). Despite the fact that risk is one of the main factors which influences investments, the relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and portfolio flows has not been broadly investigated. The aim of this paper is to shed more light on this question. Studying the impact of exchange rate uncertainty on portfolio flows is of great importance because international portfolio flows can have positive as well as negative impacts on financial sectors and real economies. Cross-border portfolio flows foster efficient allocation of resources by channeling capital to more productive companies. They connect the capital markets of different countries and make international risk sharing possible. However, rapid capital movements can induce substantial economic costs. For example, capital surges cause real estate booms, banking crises, debt defaults, inflation and currency crises. Sudden capital stops are correlated with currency depreciations, slower economic growth and higher interest rates (Forbes and Warnock 2012). From the investors’ perspective, it is useful to understand what influences portfolio flows since movements of capital affect returns of investors’ portfolios. From the policy makers’ perspective, it is vital to understand movements of portfolio flows in order to reduce the vulnerability of financial systems and to mitigate negative outcomes of financial crises. The contribution of this research to the literature is threefold. First, we study the relationship between volatility of Real Financial Market Exchange Rates (RFER) and portfolio flows. Recent research finds long-run relationships between RFER and capital flows (Ghosh and Reitz 2013; Gelman et al. 2015). However, the impact of RFER volatility on capital flows has not yet been studied. Second, we analyze disaggregated portfolio flows, which enable us to better understand investors’ behavior. Finally, in contrast to Caporale et al. (2015), our analysis includes not only industrialized countries, but also emerging markets in which the US has the highest share of portfolio investments. We are thus able to compare investors’ decisions related to portfolio allocations of equities of developed countries and emerging markets. The focus of the paper is on monthly bilateral cross-border portfolio flows between the US and its main investment partners over the period from 01M2000 to 07M2014. The data which stem from the Treasury International Capital System (TIC) provide disaggregated equity flows. These data enable us to analyze how RFER uncertainty influences investors’ decisions concerning purchases and sales of foreign equity. We control in our analysis for returns, interest rates, global volatility and industrial production, as these factors also influence equity flows. Our results show strong evidence that RFER volatility Granger causes cross-border purchases and sales of equities for the industrialized countries and emerging markets. According to the results, the impact of RFER volatility on purchases of foreign equity is negative, which is consistent with the portfolio optimization theory. We also find a negative relationship between RFER volatility and sales of foreign equity. This finding contradicts the portfolio optimization theory, but can be explained by the theory of behavioral finance, which suggests that investors are inclined not to sell more risky assets in their portfolios in order to not realize losses. Furthermore, we find that when sales of foreign assets decrease more than purchases of foreign assets as a response to higher RFER volatility, the impact of RFER volatility on net purchases is positive. The impact of other factors on equity flows is consistent with our results related to RFER volatility as well as with other studies. An important finding is that equity flows seem to react more strongly to RFER volatility than to the Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely used in research as a proxy for global volatility of financial markets. Therefore, further research may also incorporate RFER volatility as an estimate of uncertainty of foreign financial markets for domestic investors. Another important implication of this research is that RFER volatility can be used by policy markers as a warning signal for large capital movements which could harm financial and economic stability. That is why the role of RFER volatility as a warning signal for possible future instability of financial systems requires further study. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents current literature on exchange rate volatility and capital flows. Section 3 outlines the theoretical background for the empirical research. Section 4 and Section 5 describe the data and the empirical results. The last section concludes the paper.",4

Joyce,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007–09 was truly an international phenomenon, some countries were more severely affected than others. The decline was steepest in the high-income countries, where GDP contracted in 2009 by 3.5%. The emerging market and developing economies also recorded declines in growth rates, but the differences between their rates and those of the advanced economies rose during the crisis (see Fig. 1). The relatively stronger performance of the emerging markets and developing economies has been attributed to several factors, including improved macroeconomic policies, stronger external positions before the crisis, more regulated financial sectors and a rapid response by the IMF.Footnote 1 In this paper we investigate whether the composition of the external balance sheets of emerging market nations also mitigated the effects of the global downturn on their economies. GDP Growth Rates, 2006–2012 After the financial crises that occurred in emerging markets during the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of these nations altered the configurations of their external balance sheets. Countries that once had obtained external funds primarily through debt in the form of bonds or bank loans turned to equity, either foreign direct investment (FDI) or portfolio equity, for sources of finance. As a result, their equity liabilities grew steadily, both in terms of magnitude and relative to their debt liabilities. Their assets, on the other hand, largely consisted of the foreign exchange reserves of their central banks, held in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds, and other debt holdings. This profile is known as “long debt, short equity,” and differs from the “long equity, short debt” composition of most advanced economies that hold equity and issue debt. Lane (2013) has claimed that the structure of the emerging markets’ external balance sheets served as a buffer against the GFC, while the contrasting profile of many advanced economies’ assets and liabilities heightened their vulnerability. Similarly, Gourinchas et al. (2010) have maintained that the U.S. provided “insurance” to other countries against the effect of the crisis through its holdings of their equities. The fall in equity valuations combined with depreciations against the dollar lowered the value of the liabilities of the emerging market nations while the value of their foreign-currency denominated assets increased, thus raising their net international investment positions (NIIP). The advanced economies that were net holders of equity, on the other hand, suffered deteriorations in their external positions. They were also subject to financial volatility, which was much less of a threat for the emerging markets that had issued FDI. This paper tests whether the composition of external assets and liabilities affected the impact of the GFC on emerging markets and advanced economies. We specifically look at the net holdings and gross stocks of equity and debt assets and liabilities. We investigate their effect on GDP growth rates during the crisis, the incidence of bank crises and participation in IMF programs. While other papers have explored the causes and extent of the GFC (see literature review below), ours concentrates on how the holdings and issuance of equity and debt affected the response of countries to the GFC. To preview our results, we find that countries with FDI liabilities recorded smaller declines in GDP growth, experienced fewer bank crises and were less likely to enter IMF programs. Holdings of FDI assets were associated with lower growth rates. Portfolio assets and liabilities had similar impacts but their coefficients are less significant. External debt liabilities, on the other hand, were associated with a greater incidence of bank crises and more use of IMF credit. Our results, therefore, demonstrate that the “long debt, short equity” strategy of many emerging markets did act as a countercyclical stabilizer to mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis. FDI liabilities in particular served as a risk-sharing mechanism. The next section examines the impact of balance sheet positions on the transmission of external shocks. The following section presents a selective review of the relevant literature. Section 4 describes the empirical model and data. Section 5 contains our main results for the investigation of a linkage between the severity of the crisis and the composition of the external balance sheet. In section 6 we examine the robustness of our results. The last section offers our conclusions and proposes extensions of the research.",3

Related non-standard monetary policies most prominently consist of unconventional balance-sheet operations - i.e., unprecedented extensions of the monetary base - as a consequence of purchasing financial assets that have usually not been acquired by these central banks via open-market operations in the past. In addition to such large-scale financial asset purchases, very low or even negative nominal interest rates, long-term refinancing facilities for commercial banks as well as forward guidance in central bank communication add to such a lax monetary policy stance. Such non-standard monetary policies are supposed to boost economic activity by encouraging the provision of financing, making it prima facie easier for the private business sector to borrow and invest. By creating liquidity, central banks intend to ward off deflationary economic processes which, for example, have derailed Japanese economic recovery for the last twenty-five years and thus to avert protracted periods of economic slack across major-currency economies. However, possible repercussions from these measures on macroeconomic stability in emerging and small open economies are either not factored in the monetary policy stance or these costs are not seen to outweigh the benefits (Belke et al. 2017a; Belke and Verheyen 2014; Horvath 2017). A mirror discussion has just started assessing the risks of exit from unconventional monetary policies in terms of spillovers to emerging markets (IMF, 2013, Belke 2013). Macroeconomic stability implies both financial stability in the short run and price level stability in the long run, thus preparing an economy for sustained growth. In this respect, a vast academic debate is ongoing regarding the probable adverse effects of such expansionary monetary policies, which are designed to steer financial stability in the short run, but which may impact price level stability in major-currency economies in the long run. In contrast to this debate, however, researchers have paid scant attention to the possible repercussions from such a monetary policy stance within major-currency economies on macroeconomic stability within emerging and small open economies. To the authors’ knowledge, there is nearly no other study that systematically surveys opportunities and, most notably, risks to emerging and small open economies stemming from financial woes prompted by central banks within major-currency economies since the 2007 Great Recession. Our paper tries to fill this niche. Firstly, we will focus on the questions as to why and how global liquidity spillovers impact emerging and small open economies. Secondly, we will assess to what extent non-standard monetary policies of central banks within major-currency economies have affected internal and external real exchange rates of emerging and small open economies during the period from 2002 to 2013. Thirdly, our entire analysis will be embedded in a broader discussion of the possible repercussions from these global liquidity spillovers on central banks’ capability to safeguard macroeconomic stability within emerging and small open economies. For this purpose, we will divide the sample of emerging and small open economies into three categories. The respective economies of each sub-group are characterized by being distant from, close to, or at the periphery of major-currency economies. All these economies may be distressed by externalities stemming from non-standard monetary policy measures of central banks within major-currency economies, while the subsequent real exchange rate changes may differ markedly across sub-groups of emerging and small open economies. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the nature of cross-border financial flows and their transmission from major-currency economies toward emerging and small open economies. Section 3 describes theoretical arguments underpinning the passing on of global liquidity spillovers to emerging and small open economies. In that respect, we focus on real-economic dynamics with an eye on the occurrence of macroeconomic imbalances and (excessive) macroeconomic fluctuations. Such risks to macroeconomic stability reflect unsustainable real exchange rate dynamics which can be traced back to global liquidity spillovers prompted by major central banks. Section 4 then motivates our choice of the sample period and our design of specific sub-groups of economies. Employing annual data, available empirical estimates of the real exchange rate dynamics within emerging and small open economies indicate that particularly economies that are close to or even at the periphery of major-currency economies are considerably impacted by those financial woes. Section 5 finally derives some policy implications for central banking of emerging and small open economies. We argue that emerging and small open economies that are not distant from major-currency economies do neither have command over conventional policy measures to counteract unintended real exchange rate dynamics nor any scope for encouraging major-currency economies to internalize the possible adverse effects of their central banks’ non-standard monetary policies. Hence, emerging and small open economies are rather forced to seek their own way in central banking with regard to safeguarding macroeconomic stability.",8

Kyriazis,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"There has been an increasing volume of theoretical and empirical academic literature since the financial crisis triggered unconventional monetary policies (for a survey see Joyce et al. 2012a, b). There is currently a necessity of central banks to cope with the risk of liquidity shortage. This brings forth the issue of detecting the type of relationship between the amount of total assets owned by the central bank, and the yields of government and commercial banks’ liabilities. Such deepening into the interplay among monetary authorities, the government and the financial sector into a non-linear framework may also conduce to the comprehension of the rapidly evolving macroeconomic outlook. As Goodhart and Ashworth (2012) support, when the Bank of England (BoE) purchases gilts, their yields fall, thereby reducing term premium and yields on long-maturity risky assets. This increases wealth and consequently has a positive effect on domestic demand. Lower gilt yields also result in a reaction on the cost of accessing credit in financial markets, which in its turn causes a fall in credit risk premia, giving this way an additional boost to domestic demand. However, in the medium term expansionary monetary policies may lead banks to take extra leverage and risk (Borio and Zhu 2012; Lambert and Ueda 2014). In a low interest rate environment, banks may not declare non-performing loans and register significant income losses and therefore continue to roll over loans to non-viable firms. Moreover, the situation may be aggravated if relaxation of the collateral rules occurs on almost all banks despite the strength of their balance sheets. Even if the traditional channel of monetary policy relates central banks’ policy rates to interbank rates, in an unconventional policy framework there is an important hidden relationship between the magnitude of central bank assets and commercial bank liability curve built by interbank instruments (Brooke et al. 2000). Government bonds that are usually used as collaterals by banks may affect interbank rates expectations. A notable multitude of empirical studies, using a variety of methodologies, have considered the effects of central bank asset purchases on gilt yields, attempting to enlighten as regards the dynamics of this evolving nexus (see among others Belke 2013). As the majority of research has expressed, the objective of buying assets is to provoke a broad monetary expansion with stimulating impact on the overall economy. The effect of these monetary injections passes through the channel of bond yields. However, this effect tends to be lower due to higher bond prices prevailing, as most of the empirical literature has indicated (inter alia: Joyce et al. 2011a, b), Christensen and Rudebusch 2012; Breedon et al. 2012; Kapetanios et al. 2012). Moreover, Joyce et al. (2012a, b) support that quantitative easing works through the portfolio substitution channel, affecting thus asset prices and investment decisions. While international transmissions among yields during the quantitative easing period are defined by Belke et al. (2016). Overall, it is clear that quantitative easing aims to lower gilt and bond yields and this is what most research has focused on proving until now. However, the greatest volume of the up to now literature uses linear techniques of estimation, without taking into consideration the necessity of adopting a non-linear framework. Non-linearities should highly probably be present due to the non-linear relationship between the intrinsic value of a bond and its yield to maturity, and the unconventional character of policy with possible side-effects on affecting financial variables. Analyzing the persistence of QE effects on the time-series behavior of yields over the full period of BoE’s enlargement through asset purchases is not straightforward. Divergences from linearity are a particularly important factor, and really have to be controlled for. QE impact on yields is likely to present a tendency to deviate from some threshold value. Consequently, the estimation of this threshold (Heaviside Indicator), the measurement of the deviation as well as the persistence and statistical significance of the latter, may conceal a great deal of information about yield reactions, not taken into consideration until now. Our work fills this gap by applying the framework of non-linear cointegration, introduced by Balke and Fomby (1997), in order to combine non-linear regression characteristics with cointegration. Pioneers like Enders and Granger (1998) and Enders and Siklos (2001) have begun to adopt estimation methods that allow for adjustment towards long-run equilibrium in a non-linear manner.Footnote 1
 The current study provides an advance over the existing literature in two spectrums. First, we highlight the hidden relationship between Total Assets of BoE and commercial bank liability yields with 5-year and 10-year maturities in an effort to isolate the effects of QE on reducing liquidity shortages in the UK economy. Second, we examine the feedback dynamics of QE procedures by testing for dual causality between asset purchases by the Bank and yields. What we reveal based on our results is mainly a uni-directional causality between Total Assets and yields. Non-linearity is a key finding consistent across both yield cases. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we review the related literature. Furthermore, a description of the data appears in Section 3. In Section 4, there is a presentation of the methodology employed and the empirical results extracted. Finally, section 5 draws the conclusions of the study.",14

This literature presents mixed results, due to major identification issues.Footnote 1 Chinese monetary policy seems unconventional given Western standards and it is not clear what are all the factors affecting the money supply. In particular, while Chinese monetary policy is extensively conducted by restrictions and loan quotas on the official banking sector, there is also a sizable non-regulated shadow banking sector that could in principle reinforce or weaken the monetary policy decisions. In turn, monetary policy decisions could in principle take into account the dynamics of the non-regulated sector and respond to it. The economics literature has pointed to various channels through which monetary policy can impact the real economy, but in the Chinese context there are various open questions. While increases in bank reserve requirements appears to reduce economic activity and inflation, it is not clear whether changes in Chinese interest rates also have a substantial impact on economic activity and inflation. Moreover, it is not clear whether other measures of changes in credit conditions, such as shocks to M2 or lending levels/quotas, have an impact once bank reserves and interest rates are taken into account. Two recent research papers on the topic reach different conclusions and exemplify the ongoing debate. Fernald et al. (2014) claim that the monetary policy transmission channels in China have moved closer to those of Western market economies and become more effective. Conversely, Hou and Wang (2013) test the effect of reserve requirements on the lending channel and find that as the degree of market-based banking increases, China’s monetary policy transmission through the bank lending channel weakens. In both articles bank lending is increasingly independent from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), but it is still an open question whether this support, weakens or amplifies the effects of monetary policy. To address these questions it is important to notice that the bank lending channel in China is not standard because of the growing size of the largely unregulated shadow banking sector. Our paper focuses on the Shadow Banking sector in China partly because of the potentially negative effects that it could have on the national and even global financial stability and to add to the growing research on the topic in recent years. Most of the recent research on Chinese shadow banking has focused on its institutional features and implications for financial stability, without making an explicit connection between the Chinese shadow banking and monetary policy. Our paper aims to fill this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the role of the shadow banking system in the implementation of Chinese monetary policy. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the recent research on the Chinese shadow banking system from an institutional perspective and aims to describe its essential features, Section 3 outlines the Chinese shadow banking system. Section 4 presents our empirical analysis and Section 5 concludes.",9

The Chinese real estate market has experienced rapid price rises particularly during the period end 2000 to end 2015 when the national house price index rose by 332%; with house price rises being driven by the strong growth and rapid urbanization of the Chinese economy, as well as lack of alternative investment opportunities. According to Bordo and Jeanne (2002) property booms and busts have been a fairly frequent occurrence in the global economy topic as compared to stock market booms and busts. The issue of the possibility of a real estate bubble in China is an issue of increasing concern given the rapid price rises of recent years, for example, Zhang and Sun (2006) highlights the risks to Chinese banks of real estate credit exposure, the possible impact on local government finances and the dangers to foreign capital flows of large house price fluctuations. There are many ways in which to measure the existence of property bubbles, including using price to average income, price to rent and rental yield compared to the cost of mortgages. In this paper, we take a less direct approach and we regard the market value of a property as a state output variable changing over time; we similarly regard the economic factors determining the fundamental real estate price as changing inputs. A key advantage of using a state space model is that it is able to process nonstationary time series while allowing for the addition of variables that cannot be observed. The variables that cannot be observed are referred to as state variables. A linear state space model is typically composed of two equations, a state equation and a signal equation. The state equation can be used to represent the relation between observable and unobservable variables, while the signal equation describes the trends of unobservable variables. In our case, the extent of overvaluations is an unobservable variable and we therefore use the state space model to avoid the issue of inappropriate model specification in order to predict the extent of the deviation between market prices and fundamentals in the Chinese real estate sector. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review some of the previous literature on bubbles in the real estate market. Section 3 provides an outline of the state space model used in our analysis. Section 4 outlines the state space model that we employ for our empirical analysis. Section 5 estimates demand and supply equations in order to calculate the unobservable fundamentals real estate prices and estimates the deviation of market prices from the fundamental. Section 6 attempts to link the deviation of prices to changes in the most important Chinese national policies and section 7 concludes.",7

The three cases were chosen because they are all in Europe and, at least in some respects, may be seen as pre-cursors of the EMU (Loughlin and Ryan 2014). A monetary union is one where there is a single fiat currency with a single monetary authority (a central bank). It also has a single interest and exchange rate, and a single legal entity responsible for issuing that currency across a geographic area. This combination of features required for a true monetary union suggests that many previous monetary unions, including the LMU and SMU were not monetary unions as such, while the AHMU was and the Eurozone is. The SMU, at least before 1901, was similar to the LMU in being largely a common standardization of weights and measures, although after 1901 it came closer to being a monetary union, even though the currencies of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway still existed in distinct forms and there was no common interest rate. The term ‘monetary union’, however, is used in a somewhat looser way in this article to refer to the LMU, SMU, AHMU, and the Eurozone, with the appropriate addition of caveats to indicate the diversity of arrangements grouped under this heading. Special attention is paid, in particular, to the importance of economic and political integration in the success and failure of historical monetary unions, with the goal of shedding light on the fraught question of whether sustained successful monetary union is possible without high levels of economic convergence in the common currency area and indeed fiscal and banking union. The article also discusses the political and institutional aspects and whether some kind of federal set of arrangements is necessary in order to sustain monetary union successfully. Focus on the EMU is not without interest, not least because these earlier failed experiments in monetary union helped to shape the modern EMU and Eurozone (Vanthoor 1996). The article discusses the formation and progression of the EMU both institutionally and politically. Finally, it will draw some lessons from the case studies relevant to the Eurozone Crisis. Although there is a vast historical gulf separating these late-nineteenth-century monetary unions from the present, they provide ‘food for thought’ for policy makers and commentators attempting to think through the complications facing the Eurozone (Donovan et al. 2010 and Deo et al. 2011).",2

The next most popular option was a ‘Soft Brexit’. By February 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May (PM) and the Chancellor Philip Hammond (HM Treasury) seemed to favor remaining in a customs union for goods but not for services (80% of the UK economy and 40% of exports to the EU) and hoped to do a special deal for financial services including ‘mutual recognition’ of regulations for the sector. In July 2018, a modified and more detailed version of the proposal (for a ‘facilitated customs arrangement’), was seemingly accepted (at Chequers, the country House of the Prime Minister) by the ‘Cabinet’ of ministers of the United Kingdom (UK) government. The aspiration for ‘mutual recognition’ (rejected by the EU’s negotiating team led by Michel Barnier and undermined by divisions within The City, was replaced by ‘enhanced, extended or expanded equivalence’ of regulations for the financial sector. However, subsequent to the publication of a ‘White Paper’ proposing legislation to Parliament, there were prominent resignations from the government by ‘Brexiters’ (who seek a ‘hard’, or possibly a ‘no-deal’ Brexit) and pro-Brexiter modifications were made to the proposals to gain Parliamentary approval. These proposals formed the basis of the final round of pre-Brexit (March 2019) and (currently 20 months from March 2019 ‘transition period’) negotiations, even though the separation of goods from services, given the significant interactions between the sectors, did not seem wise. The UK’s ‘Chequers’ proposals are a variant of a ‘customs union’ option and related to the ‘Canada model’ in excluding services; and hence access by financial companies based in the UK the UK to the ‘Single Market’ in financial services through ‘passporting’, and in treating the UK as a ‘third country’. As such, it represents a soft(ish) Brexit. A broader trade deal involving some service sectors and more enhancements to ‘equivalence’ for the financial sector would create a softer Brexit. The degree of hardness or softness relates not just to the trading arrangements, but also to restrictions to free movement of people between the UK and the EU, the size of the UK contribution to the EU budget, and the extent of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in dispute resolution. The UK could attempt to ‘buy’ more access to EU markets by adopting a variant of the ‘Norway model’, which involves membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and making contributions to the EU budget in return for privileged access for financial services etc. Ultimately, the degree of ‘hardness’ depends on the agreed trade-offs between budgetary contributions, immigration restrictions, free trade in goods and/or services and the jurisdiction of the ECJ. The difficulty in reaching an agreement between the EU and UK on these complex matters, about which both sides have ‘red lines’, including the desire by the EU to maintain its four ‘freedoms’ (of movement of capital, citizens, good and services) is compounded by the need to reach a ‘backstop agreement’ to resolve the Irish border problem. The EU is insisting on maintaining a ‘free’ border between Northern Ireland (NI) and Eire, and the UK wants to avoid a border with the EU in the Irish Sea; and not to create a precedent for Scotland to seek enhanced independence within the UK. The government relies for its majority of the votes in Parliament on members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of NI, who want to remain in the UK and for them any border checks between NI and the rest of the UK is a ‘red line’. However, many (‘Republican’, as opposed to ‘Loyalist’) people in NI want to remain as close to the EU and the Republic of Ireland as possible. If his issue cannot be resolved amicably a flare up of the historic ‘troubles’ could result. One possibility might be to agree the general Brexit parameters in Autumn 2018 and then to work on detailed resolution of outstanding issues, including those relating to Ireland, subsequently and before the end of a (possibly extended) transition period. Other options include a failure to reach an agreement (the ‘no deal’ option) or parliamentary rejection of the agreed deal (or ‘no deal’), perhaps leading to a second referendum with a revised question outlining options put to voters. The Brexiters’ opposition to any sort of customs union derives from the concern that it would severely restrict options to develop trade deals not involving the EU. At the time of writing, early November 2018, the negotiations between the EU and the UK had reached an impasse and the PM mooted an extended transition period through to sometime in 2021. This would extend the period of uncertainty and was not well received either by hard ‘Brexiters’, or by some ‘Remainers’; or indeed by business representatives, who expressed frustration with the government. Opinion polls indicated that there had been some shift by the public towards remaining, but there was no clear majority either way. Any extension of the transition period would also involve further UK contributions to the subsequent financial year’s budget of the EU and would thus open up further negotiations and be anathema to the herd Brexiters. The probability of a ‘no deal’ Brexit seemed to have increased substantially, but a soft(ish) Brexit (or even ‘no-Brexit’) was still possible. The outcome of the ‘Brussels’ negotiations is expected to be known and voted upon by Parliament before Christmas 2018. In the meantime, the banks and other financial firms have been setting up offices in various EU cities and moving staff to them, given that ‘passporting’ will be ended, unless there is no-Brexit after all. In the no-deal case, we can expect more staff and functions to be moved because ‘enhanced equivalence’ will be off the table. The banks have anyway been required by their supervisors at the European Central bank and the bank of England to prepare for the no deal eventuality in March 2019. It was reported in the Financial Times (p.17, Weekend 27/28 October 2018) that the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had attributed a £100 m impairment under the new (IFRS9) accounting standard as a forward provision against losses resulting from Brexit and other (world trade related) uncertainties. RBS would also maintain higher capital and liquidity ratios than required by the regulators) as a buffer against Brexit.",3

With the EU aiming to complete the banking union and the capital market union, respectively – with effectively a strong focus on the Eurozone – the role of corporate bonds markets in the Eurozone has increased, while in the UK corporate bonds have traditionally played a large role. From this perspective, the issue as to what extent Brexit will affect the corporate bond markets in the EU28 is all the more important. In our analysis we try to capture and measure the effect of the UK’s decision to leave EU28 (Brexit) on the risk conditions in the United Kingdom (UK) and euro area (EA), i.e. Eurozone, corporate bond markets. As yields are intensely disposed to variations in the overall bond market, they do not represent an appropriate way to capture and analyze risk conditions in the corporate bond market. On account of this, in our study we use the yield spread (sometimes just called the credit spread), i.e. that part of corporate bond yield that is above the yield of risk-free bonds - most prevalently government bonds with an equivalent maturity. The resulting corporate bond yield spreads as an indicator of a risk premium are expected to express the risk conditions exposure of firms in the UK and Eurozone. This issue is of key importance from a corporate finance but also from a policymaker’s perspective because the UK’s leaving of the EU (most probably on March 29th, 2019) will directly affect capital market structure as well as the timing of debt and fund-rising decisions. Hence, our paper is related to the literature which focuses on the short-term effects of Brexit on financial markets. These studies elaborate on the impact of Brexit on stock markets, exchange rates, and interest rates. Davies and Studnicka (2017) analyze the effects of Brexit-related events on stock movements in the UK by using event study methods. They find that the announcement of the referendum’s result led to a sharp decline of the FTSE 350. Also by conducting an event study, Ramiahet al. (2017) find that stock prices of financials were particularly affected by the Brexit referendum. Belke et al. (2016) study the impact of Brexit on policy uncertainty and international financial markets. They find that international stock markets were affected by an increase in the probability of Brexit. Moreover, Belke et al. (2016) find that European stock market indices were affected by an increase in the likelihood of Brexit and that the effects between European countries were similar. By applying long-memory techniques, Caporale, Gil-Alana, and Trani (Caporale et al. 2018) find that the Brexit referendum led to significant changes in the degree of persistence of the FTSE 100 Implied Volatility Index and on the British pound’s implied volatility vis-à-vis the euro and the US dollar, respectively. Many studies also elaborate on the impact of Brexit on exchange rates. For instance, Korus and Celebi (2018) examine the impact of Brexit-related news on the spot exchange rate of the British pound against the euro. By splitting Brexit-related events into ‘good’ Brexit news and ‘bad’ Brexit news, they find that, bad Brexit news is associated with a depreciation of the British pound against the euro whereas good Brexit news appreciates the Pound sterling against the euro. The Bank of England (2016) examines the impact of the Brexit referendum on interest rates in the United Kingdom. It finds no clear impact of referendum-related news on short-term interest rates. Belke et al. (2016) also elaborate on the impact of Brexit on long-term interest rates. Their empirical results suggest that an increase in the Brexit probability decreased 10-year government bond yields in the UK and in risk-free countries, respectively. However, they do find that sovereign CDS for 10-year government bonds increased in the UK due to Brexit. This could suggest that there are no broadly convergent expectations amongst financial market actors which would not be surprising given the fact that Brexit is a historical and unprecedented change in EU integration. A key aspect of our research in this paper is to determine and quantify the impact of Brexit-related events on risk conditions in the UK and EA corporate bond markets, respectively. We focus on the yield spread of corporate bonds, defined as the yield differential of a corporate bond relative to that of a benchmark government bond yield with a similar maturity. We use daily data for the period from January 2013 to March 2018. We consider major determinants of corporate bond yield spreads, which are largely based and affirmed by previous studies in this field. Several findings are of a particular interest. First, we investigate whether the announcement of the Brexit referendum result had an impact on UK and EA credit spreads for bonds with a remaining maturity of 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–7 years, 7–10 years and 10+ years, including all rating groups, respectively. We find that the effect of the referendum outcome on corporate bond markets is stronger in the UK market than in the EA market. Second, differentiating between the financial and the non-financial economic sectors allows us to analyze more specific sector-related effects of the referendum result. Our results indicate that the impact of Brexit on credit spreads for a given maturity is higher for financials than for non-financials, especially in the EA where corporate bond spreads in the non-financial sector were hardly or not at all affected by the referendum result. Third, we split our sample into pre-referendum and post-referendum periods, to consider the potential changing evaluation of the determinants of corporate bond spreads due to altering risk pricing triggered by the Brexit referendum result. We find that the impact of determining variables on corporate bond yield spreads in the UK and EA is not constant over time and that particularly the effect of credit default risk is far stronger and plays a significant role in the post-referendum period in UK and EA, respectively. This paper differs from others in that, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the impact of Brexit on corporate bond yield spreads in the UK and EA. Further contributions of this study are as follows: (I) It extends the existing literature on corporate bond yield spreads in the UK and EA, which to date is rather scarce, while (II) analyzing the UK and EA corporate bond markets simultaneously allows for a direct comparison of the two markets and (III) it is the first to use the forward swap market as an explanatory variable for credit spread. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background and gives a review of related empirical literature. Section 3 presents the data used in this study. In section 4, we examine the theoretical determinants of credit spreads and discuss our empirical results. Section 5 delivers time-varying estimation results before, section 6 finally concludes.",14

Following the consolidation of the Single Market for goods, attention focuses now on the integration of service markets. Beside other policy measures, this requires the elimination of obstacles and barriers to integration that originate from service trade restrictions and anti-competitive product market regulations. Policy efforts to spur this integration comprise a range of measures and proposals starting with the 2006 Services Directive and more recently the Single Market Strategy adopted in October 2015. The latter announced that the European Commission “will set out best practices for facilitating retail establishment and reducing operational restrictions in the Single Market. These will provide guidance for Member States to reforms and priority-setting for enforcement policy in the retail sector”. Actually, retail and wholesale trade are one of the largest services sectors in the EU. Retail trade services alone represent in 2015 4.5% of gross value added and 8.6% of employment in the EU countries. Retail and wholesale trade, which are closely linked, together generate 10% of EU value added and employ 13% of the total workforce (EU 2018). Furthermore, the functioning of the retail market affects the whole economy, because of its size and also because of its linkages with other sectors of the economy. It is also important for consumers, who spend about 30% of their total consumption expenditures in retail shops. Traditionally, retailers are seen as economic agents that only exist to resolve the spatial non-incidence between producers and consumers. They buy goods from manufacturers (and/or intermediaries) and make them available to consumers. This should happen at the lowest possible cost, meaning that the difference between prices paid upstream and charged downstream should not exceed the distribution costs and the reference distribution cost coincide with the gross margin of the most efficient retail format (Pellegrini 2000). According to Pellegrini (2000), this view might have been a reasonable approximation of the role of this sector when it consists of a very large number of small independent shops that could not interfere in the relationship between manufacturers and consumers. However, it is certainly not admissible for the modern retail trade sector with its high degree of complexity, where many different store formats exist and many retail firms are larger and have bigger bargaining power than most of their suppliers. Changes can also be observed with regard to the market structure of the retail trade sector, which usually has been characterised by monopolistic competition, with low entry barriers, high entry and exit rates and a large number of competitors whose size is relatively small. Although this picture remains partly true, recent changes in some segments of the industry, such as food retailing, suggest a move towards rising concentration and retailer power (Boylaud and Nicoletti 2001; Dobson and Waterson 1997; Hewitt 2000). A further trend is the rising internationalisation of retail trade activities. Due to the simultaneity of production and consumption of retail trade services, retailers usually cannot export their services and have to be in any way physically located where their customers are. Thus, there is only a limited number of retailers’ entry modes into foreign markets. Generally, the literature differentiates between non-equity contractual modes (i.e. franchising, management contracts or licensing) and equity modes such as wholly owned subsidiaries (Petersen and Welch 2000; Falk 2016). Equity modes are always associated with foreign direct investment (FDI) and often as a consequence foreign controlled firms. The available Foreign Affiliates Statistics (FATS) data of Eurostat show for a group of 16 EU countries that the number of foreign controlled retail trade firms increased from 4,185 firms in 2003 to 10,241 firms in 2015. For a larger group of 24 EU countries the number of these firms grew from 12,058 firms in 2008 to 14,773 firms in 2015.Footnote 1 Similarly, the sales of foreign controlled retail trade firms rose from 107 billion Euro in 2003 to 267 billion Euro in 2015 for the group of 16 EU countries. For the group of 24 EU countries there was an increase from 419 billion Euro in 2008 to 517 billion Euro in 2015. For all 28 EU countries the sales of foreign controlled retail trade firms moved from 419 billion Euro in 2010 to 540 billion Euro in 2015. A considerable growth of employment in foreign controlled retail trade firms can also be observed. It rose from 542 thousand persons in 2003 to 1.21 million persons in 2015 for the group of 16 EU countries and from 2.21 million person in 2008 to 2.67 million person in 2015 for a group of 25 countries. For all 28 EU countries employment in foreign controlled retail trade firms ascended from 2.27 million persons in 2010 to 2.71 million persons in 2015. Although the overall internationalisation of retail trade activities is increasing, there might by considerable negative effects of relatively large service trade restrictions for the distribution sector in several EU countries, because commercial presence in a foreign country is an important mode of service trade and several service trade restrictions concern the entry into foreign markets.Footnote 2 In this paper, I analyse the impact of service trade restrictions on the activities of foreign controlled retail trade firms in the EU. The analysis differentiates between the extensive and intensive margin of these activities and uses in a broader gravity model framework sector data for country pairs of the number (the extensive margin) and average employment as well as average sales (the intensive margin) of retail trade firms in 23 EU countries controlled by 42 EU and non-EU countries. With its focus on retail trade internationalisation in a international economics framework frame and its use of sector data, this analysis extends the existing literature in several directions. Prior applications of the main approaches from the economic and industrial organisation literature to explain the internationalisation of firms and their entry mode choices aim rather generally at services or business services, but do not take specific features of the retail trade sector into account. Even studies empirically focussing at the distribution sector do not consider these sector’s specifics in their underlying theoretical framework (e.g. Tanaka 2015). Empirical evidence for the retail trade sector is either limited to narrative analysis and case studies in the management and business administration literature, which also provide a large amount of often anecdotal evidence concerning the internationalisation of retailers, or to few econometric analysis with firm level data (e.g. Mohr and Batsakis 2018; Tanaka 2015). Some studies based on sector data explicitly exclude the retail sector (e.g. Nordas and Rouzet 2017; Brainard 1997). Methodologically, the econometric analysis of the extensive margin of retail trade internationalisation has to deal with a lot of “true” zero counts for the number of retail firms controlled by a specific country in a certain EU country. I use hurdle negative binomial models to capture this feature of the data adequately. The main results can be summarised as follows. The gravity model-type explanatory variables derived from the review of the theoretical literature are well suited to explain the extensive and intensive margin for bilateral retail trade FDI activities. With regard to service trade restrictions, the estimation results for the extensive margin of retail trade FDI activities show that service trade restrictiveness, especially restrictions on foreign entry, but also most of the measures from other policy areas, increases the hurdle that at least one firm from a specific source country controls a retail trade firm in a certain EU host country. Once one firm from this source country has been able to jump over the hurdle to enter the retail trade sector in a certain EU host country, the existing service trade restrictions are neither a relevant factor for the number of following firms from this source country j in that market nor for the average employment or average sales of these firms. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background of the empirical analysis. The main recent general approaches from the economic literature to explain the internationalisation of firms are reviewed and it is discussed whether these approaches are sufficient to explain the internationalisation of retail trade services or whether they have to be modified to capture specific features of this sector. Section 3 describes the empirical methodology and the data used. It also includes some descriptive statistics. Section 4 discusses the estimation results for the determinants of the extensive and intensive margin of retail trade FDI activities. Section 5 draws some conclusions.",1

In particular, signals play an important role for the fiscal policy maker: given the various instruments with different implementation lags and varying levels of aggregate effects on real activity, the fiscal policy maker can influence the consumer’s optimization problem over the short- and long-run. We distinguish between government consumption and government investment expenditures: Government investment shocks work along the supply-side of our economy and will have different effects than the purely demand-side government consumption shocks. The second key dimension to this study is the analysis of the role played by fiscal rules. We impose fiscal rules for government spending and taxes. These rules contain endogenous feedback components to debt and output. Put differently, with those rules in place the model features an automatic stabilization to exogenous disturbances. In the model, fully rational agents receive, e.g., a signal about a change of government spending in the future, which they consider to be informative. However, this signal is only imperfect, in the sense that the signal may turn out to be wrong. Put differently, agents face an optimization problem under imperfect information. As agents adjust upon the arrival of the new signal, it might be the case that the shock does not materializes and a bust completes the boom-bust cycle. The main findings are as follows. We show that the response of our model economy to government expenditure shocks is very different across the specification of fiscal policy (discretion vs. rule-based policy). In the period before the realization of the shock, we find that output increases under a fiscal rule, while it decreases without a fiscal rule in response to a government consumption shock. Overall, we find that the response of our economy to a government spending shock depends on whether a fiscal rule is active or not. In contrast, we find that for the government investment shock, the qualitative differences are much smaller. We do find that the government investment shock generates larger and more persistent real effects than the government consumption shock. This can be explained by the supply-side effects of the investment shock that are absent for the government consumption shock. Our findings have several implications for the design and the implementation of fiscal policy. In general, the adoption of a fiscal rule in our model still allows for discretionary policy measures. The model implies that the design of the fiscal rule drives the effectiveness of those discretionary fiscal measures. Furthermore, fiscal rules reduce incentives to make false announcements about the future path of fiscal policy. Therefore, there is no pendant to “surprise inflation” in the time-inconsistency literature. Our paper can be understood as an extension of the Baxter and King (1993) model to the case of expectation shocks. Hoon and Phelps (2008) analyze the effects of future tax and budgetary shocks. They use a continuous time model with Non-Ricardian agents and introduce space for asset prices. They find that an announcement of lower taxes in the future decreases hours worked and output. Milani (2011) uses a New Keynesian model enriched by a near-rational expectation formation mechanism. Estimating this model on U.S. data shows that expectation shocks explain roughly half of business cycle fluctuations. Born et al. (2013) estimate a New Keynesian model showing that anticipated capital tax shocks explain about 15 percent of fluctuations in inflation and the interest rate. Ricco (2015) develops new empirical observables to proxy fiscal news in the United States. Using Bayesian methods he finds that usual econometric methods underestimate the effects of fiscal policy shocks. He estimates the cumulative output multiplier of expected fiscal changes to be 1.5. Ricco et al. (2016) analyze the effects of policy announcements conditional on fiscal policy uncertainty. If uncertainty is high, the output effects are much lower compared to low policy uncertainty. Along this line, Mertens and Ravn (2010) extend the structural vectorautoregression approach to capture anticipation effects. They find that permanent increases in government spending, anticipated or unanticipated, increase private consumption permanently. Mertens and Ravn (2009) estimate the dynamic effects steaming from tax liability changes in the United States. They find that anticipated tax cuts lead to a decline in output, hours worked, and investment during the pre-implementation period and stimulate the economy after the tax cuts realize. The literature about the impact of anticipated tax cuts gives ambiguous results. While Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and Romer and Romer (2010) find almost no effects of those shocks, Mountford and Uhlig (2009) find an expansionary short-run effect. In contrast, House and Shapiro (2006) and Mertens and Ravn (2008) find a contractionary effect over the short-run.",

Thus far, the country has experienced the deepest recession ever afflicting a European nation in the postwar era: output and employment in 2015 had fallen by 15–20%, relative to their levels in 2010, causing extensive social deprivation and political turmoil.Footnote 1An equally threatening – though hardly discussed – consequence of the recession is the massive fall in overall investment activity, which has caused a reduction in net capital stock by 6.3% in real terms relative to its 2010 level, an event unprecedented in non-war times.Footnote 2 In fact, the steep fall in investment is mirrored by a steep rise in unemployment. Figure 1 shows that gross fixed capital formation in Greece had collapsed to just 13% of GDP, below half the level before the crisis, while unemployment followed a symmetric explosion: Though recently it partially improved thanks to short-term employment programs, in 2014 it was running at around 25% of the workforce, more than three times higher than before the crisis.

Series: ZUTN and UIGT respectively The collapse in investment characterizes both the private and the public sector, as displayed in Fig. 2. Private sector gross capital formation declined to slightly over 10% of GDP in 2014, while recently public investment somewhat recovered due to higher utilization of European Structural Funds (ESF). Gross fixed capital formation of general Government and private sector, as a percent of GDP. Source: AMECO Database. Series: UIGG and UIGP respectively The relationship between underinvestment and unemployment has been extensively researched in the economics literature (Belke and Dreger 2011). The main finding is that restoring employment and economic activity necessitates and, at the same time, encourages, a revival of investment activity.Footnote 3In many studies, the massive fall in investment activity is found to be both a result of, and a cause for, the sharp decline in output and employment. The debate becomes more relevant in light of a major initiative recently approved by the European Commission. The ‘Juncker package’ – named after the current EU President - aims to mobilize private as well as public funds through the European Investment Bank to the tune of Euro 300 billion in order to finance investment projects in the EU. The initiative could not have been timelier for Greece and other debt-stricken economies. Greece should participate in the opportunities that lay ahead by organizing a coherent investment plan. In combination with existing Structural Funds, the new initiative can provide further funding and strategic support in enhancing competitiveness and promoting export capacity of, and job creation in, the Greek economy. The medium to long-term consequences of underinvestment are significant, not least for the remaining manufacturing basis in Greece. It is, therefore, crucial to examine how other areas in Europe managed to exit from similar crises in the past, so as to set a realistic policy agenda for boosting the economy back on a growth and investment trajectory. A striking such example is the Ruhrgebiet - or the Ruhr district - a highly urbanised area in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany.Footnote 4 It experienced a serious structural crisis in the 1960s, but responded, starting in the 1970s, with a multifaceted restructuring. The crisis was gradually overcome by shifting the structure of the economy from a focus on coal mining and ancillary industries to a broader base, including services and more high-value added manufacturing (Bauer et al. 2011). This shift was made possible by a radical upgrading of the educational levels of the population. In order to understand the nature of NRW crisis back in the 1960s, it is important to note that in the late coal and steel era no further innovations (new products, branches, markets or forms of organisations) have contributed to further growth of the regional economy. One important and often cited reason for this was the so called “education blocking”. Up to 1964, no university was located in an area comprising no less than 5.4 million inhabitants. Since the Bismarck period universities and students have been considered as sources of unrest and prefered to be kept away from Germany’s “economic heart”.Footnote 5 Most of the employees in mining possessed a rather low education level (“8. Klasse Abschluss und keine Lehre“). For the simple jobs in the mining industry this proved to be sufficient.Footnote 6 In the 1970s and 1980s, when a number of universities had been founded, a labour market for the qualified, pressingly needed for the structural change, gradually developed.Footnote 7 The lost ability of innovation could be traced back to the mono-structure of the coal and steel industry which requested highly specialised suppliers in terms of the amounts and the qualities of the materials, machines and services to be delivered. Since these suppliers did not have an incentive to improve and to innovate, the ability of innovation could not be developed to a sufficient extent in the small and medium-sized firms which were considered to be the driving forces of structural change. Seen on the whole, thus, growth impulses were missing until the 1970s.Footnote 8 So what reforms took place in the Ruhrgebiet as a reaction to the crisis? The immediate reactions of the economic and political actors were rather defensive. The latter intended to stay with the old structure. Instead of adapting to new market conditions, politicians demanded securing the coal markets through contracts with domestic electricity producers and the limitation of oil and coal imports through tariffs and quotas. By this strategy of „waiting and pretending“ an immediate structural change after the crisis was missed. Moreover, all over the years the local transit system, the configuration of the leisure areas and the landscape maintenance had been neglected. Hence, it became clear that market-based measures alone could not solve the structural problems. Hence, the government took the responsibility and modernisation of the region with an extensive development programme.Footnote 9 The so-called “Entwicklungsprogramm Ruhr, 1968” was the first step away from a passive crisis management towards a targeted transformation of the Ruhrgebiet. The programme provided the settlement of growth industries and streamlining measures.Footnote 10 In the 1980s the change in the Ruhrgebiet was felt significantly. Many small- and medium-sized firms located themselves in the region (for instance, in the areas of biotech and environmental techniques) and invested significantly in R&D. In the 1990s, the period of the first internet boom, numerous internet firms and telecommunication suppliers were founded. Modernisation and innovations were decisively amplified by the erection of six universities and many technology centres as well as the establishment of the so-called ZIM (“Zukunftsinitiative Montanunion”).Footnote 11 Accordingly, German politics did in the end not allow regional disparities in the education sector to exist permanently. In the Ruhrgebiet structural change thus took place in the last decades away from mining and industry towards the services sector - just the other way round as it has been requested by the Troika for Greece.Footnote 12 This means that the Ruhrgebiet is not exactly an Industrial Champion but hosts more and more hidden champions on the world markets. A useful – though smaller and less developed – analogy in Greece that constitutes a comparison to the Ruhrgebiet is the constellation of four regions in the northern part of the country, namely those of Thessaly, Central, West, and Eastern Macedonia including Thrace; grouped together in the present study as ‘Northern Greece’. This area, especially Central Macedonia with the second largest city in Greece, Thessaloniki, represents one of the few remaining manufacturing centres in the country, and its role in the Greek economy is said to resemble that of the Land NRW within the German economy. Moreover, Northern Greece is home to important energy resources, as is also the case in NRW. Lignite dominates power generation in Greece (as in NRW), but its contribution to the regional and local economy seems rather limited, both in NRW and in Greece. Our project therefore looks at the regional level (Belke and Heine 2002, 2006) and seeks to compare the Ruhr district in Germany with the four regions in Northern Greece, asking whether there are lessons which the latter can draw from the former. Put otherwise, does the successful experience of the Ruhrgebiet offer a blueprint for sectoral innovation in Northern Greece? This paper will thus seek to analyse the structural characteristics of the Greek economy and workforce with a particular emphasis being placed on the northern regions in Greece. We will then proceed to compare these to the Ruhrgebiet district in specific and to NRW more generally. As far as we know, we are the first who conduct such a regional comparison and cannot indicate the methods that are used in the literature to perform this comparison (and our case study method can be related to). We do not wish to suggest that the problems of Greece today and those of the Ruhrgebiet forty years ago were the same. The Ruhrgebiet represented a regional adjustment problem for Germany, whereas Greece clearly faces a national macroeconomic problem. However, a comparison of the different regional adjustment paths are still interesting. The Ruhrgebiet also had to undertake the adjustment during the 1970s, which were a difficult period for Germany as well given the oil price shock of 1973. Moreover, Greece is the only program where the adjustment is so far still at the beginning whereas Ireland, Spain and, to some extent, Portugal, have left the crisis behind them. The key findings are first of all that there are some noticeable similarities in the problems both areas face. To illustrate, the qualifications of the workforce show a high degree of similarities. There are also notable differences, in particular the importance of industry and manufacturing, the weight of which in the local economy was excessive in the Ruhrgebiet, but appears lower in Greece. Moreover, it appears that Greece seems to have made considerable progress in tertiary education, at least in quantitative terms. The proportion of the workforce with a university degree is now about the same in Germany and Greece. But the results in terms of productivity and innovation are very different. It remains to be seen whether this is due to the quality of the university education or the fact that the universities in Greece constitute ‘cathedrals in the desert’ because there is no high value-added manufacturing base around them to make use of the graduates. The absence of a local manufacturing base could be due to the fact that the middle level in terms of educational qualifications is much thinner in Greece (and in particular in the north of the country) where the proportion of the workforce without complete upper secondary education is still very large. The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes some key characteristics of Northern Greece within the evolution of the overall Greek economy. Section 3 compares the regional structures of NRW and Northern Greece and points to similarities and differences between the two. Section 4 investigates the two regional labour markets and in particular the characteristics of youth unemployment. Section 5 discusses the importance of human capital on value-added activities, while Section 6 describes the innovation structures in NRW and Northern Greece. Finally, Section 7 argues on the importance of governance in improving local performance. Section 8 finally concludes.",2

A strong relationship between them would have important implications for international capital budgeting decisions and economic policies because negative shocks affecting one market may be transmitted quickly to another through contagious effects. This issue has become more critical with the occurrence of recent black swan events such as the US 2007 subprime crisis. A common and pronounced finding presented in recent finance literature is that asset returns exhibit asymmetric dependence, that is, financial markets behaves differently between tranquil and extreme conditions. The presence of asymmetries in financial markets casts doubt on the benefit of portfolio diversification and the effectiveness of risk management. Gold is a strategic resource that is largely used in national security and in various national economic activities. Large fluctuations in the gold market lead to increased price volatility. The latter imposes challenges on market participants such as consumers and producers and affects price stabilization policies, who often try to predict the future price of gold. The empirical evidence on the gold – financial markets relationships has been document by numerous studies, for example, Longin and Solnik (2001) and Ang and Chen (2002) examine asymmetry in stock returns using exceedance correlation (see Ang and Bekaert (2002)). Campbell et al. (2008) reject the normality in the distribution of financial asset returns. Number of studies evaluate the function of gold as a hedge or safe haven asset (Hillier et al. 2006; Baur and Lucey 2010; Baur and McDermott 2010; Qadan and Yagil 2012; Hood and Malik 2013; Miyazaki and Hamori 2013). On the other hand, several studies show that gold has strengthened linkages with other financial assets owing to the financialization of commodities (Domanski and Heath 2007; Baur 2011; Tang and Xiong 2012; Silvennoinen and Thorp 2013; Miyazaki and Hamori 2014). In emerging markets, which attract global institutional investors, prior studies provide evidence of significant interactions between gold and equity prices and their volatilities (e.g., Wang et al. 2010, and Arouri et al. 2015, for China; Jain and Biswal 2016, for India; Raza et al. 2016, for emerging markets; Kumar 2014). Some other studies document hedge and/or safe-haven properties of gold for stock markets (see, among others, Arouri et al. 2015, for China; Gurgun and Unalmis 2014, for emerging markets). To examine the interaction between gold and stock market, some econometric methods are used. For example, Bekiros et al. (2017) use a GARCH-based copula methodology and a wavelet approach to studies the hedging and diversification roles of gold for BRICS stock markets. Results indicate the evidence of two-way causality linkages, suggesting that gold behaves more like equities. In the other hand, Sarwar (2017) considers the links between the implied volatilities of US stock markets and the gold, the author disregards the relationships in large emerging markets. Recently, Sarwar and Khan (2017) use a GARCH models and the Granger causality test, and they indicates that intensified US market uncertainty reduces emerging market returns in Latin America and increases the variance of returns. Bouri et al. (2017a) find the presence of nonlinearity and significant co-integration in the interaction between the implied volatilities of gold, crude oil and Indian equities. Bouri et al. (2017b) examine the short- and long-term causality between the implied volatility of gold and that of India and China. The authors show evidence of a feedback effect. Yang and Zhou (2017) identify the significant impact of quantitative easing on the implied volatility spillovers across US Treasury bonds commodities and developed stock market indices. In the context of asymmetric effect and time varying, Kang et al. (2016) show that the dynamic correlations among BRICS markets and commodities (oil and gold) are time varying and sensitive to major economic and financial events. Some studies consider the effect of the global financial crisis. For example, Xu and Hamori (2012) use the cross-correlation function approach and indicate that the volatility linkages between the US and BRIC stock markets have significantly eased after the GFC. In addition, Mensi et al. (2014) use a quantile regression approach and find that the BRICS stock markets exhibit dependence on the US equities, gold markets and crude oil, and that dependence is affected by the global financial crisis (GFC). The main objective of this work is to explore the asymmetric dynamics in the correlations among gold and other financial markets, as this remains under explored in empirical research. Furthermore, it would be interesting to conduct an empirical analysis on how the dependence structures of the gold and financial market changed particularly at the different phases of financial markets, the subprime mortgage turmoil and the global financial crisis. Two major contributions on this topic are made in the present study. First, we investigate the asymmetric behavior of dynamic correlations among gold and financial market by employing the multivariate asymmetric DCC (A-DCC) model put forward by Cappiello et al. (2006). The A-DCC model allows for conditional asymmetries in covariance and correlation dynamics, thereby enabling to examine the presence of asymmetric responses in correlations during periods of negative shocks. Second, we evaluate how the selected period of crises influenced the estimated DCCs among the currency markets. This article is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the methodology to test for asymmetry in the correlation. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4 presents our empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",5

With the backdrop of the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve (Fed) introduced a sequence of unconventional monetary policy measures in late 2008 to provide liquidity through its asset purchase program. The Fed started to taper the aggressive bond-buying program by ten billion US dollars a month in January 2014 and ended its historic easing stimulus program in October 2014. In December 2015, it announced the first rise in US interest rates since 2006. These policy measures implemented by the Fed could influence financial markets around the world. According to Neely (2013), the Fed’s asset purchases had substantial international effects on bond and foreign exchange markets. Large-scale asset purchases influence international asset prices as well because of global capital market linkages. Several studies have investigated the international spillovers of unconventional US monetary policy on other countries. Ahmed and Zlate (2014) find no statistically significant positive effects of unconventional US monetary expansion on total net emerging market economy inflows whereas Anaya et al. (2017), Barroso et al. (2016), Fratzscher et al. (2017) and Tillmann, 2016) find significant capital inflows outside the US. On the other hand, Gambacorta et al. (2014) find that the estimated output effects are qualitatively similar to those of conventional monetary policy while Hajek and Horvath (2018) find that the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures are weaker than those of conventional measures. Chen et al. (2016) and Georgiadis (2016) claim that the effects from the impact of US quantitative easing are larger outside the US than those in the US. Moreover, Bowman et al. (2015) and Hausman and Wongswan (2011) deal with the effects of US monetary policy announcements to determine significant responses. This paper examines whether the spillovers of unconventional US monetary policies to global financial markets are different from those of conventional policies, using the global VAR (GVAR) model. Furthermore, this paper also investigates what role exchange rates play as a transmission channel of a US monetary policy shock to stock prices. Specifically, the contributions of the study to the existing literature are as follows: First, this paper demonstrates the effects of a US monetary policy shock during relatively short periods, using weekly data.Footnote 1 Most studies, using monthly or quarterly data, cannot estimate monetary policy shock effects for a short period because of the insufficient number of samples.Footnote 2 This paper examines the impacts of a US monetary policy shock, including in the conventional monetary easing phase from the beginning of 2007 through mid-2008. Whereas Chudik and Fratzscher (2011) employ weekly data in the GVAR model and analyze the role that the tightening in liquidity conditions and the collapse in risk appetite played in the global transmission of the financial crisis, this paper compares the spillovers of conventional and unconventional US monetary policies in the tightening and easing phases. Second, shadow interest rates for the US, the UK, the euro area and Japan provided by Krippner (2016) are used in the estimations in order to assess the effects of quantitative easing monetary policy. Whereas Dees et al. (2007), Eickmeier and Ng (2015) and Martin and Cuaresma (2017) use short-term and long-term interest rates, Ganelli and Tawk (2016) use the increase in equity prices and the increase in the monetary base as two alternative proxies of Japan’s quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. It would be difficult to compare the effects of conventional monetary policy with those of unconventional monetary policy, in which short-term interests are at zero or near-zero. Taking into account the advantage of using shadow interest rates, that they are applicable whether the federal funds rate and other policy rates are at zero or not, this paper uses the daily shadow federal funds rates calculated by Krippner (2016) whereas Hajek and Horvath (2018) use the shadow federal funds rates proposed by Wu and Xia (2016), whose frequency is monthly. Third, the asymmetric effects of monetary easing and tightening policies are investigated. Furthermore, the differences of effects in conventional and unconventional monetary policies are also examined. Whereas Rogers et al. (2014) discuss a surprise monetary policy of easing and tightening, and Hajek and Horvath (2018) compare the effects of unconventional easing monetary policy measures with those of conventional methods, this paper is characterized by the introduction of five subperiods in the analysis of policy effects. Moreover, this paper divides the unconventional tightening phase into two: one in which the US shadow federal funds rate is negative, and the other in which the federal funds rate is no longer at the zero lower bound. Because no other studies have comprehensively compared conventional and unconventional as well as tightening and easing phases yet, including these two tightening phases, this paper presents differences among them in responses to a monetary policy shock. Fourth, the role of foreign exchange rates as a transmission channel of a US monetary policy shock to stock prices is accessed by counterfactual analysis. Chen et al. (2016) design counterfactual scenarios in which US QE measures are assumed to be absent whereas Anaya et al. (2017) investigate portfolio flows as a channel of shock transmission, conducting a counterfactual exercise. However, no former studies have focused on foreign exchange rates as a transmission channel in the GVAR framework. This paper presents the changing roles of foreign exchange rates as a transmission channel in accordance with various US monetary policy phases. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the global vector autoregressive model and identification. Section 3 presents data and a model setup. Section 4 demonstrates empirical results. Section 5 conducts counterfactual analysis. The last section concludes the paper.",5

J. Welfens,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The negotiations between the European Union and the US on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) began in 2013 and were expected conclude in 2016/17 – after the end of the Obama administration; political resistance had been particularly strong in Germany, often for rather unclear reasons. With President Trump’s administration the US has given up on TTIP and also on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement; it seems that the expected US economic benefits are insufficient to justify broad regional integration schemes. However, there still remains the key issue of which theoretical and empirical approach is appropriate to best assess the benefits from a deep integration scheme such as TTIP, i.e. which would not just focus on trade liberalization but on the reduction of FDI barriers as well. Focusing on TTIP, one may raise questions about the rather narrow European Union’s (EU) Commission approach and the Francois et al. (2013) paper that looks mainly at trade aspects and only in chapter 6 – based on an FDI gravity modeling – on some selected aspects of transatlantic Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) liberalization. The subsequent analysis looks, in a broader perspective, at the knowledge production function (KPF) as a methodology to simultaneously consider the role of FDI inward stocks, the number of researchers and a proxy for trade intensity. Based on an empirical panel data analysis we can then plug the results under certain assumptions into the macroeconomic production function of the EU’s largest economy, namely Germany, in order to get an assessment of how the combined effects of trade, FDI and innovation affect real output; in a nutshell the same key question can be raised in a kind of reverse perspective of Brexit where the UK is expected to leave the EU single market and thus largely give up on the intra-EU dynamics of trade, FDI and innovation involving UK firms with trade, production and knowledge networks in the EU28 (Welfens 2017). If the UK implements Brexit in 2020, one may assume that the UK and the US would embark on a UK-US free trade agreement within a rather short period of time. As the US has withdrawn from the TTIP negotiations in 2017 and adopted a broadly protectionist policy stance, the Trump Administration has undermined prospects for strong transatlantic and global trade growth. Moreover, the new US focus on bilateralism is undermining multilateralism in a general way and the functioning of the WTO in particular; the lack of qualified expert staff in the Treasury and the Department of Commerce – as Trump could replace only about 3000 of the 4000 or so political appointments made under the Obama Administration – implies considerable US and Western stabilization risk for the case of a major international economic slow-down (Welfens 2019). With global economic growth slowing down in 2019/2020 – following actual statistics for the US and the October 2019 IMF forecast for 2020 (IMF 2019) – one may again raise the question of how big the benefits for the EU and the US would be if both sides would consider a transatlantic free trade agreement: if the EU27 and the UK would embark upon a parallel transatlantic free trade agreement, one should consider the key questions of a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Even if the Trump Administration has adopted bilateralism as a preferred policy strategy, this does not exclude new EU-US free trade negotiations since this would still be compatible with bilateralism. The more difficult US-Chinese trade negotiations turn out to be, the more the Trump Administration could be interested in considering a broader Transatlantic free trade agreement; however, in a period of US-driven weakening of (and thus declining of) multilateralism, it is not very likely that the Trump Administration will very actively seize the opportunity to liberalize US-EU economic relations. The new EU Commission could be interested in minimizing the negative effects of Brexit, namely by embarking upon a new EU-US free trade agreement; possibly without the much debated international investment treaty, but it is quite unclear that the Commission would push for a Transatlantic Agreement rather soon in a Trumpian environment in which political promises from the US have become rather doubtful messages even for Western allies. Felbermayr (2019) has argued that Trump’s protectionism has thus far not undermined global trade. The statistics support the Felbermayr argument to some extent, but one should not overlook that in a US-China-EU perspective the strong US protectionism vis-à-vis China has caused considerable Chinese export diversion towards ASEAN and the EU on the one hand, on the other hand the global price level has reduced under the effect of Chinese tradable goods supplies (i.e. the global price level is lower than in the Business-As-Usual Case) so that there is a rather artificial global real income gain which stimulates trade in a particular way. Moreover, the expansion of information and communication technology is also a new driver the creation of geographically more dispersed production networks so that global trade in intermediate products should increase – and one should indeed control for such effects which apparently has not been the case in the Felbermayr analysis. Even post-Obama, there is a clear analytical transatlantic trade liberalization issue for the US and the EU and it is largely still the TTIP framework which matters; not only with respect to trade perspectives but also with respect to US foreign direct investment in the EU and EU FDI in the US: Looking at the TTIP issues in this twin perspective is quite interesting and the Trump Administration, or any other populist US presidential administration, would have to focus on the option of TTIP (obviously under a new name) or to consider just narrow sectoral liberalization options such as reducing or eliminating tariffs for the automotive sector and some other sectors. A narrow sectoral tariff liberalization focus would, however, be economically and thus politically less attractive for both the US and the EU on the one hand. On the other hand, the US as the world’s largest source country of FDI will always have an interest in reducing investment barriers in the EU and here the European Commission indeed has competences for EU investment treaties since the Lisbon Treaty which created this new competence for the EU in a rather haphazard way (Shan and Zhang 2010). From an economic perspective, a key question has been how big the potential benefits from TTIP could be and here it is remarkable that no joint EU-US analysis was published. Rather, the EU presented its own study – state of the art in terms of trade modeling, but actually missing key points: The analytical issues related to TTIP are still highly relevant and one of the issues to be considered is why the EU itself has not commissioned a broader study on TTIP; instead the CEPR study (Francois et al. 2013) has mainly looked into the trade-related benefits that were estimated to be rather low while foreign direct investment effects were considered only in a limited way. While one may anticipate that the FDI and innovation effects would be core elements of TTIP dynamics, the European Commission focused only on trade and FDI; the small TTIP benefit identified by the Francois et al. study – basically a 0.5% increase of GDP in the EU (plus a small impact from the liberalization of transatlantic FDI - contributed to many critical questions on TTIP. Given the fact that the US and the EU are the largest source countries of FDI and also stand for two of the three leading FDI host countries globally, it is obvious that FDI aspects should be included in a TTIP analysis; and since the US and the EU are the world’s two most innovative countries and since FDI and innovations are closely linked, the FDI patent/innovation nexus should be included in a serious TTIP analysis. However, this has not been done in the study of Francois et al. – the subsequent contribution undertakes this task and generates new insights, including that the study by Francois et al. results in a stark underestimation of the benefits of TTIP. In many EU countries there is a broad discussion about the economic benefits of TTIP – particularly in Germany, Austria and Luxembourg where PEW surveys (2015) on TTIP attitudes suggest that a majority of the population in these countries is against TTIP; and in the US the regional trade project on a Trans-Pacific Partnership – TPP has been signed in 2015 – has also encountered massive political resistance. One key issue concerns the economic benefits for the countries involved. It is well known that the official EU study (Francois et al. 2013) on the TTIP-related benefits suggest a fairly low long run economic gain, namely 0.5% of GDP for the EU and 0.4% of GDP for the US. While it is true that Chapter 6 of the Francois et al. study is rarely mentioned, one may argue that this analysis indeed looked beyond pure trade creation effects, namely by asking how much transatlantic FDI flows would be raised if the transatlantic barriers to capital flows would fall by a quarter, namely down to the level of intra-EU capital flows; and the result was a rise in employment by US subsidiaries in the EU of about 11% and for EU subsidiaries in the US of about 10%. Taking additionally into account BEA data, according to which US subsidiaries in the EU have accounted in 2012 for about 3% of the EU’s gross domestic product while that of EU subsidiaries in the US stand for a similar figure, the implication is that there could be another gain of 0.33% in the EU and of 0.30% in the US if labor productivity remains constant in these firms – and if there is no offsetting decline of employment in other firms (not standing for transatlantic foreign subsidiaries). It is, however, clear that TTIP lets one expect a rise of labor productivity so that the implications of the findings of Francois et al. (2013) imply an output increase that should exceed that of employment in the subsidiaries. While the study of Francois et al. covers at least the main trade aspects and basic FDI perspectives, it is obvious that a broader analysis of FDI and innovation dynamics is not included. It is also not fully clear as to what extent reduction of non-tariff barriers brings about direct output gains through cost cutting by firms as a result of new - common transatlantic - norms. Subsequently, we will take a closer look at this issue and consider the empirical findings for Germany to be an important clue for potential effects for the EU as a whole. It should be emphasized that in a world economy with economic globalization – read: where FDI, trade and innovation dynamics are interacting – it will be important to consider broader international Schumpeterian dynamics, including the particular role of FDI on knowledge accumulation. The modern knowledge production function is an adequate approach in this context and this holds not only for OECD countries but for China (Cheung and Lin 2003) as well. It is fairly obvious that it is not only an analysis of the TTIP project which requires a careful look at the concept of a knowledge production function and real income gains; the case of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a similar development which suggests not to simply rely only on a standard Computable General Equilibrium model and some basic gravity equation modeling (even if the US pulls out of TPP, the other 11 countries seem to be willing to start the political venture – at first without the US). The EU and the US are the main source countries of global foreign direct investment and they stand for two of the three main host countries (with the EU considered here as a quasi-country); they also stand for about 30% of triad patents and it is well known that FDI dynamics and patent applications are often positively linked. In the context of the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, one may expect that a rising inward foreign direct investment in EU countries could directly or indirectly affect real income. At first glance the inward FDI dynamics have three basic aspects: Inward FDI could be reduced in a transatlantic perspective, namely to the extent that reduced import tariffs in the EU (or the US) will weaken previous tariff-jumping motivation. Given the fact that import tariff levels in the US and the EU were about 3% at the start of the TTIP negotiations on both sides of the Atlantic, one may, however, expect this aspect to be rather weak. With non-tariff barriers estimated to amount to a tariff equivalent of about 17% in the EU (based on the CEPR report and assuming that industry stands for 60% and services for 40% of trade) – and with similar levels in the US – one cannot rule out that NTB reductions could make this aspect somewhat temporarily relevant. With transatlantic investment barriers to be reduced additional transatlantic FDI inflows can be expected in EU countries – and higher EU FDI outflows to the US. A rise of transatlantic FDI might not only reflect lower barriers to international investment but could also stand for increasingly complex global value-added chains that are facilitated by modern information and communication technologies (ADB 2015). FDI inflows from third countries can be expected in the context of TTIP and this to some extent is indeed the tariff-jumping argument in a modified perspective mentioned in the first aspect. For example, investors from China, ASEAN countries or Latin American countries can be expected to be interested in raising production in the EU (and the US), respectively. In oligopolistic industries one may expect additional inflows in the context of follow-the-leader FDI pattern. With higher foreign direct investment inflows – and hence a higher role of multinational companies, most of which are technology-intensive –, one can focus on knowledge production functions and the role of (cumulated) FDI inflows on the production of new knowledge. However, in the presence of inward FDI and outward FDI it is necessary to make a distinction between the effects of deep regional integration on gross domestic income (Y) and gross national income (Z): Real income Z is obtained as Y plus net income from abroad so that net dividend payments received are a crucial element to be considered – and here the stock of inward FDI and of outward FDI naturally will play a role. Hence of one wants to understand how FDI and innovation dynamics, respectively, affect real national income one will have to look beyond GDP effects – in any case the innovation dynamics and the knowledge production function will be key aspects to be considered. The analytical concept of a knowledge production function is well established in the literature and indeed has been applied in various ways to industrialized countries (Charlot et al. 2014; Fritsch 2002; Marrocu et al. 2013); this concept assumes that new knowledge, approximated by patent applications for example, is based on a specific macroeconomic knowledge production function including researchers and FDI capital stocks as well as other variables. While looking at patent application is a common way to proxy new knowledge, one may emphasize that not all new knowledge is patented – possibly a declining share of it can be protected by patents in modern services economies. However, in a pragmatic empirical perspective patent applications are still crucial for analyzing knowledge progress in industrialized countries. The paper is organized as follows. At first we take a brief look at some basic aspects of trade and productivity growth in regional trade liberalization approaches. Key insights from the literature are summarized. Next, a compact knowledge production function is developed in a new approach for an open economy and this represents the basic theoretical basis for the subsequent regression analysis which in turn allows to calculate the overall GDP effects for the EU; this will include trade effects, FDI and innovation effects plus the transatlantic macroeconomic spillover effect from the US GDP to the EU GDP. Finally, selected policy conclusions from the empirical findings are presented with some particular conclusions for the case of Germany. The order of magnitude that comes out as the grand total for the EU is about 2%. In principle, the methodology developed here could also be applied to the US on the basis of a Schumpeterian regional US model (with states instead of EU countries considered here). The policy conclusions stated in the end are not only picking up the key insights from the panel data estimation of the knowledge production function for 20 EU countries in the period 2002–2012. Rather there is also a need to consider not only the implications for the EU policy layer but for the national policy layer as well and to take into account that differences in intra-EU FDI and innovation dynamics could considerably reinforce economic divergence within the European Union. One may also emphasize that policy reforms that enhance the respective national innovation system. The analytical approach used in the context of the knowledge production function is to understand deep integration projects such as the EU-US project of a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – potentially also the TPP project of the US with eleven partner countries from the Pacific Basin including Australia and Japan – indeed should go beyond the analysis of trade creation and trade diversion. While President Obama had signed the TPP project, his successor Donald Trump has decided to stop TPP and indeed the US effectively had soon withdrawn from three treaties and international institutions, respectively: The US turned its back on TPP which began under a different name by the eleven partner countries. Japan, which had joined the negotiation process rather late, became the new de facto leader of this trans-Pacific integration scheme once the US dropped out. The Trump Administration withdrew from the UN’s Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 in a move which would take effect in late 2020. In December 2019, the dispute resolution mechanism of the WTO became dysfunctional since the Trump Administration did not want to contribute to the process of the election of new judges to the WTO’s appellate body. Since patents and innovation, respectively, play a very strong role in the EU and the US, it is clear that TTIP should have a complementary Schumpeterian dimension and this is what we present here with respect to EU countries. The FDI dynamics, the associated Schumpeterian innovation effects and the associated output effects should be studied – a priori it is not clear whether or not there are direct effects of cumulated FDI capital on output or whether only indirect effects are relevant. As will be shown for the case of Germany, which represents about one quarter of the EU’s GDP, it is indeed not FDI that has a direct impact on output; the relevant channel is clearly from (cumulated) FDI to knowledge and from knowledge to the macroeconomic production function and output, respectively. From this perspective, chapter 6 of the Francois et al. study should be interpreted with care since employment in US subsidiaries in the US might increase at the expense of the domestic competitors in the EU host countries. The analysis is organized as follows: Section 2 takes a look at the theoretical background of the knowledge production function and section 3 gives the empirical results of the panel data analysis for 20 EU countries. Section 4 considers the results of plugging the knowledge production function findings into a well-known macro production function for Germany that was originally calculated for the German Institute for Standardization/DIN (an approach that has also been applied to some other countries). Section 5 looks at the implications of FDI inflows for Germany’s output so that one major EU country is considered – as an example for the whole EU: We provide empirical evidence on the issue of whether or not FDI has a direct effect on output. Section 6 gives some policy conclusions and the appendix points out the relevance of the distinction between GDP and gross national income in a setting with FDI. The fact that the figures for Germany, Spain, the UK, the US and other OECD countries show no significant difference between GDP and GNP figures could have various explanations; partly it seems to be an artefact in the context of the tax evasion of firms as can be shown, for example, in the case of Spain where hidden Spanish investment in Switzerland is partly hiding considerable extra foreign dividend income accruing to Spanish investors (Welfens 2019).",9

J. Welfens,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The novel coronavirus (for short COVID-19, or COrona VIrus Disease 2019) epidemic which started at the end of 2019 in the Wuhan area of China has, within three months, affected about 90,000 people worldwide of which approximately 3000 have died. The number of countries reporting infections has increased rapidly and the high case fatality rate has caused many individuals, firms and governments to react in various ways in order to try to limit the spread of the virus. In the EU and the US, this has included imposing quarantine on people who have recently returned from abroad – for example, from China – or who have participated in certain social events (such as the carnival celebrations in western Germany in late February, where in one location alone, the city of Heinsberg which is close to Düsseldorf, many people seem to have contracted the virus) in which individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 had also participated and who have been on the radar of health authorities. Many firms in Germany and France have encouraged employees to practice home office and thus have tried to minimize infection risks within the company; other countries, including the US, have followed in March 2020. Such adjustment measures in firms, while pragmatic, will go along with reduced labor productivity and innovation, but at least a lot of important work can still be done remotely. The authorities imposed a so-called “lockdown” in Italy in mid-March and other EU countries have followed with similar measures in order to slow down the spreading of the coronavirus. In car factories – for example Volkswagen – workers have raised the question of why production should continue meaning that workers are exposed to a spreading infection while white collar workers are sitting at home with the family following the government-imposed restrictions in many western OECD countries in mid-March, namely to avoid situations with many people congregating in the same area. Problems with lack of intermediate products supplied from abroad could thus slow down industrial production as much as workers’ fear of the propagation of the coronavirus and the spread infection at the factory floor, respectively. To the extent that regulations have been imposed to close hotels and restaurants both domestic and international tourism are extremely restricted in the first and second quarter of 2020. Thus the question arises which macroeconomic effects one has to anticipate and how the effectively massive epidemic test of the health system and the hospital sector, respectively, will cause in the many countries affected. The first part of this contribution is an introduction and an overview of key issues. The basic idea of the whole contribution is to argue that a broader and deeper analytical link between macroeconomic approaches and health system analysis seems to be adequate; indeed required if one is to largely understand the unique medium- and long-term effects of the coronavirus shock – or of similar future shocks. Moreover, some new key indicators for the capacity of the hospital sector in the coronavirus pandemic are presented for OECD countries. The usefulness of the recently available Global Security Health Index is emphasized and analytical findings of the augmented Mundell tradables/non-tradables model are presented along with a simple modified Solow growth model which includes the health insurance coverage ratio as a critical variable in the context of an approach with an epidemic shock. A crucial aspect of this contribution is to emphasize established analytical positive links between health and productivity and output growth, respectively – generally emphasized by, amongst others, Mushkin (1962), Hsiao (2000) and for the case of China by the empirical findings of Li and Huang (2009). The subsequent analysis is based on knowledge available at March 24, but the theoretical approaches highlighted and developed here should be useful beyond changes in the CORVID-19 statistics. COVID-19 is spreading worldwide and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the international epidemic to be of a global nature: COVID-19 was by that date officially regarded as a pandemic. With 104 countries affected, about 420,000 people infected and nearly 19,000 fatalities (for an overview see the map of the WHO as of March 25, 2020Footnote 1 and tables in Appendix 1 Tables 7 and 8). As of mid-March, 146 countries were affected, 154,000 people had been infected and 5700 fatalities had been recorded. In absolute terms, the number of infections was very high in China with 81,048 cases, followed by Italy (21,157), Iran (12,729), Republic of Korea (8162), Spain (5753), France (4469), Germany (3795), US (1678), Switzerland (1359) and the UK (1144). Given the nature of the pandemic, the picture quickly changes: For March 23, 2020, the WHO reported 81,601 cases in China which is roughly a stagnation, but Italy already had recorded 59,138, Spain 28,572, Germany 24,774 and France 15,821 cases. The age distribution of coronavirus-related deaths for China shows that the elderly have, not surprisingly, a higher mortality than the average. One economic implication is that, on the one hand, the effective labor force should be negatively affected by COVID-19. On the other hand, there is an unclear effect on retired persons and the overall death rate as the shut-down of firms improves the overall air quality and thus could reduce the number of people falling ill from non-coronavirus diseases (Fenz and Kharas 2020). With hospitals facing full capacity utilization in acute care capacities, the survival rate of other inpatients and outpatients with serious illnesses (non COVID-19) could fall. As regards the WHO figures, one may note that the oft-cited figures published by the Johns Hopkins University differ due to the broader statistical coverage by the latter. The only country in the top seven countries where the apparent e-function type related expansion was different – starting from the day when 100 infections had been reported – was the Republic of Korea where broad testing and strict quarantine measures had been applied. Another country with a rather low number of infections reported was Taiwan (with less than 50 confirmed cases by March 9, 2020) where government relied on a ready emergency plan built upon the previous experience of the SARS epidemic and shut down all air travelling with China early on. The pandemic could bring a minor recession for OECD countries and China or several quarters of much reduced output in industry and the services sector. International tourism will be very modest in 2020 and might not recover before the second half of 2021. In a normal recession, tourism – representing a large economic sector in many countries – is usually not much affected. A lack of vacation time in turn and the stress from the threat of the pandemic might also depress considerable strata of society for some time so that productivity could decline strongly for many months. As PSA, Renault, Fiat-Chrysler, Volkswagen and other EU car producers have announced on March 16 that production in several plants will be shut down for several months in Europe a deep recession cannot be excluded, as there could be a unique overlap of declining manufacturing output and services sector contraction, including tourism. There is also the risk that the normal chain of payments could be interrupted as firms or households face serious liquidity constraints – and firms or banks’ solvency constraints - if the economic crisis deepens. A deepening economic crisis will make it more difficult to bolster the resources allocated to the health sector. The hospital sector is obviously crucial to the response to the coronavirus epidemic and here the indicators are critical for many countries, including many EU countries, namely when acute care beds relative to the elderly population are considered (see subsequent sections). This contribution brings together macroeconomic and health system aspects in a somewhat unusual way, but this perspective could be useful for the analysis of the coronavirus epidemic (Map 1). An epidemic typically starts with a small diffusion of the number of people infected, after a few months or quarters there will be a peak as counter measures by government as well as individuals - and physicians in the health system - have been implemented. After the peak has been reached, the number of infected will gradually fall. From this perspective, the macroeconomic effects in a first stage of an epidemic should be rather modest, followed by a peak of negative output shocks – finally followed by a potentially enhanced economic upswing as postponed investment and consumption in the private sector could increase. Both mortality and morbidity statistics published should affect aggregate demand on the one hand, but also aggregate supply on the other hand as there will be less people working in factories and offices in an epidemic period. Of particular relevance for the control of the spatial spreading of COVID-19 are measures which effectively impose a quarantine on those who are infected; and for many other people, the authorities could impose restrictions on mobility at the regional, the national and the global level. Many people, including tourists and business people, will be eager to reduce their level of international travel, particularly to regions/countries with high infection problems. From this perspective, China – where COVID-19 started in late 2019 – has a specific problem, but one should also notice that China has had growing numbers of visitors, including business people, and tourists in the two decades after 1990 (see Appendix Fig. 9). A pandemic like COVID-19 is a crucial shock to most national health systems in countries with a high number of infections and is also a shock to the world economy. Given the fact that health care expenditures relative to gross domestic product in industrialized countries are between 8 and 18% in 2019, it seems crucial to link health care expenditure analysis to the more traditional macroeconomic analysis. Indeed, there is a lack of such analysis as has already been noted by Gerdtham and Jonsson (2000) in their classical health care analysis contribution “International Comparison of Health Expenditure: Theory, Data and Econometric Analysis” in the Handbook of Health Economics. The coronavirus shock to the world economy is a case where indeed an overlap of macroeconomic analysis and health care analysis indeed makes a lot of sense. To the extent that the COVID-19 shock reduces real income for several quarters in many countries, one should also see a medium term decline of health care expenditures (after the short-term transitory peak determined by the epidemic) since the demand for health care rises over-proportionately with real income. The statistics on China’s regional incidence of COVID-19 infections show that two provinces are primarily affected which suggests that the drastic quarantine measures imposed by the national and regional authorities seem to have been effective. As regards the EU, Italy is a hotspot with more than 7000 confirmed cases at the end of the first week of March. The US Center for Disease Control was reporting eleven fatalities in the US on March 7, 2020, while the WHO) were documenting no COVID-19 related deaths in the United States on the same day (the WHO figures were subsequently updated in the following days). On March 24, the WHO had already registered a total of 42,164 coronavirus infections in the United States, including 10,591 new infections and 471 fatalities. New York seemed to be a regional hot spot and on March 24 the Trump Administration declared that visitors to New York should undergo 14 days in self-isolation. Given the fact that New York had 64 million US visitors plus 14 million foreign visitors plus an unknow number of New York people who visited friends or business colleagues and other institutions in the US, and indeed outside the US, the New York cluster indeed stands for a crucial challenge. Assuming that 500,000 US visitors had been in New York as visitors in the two weeks prior to March 24, about half a million US citizens should go into quarantine and the roughly 100,000 foreign visitors who had visited New York in the same period should also followed the advice for a self-imposed quarantine. However, these people apparently have not been contacted although airlines could have been mobilized to track foreign visitors and to alert them about the need for self-quarantine. This is an example of how poorly organized the world economy is in facing the challenge of a pandemic and how negligent authorities in the US and outside the US have dealt with the fact that New York is a coronavirus hot spot. While the very nature of a pandemic calls for global economic cooperation, it seems that such cooperation is at a premium in 2020; to what extent political populism contributes to this problem could be an important aspect in future research. As regards the economic impact of COVID-19 in various countries, one may point out that it is not only direct and indirect channels into the real economy which will be relevant, but changes in income expectations which will (this includes digital news channels – e.g. the diffusion of COVID-19 related information in the internet) affect the behavior of investors and consumers as well as policymakers. Psychological effects on the demand side could play a strong role in the current epidemic and negative effects on the aggregate demand side could overlap with supply-side disturbances from international problems in the delivery of intermediate inputs. Liquidity problems on the side of firms could also contribute to an economic slowdown, moreover liquidity problems of major banks might occur in many countries so that output decline in OECD countries as well as in China and other countries could be considerable. In early March 2020, McKibbin and Fernando (2020) have presented a macro model with various scenarios for the world economy which show a large range of negative possible real GDP outcomes in the context of the COVID-19 challenge, including a major international recession. The Interim Economic Assessment of the OECD (2020) from March 2, 2020 has argued that global output growth could decline to a low rate of 2.4%, down from the 2.9% of 2019 – but in 2021, the output growth would rise to 3.3% in the world economy (see following Table 1). The interim assessment of the OECD (2020) showed in March only slight negative effects on output in 2020 and 2021, respectively; the peak of the infection was assumed to be in the first quarter 2020. In a special simulation case with a peak only in the second half of 2020, a stronger output decline is shown, namely −1.75% relative to the baseline; North America records −1.5% Table 1. At the end of the first quarter of 2020, it is still too early to fully assess the output decline from the coronavirus shock, but the order of magnitude for western OECD countries could come close to the output decline related to the Transatlantic Banking Crisis. The type of shock represented by the coronavirus pandemic is normally not considered in standard macroeconomic simulations – hence the combined effect of a shutdown of the tourism sector and the hospitality sector plus the automotive sector plus other services (say, a barber shop closed for several weeks as a consequence of epidemic-related government regulations – with no relative price adjustment able to bring about a new market equilibrium in the short term) first have to appear on the analytical radar of simulation expert groups. The duration of the demand effect is rather uncertain in the early stage of the pandemic, but even once the duration becomes clear after a few months there could be serious balance sheet effects on companies with limited working capital and short-term debt maturities – hence, even a temporary closure of firms can have serious effects in some economic sectors. It is thus not clear that after a few months of the temporary shutdown of many firms, one could more or less reset the whole economy and continue output expansion on the old level of the growth path. Since the pandemic shock affects nearly all countries of the world economy there is also an unusual global synchronization of the shock and the big fiscal packages considered in the US, the EU, the UK and in other countries clearly imply a medium-term rise of debt-GDP ratios in OECD countries and many newly industrialized countries. Developing countries without much room to maneuver will need strong support by the IMF, the World Bank and regional multilateral banks. The coronavirus pandemic thus is a challenge that requires a multilateral response. Multilateralism, however, is not the favored approach of the Trump Administration with its emphasis on bilateralism. By implication, there will be a lack of US leadership in this international economic crisis that in turn also could raise doubts about standard open economy simulation results. In a typical DSGE macro model the strong output decline after the initial epidemic shock is followed by a later output increase where part of the initial output loss is compensated by higher output growth in the following quarters. As long as the coronavirus challenge can be overcome in a medical sense by autumn 2020, postponed consumption and investment should be useful to contribute to a new economic upswing in 2021 and beyond; an adequate mix of monetary policy and fiscal policy can contribute to overcoming the incipient recession. To the extent that China, the US, the EU27 plus the UK and Japan adopt similar expansionary policy, there will be international spillover effects on the one hand which reinforces the upswing. However, quantitative easing (QE) which normally brings about a nominal and real devaluation, and a decline of the interest rate, will not bring much output expansion through the real devaluation impulse if several big countries adopt similar QE policies. As regards the UK, it is, however, clear that the expansionary policy mix adopted in spring 2020 means that there is not much room to maneuver for a strong fiscal and monetary impulse to cushion the BREXIT shock. The UK in turn faces sharper problems in the health system post-BREXIT – as of February 1, 2020; the UK’s access to special medical programs of the EU are no longer available and the number of foreign workers in the UK National Health Service (NHS) has declined in the period 2016–2019. This is a problem in a period in which demand stress on intensive care in the NHS hospital system will increase. The number of hospital beds per inhabitant in the UK is rather low by an international comparison amongst OECD countries, at the same time, one may point out that Italy, Spain and France had recorded high number of COVID-19 infections in March 2020. By mid-March 2020, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve System had all reduced interest rates or adopted – as with the ECB which was already operating at a zero interest rate level – more favorable conditions for banks to get central bank loans. It is not clear that monetary policy is suitable to counter-balance the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic whose economic disturbance is largely a supply-side disturbance (shocks to international production networks) and liquidity problems of many firms as well as some aggregate demand weakening. Fiscal expansion packages had also been adopted in the US, the UK and some leading EU countries by mid-March 2020. The European Commission (2020) emphasized that a consistent expansionary policy mix could help to stabilize the EU in a situation in which supply-shocks and demand shocks – including a negative shock from China in the first quarter of 2020 - as well as liquidity problems of firms were overlapping. One may add that the EU and the EU countries, respectively, had been passive in seeking restrictions on air travel to and from China in February and March 2020 which probably was not helpful in containing the spreading of the epidemic to Europe; by contrast the US imposed flight travelling restrictions with China in February. While China and other countries in Asia are facing the epidemic as a crucial challenge for the health system and the political as well as the economic system Western Europe and the United States try to anticipate the spreading of the virus and to develop an adequate response in health policy, economic policy and in the field of international cooperation. As regards China, the province of Hubei (with the epidemic center of Wuhan) was very strongly affected by COVID-19 and the Chinese authorities have largely closed down production in the region, but schools and universities across the whole region have also undertaken quarantine measures. Authorities in China have closed down production in several regions which implies that firms in Europe, the US and Asia face a shortage of intermediate inputs from China; negative demand effects in China and in other countries could also be observed. Sales of cars fell in February 2020 by about 80% compared to the previous month before which clearly indicates a case of a strong negative sectoral demand shock. One key intermediate export of China are computer chips which are imported by companies in the US, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia and Africa. The first sector facing a reduction in production after Chinese export slowdown will be computer and mobile phone producers as well as producers of modern screens. In a second round of supply-chain transmissions, digital service providers would obviously have to slow down planned expansion of such services and this in turn would reduce productivity growth in OECD countries and Newly Industrialized Countries. If Chinese firms can restore production capacity rather quickly, the negative supply-side effects for other countries should be rather modest, but if there is a second wave of COVID-19 in China, the global supply side shock of COVID-19 could be rather big. Taking into account the digital productivity slow-down in the world economy this shock would come on top of sectoral declines in tourism and logistics. As regards the response from International Organizations and multinational firms to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, they typically recalled international personnel located in Beijing (and other Chinese centers) home in early and mid-February. European, American as well as Japanese firms in many cases followed the example of international organizations; those coming back to EU28 countries or the US were expected to implement a 14 days self-isolation in home quarantine. While many observers of the COVID-19 epidemic – and politicians in the US, the EU and China/Japan/Republic of Korea - raise questions related to national health system challenges, there is not much awareness that the novel coronavirus with its potential as a worldwide epidemic (a pandemic) concerns a global public evil; and fighting the virus in these and other countries stands for a global public good. It is obvious that fighting a global public evil requires cooperation among the leading economies and in the relevant international organizations (e.g. the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, UNHCR – in the case of refugees). In this perspective, the fact that the world’s global technological leader, the United States, is governed by the Trump Administration which refutes multilateralism might become a serious problem. Fighting a pandemic is a global public good and if there are considerable political free rider problems, or simply political inconsistencies and inefficiencies in major OECD countries, the fight against the global epidemic will be not really successful. This in turn implies that many more lives could be lost than in the case of efficient and effective global cooperation. The fact that the world economy is facing the challenge of COVID-19 as a global problem in early 2020 could mean that the world economy is facing an instability problem, namely to the extent that the output decline in 2020/21 will seriously affect more than one half of the world economy: The disease emerged in China, standing for about 17.5% of world real income and thus a bit more than the US and the EU28 with each representing 16.5% in 2018 (PPP figures according to the World Bank). If national and international epidemic shocks translate into a serious economic slowdown in China in 2020, it will automatically have major negative international spillovers to the EU and the US and from these two actors there will be a strong negative repercussion effect on China. In short, a COVID-19 pandemic in the new world economy of triadic interdependency EU-US-China, requires enhanced international cooperation and multilateralism; but the Trump Administration is emphasizing bilateralism which means that the efficiency of OECD countries+China fiscal/monetary policy cannot be efficient. This in turn makes fighting the pandemic more difficult since an economic downturn in the global North would undermine economic stability and prosperity in the global South which implies that the problem of insufficient resources in the health sector of developing countries would be reinforced. The very nature of a pandemic is, however, such that the South of the world economy could be directly affected by the COVID-19 shock, and relatively poor countries – with rather weak public health systems – could face massive problems in dealing with the health care challenges as well as with the economic effects from this shock. If the G20 countries would, in the end, face a simultaneous COVID-19 problem – outside China the peak of the pandemic may still be expected to occur only in summer 2020 (and possibly a second wave in autumn 2020 or thereafter) – there could be a global recession, as the G20 stands for 81% of global GDP. If the diffusion of COVID-19 can be stopped rather quickly, there is no major reason to worry with respect to the output and job development in the world economy, but if the pandemic should go on until 2021 or even beyond, there could emerge a very serious global stability problem. Given the pandemic and the likely size of the economic shock in sectors such as tourism and logistics – plus economic multiplier effects - policymakers should potentially be rather concerned in North America, Europa, Asia and other regions of the world economy. Moreover, as regards the EU27/Eurozone and the US it will be interesting to take a closer look at the one sector which is directly exposed to the pandemic, namely the health care sector. The size and characteristic of that sector in the EU and the US clearly justifies the argument that this is a systemically relevant sector. To the extent that the health care sector and the economy – with health insurance linked to firms in the US – are characterized by inefficiencies, the COVID-19 challenge will reveal those inefficiencies to a considerable extent. If there is a person with a suspected infection, a test is typically necessary and if the result of that test is positive, the respective person must stay in quarantine at home or go to hospital. If patients exhibit a serious reaction to COVID-19, they will typically be taken care of as in-patients in hospitals where strict quarantine conditions and protective measures for the people working there are necessary. The US Congress has appropriated an extra $8 billion in early March to increase the health care budget in the context of COVID-19 cases. Italy has introduced an additional package to the value of €7 billion in an extra budget on March 5, 2020, in order to fight the challenge posed by the virus. Additional fiscal packages were adopted in mid-March in the US, Germany, France and Italy. The very high mortality rate in Italy in early 2020 suggests that the number of infected people in Italy has been underestimated. This raises questions about the quality of the Italian health system and health policy in Italy, respectively. On March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a lockdown on the whole country, while Austria a week later had signaled that it wants to restrict free travel between Italy and Austria (which are both Schengen area countries). By March 17, most EU countries had imposed new border control measures which were supposed to control and restrict travelling of people across borders in the EU as a means to reduce the corona virus infection rate. However, an economically serious side effect was that long queues of trucks at many borders soon occurred which inevitably was bound to undermine just-in-time production in the automotive industry in most EU countries. It is quite unclear why the new border controls were not installed in such a way that the supply-side chains in the EU single market were not seriously disrupted: The avoidable massive slow-down of truck-based logistics in the EU amounts to a grave delivery risk for automotive firms whose temporary closing is thereby caused (plus the impulse of reduced demand). This part of the economic recession risk facing the EU should and could have been avoided by coordinated efficient policies of EU countries. There is a high probability that this effect will bring a higher economic burden related to the COVID-19 crisis for the EU countries compared to the United States where such problems do not exist. Employees of firms in many countries have cancelled planned meetings in Italy and tourism in Italy is also bound to suffer considerably in 2020. As regards German and French car producers, as well as producers of machinery and equipment in Germany and France, firms in both countries partly rely on intermediate inputs from Italy so that distortions of relevant production in Italy will also slow down industrial output in Germany and France. This situation will, of course, encourage firms to seek alternative intermediate product suppliers. As regards a comparison of the US and the EU, European firms are more dependent on international intermediate inputs than firms in the US (Welfens and Irawan 2014). A general problem for the US, the EU, China and all other countries with novel coronavirus problems is that vaccination against the COVID-19 will probably not be available at short notice. International investors have responded to the COVID-19 shock: Stock market prices have declined steeply in mid-March and are likely to further fall in the medium term. The very fact that there is a pandemic means that almost all countries in the world economy will face similar problems: Supply-side distortions, demand shocks and liquidity problems faced by firms and millions of self-employed. This makes the corona virus economic crisis potentially worse than the 2008/09 Transatlantic Banking Crisis. However, due to many reforms in banking regulation and institutional innovations undertaken since that crisis, the western world is better prepared for an international shock than it was in late 2008. Moreover, there is some probability that once the infection wave can be stopped – after a few quarters (or possibly after two years) – there will be a quick economic recovery. The potential for supply disruptions is, however, considerable since global value-added chains have strongly evolved in certain sectors since the 1990s. As regards the US, the Eurozone/UK and China, there is one specific distinction concerning the western world (e.g. US+Eurozone+UK + Switzerland) versus China, namely that safe haven effects can be expected in a period of an international epidemic – indeed in favor of the US and main Eurozone countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria; plus the UK and Switzerland. These countries should benefit from lower nominal and real interest rates, but should also face a nominal and real appreciation of the currency. The following section considers the SARS experience briefly and emphasizes that certain characteristics of the health systems of the US and EU countries have crucial macroeconomic effects that have thus far not been thoroughly considered in Economics. Section 3 considers a cross country regression with the Global Health Security Index as an explanatory variable for per capita GDP. Section 4 is devoted to theoretical macroeconomic aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic, while Section 5 considers some financial market aspects. Section 6 briefly considers political economy aspects in the western world, while Section 7 provides a growth modelling approach which looks at more long-term issues of an epidemic. The final section considers implications for policymakers. The following analysis puts the analytical focus on some new theoretical perspectives which should be useful for the understanding of the coronavirus related economic dynamics and potential policy responses.",33

As a customs union, the European Union (EU) is – in terms of its institutional framework - most similar to Mercosur, but in economic terms there is a considerable similarity to the ASEAN countries which have decided to start an ASEAN single market in 2019. EU integration has been a successful long-term project over many decades – the number of member countries increased over half a century from the initial grouping of six countries to 28 countries, but 2016 became a historical watershed year as the United Kingdom held a referendum on continued EU membership and a narrow majority voted in favor of leaving the EU, much to the surprise of most British experts, the European Commission and the European Parliament - as well as the German and French governments. For the first time in the history of EU integration, a majority within a member country had refused continued EU membership and this, in a large European economy, is a shock event not just for the European Union but also raises new questions in other regional integration areas. ASEAN is a rather dynamic integration group which has partly been inspired by the integration history in Europe on the one hand, but on the other hand there has also been growing economic linkages between the EU and ASEAN. While it is true that ASEAN currently has less institutional integration than the European Union, the growing group of ASEAN countries also stands for a regional integration success story and its ability to initiate is own regional single market – with the same four freedoms as in the EU’s single market project starting in 1993 – has been remarkable. To what extent ASEAN will be able to maintain a low profile institutional setting remains to be seen in the new world economy with US anti-multilateralism and rising US-China economic and political rivalry. While the rising number of integration projects in the world economy and an increase in the number of countries active in regional integration schemes have suggested that regional integration is a strong pillar of both economic integration, globalization and multilateralism, 2016 became a critical historical watershed marker for another reason: The rather surprising majority of Donald Trump in the US presidential elections that year is the fifth case – out of the 45 presidents of the United States thus far - where the label of populism seems to be appropriate and this populist president declared during the election campaign in 2016 that he favored bilateralism over multilateralism, i.e., the international governance structures based largely on internationally accepted rules and international organizations. There is a natural tension between regional integration schemes, which themselves use complex treaties involving many countries at the same time, and the bilateralist approach which typically favors privileged interaction amongst large economies and also an undermining of global international organizations. Under President Trump, the World Trade Organization is an obvious target of the anti-multilateralism pervasive in the White House. In the period of such complex international changes, the coronavirus shocks – namely both a public health and an economic shock – in particular have hit the world economy in 2020 and pose new challenges for regional integration clubs, such as the EU and ASEAN (and others), and the wider global economy. The following contributions look into EU and ASEAN economic and political dynamics – with a deliberate interdisciplinary focus (from economists, a historian and political scientists) in this special issue. Most papers presented here have been extensively discussed at workshops at both Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok in 2018 and at an international conference which was hosted by Chulalongkorn University, the EIIW/University of Wuppertal and the European Commission in Brussels in 2019. The first paper is by Paul JJ Welfens and takes a look at “Trump’s Trade Policy, BREXIT, Corona Dynamics, EU Crisis and Declining Multilateralism”. This broad and deep analysis of integration developments in the EU, contradictory US trade policy and the unfolding of the corona shocks in Asia, Europe and the US (and the world economy) show a critical overlap of international economic challenges; including critical points of post-BREXIT EU integration dynamics where serious risks in terms of a potential new Euro Crisis are identified. The newly developed formula of optimum import tariffs in open economies with outward foreign direct investment gives crucial insights on the non-optimality of both US and UK tariff policy under populist political leaders. As regards the risk of new Euro Crisis, and potential further disintegration of the EU, critical questions are raised with respect to EU and EU member countries’ fiscal policies and the lack of institutional reforms. The weakening of multilateralism by the Trump Administration has dealt a serious blow to the global set of rules and the question arises as to what political pattern possibly could replace the historical US leadership over the 1944–2016 period. One new option could be a networked leadership shared between regional integration clubs. Andrew Crozier raises key topics and issues of British policy in a broader historical context and thus can also give the reader a broader perspective on BREXIT. His contribution “British Exceptionalism: Pride and Prejudice and Brexit” puts a focus back on the period when it developed its classic form in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. During the nineteenth century, the British state concentrated on the creation of a global empire and by the 1890s was in a state of ‘splendid isolation’ with respect to Europe. Simultaneously, the rise of Germany meant that Britain could not ignore Europe entirely. During the first half of the twentieth century, Britain became involved in two major wars, which to a considerable extent revolved around the need to curb German power. After the First World War, Britain wanted to focus once again upon her global interests and this was reflected in her reluctance to embrace integrationist initiatives such as the Briand Plan. Although the Second World War destroyed the basis of Britain’s Empire, the feeling that British superiority had saved the world only reinforced the sense of exceptionalism by adding to it a sense of ‘pride’. After 1945, British power steadily waned and the British state increasingly came under pressure from Washington to join the European Economic Community. The potential of Germany to dominate this grouping and British apprehension of such a development led to ‘prejudice’ in respect of Germany which later translated itself into prejudice against Europe as a whole. Once inside the European Community, Britain accordingly became somewhat of an awkward partner. Never entirely comfortable within the EU, a secessionist movement grew which ultimately forced the referendum of 2016, the result of which came as a surprise to many observers in Europe and beyond. It is rather unclear whether or not the United Kingdom can easily be stabilized in economic and political terms post-BREXIT. Rolf J. Langhammer and Suthiphand Chirathivat discuss “ASEAN and the EU Challenged by “Divide and Rule” Strategies of the US and China: Evidence and Possible Reactions”. The United States and China, both global superpowers, have launched attacks upon the coherence of ASEAN and the EU by offering individual member states privileges if they depart from common policies of the two integration schemes. Key motives behind those offers and the ways they are addressed to the member states are reflected upon by the authors who consider such “divide and rule” policies as serious challenges to the collective bargaining power of ASEAN and the EU, respectively. Moreover, strategies to counter these challenges are discussed. For both China and the US, the authors see economic and political targets as the key elements of motivation. Economically, each of the two countries wants to gain superiority in paving freeways for their suppliers of technology, goods and services to the markets of the two schemes against the competitive pressure of the other country. Politically, the two integration schemes have become contested areas in the geopolitical struggles between the two countries. For the EU, as the more advanced scheme of deep integration, the paper recommends a closer convergence between EU policies and the demand of the electorate, to prefer more cooperation projects over deeper integration steps, and to motivate the private sector, in particular higher FDI inflows and options to include foreign investors, in order to stand up against “divide and rule” strategies. Strengthening ASEAN integration through the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade within ASEAN is crucial. Ajaree Tavornmas and Kasira Cheeppensook consider topics and issues of international ocean governance with respect to links between the EU and Thailand/ASEAN. The authors’ contribution is titled “Shaping Ocean Governance: A Study of EU Normative Power on Thailand’s Sustainable Fisheries”. The EU has long been championing an agenda for better ocean governance based on a cross-sectoral, rules-based, international approach and indicated its role as a strong global actor in this field early on. The European Union, as reflected through the strategies it has adopted during the last decade (2005–2015), aims to shape international ocean governance on the basis of its experience in developing a sustainable and ethical approach to ocean management, notably through its environment policy and regulatory regime. This paper observes a significant transition of EU internal policy towards a more externally-oriented one, as well as its ambition in exporting EU norms to third countries. It seems that the EU aims to lead this maritime and fisheries domain as a global actor, diffusing norms via interstate relations. The case study of EU policy towards Thailand’s fisheries policy, resulting in Thailand’s adoption of a sustainable fisheries policy in 2015, is explored in this research paper. In addition, the paper aims to analyze the development and evolution of Thailand’s sustainable fisheries policy during 2015–2019 and to examine the rationale behind Thailand’s shift towards a more environmentally- and socially-friendly fisheries policy. It is quite important to understand how the EU tries to export its standards (as an EU28 country group) to other parts of the world economy. Ocean governance could become increasingly important over time. Infrastructure is a new key field of global economic rivalry and indeed it has also become an important topic for regional economic development. China, Japan and the EU have become active here in the global economy, but their strategies are rather different as emphasized by Werner Pascha who highlights analytically these crucial developments in his paper “The Quest for Infrastructure Development from a “market creation” perspective: China’s “Belt and Road”, Japan’s “Quality Infrastructure” and the EU’s “Connecting Europe and Asia””. Pascha puts the focus on some key analytical points related to the public good aspects of modern infrastructure – an analysis which has been partly neglected in the Economics literature on infrastructure investment projects. The paper deals with the interplay of major international infrastructure initiatives, in particular China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Japan’s Partnership for Quality Infrastructure and the EU’s strategy on “Connecting Europe and Asia”. Their co-evolution is interpreted as the creation and further development of a new market, whose characteristics, like its complexity, its properties as an international public good and its oligopolistic supply structure, create interesting insights. The paper finds that the initiatives have adjusted to each other, in line with expectations from a market perspective. While China’s initiative at first followed a “low-price” strategy, Japan reacted with a “quality infrastructure” approach, also winning support from multilateral fora such as the G7 and G20. Gaining a deeper insight into the international contest between China, Japan and the EU is crucial to understanding international economic relations and some limitations to international cooperation stemming from new rivalries. Evelyn S. Devadason and Shujaat Mubarik consider the links between the European Union and ASEAN in the field of trade. The title of their paper is “ASEAN and the EU: An Assessment of Interregional Trade Potentials”. Though negotiations on an Association of Southeast Asian Nations – European Union (ASEAN-EU) trade agreement began in 2007, the region-wide agreement stalled, and the EU has since pursued bilateral agreements with individual ASEAN member states (AMS). Nevertheless, the goal of forming an interregional agreement remains as the European Commission and the AMS are currently participating in a stocktaking exercise to explore the prospects towards the resumption of region-to-region negotiations. In this paper, a stochastic frontier specification of the gravity model is employed to identify and compare the performance (efficiency) of exports relative to the maximum export levels for the ASEAN-EU partnership. The findings, based on a panel dataset of two-way bilateral exports between the ASEAN10 and the EU28 over the 2000–2016 period, indicate a low-level of export efficiency. It seems that there is considerable room for higher EU-ASEAN trade in the future, possibly with digital services becoming a new growing field in the long run. With BREXIT, the smaller EU27 will be quite interested in both maintaining and expanding trade with ASEAN, but the UK in turn will also be quite eager to witness UK-ASEAN trade creation in the context of new FTA treaties to be concluded after January 31st 2020. Economic analysis is often useful for understanding key elements of regional integration and inter-regional cooperation, but in many cases a political science perspective is an indispensable corner stone for a broader understanding of complex international dynamics. Julie Gilson’s contribution “EU-ASEAN Relations in the 2020s Pragmatic Inter-Regionalism?” indeed sheds new light on the relevant issues. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the world witnessed a proliferation of region-to-region institutional frameworks. There was a recognition that scale and leverage could create an advantage for economic relations, that security could benefit from cross-regional dialogue and initiatives, and that some of the many global challenges, from global climate change to resource depletion, could be addressed more effectively at regional and even inter-regional levels. The EU-ASEAN dialogue itself presents an important model for inter-regional cooperation at the heart of these tangled institutional webs. This analytical perspective assesses the ways in which the changing multilateral landscape and intra-regional crises within ASEAN and the EU have altered the relevance of inter-regional dialogue and initiatives. It becomes clear that an innovative EU27 international cooperation approach should take a broader approach than the current, rather slow, EU-ASEAN cooperation. China’s new military strength has become visible in many fields – certainly in the South China Sea region with localized conflicts involving various countries. Kasira Cheeppensook takes a fresh look at the issues. She analyzes “ASEAN in the South China Sea conflict, 2012–2018: A lesson in conflict transformation from normative power Europe”. For decades, overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea have had a destabilizing effect in East and Southeast Asia, with broader implications beyond the region. Four ASEAN countries (Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam) are direct claimants in the South China Sea conflict. ASEAN’s role, as a regional organization, in facilitating peaceful resolution of these claims and maintaining stability is challenging because the conflict presents potentially divisive rifts amongst ASEAN members themselves. This paper explores ASEAN’s role in managing the South China Sea conflict by examining the actions of two non-claimant states which functioned as country coordinators for ASEAN–China relations from 2012 to 2018: Thailand and Singapore. The efforts of these two countries as honest political brokers shed new light on how ASEAN can deal with this ongoing crisis so as to ensure the organization’s ongoing effectiveness and sustain regional harmony. Under the Normative Power Europe framework, the roles of non-claimants are explored in the regional conflict transformation process. The EU integration club has for many years tried to exert normative power in various regions of the world. Natthanan Kunnamas’ contribution “Normative Power Europe, ASEAN and Thailand” takes a closer look at both the EU and ASEAN in general and in particular at the role of Thailand in this important context. Recognizing the state of political, democratic, and humanitarian problems in ASEAN, as well as the existence of a stumbling block for the two regional organizations’ relations - regarding human rights, the European Union has opted for a more pragmatic approach in two ways: firstly, by addressing a wide range of developmental issues and agendas in ASEAN political, economic, and socio-cultural cooperation; secondly, by implementing an adaptative policy to focus more on a region-to-state approach through development aid packages, and by fostering agreements of cooperation, especially with Thailand, a country case study. With different levels of leverage possessed by the EU on the region-to-region versus region-to-state platform, it has become clear that the EU’s normative pressure directed specifically toward Thailand yields a more desirable result than what it achieves with respect to ASEAN. The pressure by the EU to make Thailand conform to a set of values, i.e., liberty, democratic elections, freedom of expression, just and fair trade has, at times, generated certain challenges in the relations between the two parties, particularly during the period of military junta rule between May 2014 and July 2019. The analysis, therefore, evaluates whether bilateral relations between the EU and Thailand contribute to the EU’s normative aims using Ian Manners’ Normative Power Europe (NPE) concept to assess the extent to which the European Commission could exert normative pressures contributing to changes in Thailand through four examples, namely calls for vox populi elections and the protection of human rights, the campaign for the abolition of capital punishment, a ban on illegal fishing, and the implementation of EU-style emission trading schemes (ETS). ETS has become an increasingly important field of both national economic policy and climate policies with its global dimension and thus deserves particular attention. There is a long history of EU-ASEAN cooperation, at least in the decades after the EU had effectively concluded trade integration. Marissa Maricosa Acierto Paderon takes a closer look at cooperation dynamics and perspectives under the heading “Opportunities in ASEAN-EU Economic Cooperation”. The European Union has been a dialogue partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations since 1977. This dialogue partnership was institutionalized with the signing of the ASEAN-EEC Cooperation Agreement on 7 March 1980. Since that agreement, EU-ASEAN dialogue relations have grown and expanded in both scope and depth. From the limited issues of trade, investment and development cooperation, its partnership has extended to social and cultural affairs; and political and security dialogue. The findings indicate that the ASEAN and EU are ‘natural trading partners’ and should pursue a region-to-region FTA. Institutional diversities in the ASEAN region as well as the BREXIT stress-test for the EU27 and Europe, respectively, have created a complex international setting for the near future. With the overlap of regional dynamics, the US-China conflict and the corona shock affecting the world economy, adjustment options have narrowed at least for a few years and in both the EU and ASEAN – as well as in other integration areas – new reflections will emerge about the economic and political benefits, but also risks, of regional integration and networked international cooperation. While many voters in certain democracies – hardest hit by the public health and economic shocks of the coronavirus pandemic – might translate the shocks into long-term political frustration, there is also new economic pressure for more international benchmarking as certain countries have coped relatively successfully with the corona shocks and previous economic or political shocks. ASEAN countries show a rather favorable record in 2020 – compared to parts of the EU – which might be considered as a signal that a large share of the institutional capital in the region is working and valuable where the accumulation of said capital has, of course, taken place over decades. One cannot overlook that the US-Sino trade conflicts will raise new questions in Europe and Asia. We greatly appreciate the support of the the European Institute for International Economic Relations (EIIW/University of Wuppertal) and Chulalongkorn University in relation to the two workshops; the hospitality of the European Commission in Brussels is also much appreciated. Finally, the organizational and editorial support of our staff in Bangkok and Wuppertal is also recognized. European-Asian intellectual cooperation will hopefully continue on an even broader basis in the future and the interdisciplinary overlap of the fields of Economics, History and Political Science should be fruitful for understanding new critical future challenges as well.

17.0,3.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,01 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-020-00479-x,"Trump’s Trade Policy, BREXIT, Corona Dynamics, EU Crisis and Declining Multilateralism",July 2020,Paul J. J. Welfens,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The world economy has greatly changed since the end of the Cold War – the rise of China since the 1980s, the expansion of the digital economy worldwide since the 1990s, and a rising wave of populism and the declining political cohesion of the Western world since 2016 are visible as new traits of the new global order, while systemic competition among Western countries and the role of climate policy at a global scale has been reinforced; at the same time, multilateralism and the role of International Organizations, respectively, seem to have weakened. While in the EU significant political focus has been placed on the rise of China, the perception of the parallel rise of the ASEAN group, has been rather modest even though at the end of 2015 the ASEAN countries have embraced the start of an ASEAN single market and ASEAN will naturally also become a more important partner for the EU if US-Sino politico-economic conflicts should increase over time. While the US and China signed a first trade agreement in January 2020, its implementation is rather doubtful since the coronavirus shock has brought about a truly global recession – with output falling more than in the Transatlantic Banking Crisis of 2008. The Corona World Recession takes place in a strange setting, namely with China being a key part of an international economic crisis for the first time, while the traditional leadership which was present in every international crisis since 1945 is not visible at all: President Donald Trump, as a populist leader, is neither willing nor able to exert US leadership and this in turn is a new political shock to the Western world as will be argued subsequently. The whole of the Western world is currently weakened, as not only is the US showing no leadership, but 2020 is also the year in which the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the United Kingdom intends to proudly implement a BREXIT project which is inflicting massive economic costs on both the UK and the EU27; the UK’s performance – under the Johnson government - in fighting the Corona Pandemic is remarkably weak (the situation in the US is not any better, as more than 110,000 COVID-19 related death cases reveals a weak position for the world’s superpower in mid-2020). In Brussels, the Juncker Commission did not understand the challenge of the British EU referendum of 2016 and it is unclear whether the von der Leyen Commission will be able to keep the EU27 together in the face of a difficult COVID-19 public health and economic shock in 2020 – EU policies suggested by mid-2020 were indeed not likely to be adequate to avoid a new Euro Crisis 2 which will become acute once Italy should lose its investor grade ratings. Such downgrading in OECD countries is likely in a transatlantic environment in which the Trump Administration’s decisions set the course for a raising of the debt-GDP ratio from 100% in 2019 to about 160% in 2025. A global recession means that many multinational companies will face much lower domestic sales. This in turn brings negative international investment and sales spillovers, if one is to follow recent analysis on the topic of international MNC supply-side spillovers (Cravino and Levchenko 2017). There are additional MNC spillovers in the Corona World Recession as intermediate product trade has been hampered by the introduction of new border controls and explicit new protectionism – including export barriers - in the first half of 2020: according to the University of St. Gallen database on protectionism, 75 countries have introduced barriers to the export of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and epidemic-related equipment in early 2020 (FT, 2020). The Trump Administration has tried to promote exports in 2017–2020, partly through a special tax reform, and by threatening to impose import tariffs it has tried to promote inward FDI flows from OECD countries in a rather artificial way. By contrast, the US has tried to discourage Chinese FDI inflows and to limit, through new export barriers, international technology flows from the US to China. The US-Sino trade conflict involves the world’s leading two economies and therefore is bound to have negative spillovers affecting the rest of the world which has not yet adjusted to the new global regime of the global interdependency of big economies. ASEAN countries face enhanced competition for Western countries’ and China’s economic influence in the medium term; once the Corona World Recession has been overcome. The global economic picture is rather complex since 2016 and not enough analysis is available thus far to cover the new challenges. The following reflections will contribute several new thoughts, both related to theoretical and institutional analysis – in the end, one gets a post-corona picture of the world economy which suggests that more political instability, less regional integration and a weakening of Western democracies could be a key impact of the dynamics since about 2005; the extent to which fading US leadership could be replaced by a new networked approach can be discussed only in a first approach where EU-ASEAN cooperation could play a key role under certain circumstances. A crucial theoretical contribution will highlight the optimum tariff literature where one can show that the traditional result is not valid if there is outward cumulated foreign direct investment – and, in this perspective, the Trump Administration’s import tax rates imposed on China are all likely to be too high (assuming that this administration uses the traditional optimum tariff literature). That the Western world’s leading economy has no trade experts in government which would have noticed this analytical problem tells its own story. ASEAN countries could benefit from rising US, British, EU and Chinese foreign direct investment inflows. This would encourage broader human capital formation and R&D capital accumulation plus the dynamics of the ASEAN single market, the perspectives for closer EU-ASEAN economic relations and political cooperation could become more important. Part of China’s investment in the land-based and the maritime new silk roads could also stimulate more EU-ASEAN trade. Moreover, with digital progress rising in the corona crisis, and expected to remain high worldwide in a post-corona setting, the EU’s interest in ASEAN digital economic capabilities – which are particularly strong, for example, in Singapore, Malaysia, parts of Indonesia and Thailand – could be reinforced. The corona epidemic has changed the picture of international economic relations; the US-Sino trade conflict has intensified even more and ASEAN countries will have to consider what BREXIT – the UK’s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020 – means for both the relations with the EU and with the UK. The May government had already pushed for new free trade treaties with ASEAN countries, but these refused to negotiate and wanted to know not only the final date of BREXIT implementation but also how the EU27-UK treaty regarding the future relationship would look. While the new Johnson government has announced that the negotiations with the EU will have to be finalized by the end of 2020 – even though the corona shock has now made the picture more complex – the European Union might not be inclined to soften its position since, in mid-2020, the re-election of Donald Trump looks not to be very likely. ASEAN countries will have to wait at least until 2021 to see what type of UK-EU27 trade treaty will be on the table. The November 2020 US presidential election is a crucial element in the EU-UK negotiations. Without the populist US President Trump, the British negotiation position vis-à-vis the EU would be rather weak. There is no doubt, however, that the UK will seek to get favorable trade deals with ASEAN countries so that a new UK-EU rivalry will characterize EU-ASEAN relations in the future. As regards the UK’s international reputation, there is a negative development in the course of the corona epidemic which shows that the UK’s health system and the government’s health policy are rather weak: More than 40,000 COVID-19 deaths are a shocking indicator, compared to the 9000 COVID-19 deaths in Germany in mid-June 2020; other EU countries such as Italy, Spain and Belgium – each with rather weak coalition governments – also show high COVID-19 fatality ratios. If the political reaction pattern identified by Aksoy et al. (2020) for the case of epidemic shocks holds in the coronavirus pandemic, there will be negative political scars for about two decades in those (and other) countries and possibly a weakening of democracy. What will be the effects on the EU as well as the US, China, ASEAN and other countries, how will international cooperation in key policy fields be affected? In economic terms, many ASEAN countries may be expected to come close to the per capita income position of the eastern European EU countries by 2030. It is interesting to note that several ASEAN countries have achieved per capita income positions that are close to or above that of Bulgaria and Romania in 2018 (see Fig. 1 and 2). Narrowing per capita income differences imply better prospects for political cooperation as political preferences become more similar. Per Capita Income in the EU Countries and in Selected ASEAN Countries. Source: own representation of data from the World Development Indicators Trump Complaint Box. Source: Own representation using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Preliminary Estimates of U.S. International Transactions, March 2019 2016 represents an historical watershed moment for the Western world as the EU faced the first rejection of membership from an existing EU country, namely the UK, with its majority in a referendum for BREXIT, and since the US has voted for a populist president – Donald Trump - who has started to change the global institutional setting and to embark upon an aggressive trade policy soon after he had already refused to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP; negotiations concluded under President Obama) with eleven partner countries, including Australia and Japan. Trump also did not continue negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) which was a US-EU deep integration project for more transatlantic free trade – with a strong focus also on an international investment treaty. As regards China, the Trump Administration is particularly dissatisfied since there are issues both in the field of trade as well as in the area of foreign direct investment (FDI) and intellectual property rights. The demise of the socialist systems in Eastern Europe in the late 1990s and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 initially contributed to a reinforcement of the World Market Economy, not least since China and the then new Russia joined the World Trade Organization and due to the process of EU Eastern enlargement and ASEAN integration deepening, while the TTIP and TPP negotiations seemed to indicate a stronger regional integration and global integration dynamics. However, the declining external pressure on the EU after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the imperfect monetary integration in the EU have brought about a weakening of EU integration and this, along with the rise of China as the world’s No. 1 exporter, has destabilized EU integration as well as the US whose expansion was dampened by the Eurozone crisis. The latter also faced a massive decline of the income share of the lower half of the US income pyramid since the 1980s – this can be shown to be a driver of US structural populism which means that even if President Trump should not be re-elected in November 2020, there remains significant pressure in the US for political populism which is a totally new Western world and which certainly presents a major challenge for Europe: Trust in US politico-economic stability could decline dramatically in the decade after 2016. Issues of political risk – so far familiar from some Latin American countries – could become a regular issue in Western OECD countries and this could include EU countries and the UK, as will be argued subsequently. Trump’s presidential election victory owes much to a high share of votes from relatively poor households and unskilled workers, respectively. For decades, the latter could earn relatively high wages in the manufacturing industry, but with high productivity growth and a rather slow growth of domestic demand for industrial goods, the share of workers with no college degree in overall manufacturing employment in the US has clearly declined over time (Lawrence 2017). China’s rising exports to OECD countries might have contributed to mounting dissatisfaction among workers in both the USA and the UK since the export of Chinese industrial goods contributes to wage polarization there as it does in many other industrialized countries (see the OECD study by Breemersch et al. 2017). The economic relations of the US with China again played a major role in the corona crisis as the coronavirus pandemic seems to have started in the Chinese province of Hubei in late 2019. As a by-product of the international epidemic, the Corona World Recession emerged in 2020 and this also caused conflicts with China at the World Health Organization (WHO) - which President Trump announced the US would leave in late May 2020 so that another cornerstone of multilateralism was about be massively weakened; in this case by the largest financial contributor amongst member countries, namely the United States. The WHO is an unusual organization since only about 20% of its budget comes from member countries’ standard contributions, the rest is from private foundations as well as additional contributions by various member states; in the case of China, the Chinese government had announced in 2020 that China’s contribution would be raised by a one-off increase of two billion dollars. The Trump Administration had argued that the US’ poor response in the Corona Crisis was largely due to China not communicating early on its insights about a new epidemic in late 2019 – and that the WHO had been too uncritical of China, indeed the WHO pointed out that the Chinese epidemic policy was a great success story. In the decades since 1995, the world economy has moved towards more economic integration and in parallel – since about 1985 when foreign direct investment has increased strongly – towards more economic globalization. As China had opened up in 1978, Asian economic dynamics strongly increased. It is remarkable that the rise of the Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs: Taiwan, Republic of Korea and Hong Kong plus some ASEAN countries, prominently including Singapore) indeed had contributed to the crisis of socialist Eastern European countries which were forced to export higher volumes of export goods - in a context of more competitive international markets and rising high quality exports from NICs – in order to get the required volume of import goods in the 1980s (Welfens 1992). Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and its bloc in Eastern Europe, the Western world has expanded as a globalizing market economy: 29 transforming economies have integrated into the world economy and finally Russia became a member country of the World Trade Organizations in 2012, eleven years after China’s membership. Until 2016, the world economy seemed to make progress with further trade and investment liberalization; the EU and the United States, for example, wanted to conclude a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) under the Administration of President Obama, but this project could not be finished; to same extent due to the lackluster commitment of Germany and France both of which did not attach strategic value to this project – governments in both countries faced some resistance against the envisaged TTIP in parts of society, but the government in Germany was particularly hesitant to explain the benefits for Germany and the EU, respectively; the investment protection issue was also greatly emphasized by opponents in several EU countries. Meanwhile the Obama Administration had concluded the Trans-Pacific-Partnership (TPP) agreement which had even brought Japan on board in the final stages of negotiations. At least – with many political problems faced before the conclusion of the treaty - the EU was able to conclude a partnership agreement with Canada (“CETA”) which later became a potential benchmark for the question of how the EU27 and the UK, leaving on January 31st 2020, on the basis of the 2016 British EU referendum, could organize their future relations. With the British EU referendum of 2016, which rather surprisingly brought a majority for BREXIT and the election of the populist US President Trump in November of that year, the Western-led era of globalization seems to have come to a pause. To the extent that BREXIT means less liberal trade between the UK and the EU27 after the transition period until the end of 2020 – until then the UK remains in the EU single market – and to the extent that the Trump Administration is clearly pursuing a rather protectionist trade policy agenda, the two historically leading Western countries in terms of free trade have changed their position dramatically. Given the considerable EU-UK integration benefits, achieved over more than 46 years of EU membership, one might consider BREXIT to be a rather strange decision in economic terms; and it is so indeed, if one follows the arguments spelled out the Treasury’s report on British benefits of EU membership (HM Government 2016) which was published in April 2016 and suggested that a hard BREXIT – the UK leaving the EU without a free trade agreement – could bring an economic loss of 7 to 10% of GDP. However, the old economic and political elites, nearly all of whom had recommended Remain as a decision in the referendum, had lost much credibility in both the US and the UK in the years of the Transatlantic Banking Crisis 2008/09 which was marked by a sharp economic output contraction in 2009 in Western OECD countries and clearly showed a new vulnerability of both the US and UK as well as some other EU countries. The Euro Crisis of 2010–2014 – involving mainly Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and at some point Spain – brought a rather slow economic recovery in the Eurozone where Italy’s growth problems were exacerbated in the context of that crisis and even a populist coalition government which came to power in 2018 (the first Conte government of 2018/19 had two populist parties on board, the second Conte government of 2019 still had the left-wing MoVimento 5 Stelle Party in government while the right-wing Lega Party had left the coalition); Italy could be understood almost as a first political warning signal concerning US spillovers following the election of the populist President Trump in late 2016. Populism means nationalism and protectionism and therefore undermines regional integration and economic globalization (Welfens 2019a). A populist president in the US is a shock to the world economy. The US had turned its economic attention to China and Asia since the beginning of the twenty-first century and President Obama was indeed offering TTIP as a political project to the EU because EU countries felt disappointed about the US push for TTP and thus more emphasis on Asian-US economic relations. Obama’s successor, Donald Trump, adopted a populist political and trade policy agenda and decided to pull the US out from TTP leaving Japan in a surprising lead situation for a country which had itself only joined the negotiation process rather late. The reason for Trump’s political success in the presidential election of 2016, coming also as a surprise for most observers in the US at that time, brought a radical change for the US and its Western allies: The EU countries no longer received political support from the US and indeed witnessed Trump publicly supporting the BREXIT project. From a standard economic perspective, BREXIT was bound to economically weaken both its NATO ally UK and the large group of NATO member countries in the EU27; this normally would not be in the interest of the United States, but the populist President Trump ignored standard economic wisdom and indeed often did not want to listen to his leading experts; Kevin Hassett, for example, left his position as the chief of the Council of Economic Advisors in 2019. Trump’s Administration also embarked upon an ongoing US-Sino trade conflict and Trump even sought conflicts with European countries which had been traditional partners: by pulling out of the TTIP negotiations and by imposing import tariffs for aluminum and steel as well as other products. Moreover, the Trump Administration suffered from the particular problem of a lack of competence as only three-quarters of vacant positions left by political appointees of the Obama Administration had been filled by Trump. This makes it almost impossible to coordinate the US and its western allies in the situation of an international economic crisis – the IMF, for example, would not really know with whom they should talk in the Treasury in such a situation. This, however, was exactly the situation which occurred in 2020 with the corona shocks: Affecting the health systems and the economic systems of almost 200 countries worldwide. While China was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, the countries worst affected were countries in Europe, North America and Latin America. The question arises as to how the corona shocks will affect the EU and the ASEAN countries in this broader context, namely in the context of a parallel rise of the US-Sino politico-economic relations. Moreover, how will the corona shocks affect the EU and to what extent is the overlap with BREXIT dynamics and Trump’s aggressive trade policy a problem for regional integration in Europe and Asia? Finally, what are the implications of BREXIT for EU-ASEAN economic relations and what could replace waning US leadership – such leadership in international economic crises was always visible in the decades after 1945; until 2020 when the Corona World Recession called for just such US leadership while the populist US president decided not to demonstrate any. This, in turn, raises in passing the question as to what the reason for the rise of populism in the US actually is: If there is only a short-term rise of political populism, people in the Western world, the OECD group and in ASEAN and China will not have to worry much about a transitory political shift in the United States, but if Trump represents a structural populist challenge, the situation is much more difficult for the US partner countries and for the global economy at large. The following analysis looks at first at US trade policy (Section 2), before taking a brief look at the BREXIT challenges (Section 3) and the problems of the corona shocks and a potential EU crisis (Section 4). Section 5 offers some key policy conclusions and suggests that there could be a considerable change in global governance in the post-corona setting. Multilateralism seems to be seriously weakened and it is as yet unclear to what extent the option, for example, of a networked leadership – involving the EU, ASEAN and Mercosur (plus X) – would be able to replace US leadership. Even if Trump’s successor should switch back to a more traditional US policy approach, the structural nature of US populism suggests that the traditional Western stability and global leadership can hardly be restored. Post-corona, the OECD countries could face much more political risk than in previous decades, weaker trust in democratic western institutions and, as a consequence, lower economic growth which in turn could encourage the rise of populism in some western countries; the latter would ultimately undermine multilateralism in a very serious way. With the Trump Administration blocking the Nord Stream II gas pipeline link between Russia and Germany in 2019 new trade conflicts emerge and high stranded investment costs could become a problem for the firms involved which implies new barriers for growth and efficiency gains – a conflict which should have been avoided and shows a lack of multilateral rules for international investment projects. At the same time the Corona EU recovery program with emphasis on costly green innovations such as hydrogen used in steel production could bring new trade conflicts to the extent that the EU could impose new tariffs on “dirty” steel imports in the future; climate policy initiatives matter for trade policy.",13

Langhammer,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economic integration following the traditional steps from shallow integration (free trade areas) to deeper and finally deep integration (customs unions, common markets, economic and monetary union) has always served political targets in addition to economic targets such as higher economic prosperity. One of the political targets was to increase the bargaining power of small countries against powerful larger trading partners (Kahnert et al., 1969). In a mercantilist world where concessions for opening domestic markets were always conditioned by equivalent counter- concessions of trading partners, market size and bargaining power coincide. The powerful trading partners are the US and, as a latecomer, today China. Those who intended to improve their bargaining power were countries forming integration schemes like the EU and ASEAN. While the EU itself is a model for deep integration and should have already achieved a level playing field status against China or the US, it is not a nation state with a similar political clout as the two countries. Instead, with ongoing integration widening and with rising economic and political heterogeneity among member states, the strategy towards integration deepening got challenged. This has weakened the bargaining power of the EU as even the common trade policy, the oldest common policy next to the common agricultural policy, increasingly faces controversies between the EU Commission and member states as well as between member states. In short, the imbalance between integration widening and integration deepening and a rising gap between what Brussels does and what citizens want, has made it easier for third countries like the US and China to test the robustness of the EU against attacks on its coherence and stability. ASEAN as a model of shallow integration has never achieved a level playing field status like that of the EU. It has always been gradual, characterized as a “work in progress”, always pursuing for many decades back, but still not that deepened as the EU. Until the cooperation was matured enough that ASEAN started to adopted an open regionalism, with trade-led integration, adopted and agreed in a consensual way, or the ASEAN way, in its decision making, which also often reflects the geo-political and geo-economic environment of the time. As such, ASEAN, a much smaller outward-oriented grouping, has never been ambitious as the EU in its economic deepening process. Although it looks at the EU as a model of integration to learn from, ASEAN’s success as a model of regional integration among developing countries lies elsewhere, more on with the way ASEAN is becoming a “club”, or “ASEAN centrality” for convening meetings with major countries, so called dialogue and strategic partners, in dealing with security, regional affairs, and new emerging issues, where Northeast Asia and South Asia cannot form such similar platforms. However, on-going development of ASEAN is never far away from the role of US always playing in the security sphere of the region, but also has become to face more with the rise of China in recent years. In addition to internal divergences in the two groupings, the two giants exert external pressure on ASEAN and EU that attacks their cohesion. The US government challenges EU cohesion in different ways: by supporting a hard Brexit or even a non-deal exit of the UK, favoring autocratic governments in Central and Eastern Europe which deny the EU Commission the right to intervene into domestic policies, urging for a hostile position against Iran and blacklisted Chinese companies, and criticizing Germany for its large current account surplus which it sees as a result of unfair trading practices. China pursues divide and rule practices (in the following called DRP) by marketing its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in East and Southeast Europe while Northern and Western European countries have refrained from formally joining this initiative (called 17 plus 1). Traditionally, the US favors individual ASEAN member countries over others, Malaysia and Singapore over Cambodia and Laos PDR, the Philippines over Indonesia, and Thailand over Vietnam. However, this order has subject to recent changes and new priorities in recent years, in large part, because the US preoccupied with the security and terrorist threat in many parts of the world since the 9/11 event and the Bush administration had put behind the US initiative to counter China in Southeast Asia. From the turn of the century, China has progressively been moving to be ASEAN’s most important trading partner, surpassing Japan, the US and the EU, unlike before the end of the Cold War. And since the beginning of Trump’s “America First”, the US abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), leaving the scene, making the rest of signatory countries to pursuing its new version of a Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) by themselves, along with four ASEAN member countries, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. With US-China trade frictions, ASEAN feels even more to secure its broader trade integration so the long standing Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), since the start of 2012 negotiations, with China-back up with 16-countries trade initiative, has been finally advanced although India decided to pull out at the latest ASEAN Summit in Bangkok, November 2019. Despite ASEAN’s divide on distrust with China, particularly, on issues of South China Sea and Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, many ASEAN member countries have no other way, but feel obliged to cooperate with China or to choose their best path, for the most part to balance out the US and China, in moving their countries forward, and that include for their strategic and economic interests. The paper addresses the issue whether current trade tensions between the two giants aggravate a “natural” tendency of powerful countries to achieve their targets by DRP and how these practices convert themselves into economic and political costs for the EU and ASEAN (part II). Part III discusses various options for the EU and ASEAN to counter these practices individually while Part IV widens the scope of options towards common endeavors of ASEAN and EU against them. Given the divergences in the state of integration (deep vs shallow) as well as in the understanding of political governance (democracy vs autocratic ruling), it is evident that the limits to common endeavors are important and thus must be observed. Part V concludes on the findings.",1

It is usually covered from an international relations perspective, focusing on political interests and stakeholders as well as geo-political considerations of actors. This paper employs a different perspective: The commencement and progress of initiatives like BRI in 2013 and Japan’s Partnership for Quality Infrastructure (PQI) in 2015 is interpreted as the creation and further development of a new market, whose characteristics like the complexity of its very idiosyncratic product(s), its properties as an international public good and its oligopolistic supply structure create interesting and sometimes underrated insights. The paper also analyzes the EU’s strategy from this perspective, which manifested itself resolutely only as late as September 2018 with the release of the Joint Communication on “Connecting Europe and Asia: Building blocks for an EU Strategy” (EC-HR 2018).",12

There was a recognition that scale and leverage could create an advantage for economic relations, that security could benefit from cross-region dialogue and initiatives, and that some of the many ‘new’ global challenges – from global climate change to resource depletion – could be addressed more effectively at regional and even inter-regional levels (see Hettne et al. 1999). Against this background, the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) was inaugurated in 1996, and the European Union (EU) sought to develop a range of other inter-regional agreements, such as the early Yaoundé agreements and the EU-Mercosur agreement of 1999. Other inter-regional linkages were forged, and included the Association of Southeast Nation States’ (ASEAN’s) ties with MERCOSUR, with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Rio Group, which became the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Indeed, the EU and ASEAN sat in the driving seats of all of the major inter-regional agenda, with the US continuing to engage trans-regional formats (such as NAFTA) alongside its bilateral alliances. The EU-ASEAN dialogue itself presents an important model for inter-regional cooperation at the heart of these tangled institutional webs. It began in 1977 when the tenth ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting agreed to intensify the formal elements of ASEAN’s relations with a number of key state partners, as well as with the European Economic Community.Footnote 1 There followed in 1980 the signature of the ASEAN-EEC Cooperation Agreement, which institutionalised relations by setting out a long list of economic and development initiatives, and which sought to engage in joint actions ‘on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit.’Footnote 2 With the expansion of ASEAN and (by then) EU membership, in 2007 the Nuremberg Declaration on an EU-ASEAN Enhanced Partnership set out a longer term vision for mutual cooperation and dialogue based on shared values, including democracy and human rights. In so doing, this declaration pledged the further development of cooperative actions in fields as diverse as climate change, arms control, money laundering and within various multilateral frameworks, including the United Nations.Footnote 3 Importantly, it also expressed support for the launch of negotiations into an EU-ASEAN free trade agreement (FTA), although in the event this was to be suspended in 2009, in favour of EU agreements with specific ASEAN states. Interestingly, the 2007 Declaration also pledged cooperation in the attempt to address broader transborder issues, such as the UN’s Millennium Development Goals as well as climate change and environmental protection, including the sustainable management of forests. As meaningful progress was slow to emerge, the 2012 ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, devised a Plan of Action to implement the cooperation envisaged in the 2007 Declaration, and to cover the period from 2013 to 2017. The EU’s 2015 document, EU and ASEAN: A Partnership with a Strategic Purpose, was written as a precursor to attempts to formulate a Strategic Partnership Agreement between the two sides.Footnote 4 The EU recognised at the time ASEAN’s growing intra-regional ambitions, particularly the aim of completing the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, which it subsequently achieved. In these endeavours, the EU recognised that they were ‘partners in integration,’ and sought to boost trade and investment with the region, as well as to foster both intra- and inter-regional connectivity in a range of ways. A blueprint for implementing the AEC was then published within ASEAN, alongside a range of other blueprints for Political-Security and Socio-Cultural Communities.Footnote 5 Moreover, aiming to realise the promise of a ‘more rounded partnership,’ the EU document clarified ways in which the post-Lisbon Treaty EU, with a greater security remit, could work with the regional initiatives both sponsored and attended by ASEAN in Asia, including the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit. Subsequently, in 2017 at the ASEAN-EU Post-Ministerial Conference in Manila on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the EU-ASEAN dialogue, another Plan of Action (covering 2018–2022) was put forward, in order to frame a clearer strategic future for the collaborative activities of the two regions.Footnote 6 This renewed attempt to define the partnership and its ‘strategic purpose’ underlined the recognition that today the EU and ASEAN remain important trading, political and security interlocutors. In 2016, the total trade between the two regions amounted to US$229.7 billion, making the EU the second largest trading partner for ASEAN (after China), and making ASEAN the third largest for the EU (after China and the US). Beyond the remit of this article, it is, nevertheless, important to note that the EU remains the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) for ASEAN (at 31.5% of total ASEAN FDI), and that work on a future ASEAN-EU Free Trade Agreement continues, as agreed in their joint statement of March 2017. Despite these collective steps forward, during the past decade any attempt to enhance the partnership between the EU and ASEAN has been diluted by a growing trend for the EU to deal bilaterally with the individual states of ASEAN, rather to engage in inter-regional dialogue (Boisseau du Rocher 2012; Fitriani 2014). In fact, the EU completed FTAs with Singapore and Vietnam in 2019, and is in negotiations over FTAs with Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. Such a preference for bilateral agreements has been motivated by the failure to achieve a free trade agreement between the two regions, as well as by the more fundamental differences in economic structures and levels of development within the states involved, as well as in their varied levels of adherence to democratic principles, including the protection of human rights. In 2020, one further complication in attempts to forge greater inter-regional agreement has been the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union as a result of the ‘Brexit’ process. The UK’s exit has removed from this trading bloc one of its most significant economic, political and security members, accounting for approximately 16% of the EU’s gross domestic product. The implications of this loss will be explored below. The first section of this article sets out how inter-regionalism came to be framed in academic debates and the challenges the scholarship now faces. This is followed by a section assessing the ways in which the changing multilateral landscape and intra-regional crises within ASEAN and the EU have altered the relevance of inter-regional dialogue and initiatives. And section three examines the prospects for ‘pragmatic inter-regionalism’ in the face of new global and regional challenges, including Brexit.",3

J. Welfens,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In early 2021, vaccination programs aimed at combatting the spread of Covid-19 infections have been initiated in most OECD countries so that the Corona dynamics and the numbers of people becoming infected should begin to slow down, however, the number of doses of the appropriate vaccinations which are available are still rather modest in many countries. At the end of 2020, the situation in many countries had become rather dramatic such that new lockdowns/shutdowns had been adopted in numerous countries in late December 2020/early January 2021. Hence the vaccination programs are beginning in the context of an overall national epidemic situation which is still rather tense within the medical systems of several OECD countries. As regards Covid-19 fatality ratios and Covid-19 infections, several papers (see, for example, Bretschger et al. 2020) have looked into key empirical aspects which show that some of the main drivers of fatality ratios in OECD countries differ from those in developing countries. As regards the infection dynamics, it is also apparent that geographical aspects – partly affecting the intensity of contacts – matter (Chen et al. 2020). The IMF’s October 2020 economic outlook report has clearly indicated that the Corona World Recession has resulted in high national and global output costs in 2020 (IMF 2020). The following Table 1 shows some basic statistics on Covid-19 fatality ratios and Covid-19 infections ratios plus the absolute total death figures and total case figures in OECD countries plus China by the end of December 31, 2020. It is rather surprising that China – with a population of approximately 1.4 billion - as the presumed starting point of the pandemic has recorded only about 5000 total deaths from the disease which is the same order of magnitude as Greece with almost 11 million inhabitants. The worst performers in terms of Covid-19 fatalities in the group of OECD countries plus China were Belgium, Slovenia, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Czechia, US, France, Hungary and Mexico; while the ten best performers were Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and China. The fatality ratio in Belgium was 10 times as high as in Finland and four times as high as in Germany; the variance within the European Union (EU28 or EU27: EU without UK) was thus considerable in 2020. With a relatively low incidence – the ratio of infected per 100,000 people within 1 week – health authorities are capable of tracking the contacts of those who have been tested positive. In Germany, the critical incidence was estimated at 50 by the government at the beginning of the Corona crisis in March and April 2020 (for age brackets and all weeks see Appendix), but this figure was not raised by the end of 2020: The lack of a modern, strongly digitalized health administration apparently translates into a modest tracing capacity on the part of health authorities in Germany. One should add that the situation in many EU countries is similar, with many national health authorities facing challenges similar to those seen in Germany. This is in stark contrast to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, where digital tracing technologies have played a crucial role and have helped to achieve a relatively good performance during the course of the pandemic, namely low infection ratios and low fatality ratios when compared to Western economies. High infection rates have clearly undermined the supply side of the economy through a negative labor input effect, but there were also psychological effects which resulted in negative demand-side macro effects which undermined economic growth and employment creation in 2020. The first – rather comprehensive - lockdowns in Italy, Spain, the UK, France and Germany plus the US brought a sharp contraction of output as is shown in Table 2. As regard the pandemic, there are three main measures to control infection dynamics: Lockdowns of part of the population - which have the disadvantage that such measures impair production and also dampen consumption and a fortiori investment plus output growth and employment. Selective quarantine measures - which in 2020 were typically applied in the context of travelers returning from international visits/or after specific testing for the virus. Testing was also a familiar approach in care homes and hospitals in OECD countries during 2020. Quarantine can be imposed on those who are considered to represent those who stand for a high risk of spreading the infection – individuals with a positive test result are routinely sent into quarantine for several days. Effectively imposing a quarantine (e.g., people strictly confined to home) is not an easily effective tool as long as there is no electronic device, such as effective epidemic tools for tracking based on mobile phone technology, which facilitate quarantine decisions and monitoring for a limited time. To some extent, social peer group pressure could substitute for technical monitoring devices: Teachers and pupils in a given school will want not to suffer any negative reputational damage within their respective peer group and thus most of them can be expected to follow quarantine requirements as the consequence of a positive test. People working together within a certain firm could also be expected to consider social norms as a deterrent to “cheating” in the field of health policy measures known to be of public interest. Corona vaccinations of people above a certain age – typically above the age of 16 – represent a novel approach to controlling the pandemic; given the scarcity of vaccines in Europe and worldwide it might take well until late 2021 for most countries in the world to have achieved herd immunity. Our particular interest puts a focus on the role of testing which requires government a) to develop a physical testing infrastructure and b) to organize and implement selective and regular testing so that the speed of the spread of the coronavirus can be controlled in an effective way. The testing proposal developed here is partly in line with the approach suggested by Cherif and Hasanov (2020) in an IMF working paper. Our analysis adds simulations and particular policy perspectives to the debate. One also may emphasize that the Testing & Quarantine (T&Q) approach developed here clearly shows that a lockdown can be fully avoided with an adequate testing regime which, however, requires government to strongly invest into a national (and possibly international) testing infrastructure. Moreover, one should emphasize that the approach presented is powerful in terms of fighting the epidemic, generating cost savings for society, stimulating the economic recovery and maintaining individual freedoms. The following analysis considers in some basic aspects of controlling corona epidemics at the national and international level in Section 2. Section 3 presents basic modelling of testing strategies and cost considerations, while Section 4 is a discussion of key policy conclusions.",2

Several years after the referendum, the official British exit, commonly referred to using the portmanteau “Brexit”, took place on 31 January 2020. As of late 2020, the Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU were continuing. The range of possible negotiation results spanned from a hard to a soft Brexit. Both sides are playing the so-called game of chicken (or hawk–dove game) where both maintain a collision course with the other in order to move the negotiating partner toward offering some concessions. Since neither of them is about to swerve and lose the game, the likelihood of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, where both parties lose, has increased during the Brexit process.. Uncertainty about the outcome of the negotiations has resulted in major planning problems in the real sector, since households and companies in the UK are faced with the loss of access to the European Single Market. That is why it is not surprising that the Brexit process itself led to major changes in the economic environment and trade flows of the UK due to the anticipation of the soft or hard Brexit. Several studies focus on the impact of Brexit on economic factors such as income, welfare, exports, and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK, where many contributions employ the gravity model approach. Using a quantitative trade model covering 40 countries and 30 sectors, Dhingra et al. (2017) predict that a soft and a hard Brexit would lead to a fall of the UK’s consumption per capita of about 1.3% and 2.7%, respectively. Furthermore, using a gravity model, they show that the UK’s income per capita declines by between 6.3% and 9.4% due to Brexit. Brakman et al. (2017) use the gravity equation with counterfactual scenarios to analyze the impact of Brexit on exports. By taking 43 countries into account, they show negative trade consequences for both the UK and the EU. Baier and Welfens (2018) examine, using the gravity model, the impact of Brexit on FDI flows and estimate a decline of FDI inflows to the UK by about 42%. Using a panel data structural gravity approach, and assuming different counterfactual post-Brexit scenarios, Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr (2018) find that six years after Brexit occurs, the UK’s (EU’s) exports of goods to the EU (UK) are likely to decline by between 7.2% and 45.7% (or 5.9% and 38.2%). They also find that the UK’s real income is likely to decline by between 1.4% and 5.7% under a hard Brexit scenario and that welfare effects for the EU are insignificant. Henkel and Seidel (2019) run a gravity-spatial model with labour mobility in two counterfactual exercises to study the impact of European integration on welfare and migration flows across 1280 European regions. They estimate welfare losses for the UK of 1.05% and for the EU of 0.41% in the most pessimistic Brexit scenario. Graziano et al. (2018) analyze the uncertainty effects of trade disagreements via a constant elasticity of substitution demand function and find that increasing probabilities of Brexit reduce bilateral export values. Apart from the gravity model, some studies use program evaluation methodologies, which measure the impact of political or economic interventions by constructing counterfactuals. Usually, a counterfactual without treatment is estimated and compared with the observed series with treatment. In this way the significance and the impact of Brexit can also be measured. Based on Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) is one of these methodologies. Using the SCM, Douch et al. (2018) estimate the effects on bilateral trade between the UK, on one hand, and 14 EU and 14 non-EU trading partners, on the other hand, and find that compared with the synthetic UK, exports have declined to both EU and non-EU countries. Serwicka and Tamberi (2018) apply the SCM to examine FDI flows and show that the Brexit referendum reduced the UK’s FDI inflows by around 16%–20%. Further recent research about the impact of Brexit on the real economic growth of the United Kingdom is published by Born et al. (2019). Using the SCM, the authors find that by the end of 2018 the gap between the counterfactual and actual GDP ranges between 1.7% and 2.4% of UK GDP and estimate the cumulative loss of the Brexit vote in terms of 2016 GDP at 55 billion British pounds. Moreover, by decomposing real GDP into its components, they find that primarily investments and consumption have been negatively impacted by the Brexit vote. The main motivation of this paper is to measure the impact of the Brexit process on the real economy. Its primary contribution to the existing literature is in the use of a novel alternative method to the SCM, namely the Panel Data Approach (PDA) of Hsiao et al. (2012). Looking from a different methodological angle, results are obtained which will be compared with previous findings in the literature using SCM. The research mostly relates topically to the study of Born et al. (2019) and analyses the impact of Brexit on real GDP growth, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), consumption and the export performance of the UK. As proposed by Li and Bell (2017), the PDA is combined with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, which helps to select control units to make adequate out-of-sample predictions. The results of this research article are twofold. Firstly, from a technically point of view, the PDA appears to be a more appropriate approach in order to measure the impact of Brexit. In contrast to the SCM, the use of the PDA allows to conduct classical inference. Moreover, the PDA approach is able to estimate quantitatively the impact of the Brexit process on consumption and investment, whereas the SCM approach of Born et al. (2019) can only point out the direction of the impact of these variables. This is due to the flexibility of the PDA. In addition to that, the flexibility and the simplicity of the computation of the PDA allow predicting counterfactuals for the UK using a donor pool of countries, whereby member countries of the European Single Market are excluded; indeed excluding major trading partners is adequate in order to avoid having an inadequate donor pool including countries which due to strong trade links partly automatically would lead to a pool of countries with quasi-similarities to the UK simply on the basis of trade links. Since the SCM application of Born et al. (2019) also includes EU countries, which themselves could be significantly affected by the Brexit process, the predicted counterfactuals could be biased due to endogeneity. Secondly, most of the estimated figures are highly significant and show that, with the exception of UK exports, the Brexit process has been negatively impacting GDP, consumption and GFCF. By 2019Q2, the cumulative loss in terms of UK GDP amounts to between 48 and 54 billion British pounds, whereas the gap between actual output and the counterfactual prediction is approximately 2.5 to 2.7%. The estimated impact on UK exports is positive, most likely because of the depreciation of the British pound following the referendum and during the Brexit process. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the econometric methodology used, namely the PDA of Hsiao et al. (2012) in combination with the LASSO model selection method. Section 3 describes the data used and the modelling strategy. In Section 4, the empirical results for UK GDP, consumption, GFCF and exports are presented. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary including policy conclusions. To the best knowledge of the author, studies about the impact of Brexit using this econometric technique and time period do not exist.",2

A structural vector autoregression analysis,May 2021,León Padilla,Ángel Rodriguez García-Brazales,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Recent changes in the International Monetary System (IMS)Footnote 1 have led several economies to adopt regional currencies, as is the case for the euro area and the recent Monetary Area in the West African (ECOWAS) project. This scenario may have an impact on the debate about regional currencies in other economic blocs. In the case of South America (SA), the debate started with the work of Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993), who found little support for the idea of a common currency area. Further contributions corroborate this result, with the last relevant work being that of Larrain and Tavares (2003) and the recent paper of Hafner and Kampe (2018). However, after more than twenty-five years of an unprecedented process of globalization, the case for a monetary union in SA should be revisited. One of the main obstacles to economic integration is the reluctance of the majority of countries to forgo their sovereignty in order to achieve more regional cohesion (Dutta et al. 2020). In a global context, most researchers agree that Latin American (LA) economies maintain a low level of integration. Using a set of indicators of economic integration —suggested by the optimum currency area theory (OCA)—, Dorrucci et al. (2004) showed that LA was less economically integrated not only than the European Union (EU) after the adoption of the euro, but in some cases even less than the EU at the beginning of its regional integration process in the 1960s. East Asia, even with their relative lack of formal regional trade treaties, is more integrated among itself than the countries within LA (Aminian et al. 2009). Reyes et al. (2010) explained that the lower degree of integration of LA could be related to the lack of economic development of the region. Márquez-Ramos et al. (2017) proved that institutional and political factors influence economic integration in LA. These researchers showed that the terrorist attack on September 11th, 2001 and the region’s policy affinity with the Revolución Bolivariana affected the economic integration process in LA. Despite this relatively low level of integration however, Basnet and Sharma (2013) determine that the economic fluctuations in the seven largest economies in LA —Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela— follow a similar pattern in terms of duration, intensity, response, and timing both in the long run and in the short run. Therefore, their findings suggest that these economies in LA could benefit strongly from regional cohesion and can lead the path of economic integration in the region. In the context of LA, most relevant literature has focused on assessing the potential gains to the creation of an optimal monetary area across all LA countries or within economic blocks that maintain regional trade agreements such as MERCOSUR member countries or the Andean Community (CAN) (Eichengreen 1998; Hochreiter and Siklos 2002; Bresser-Pereira and Holland 2009; Numa 2011; Basnet and Pradhan 2017; Hafner and Kampe 2018). While Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993) found no evidence to support the benefits to the adoption of a common currency in LA, their model has been criticized because it cannot distinguish whether the shocks are regional, global, or simply correlated local shocks (Chow and Kim 2003). Nevertheless, according to Chow and Kim (2003) the prevalence of regional shocks may justify common monetary policy within the region independently of their nature. In other words, the relative importance of regional shocks in the trajectory of the local output is considered the key indicator of the suitability of an economy to adopt a regional currency (Zhao and Kim 2009). Consequently, in this paper we use a regional model to identify what kind of structural shock —country-specific, regional or global shocks— prevails in SA economies. Once identified, it is possible to establish candidates who would face lower costs to integrate a currency area in SA. These results are compared with a similar analysis of eleven members of the euro area states, taking into account that eurozone is a benchmark with which to compare these kinds of monetary agreements. Additionally, contrary to previous studies that include all LA countries, our research only includes SA countries. This is because a monetary union is much more likely in this group of countries due to their geographical proximity, similar production patterns, existing trade agreements, historical aspects and a greater degree of political integration. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the second section, the OCA literature and the research related to LA are revised. The third section details the methodology and the model used. The fourth section outlines the most important findings. The fifth section assesses the costs and benefits of adopting a single currency in SA. Finally, the main conclusions of the study are presented.",2

“The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws.”
 Tacitus, The Annals of Imperial Rome (Tacitus and Grant 1959) Foreign direct investment (FDI) has become increasingly relevant in past years. In 1995 FDI flows totaled $330 billion whereas in 2017 they had increased to $1.43 trillion (UNCTAD 2018). Many developing economies replace existing controls and restrictions over the entry of foreign multinational companies (MNCs) with new policies that are designed to attract and encourage FDI. Developing countries hope to benefit from FDI. Some of those benefits can be incoming capital, spillover effects associated with foreign technology as well as modern management skills and corporate governance (Alemu 2012). But it is not just FDI that has gained in importance around the world. It is also corruption, or rather the fight against corruption, that has become more important over the last number of years. Recent corruption scandals show that corruption plays a big part in countries and economies around the world. For example, Volkswagens’ manipulation of the software in their diesel cars, the release of the Panama Papers, Brazil’s former presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva corrupt dealings with the oil company Petrobras and South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye abuse of power to pressure conglomerates into millions of dollars of “donations” to just name a few (BBC News 2018a, b). Additionally, the abominable effects of corruption show especially in times of crisis. Regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, the United Nations Office on Crime and Drugs (UNODC) mentions for example the possibility of corrupt behaviour regarding the distribution of fiscal stimuli and rescue packages of governments around the world, especially who receives grants from these emergency funds (UNODC 2020a). Another issue raised with regard to the Covid-19 pandemic are the corruption risks related to vaccine development, production and distribution. Due to fast tracked research and development processes, opportunities for corruption arise due to conflicts of interest. Another area at risk for corruption is vaccine deployment as well as vaccine procurement; basically, the whole supply chain is at risk due to these extraordinary circumstances and sped-up processes and controls (UNODC 2020b). Corruption was also a topic at the UN Security Council in 2018: Secretary-General António Guterres cited World Economic Forum estimates saying that the global cost of corruption is at least 5% of world GDP or $2.6 trillion (United Nations 2018). According to a World Bank estimate, businesses and individuals pay about 2% of global GDP or $1.5 trillion in bribes each year (World Bank 2017). Along these lines, Transparency International estimates that governments lose around $500 billion in tax revenues from businesses each year and further billions from individuals. These estimates should not be taken at face value as it is very hard to quantify the extent of damages caused by corrupt behavior. But it shows that corruption is treated as a very serious matter by major international organizations. Moreover, one cannot rule out that corruption in some countries facilitates a sometimes useful expansion of the shadow economy during critical periods – e.g. during a major recession – so that more people find a job and the overall effective real income could be raised, and poverty problems could possibly be alleviated in relatively poor countries. Such paradoxical real income effects are, however, not a key aspect considered in the subsequent analysis. Compared to the early corruption research on FDI in the first decade of this millennium the data coverage and quality of data have improved for FDI as well as the estimation methods for the gravity model like the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006). Building on these advantages this paper contributes to the literature by investigating corruption in a homogenous country group, namely the OECD, using high-quality bilateral FDI data from the OECD. By employing state of the art econometric modeling, i.e. a gravity model using PPML estimation and dyadic fixed effects as well as time fixed effects, new insights into the dynamics of corruption and FDI will be gained. Furthermore, the use of an event variable to model a corruption shock, i.e. the use of the revelation of the Panama Papers scandal as a shock that increases perceived corruption levels within this country group, brings new insights into the afore mentioned dynamics. Lastly, with the use of the OECD anti-bribery convention, a corruption curbing mechanism will be researched. As regards an analysis of the latter, some research has been done by Blundell-Wignall and Roulet (2017). The reason for using only the OECD group of countries is due to the quality of data available but also to see what happens when one looks at a relatively homogenous group of primarily developed economies. Does corruption matter? Are subtle differences in corruption enough to affect FDI flows? Or are corruption levels low enough that companies do not need to care too much about it? Maybe there is just enough corruption for MNCs to take the risk and abuse these opportunities to their advantage? These are some of the questions that this paper is trying to answer. Following the introduction is chapter 2 in which the theoretical framework as well as empirical findings regarding the nexus of FDI and corruption will be discussed. At the end of this chapter, hypotheses will be formed. Chapter 3 concerns the gravity model and its historical development from Newton’s law of gravity, to a model that explain trade flows and then to a model that explains FDI flows. Also, in chapter 3, there is a description of the data, control variables, model specification as wells as the estimation method used in the analysis while statistical challenges are also discussed. Chapter 4 presents the results of the estimation of the gravity model as well as a discussion of the empirical findings. Chapter 5 concludes with policy conclusion and an outlook on further research.",12

Belgium went into its first lockdown on March 18th of 2020 to contain the coronavirus, with the mobility and social distancing restrictions persisting into 2021. While these extraordinary measures helped to slow down the spread of the virus and to prevent the overload of health services, they also affected the economy significantly. The National Bank of Belgium estimates an economic decline of 6.3% during 2020 in real terms. At the same time, the number of employed people in Belgium shrunk by 0.8 percentage points. While in the first quarter of 2021 the economy grew by 0.6%, the unemployment rate remained at elevated levels than before the pandemic.Footnote 1 During the lockdown most of the measures to support the businesses and entrepreneurship went to incumbent firms, ignoring to large extent start-up firms. However, a small group of these start-ups is high-growth firms that matter for innovation, creative destruction, and productivity growth in the long run (Acemoglu and Cao 2015; Aghion et al. 2009; Decker et al. 2017, 2016; Sterk et al. 2021). According to the National Social Security Office of Belgium, the entry of new firms in the private sector during the first half of 2020 relative to the first half of 2019 decreased by 40%. This number is even higher for start-ups with employment. While in the second half of 2020 the start-up activity picked up slightly, nonetheless, it remained below the pre-crisis level. Karimov and Konings (2020) show that the start-ups in Belgium are net job creators in the long term. Therefore, a missing generation of start-ups would create a long-lasting impact on employment. Despite the rapid development of vaccines, the restrictions are being lifted slowly and the supply chains will continue to be disrupted worldwide for a while, preventing firms from resuming business as usual. This has triggered a recession in 2020 for a small and open economy, such as Belgium. Pugsley and Şahin (2019) show that the survival rate and the conditional employment growth rate of incumbent firms are highly sensitive to business cycle fluctuations. Moreover, the studies suggest that the initial conditions of firms at the start-up phase matter a lot for their post-entry growth dynamics (Sedláček and Sterk 2017; Sterk et al. 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic affected significantly both, the business cycle and the conditions that firms operate in. Therefore, the employment gap generated by the lockdown has two components, the short-term and long-term effects, which need to be taken into account. To this end, we assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on jobs in Belgium using a dynamic decomposition framework as in Karimov and Konings (2020), but instead of holding sectors’ age-specific survival rate and conditional growth rates at their averages, using machine learning algorithms, we predict them as a function of GDP growth, to forecast the evolution of aggregate employment under various economic scenarios. We consider two cases, the baseline and the lockdown, for the period of 2020–2030. The baseline case presents a counterfactual scenario without the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we assume the economy to evolve as in the pre-crisis period. The lockdown case presents the actual case where GDP growth and start-up rate decline sharply. Therefore, looking at the differences between the lockdown and baseline cases, we isolate the impact of lockdown on employment in Belgium. To this end, we use data on employment from the social security registry, which covers all firms with paid employment. We only focus on employment in private firms and consider full-time equivalent employment. Our contribution is threefold. First, using the most recent data from the social security registry we describe the immediate effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown on the employment of Belgium. During the first half of 2020, the number of private-sector jobs declined by almost 20% relative to the first half of 2019. In the second half of 2020, the number jobs partially recovered leaving an employment gap of 6% Y–o-Y. While mature (ages 6 + years) firms were responsible for 90% of lost jobs in absolute terms, the start-up and young firms experienced the highest employment losses (peaking at 47 and 30% Y–o-Y) in relative terms. Recent literature highlights the heightened sensitivity of young firms to business cycle fluctuations (Konings and Yergabulova 2021; Pugsley and Şahin 2019). Looking within sectors, the distribution sector (NACE 44—56) was impacted the most. It accounted for more than a half of lost jobs overall and 75% of firm exit during this period. Karimov and Konings (2020) show that the employment growth of the distribution sector in Belgium is primarily driven by the entry of new firms, and therefore the lockdown restrictions severely limit the entry margin for firms in distribution. Second, we develop a machine learning-based approach to forecast the evolution of aggregate employment. The approach relies on the dynamic decomposition framework as in Pugsley and Şahin (2019) and the sectoral decomposition as in Karimov and Konings (2020). We extend it by using machine learning algorithms to predict the out-of-sample age-specific survival and conditional growth rates within narrowly defined industries based on business cycle fluctuations. This “from micro to macro” approach forecasts well the path of aggregate employment over time through the endogenous shifts in the age distribution and the sectoral composition of firms. As it incorporates expectations about the growth of the economy and allows us to perform a counterfactual analysis looking into the future, we simulate different values of the GDP growth and the start-up rate. Therefore, we use it as a simulation tool to estimate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the aggregate employment of Belgium. For the US, Sedlacek and Sterk (2020) build their model upon the number of start-ups, their size upon entry, and survival rate of young firms to quantify the aggregate employment losses. However, they ignore the sensitivity of incumbent firms to business cycle fluctuations, and we show that such effects are very important, especially in the short term. Third, we forecast the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aggregate employment of a small open economy, Belgium, during the period of 2020–2030. Under relatively mild assumptions, the forecasting results suggest that the lockdown has two types of effects on employment, the short and long term. In the short term, private firms cut employment by 40 thousand jobs or 2% of aggregate employment, of which about 30 thousand jobs are due to mature firms. In the long term, the coronavirus crisis creates an employment gap of 26 thousand jobs a decade after the lockdown, and the gap is expected to continue growing. The missing generation of start-ups due to the lockdown accounts for 12 thousand jobs or 46% of the overall employment gap in the long run. Looking within sectors, we expect the majority of lost jobs, in the long run, to be in services. Belgian firms in services have the highest post-entry employment growth dynamics (Karimov and Konings 2020). The industrial and distribution sectors are expected to recover employment losses within the next five to six years. While the actual job losses in 2020 are much higher than the forecasting results suggest, it is important to keep in mind that our approach relies on historical relationships observed in the data which do not capture the unprecedented effects of the mobility and social distancing restrictions imposed in Belgium during that period. Therefore, the simulation results are more likely to be an under prediction of actual effects to see. Our results suggest that the cumulative employment losses for Belgium are 1.3% of total employment, where half of the losses are due to a missing generation of start-ups formed during 2020. In the US, Sedlacek and Sterk (2020) suggest that in the case of quick economic recovery the cumulative employment losses are around 2 million jobs (1.4% of total nonfarm employment), similarly highlighting the sensitivity of start-ups to economic conditions. Therefore, the relative magnitude of employment gaps in Belgium and the US are comparable, highlighting the significant employment costs of the measures taken during the pandemic. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology; Section 3 presents the details of the data; Section 4 validates the model predictions; Section 5 discusses the forecasting results; Section 6 provides the concluding remarks and policy implications.",1

This paper studies the response of Euro Area (EA) GDP and inflation to the Covid crisis. The Covid epidemic is a very large and truly unexpected and exogenous disturbance. This distinguishes Covid from standard macro shocks in “normal” times. Due to its huge size, the Covid shock is likely to have dominated other macroeconomic disturbances in 2020–2021. Thus it is plausible that macroeconomic developments, in 2020–2021, were mainly caused by Covid. Covid thus provides a unique laboratory for analyzing the determination of real activity and prices in the face of a large exogenous disturbance. Understanding the transmission of exogenous disturbances is, e.g., important for designing effective policy responses. A vast (and growing) literature has analyzed the economic repercussions of Covid.Footnote 1 Early studies on the macroeconomic effects of Covid include Eichenbaum et al. (2020) who incorporated an epidemiological model into a Real Business Cycle framework; and Guerrieri et al. (2020) and Pfeiffer et al. (2020) who considered New-Keynesian models. The contribution of the present paper is to provide simple analytics of the macroeconomic transmission of Covid, using a stylized New Keynesian model. An important feature of the analysis here is that it compares the adjustment to the Covid shock in a liquidity trap, i.e. a situation in which the zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint for the nominal interest rate binds, to adjustment when the ZLB constraint does not bind. The framework is used to assess the relative role of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) shifts, during Covid. The use of a liquidity trap model is motivated by the fact that Covid hit the EA (and other advanced economies) in a situation of persistently ultra-low interest rates. With monetary policy interest rates at the zero lower bound (ZLB), the central bank cannot stimulate real activity by lowering the policy interest rate.Footnote 2 AS shifts are modeled as total factor productivity (TFP) shocks, while AD shifts are modeled as shocks to the household subjective discount rate. As documented below, Covid induced a reduction of EA GDP of about 7.8% in 2020, but Covid only had a negligible effect on inflation. The model suggests that the macroeconomic situation under Covid must be interpreted as the outcome of joint AD and AS shocks, whose offsetting effects stabilized inflation. The muted response of inflation indicates that Covid did not affect the output gap, so that the Covid-induced contraction of GDP corresponds to the contraction that would have obtained in a flex-price economy. The model suggests that Covid amounted to a 7.8% drop in EA TFP during 2020; this AS disturbance was accompanied by a fall in the subjective rate of time preference, that stabilized the natural real interest rate. The size of the concomitant model-inferred AD and AS shocks that reproduce the actual GDP contraction of 2020, at an unchanged inflation rate, is invariant to the persistence of these shocks, and to other model parameters. However, the model-inferred relative contribution of AD vs. AS shocks to the GDP contraction, in a liquidity trap, is sensitive to the assumed shock persistence. When the Covid-induced AD and AS shifts are assumed very transient, the liquidity trap model attributes the Covid GDP contraction to a fall in AD (low household demand). However, the (predicted) slow recovery of EA output in 2021 indicates that the adverse AD and AS shifts induced by Covid are persistent (annual autocorrelation: 0.6). Under realistic shock persistence, the liquidity trap model attributes the Covid output contraction in 2020 to the negative effect of Covid on AS. However, AS and AD shifts mattered equally for the observed stability of inflation. In a liquidity trap, persistent negative AS shifts lower inflation, while persistent adverse AD shifts raise inflation. If Covid had solely affected AS, the EA would thus have experienced a sharp fall in inflation and a contraction in GDP that would have been deeper than the actual contraction, according to the liquidity trap model; that model suggests that the contraction in AD had a stabilizing effect on EA GDP during the Covid crisis. Interestingly, a model version that abstracts from the ZLB constraint (and assumes that the central bank sets the policy rate according to a Taylor rule) produces the same estimates of the Covid-induced AD and AS shifts, as the liquidity trap model. In that no-liquidity-trap model version, the Covid output contraction is unambiguously interpreted as an AS shift (irrespective of shock persistence). However, a model version without ZLB constraint predicts that if Covid had solely affected AS, the EA would have experienced a sharp rise in inflation and a contraction in GDP that would have been smaller than the actual contraction. Section 2 presents empirical evidence on the EA macroeconomy during Covid. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 interprets the EA macroeconomy during Covid through the lens of the model. Section 5 concludes.",6

An analysis of the fiscal impact of the COVID-19 crisis on different levels of government,July 2021,Sean Dougherty,Pietrangelo de Biase,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In 2020, the world faced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, triggered by an unparalleled pandemic of a highly contagious virus in a globalised world. During the crisis, the budgets of all levels of government came under stress. Stress arose as a result of a “scissors effect” of contractions in revenues and increases in expenditure needs. Since different levels of government have different funding streams, expenditure assignments and degrees of fiscal autonomy,Footnote 1 As of 2019, subnational governments (SNGs) in OECD countries were responsible for spending 31% of general government expenditure and collecting 15% of general government’s revenues, on average, according to the OECD Fiscal Decentralisation Database. The role of SNGs is essential in making public investment, as they are responsible for, on average, half of all general government investment and also many government functions important to tackle the pandemic, such as health (31% of general government), public order and safety (21%) and social protection (16%). With responsibilities divided across levels of government, intergovernmental coordination can be problematic, which makes the overall policy setting of a country the result of a multitude of separate policies implemented by different levels of government and jurisdictions.Footnote 2 Unfortunately, such a complex multi-layered structure does not make for a simple narrative and tends to be underexplored by academics and the press, with a tendency to overemphasise the role of central or national governments (Rozell and Wilcox 2019). This article aims at filling this gap by analysing the fiscal impact of the COVID-19 crisis across levels of government as well as the fiscal measures implemented through the channel of intergovernmental relations to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude that central governments are absorbing most of the fiscal shock, as they have been supporting SNGs through intergovernmental grants, while their revenues and expenditures tend to react more counter-cyclically than SNGs’. Preliminary data from 2020 for a sample of countries support this conclusion (see Supplementary Material A7). Nevertheless, it is still early to conclude that SNGs were not heavily impacted fiscally by the crisis, as some grants are lagged and thus SNGs may be affected with a delay in the future. More concretely, to support SNGs’ fiscal capacity to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, central governments and central banks have stepped in, typically through additional grants, with no conditions attached, and through the lifting of fiscal rules, while a small portion of countries have provided support through loans and guarantees.Footnote 3 As a result, this fiscal support has imposed costs to central governments, which affect central governments’ debt levels, in place of SNGs’ indebtedness. With regard to revenues, the short-run total tax buoyancy for central governments is, in most countries, higher than for SNGs. As a result, SNGs’﻿ own tax revenues are more stable in times of crises. This can be explained by the fact that there is a tendency for SNGs to rely more on recurrent taxes on immovable property, which is a more stable source of revenue, while SNGs’ personal income tax revenues tend to be less buoyant than those of central governments’﻿. Concerning expenditures, as central governments are responsible for economic stabilisation, they tend to have more counter-cyclical expenditures and their expenditures tend to increase the most in times of macroeconomic crises. More specifically, as a percentage of their revenues, SNGs tend to spend more on investment, consumption and personnel, while central governments tend to spend more on social benefits and current transfers. To tackle the COVID-19 crisis, fiscal stimulus has been enormous, as governments already deployed US$16 trillion from the beginning of the pandemic through mid-March 2021 (IMF 2021). Much of this stimulus was deployed by central governments, damaging their finances. These conclusions are drawn from a multi-country case study of key OECD and partner economies and are, thus, relatively broad, which is a distinctive feature of this article. Other studies on the reaction of SNGs’ fiscal aggregates to economic activity tend to cover only a specific country. Clemens and Veuger (2020) estimated expected revenue shortfalls as a result of the COVID-19 crisis for US states and local governments using employment data. Anderson and Shimul (2018) and Bruce et al. (2006) estimated the long-run and short-run elasticity of US state and local tax revenues by tax type using error correction models. Shoag et al. (2017) examined the influence of local autonomy on the responses to negative revenue shocks in the United States. Kodrzycki (2014) explored why elasticity levels differ across US states and over time. Jonas (2012) analysed how the Global Financial Crisis affected US SNGs finances. More comprehensive studies tend to analyse the reaction of fiscal aggregates only from a central or national government perspective and they usually differ with regard to the methods employed. Lagravinese et al. (2020), Deli et al. (2018), Dudine and Jalles (2017), Köster and Priesmeier (2017), Mourre and Princen (2015), Belinga et al. (2014), Koester and Priesmeier (2012) and Wolswijk (2009) estimate tax buoyancy or elasticity for general governments of various countries using variations of error correction models to capture dynamic effects. Price et al. (2015) estimated the elasticities of both government revenue and expenditure items with respect to the output gap for European Union countries. Thus, the comparison of short-term buoyancy by level of government across countries provided in this piece is novel and potentially the first of its kind. Our discussion and analysis proceed as follows. In section 2 we delve into the methods employed, contrasting these with similar studies. In section 3 we explore revenue and expenditure items by level of government as well as structural differences that might change their expected reaction to crises. In section 4 we show the model’s results. In section 5 we examine the fiscal measures employed through the channel of intergovernmental relations to tackle the COVID-19 crisis, which we obtained from a survey of the OECD Network on Fiscal Relations across Levels of Government. We close this research discussing the implications of the main results of the aforementioned sections.",3
18.0,3.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,14 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-021-00515-4,Productivity and the pandemic: short-term disruptions and long-term implications,July 2021,Klaas de Vries,Abdul Erumban,Bart van Ark,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically disrupted people’s lives as well as their economic fortunes in the short-term with possible consequences for the long-term. The global economy experienced a recession of an unprecedented nature. According to The Conference Board, global GDP contracted by 3.7% and GDP per capita by 4.5% in 2020. This compares very unfavourable with the global financial crisis (GFC) when global GDP declined by less than 1% and per capita income by 1.8%.Footnote 1 While one might expect significant growth rebound effects once the pandemic fades, it is unclear how the long-term growth rate of the economy will be affected. The growth performance of advanced economies in 2020 was especially affected by the pandemic. GDP for the advanced economies fell by 4.7%, nearly 2% points more than the fall in the emerging markets, and GDP by per capita dropped by 5.2%. The larger decline in advanced economies can be partly explained by lockdowns and other government-mandated restrictions of mobility to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on people’s health which were not as much implemented in many lower-income economies. Moreover, the size of the services sector in the advanced economies is larger and has been more vulnerable to those restrictive measures. The pandemic and subsequent government interventions in advanced economies have led to a seemingly perverse effect on productivity growth. Despite the dramatic drop in economic activity, labour productivity (measured as GDP per hour) in advanced economies increased by, on average, 1.1% in 2020, which is quite similar to the trend of the past decade. The reason is that according to The Conference Board’s series the decline in total hours worked (5.8%) was even bigger than the fall in real output (4.7%). Less than half of the decline in total hours (2.6 percentage point) was due to a drop in the number of persons employed while the remainder came from a fall in average hours per person employed. This decline in working hours has, to a large extent, resulted from business support programmes and furlough programmes for employees, which governments implemented to mitigate the short-term impact of the pandemic on business failures and employment. As a result, the average number of annual hours per worker in advanced economies dropped by more than 3% from 1718 to 1661 hours, though with large differences between countries and sectors.Footnote 2 Productivity growth is, of course, best analysed in a long-term context (Krugman 1994).Footnote 3 Investments in human and physical capital, technology and innovation are only materialising in improved business and economic efficiencies in the longer term. Short-term productivity changes during a recession, therefore, need to be carefully interpreted. For example: The numerator (output index) and denominator (input index) in the productivity equation can change rapidly and be highly volatile, which will exacerbate swings in the productivity index. Data revisions of value, prices and resulting volumes of output and inputs may be especially large during times of crisis due to distortions in data collection. Downward shocks in one period may create large rebound effects in subsequent periods and therefore obscure the underlying long-term drivers when looking at the short-term indicators on a quarter-by-quarter or month-by-month basis. A crisis may impact sectors in different ways causing large shifts in employment shares leading to temporary reallocations of labour between low productivity and high productivity sectors. This has especially occurred during the pandemic, as mobility restrictions and mandated business shutdowns disproportionally affected sectors that were highly dependent on direct customer-facing contacts, in particular hospitality services, the cultural sector and parts of the retail sector (except essential retail services, like supermarkets). During the pandemic, the utilisation of human capital has been affected as a result of fiscal support programmes for business and employment furlough programmes. The utilisation of physical capital, such as buildings and machinery and equipment, also declines rapidly during a crisis. Adjustments for capacity utilisation can be large, and highly different between industries.Footnote 4 Despite those concerns, there has been much conversation and some hard evidence that apart from the crisis-related effects described above, the pandemic may also have caused genuine productivity improvements. Some of those pure productivity effects may be related to the accelerated adoption of digital technologies by businesses (Bloom et al. 2021a; Riom and Valero 2021; McCann and Vorley 2021). Other effects are due to a rise in the number of people working from home, which may have caused improvements in digital communications and an acceleration in the digital processing of business information (Barrero et al. 2020; Taneja et al. 2021). Some of those improvements may just cause transitory productivity effects, but others could be of a permanent nature (Bloom et al. 2021b; Bighelli et al. 2021; McKinsey 2021). While it is too early to precisely determine what the long-term economic effects of the pandemic will be, this paper aims to examine the latest estimates of productivity by industry and the possible long-term implications for productivity growth. We analyse quarterly estimates of productivity growth for 36 industries in three advanced countries, France, the UK and the US, for 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. We remove the productivity effects from reallocations of working hours between industries to focus on the pure productivity gains or losses within industries in driving aggregate productivity growth.Footnote 5 We find that while all three countries showed positive growth rates of aggregate output per hour in 2020 over 2019, after removing the effects from reallocations between low and high productivity industries, only the US showed positive productivity growth within its industries (1.5%), whereas the two European economies showed negative within-industry productivity growth rates (France at − 1.1% and the UK at − 1.9%).Footnote 6 We then proceed by grouping the 36 industries using three taxonomies. The first taxonomy is a simple sector taxonomy based on type of activities, clustering industries in five main sectors: manufacturing, “other industry” (comprising agriculture, mining, utilities and construction), market services (excluding hospitality and culture), hospitality and culture, and non-market services. We find highly different within-industry productivity contributions between countries. For example, in the US, within-industry productivity contributions were broad-based. Manufacturing, other industry and market services (excl. hospitality and culture) all showed positive within-industry productivity contributions. In the UK, only manufacturing and other industry showed a modestly positive effect on aggregate productivity growth, whereas in France, non-market services were the only sectors with positive within-industry contributions to aggregate productivity growth. Our second taxonomy considers one specific aspect of digital transformation during the pandemic, that is, the productivity effects from working from home (WFH). We find no evidence of within-industry productivity growth benefits for the top quartile of high-intensive WFH industries vis-à-vis medium-intensive ones (the two middle quartiles). In fact, as the medium-intensive WFH industries made bigger productivity gains, they may have been catching up with the high-intensive WFH industries by implementing the basics of WFH during the pandemic. It may take time and effort before the productivity effects from WFH, and especially the anticipated increase in hybrid WFH models combining part-time work-from-home and work-in-office models, will become large enough to show up in the data as a clear differentiator between strongly and weakly performing industries. The third taxonomy, which looks at digital transformation more broadly, provides a somewhat more favourable perspective on the productivity impact of new digital technologies introduced during the pandemic. Distinguishing industries by their usage of digital technology, including industry purchases of ICT goods and services, the share of ICT specialists in total employment and the share of turnover from online sales, we found better long-term performance in above-average digital intensive industries during the pre-pandemic period (van Ark et al. 2019, 2021). During the pandemic, above average digital-intensive industries showed higher productivity growth than below-average ones. In the US, both groups performed about the same but better than in France and the UK. Overall we conclude that, after adjusting for the large industry reallocation effects, and with the notable exception of the collapse in productivity in the hospitality and culture sector, the within-industry growth patterns during the pandemic showed no clear deviation from the slowing long-term productivity trend as established in our earlier work (van Ark et al. 2019, 2021). This sobering conclusion implies by no means that the pandemic could not turn out to be a source of a potential sustained productivity improvement during the post-pandemic period. Our analysis suggests that digital transformation seems to have progressed during the pandemic through favourable productivity gains (or smaller losses) in industries that are above-average users of digital technologies. Productivity growth during the post-pandemic period will depend on whether such positive effects will outweigh possible negative effects from the pandemic, in particular scarring effects on labour markets and unfavourable business dynamics. The large differences in productivity performance between countries during the pandemic also suggest that country-specific factors such as the response of innovation ecosystems to the opportunities for adoption of new technologies play an important role in the future. Such differences in policy environment may also have a significant impact on the within-country regional fortunes of a productivity revival. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the aggregate trends in productivity growth in France, the UK and the US for 2020, and compare them with pre-pandemic performance. We briefly discuss some of the key data quality issues, and address the impact of the business support and furlough programmes on productivity. In Section 3 we outline the shift-share technique used to separate the pure or within-industry contributions to aggregate productivity growth from the industry reallocation effects. In Section 4 we present the results from our three taxonomies (type of activity, working-from-home and digital intensity). In the final section we conclude by outlining the implications of the pandemic for productivity growth in the long-term.",14

J. Welfens,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many industrialized as well as newly industrialized countries (NICs) have adopted policy initiatives aimed at improving the quality of the environment or at fostering some form of green growth and the development of new, CO2-light, technologies which could help to achieve the stabilization of the climate and to avoid global warming, respectively. Middle-of-the-road, or centrist, parties as well as special issue parties with a strategic focus on environmental issues – for example the Green parties in many European Union (EU) countries – represent the interests of voters in the field of environmental quality and combatting global warming; in the elections for the European Parliament in 2019, the Green Party in Germany, in particular, increased its voting share and the exit polls of the German expert electoral analysis group Forschungsgruppe Wahlen indicated that a large share of voters hold the view that the EU should become more active in climate change policy (Forschungsgruppe Wahlen 2019). This seems to suggest broader individual support for sustainability policy in Germany, for example, however there is no clear picture at an international level as to the extent to which individuals in many countries in the North and the South of the world economy support pro-sustainability policy and ambitious climate policy as emphasized by the United Nations (UN). As regards macro perspectives on climate change, it is not obvious to many that there is a double dividend possible if CO2 pricing-related revenues in OECD countries are used for fiscal recycling to the households through effectively lower income tax rates. Green progress and high per capita income could still be a trade-off setting so that individuals’ perceptions and attitudes about the environment and economic well-being should matter – as should the communication channels available. In the published report of the IPCC (2021), it has clearly been argued that the natural science base findings further underline the analysis of previous IPCC research and even suggest that the 1.5 degrees limit for global warming might already become a reality by 2030, earlier than was anticipated in previous reports. From this perspective, the attitude of people with respect to sustainability and climate change issues in different countries are indeed of critical relevance for international cooperation and policy progress; and the relevance of alternative modes of diffusion of crucial information seem to be quite important in this context. The UN COP25 conference in Madrid in 2019 was extended beyond the initial program as extra days were required for continuing negotiations which, ultimately, brought little in the way of political success, mainly due to the fact that conferences with over 190 participants are complex political events where high transaction costs for negotiations and free rider problems in the provision of the global public goods of CO2 mitigation and climate policy, respectively, make achieving progress towards attaining a global consensus quite difficult. Surprisingly, there is not much knowledge about the environmental concern of individuals nor their willingness to pay for environmental improvement—and the role of relevant information sources, including internet access. Such knowledge would be important not only from an international comparative perspective, but could also be a basis – combined with other relevant knowledge – for a better understanding of opportunities for international environmental and economic policy cooperation; not only are the sources of information regarding environmental concern crucial but also the role of economic and psychological control variables. Macroeconomic policy approaches could be environmentally-friendly and indeed could support climate-friendly structural change: Looking at a combination of higher CO2 taxes, tax recycling through lower income tax rates to a large extent (say 80%) plus the remaining revenue devoted to higher R&D promotion by government, could be an adequate approach for an optimal green tax reform; the higher CO2 tax brings lower CO2 emissions and thus reduces negative external effects from the use of fossil fuel energy sources, the reduction of income tax rates reduces the negative welfare effects from CO2 taxation and the rise of green R&D promotion contributes to higher positive external effects from higher innovation dynamics (Welfens 2019). These macroeconomic perspectives suggest possible welfare-enhancing perspectives of green growth policy, but there is double caveat: Firstly, government would really have to consider and implement such a new policy approach in a consistent way and, secondly, the attitudes and the behavior of individuals (read voters) should be such that there is indeed broad support for policymakers eager to modernize economic policy in a climate-friendly way or new policy measures that generally enhance sustainability. Do individuals in leading industrialized countries and developing countries really support green growth policies? To what extent are the individuals’ attitudes and views different in a North–South comparative perspective so that – beyond the impact of per capita income – a comprehensive international policy cooperation is difficult to achieve? Here, the World Value Survey results have to be considered and in particular the channels by which “environmental concern” are shaped. As regards a European Green Deal, as envisaged by the European Commission (2019), it is also crucial to have a basic understanding as to the extent to which attitudes of people in EU countries oriented towards supporting measures aimed at climate protection and how potential trade-off relations are considered in society. The same also applies to other countries in the world economy, but thus far it is still relatively unclear just how attitudes are shaped through various information channels and other influences. The following analysis aims at closing this research gap by taking a look at survey results from 46 industrialized and developing countries in 2010–14, where not only alternative information sources – traditional as well as digital—for both high-income countries and low-income countries are considered but also a group of control variables. As regards differences between high-income and low-income countries, it is clear that there is a considerable digital structural gap between the two groups – relevant for internet information and digital communication aspects; however, over time the digital mobile gap between developed and developing is expected to be closed fairly quickly (ITU 2015, 2018) and certainly faster than the per capita income gap. While different attitudes, priorities and green activity levels are often making cooperation between developed and developing countries in environmental policy difficult, one should consider the medium and long-run prospects for behavioral green convergence across countries as well – if one would know more about the underlying variables, it would be easier to adopt more efficient and consistent international cooperation approaches in environmental policy. In Environmental Economics there is a wide range of survey studies for EU countries and the US; as regards survey results on the individual’s willingness to pay for climate protection, there is a broad view that answers from surveys will be biased since climate protection and many other fields of environmental policy stand for a national/international public good. If one carefully considers the survey design necessary to avoid biased results, one will receive, in the field of willingness to pay for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, valid important results which suggest in the case of Germany that environmental concern so far is crucial for an influential minority from the upper strata of society (Löschel et al. 2010). A majority of those German respondents surveyed in a ZEW study had zero willingness to pay for reduced GHG emissions, the minority that showed some significant willingness to pay was characterized by high per capita incomes and rather high levels of education plus a party preference in favor of the Green Party (an ecological party in Germany). Willingness to pay in the US has been studied by Kotchen et al. (2013) who found that household surveys showed a positive willingness to pay for reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions – with higher education raising willingness to pay, while older individuals were found to have a lower willingness to pay for a carbon tax and GHG regulation; a higher income raised the willingness to pay for both policy instruments mentioned. In a broader perspective, the key international challenge is sustainability and resource efficiency (Bleischwitz et al. 2009; Welfens et al. 2015). Wagner (2016) has shown for the case of the US that consumers who are environmentally-conscious are characterized by lower gasoline net price and excise tax elasticities (net means: tax-exclusive). As regards price signals this implies that this group is less sensitive to changes in green taxes and prices than less environmentally-conscious households. This not only indicates support for the role of heterogenous environmental preferences, but also suggests that the diffusion of environmental-consciousness could, paradoxically, reduce the environmental impact of green taxes – this link stands for a new analytical challenge that might become relevant in the context of climate change policy. It is not clear that a similar phenomenon of heterogenous environmental preferences also matters in Asia or the EU; given the new “green” emphasis of the European Union’s Von der Leyen Commission, this question could play a crucial role for an effective EU climate change policy – climate change policy will also become a new serious challenge for the G20 group (Welfens 2019). The following study makes use of the 2010–2014 wave of the World Value Survey, analyzing more than 66,000 survey responses across 46 countries. A key idea in the subsequent empirical analysis is to make a distinction between affective (the individual considers environmental issues as a pressing problem which is reflected in the personal attitude), conative (environmental protection is said to be preferred over growth so that a well-reflected interest in a clean environment is indicated) and pro-environmental action (the individual has donated money for the improvement of the environment) as three different dimensions of environmental concern; for each of the three pillars of environmental concern there is a need to use information, not least information relevant for green topics and issues. So, which of the many alternative information sources (radio, newspaper, internet etc.) is relevant for the three degrees of environmental concern where the weakest level of concern is represented by attitude, the second weakest by conative perspective and the strongest by pro-environmental action? The basic finding of the subsequent probit regression analysis is that with respect to alternative information sources the internet is significant for all three types of environmental concern – for the version of the preferred model with country dummy. When it comes to action, all information sources are significant except for conversations with other people. Among the economic control variables considered, the income variable and the education variable, as well as socio-ecological attitudes, are relevant for all three green levels of commitment; plus the internet penetration intensity (country indicator) for “Green Intention” and “Environmental Activity”. The findings differ partly between the high-income group and the low-income group as will be explained subsequently. The setup of the analysis is such that in Sect. (2) there is a brief descriptive part and a brief presentation of the analytical framework, while Sect. (3) gives selected empirical findings. Section (4) presents conclusions and policy implications.",5

Hiremath,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since 2008, emerging market economies (EMEs) are experiencing significant financial distress and large output losses due to the large ebb and flow of foreign currency-denominated debt (FCD). The dollar debt issuance of EMEs has substantially grown to 134 percent from $1.57 trillion in 2008 to $3.67 trillion in 2018 (BIS 2019).Footnote 1 Such growth has been owing to the low-cost source of capital but at the cost of currency risk. In addition, the share of FCD in GDP increased from 10.74 percent in 2007 Q4 to 16.5 percent in 2018 Q3, indicating an alarming sign of external sector vulnerability in EMEs (Fig. 1). The high level of FCD possibly leads to a currency mismatch problem, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of financial crises. On this count, it is clear that the Covid-19 and consequent lockdown of economies can lead to destabilizing effects on EMEs. Therefore, there is a need to measure foreign currency exposure to assess recent external vulnerability and financial distress. In this context, we evaluate the external vulnerabilities in EMEs by developing a method to measure exposure. We also investigate the factor responsible for such exposures. Source: Prepared from the data collected from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Foreign currency-denominated debt (FCD % of GDP).  The EMEs raise the capital from international markets in foreign currency as they find it difficult to borrow in their own currency. This inability to borrow in own currency is termed as ‘original sin’ (Eichengreen et al. 2005a, b). The original sin results in a 'currency mismatch’ in the assets and liabilities of the country. Currency mismatch is defined as the mismatch between currency composition of liabilities and assets where the assets are denominated in domestic currency but liabilities in foreign currency (Goldstein and Turner 2004). We measure the original sin and currency mismatches in EMEs to examine the extent of external vulnerability. Nevertheless, the foreign currency borrowings boost the production and output in EMEs (Hiremath 2016). Therefore, while the currency mismatches suggest vulnerability, the debt cannot be completely averted as leverage is essential for the economic growth. The EMEs are posed with significant challenges, such as a slowdown in growth rate, higher sensitivity to the exchange rate risk, and capital volatility. The exchange rate pass-through is higher in EMEs than in advanced economies, and therefore the fallout of currency mismatch will be devastating in the former than the latter (BIS 2019). Thus, the growing FCD and original sin can hurt the balance sheet of EMEs in the event of exchange rate depreciation. The local currency bond spread sharply rises in the event of exchange rate depreciation and capital outflows due to Covid-19 (Hofmann et al. 2020). On the other hand, foreign currency risk can be hedged by earning forex reserves through exports (Goldstein and Turner 2004). For instance, Chinese Taipei and China sustained larger FCD levels as they accumulated a considerable amount of foreign currency assets (215% and 166% of exports, respectively). Therefore, measuring both assets and liabilities in foreign currency reveals the severity of currency mismatch problems in aggregate balance sheets. Further, computation of currency mismatches at the aggregate level can help policymakers to make the right decisions apposite to external risk. Less is known about the recent developments in foreign currency exposure of EMEs, especially that of the corporate sector. Studies such as Goldstein and Turner (2004), Eichengreen et al. (2007), and Chui et al. (2018) document that EMEs lengthened their foreign currency exposure. The FCD and currency mismatches have been associated with a higher incidence of financial crises in the past. Still, little attention is paid to the topic of currency mismatches in the recent past despite staggering growth in such mismatches. Eichengreen et al. (2005a, b, 2007), Goldstein and Turner (2004), Park (2011), and Chui et al. (2018) emphasize the need for a comprehensive method of measuring currency mismatches in EMEs. To the best of our knowledge, no study probes recent developments in currency mismatches and implications of such trends. Hence, this paper fills these gaps in the literature by analyzing the current evolution in foreign currency exposure and currency mismatches in EMEs. We contribute to the literature on foreign currency exposure and external vulnerabilities by analyzing the evolution of FCD, currency mismatches, and policy implications. To do so, we put together and analyze the variety of data sets on foreign currency exposure. First, we examine the issuance of international debt securities encompassing the currency composition of external debt. We compute the original sin index for the EMEs using granular data on global debt securities. Second, we complement the information on original sin values with country-level data on the share of foreign currency debt in total debt outstanding. Third, we also use the balance sheet information to calculate the net asset position in foreign currency and examine currency mismatches. Using these indices, we take a fresh look at the role of original sin and foreign currency debt in influencing currency mismatches. One of the main contributions of this paper is to show the resurgence of currency mismatches in EMEs since the post-global financial crisis (GFC). Finally, we examine the factors responsible for the currency mismatches and original sin and offer policy inputs to manage external vulnerability. The computation of currency mismatches reveals a higher degree of currency mismatches in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Poland, Mexico, and Turkey, indicating the likelihood of financial crises. We show that the currency mismatch problem is lower in countries that follow de-dollarization policies such as limiting debt exposure, effective monetary and fiscal policies, better institutional quality, and export openness. The findings suggest the crucial role of foreign currency assets, macroprudential policies, and domestic bond markets in limiting currency mismatches and enhancing the resilience of the financial system in the event of a crisis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The conceptual framework and analytical issues of currency mismatches are discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the recent trends in currency mismatches and important insights into policy conflicts. We discuss the factors responsible for currency mismatches and original sin in Section 4. The last section concludes the paper with policy implications.",3
18.0,4.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,01 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-021-00505-6,Do conditional cash transfers increase schooling among adolescents?,October 2021,Eric Draeger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In Brazil, as of 2018, about 40% of the population over 25 years has not yet completed primary school (Globo 2019a). Although the average number of years of schooling has increased from 3.8 years in 1990 to 7.8 years in 2018 according to the Human Development Reports, this figure is still very low by global and even Latin American standards (United Nations Development Programme 2018). A particularly affected age group are young people between 15 and 17 years, since about one in eight stays away from school (Globo 2019b). For this reason, the main focus is on policies that reduce early school leaving and increase the likelihood that more and more young people will obtain higher qualifications. Understanding changes in school absenteeism are fundamental for the educational and long-term economic future of a country, for policy makers and for the effectiveness of social policies. There is robust evidence for the promotion of educational outcomes through conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes. In Brazil, the introduction of Bolsa Família in 2003 increased school attendance and completion rates and reduced the number of school dropouts. The average length of schooling has increased by about two years since its introduction. In addition, more than 99% of all children between the ages 6 and 14 now attend school regularly (Globo 2019b). However, due to the fact that school absenteeism is particularly prevalent among children over the age of 15, the support programme began to include 16 to 17-year-olds in 2007/2008. Since the proportion of young people with a secondary school leaving certificate has nevertheless not risen sufficiently, the question arises as to the effectiveness of such programmes. Previous studies examined the programme effect calculating the intent-to-treat impact. Replicating the difference-in-differences (DD) regression model used by (Chitolina et al. 2016), I also find positive ITT effects on school participation but conclude that the estimates are sensitive to the use of different time periods and that the influences are heterogeneous in nature. Aiming to achieve more conclusive evidence on the effect on school outcomes, in this paper I try to examine the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of the expansion of Bolsa Família in 2008 among 16 year olds. In Brazil as a low to middle income country with one of the highest income inequality indices in the world, Footnote 1 educational attainment is important and affects many different dimensions: First and foremost, education impacts on a country’s productivity, the level of income and individual chances on the labour market.Footnote 2 Paes de Barros et al. (2017) estimate that Brazilians with only a secondary school leaving certificate earn about 20% more per month than those with no more than a primary school diploma.Footnote 3 Furthermore, economic theory emphasises the amount of years of education which signals productivity and increases job market opportunities (Spence 1973). In addition, just attending school has an important impact on the students’ social understanding to find their role in the midst of their peer environment. This in turn contributes crucially to the development of social skills, which are elementary for success at work and in life. Another aspect is the attitude towards law and justice since education reduces the likelihood of criminal incarceration (Lochner and Moretti 2004; Machin et al. 2011).Footnote 4 The fact that education is negatively correlated with crime means that investments in this area in particular can hold enormous future potential for Brazil, especially when one considers its overburdened prison system and its low level of public safety compared to other countries. Beyond that, education influences family decisions and vice versa. By 2013, women in Brazil without high school diploma became mothers for the first time between the ages of 19 and 20 on average. Concluding secondary school, on the other hand, increased the age to 22 years (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE 2013).Footnote 5 Also, according to PNAD national household data from 2013, 8% of all girls in Brazil between the ages of 15 and 17 are already mothers. Of those affected, only about one in four attend school, only one in eight of them has a job (Globo 2015). Increased education relates not only positively to reduced (teen) fertility (Olson et al. 2019), it also effects better health results and reduces mortality. The exact estimation of the Bolsa Família cash transfer effect on schooling or labour outcomes is difficult for several reasons. First, self-selection is present in the implementation of the intervention, which, based on unobservable characteristics, contributes to the fundamental difference between treated and non-treated units and would therefore cause OLS regression estimates to be biased. Secondly, given cross sectional household data from Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD), the occurrence of an actual intervention is not directly observable for the relevant treatment periods. The DD design and a classifier method used for this work try to solve these two points. One part of this approach is to infer the treatment on individuals by applying a set income limit as exclusion criterion of the programme. Instead of using the resulting intent-to-treat (ITT) estimator, in a second step, a classifier matches the queried incomes from social programmes with the benefit levels of Bolsa Família from each respective year to determine actual treatment status. The corresponding DD interaction term consequently represents the estimated average effect on the treated (ATT). Another mechanism is the exploitation of the age rule inherent in Bolsa Famílias extension since the division into treatment and control group is based on two slightly different age groups defining the reception (16-year-olds) or non-reception (15-year-olds) of the programme. As a result, both control and treatment groups are supposed to differ only slightly in terms of individual characteristics due to this income and age restriction. In fact, with regard to key socio-economic variables that could affect educational success, the two groups do not differ significantly from each other in most cases. Also, in order to raise the precision of the regression, a covariates vector emulating the one constructed by Chitolina et al. (2016) is added to the equation. Given the parallel trends assumption, it can be argued that the estimated effect is causal. The PNAD data used cover the years 2001 to 2015 with the exception of 2010.Footnote 6 As Chitolina et al. (2016) I previously had found significantly positive estimates on schooling for the entire country when using the ITT approach for the time span 2006-2009. However, aiming at yielding ATT estimates for 2006/2009 and 2007/2009 intervals I find no significant treatment effects for 16-year-olds for the whole country in either period after accounting for additional controls, either in rural or urban areas. Though, I detect positive programme influences on school attendance in the Northeast for the first period, particularly pronounced for males. Additional placebo tests for non-treated groups reveal larger positive effects on school participation among ”fake” treatment groups, both in the Northeast and in national samples. Finally, I draw on five extra treatment periods (2011-2015) alongside additional pre-treatment years to examine the (ITT) effect from a longer-term perspective. In this context, I conduct heterogeneous analyses for different geographical regions by gender. There is no significant impact of the programme on additional school attendance rates in the longer term detectable. The overall (direct) effect of the Bolsa Família programme expansion on school participation therefore remains uncertain. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the next Section 2, I will go into more detail about the relevant literature. After that, in Section 3, I describe the institutional background of the Brazilian education system and of Bolsa Família. In Section 4, I present the data. In Section 5, the empirical strategy applied and based on the paper by Chitolina et al. (2016) is explained. Afterwards, in Section 6, I summarise the results of the estimates. Finally, Section 7 concludes presenting final considerations.",

Growing capital flows or cross-border asset and debt positions as well as the ongoing emergence of multinational banking groups that operate across the globe have shed light on the necessity to coordinate regulatory oversight across different countries. As a consequence of the great financial crisis in 2007–09 policy makers and regulators have been forced to increase efforts to harmonize and coordinate common regulatory actions in order to strengthen the resilience of the global financial system. In practice, however, the number of bi- or multilateral supervisory agreements between national regulators is still limited, see Beck et al. (2019). Our work is inspired by the need for a better understanding of regulatory cooperation. We characterize the formation process of self-enforcing supervisory cooperation and evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of cooperation. Our analysis provides novel insights into the difficulty of reaching a stable outcome by explicitly determining the number of countries being willing to cooperate. We show that in equilibrium a partial cooperative solution where only a fraction of countries jointly set regulatory standards and partly internalize the positive externalities from supervision can be stable. We analyze endogenous coalition formation by applying a two-stage game from cartel theory developed by D’Aspremont et al. (1983). We prove for the basic version of the model that the number of countries forming a stable regulatory coalition is at most three, depending on the specific functional specification. Furthermore, we highlight the crucial role additional club benefits might play and prove that larger coalitions are stable up to the grand coalition if they are taken into consideration; that is signatory countries of a coalition gain benefits over and above the joint welfare maximization. Such benefits can materialize in various forms, for instance through facilitated market access, more and faster information exchange and through reduced costs due to more adequate regulations adapted to the specific needs of the signatories. Similarly, such benefits can also be interpreted in negative terms when non-cooperation is penalized for example with respect to anti-money laundering. In line with the seminal paper from Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2006) that studies cooperation and competition among regulators, we are also able to explain the economic rationale for regulatory cooperation given that individual welfare maximization on the country level leads to insufficiently low levels of contributions to global financial stability. In our model, we can show how the stability of the financial system, which is induced by regulations on the country level and operationalized in form of the so-called supervisory effort, can be increased when regulators coordinate their supervisory actions. Still, the difficulty of reaching stable coalitions is also highlighted and explained by free-riding incentives of individual countries. In this work, we argue that efforts to coordinate joint regulatory policies resemble problems that have been put forward in the framework of public good analyses. The public good character of financial regulation has firstly been mentioned in White (1994) but has fallen into oblivion for a long time. More recently, Gaspar and Schinasi (2010), VanHoose (2016) or Agénor and Pereira da Silva (2018) have come up again with this idea, stressing the need to view and analyze supervisory cooperation by explicitly taking global externalities from national regulatory tools and efforts into account. Micro- and macroprudential tools such as minimum capital adequacy ratios or a deposit guarantee scheme imposed by a national regulator shall increase the stability of the respective domestic banking system through reduced incentives for risk-taking. Such efforts to sustain financial stability on the national level, however, translate into positive externalities within other countries that are interconnected via their respective financial system. Thus, there exists a social rationale to cooperate in safeguarding financial stability by national authorities which could lead to an increase of global financial stability, as brought forward for example by Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2006) and Gaspar and Schinasi (2010). On the contrary, however, incentives of national regulators to reduce risk-taking within their financial system is normally restricted by efforts to maintain or increase the competitiveness of their banking system, in particular when financial globalization is far reaching and domestic banks are deeply embedded in international competition. Higher risk leads to negative externalities in form of a destabilization of the international financial architecture, which may lead to banking failures or large economic downturns worldwide. Banks in countries with lax financial market regulation do not have to pay for taking higher risk positions and therefore obtain an implicit subsidy, as noted by White (1994). Hence, national regulators have to impose a certain level of supervisory effort that takes the trade-off between financial stability on the one hand and the banking system’s performance on the other hand into account, see for example Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2006). In our view and in the work of Kaul et al. (1999) international financial stability is non-rivalrous and partly non-excludable and can be interpreted as an impure international public good. Thus, if all countries that participate on global financial markets cooperate, social welfare in the involved countries will increase considerably. However, an increase of prudential supervision and regulation in a few countries leads to free-riding behavior of the remaining countries. Early incentives to cooperate with respect to financial regulation were brought forward in the early 1970s when amounts of capital traded on euro markets increased drastically and the failure of the small German Herstatt Bank sent shock waves across the global financial markets, see Goodhart (2011). Consequently, several industrialized countries founded the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which was meant to serve as a platform to discuss common regulatory incentives and reforms. Soon discussions started that aimed at creating a level playing field with respect to capital requirements induced by the Latin-American sovereign crises in 1982. Hence, the Basel Accord (Basel I) was a first important international financial regulation agreement (IFRA) with a view to reduce the implicit subsidy of domestic banking systems (Sinn 2003). The Basel Accord sets some voluntary standards that can only be understood as recommendations for all participating authorities. In recent work, Beck et al. (2019) collect data on supervisory cooperation worldwide and find more than 4000 agreements between individual countries. Their data reveals that the number of regulatory agreements is increasing but that only a small fraction of all potential agreements is realized. Supervisory cooperation today can have various forms, from unbinding standards such as the Basel agreements up to formally and legally binding regulatory unions such as within the European Union or the West African Economic and Monetary Union. Multilateral cooperation is often accompanied by several, partly interlinked international bodies that aim at reinforcing cooperation. Such is the case for example with respect to financial stability at the Financial Stability Board, with a focus on developing common market infrastructure standards at the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) or the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), or with a focus on common actions against money laundering on behalf of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Therefore, it is important to understand the drivers and incentives of countries to follow such voluntary regulations. Negotiations, for instance between American, European and Asian regulators, do regularly take place. They partly result in common binding standards while other issues remain disputed resulting in different regulatory approaches that could undermine the common goal of global financial stability. Beck et al. (2019) highlight the importance of costs and benefits from regulation. They also show that a large fraction of countries only cooperates with a small amount of other countries, hence the coalition size can often be assumed to be small. Against the background of various forms of regulatory cooperation to date, our approach is twofold. In the first place, we set up a stylized model of international supervisory cooperation that predicts a small number of cooperating countries. As a second step, we then introduce a mechanism to allow for a larger cooperation. While we do not aim at synthetically replicating and explaining a specific real-world agreement, this procedure enables us to study fundamental characteristics of cooperation that might help explaining different forms of observable supervisory cooperation. More precisely, we model financial stability as an international impure public good within a multi-country model and assess the role cooperation might play to assure a stable global financial system. We endogenously determine the number of signatories by studying a game theoretical model of international cooperation that explicitly takes costs and benefits from regulation for each single country into account. A stylized fact of competition between national supervisors is incorporated in our model by assuming that costs from regulation on a national level increase when other countries reduce their supervisory effort and vice versa, since a lower level of supervision abroad is directly interpreted as a competitive advantage compared to the more severely regulated national banking system. This setting allows us to assess how efficient the formation of an IFRA is in improving social welfare relative to the fully non-cooperative Nash equilibrium and the social optimal solution. We show that partial cooperation leads to higher levels of supervisory effort on average and, hence, to a more stable financial architecture. Even though the signatory countries of the IFRA have to bear the additional regulatory efforts and costs, our results reveal that partial cooperation of two countries is stable for most of the feasible parameter space. Then, there is a distinct Pareto-improvement from partial cooperation relative to the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium. We furthermore confirm our results by studying the model under a different functional specification and find that coalitions of up to three countries might be feasible, irrespective of an additional assumption regarding parameter values. Our analysis also reveals that club benefits are of utmost importance when larger coalitions are desired. Whenever signatories of a regulatory coalition are exposed to additional benefits that go beyond the internalization of externalities, stable coalitions of any size can become feasible. Two main implications can be drawn from these results. On the one hand, our model can confirm early empirical evidence that suggests that supervisory cooperation often materialize only within small groups of countries. This finding is particularly strong when gains from cooperation are small compared to involved costs (see Beck et al. (2019), and also for an analysis of the assumed underlying drivers). On the other hand, by confirming the necessity to cooperate with respect to regulatory actions, we can additionally show that the incorporation of club benefits is an important tool to overcome difficulties when aiming at the formation of larger stable supervisory coalitions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After the introduction of the research topic we discuss related literature in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we present the baseline model, explain the underlying assumptions and analyze the desirability of cooperation by comparing the non-cooperative Cournot-Nash equilibrium with the socially optimal solution. Subsequently, in Sect. 4 we examine the feasibility of IFRAs. First, we analyze the formation process of an IFRA with respect to an exogenously determined coalition size before we endogenously solve for the number of signatories. Then we add the notion of a club benefit and analyze its impact on coalition formation. In order to analyze whether our chosen functional specification drives the results, we solve the model with a different functional specification before we discuss the implications of our results in Sect. 5. Concluding remarks will be presented in the final section.",2

However, most of the extant economics literature focuses on how inflation is viewed by professional observers, such as financial market participants. Findings from this literature are frequently generalised to nonprofessional economic actors, particularly consumers. For instance, rational expectation formation can rarely be rejected using financial data (see, e.g., Capistran and Timmermann 2009) and it is then often assumed to hold for private households, too. However, standing in the shadow of this dominating approach in mainstream economics is a small, but active, strand of research that explicitly investigates how inflation is viewed by laypersons. Researchers working in this domain address fundamental questions such as whether and how laypersons actually know about price changes, whether their perception of the inflation rate is confounded by other variables, for example, income, or how they store information about past prices in their long-term memories. This alternative stream of research is interdisciplinary in that relevant work can also be found in the fields of psychology, marketing, learning and information processing, and media studies. In this paper, we utilise representative survey data collected on our behalf in 2016 by Research New Zealand. Our emphasis is on generating stylised facts about how laypersons think about inflation. Thus, the paper is more closely linked to the psychological literature than to the typical economics literature. We are trying to better understand how laypersons perceive past and future inflation, how they learn about inflation, and how they respond to it. Several findings emerge. The most important are the following. (i) Although respondents think that they are relatively well-informed about inflation, less than one-half actually know last year’s inflation rate. (ii) On average, stated inflation rates are significantly higher than the actual inflation rate. (iii) When recalling inflation rates from last year, people are attracted to natural numbers. (iv) People who remember higher inflation rates are married, reside in towns (rather than cities or villages), and have a desire to be informed about inflation. People remembering lower inflation rates tend to have a high level of subjective and objective macroeconomic knowledge. (v) We find it difficult to explain what type of people actually react to the inflation rate. In our interpretation, economic reaction to inflation is strongly determined by unobservable factors and/or subject to strong idiosyncratic influences. Theoretically relevant economic variables, such as income, wealth, or saver/debtor position, do not appear to play a role. (vi) Only 25% of New Zealanders form expectations about the future inflation rate, which is not in line with the typical assumption made in macroeconomic models. (vii) Those who obtain their information about the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) from either their bank advisor or another financial-sector source are more likely to form inflation expectations, suggesting that RBNZ’s forward guidance may not reach laypersons directly. (viii) Respondents who are not earning their main income on the labour market are even less interested in forming inflation expectations or less likely to react to the expected inflation rate than other groups in society. (ix) The expected inflation rate moves in a one-to-one fashion with the perceived inflation rate from the last period, suggesting that adaptive inflation expectation formation is superior to forward-looking expectation formation when forecasting inflation. (x) That people overestimate the previous inflation rate leads to an overestimation of future inflation. Thus, with respect to the population at large, we interpret our results as an indication that laypersons’ knowledge about inflation is more in line with the imperfect information view prevailing in social psychology (see, e.g., Williamson and Wearing 1996) than with the rational actor view often assumed in economics. Section 2 discusses our conceptual framework and the extant literature. In Section 3, we discuss the empirical methodology and the dataset. We study people’s perceptions of last year’s inflation rate in Section 4. Section 5 is concerned with investigating people’s inflation expectations; Section 6 concludes.",1

More detailed and specialized supply chains in production as well as consumption patterns across countries lead to an increase in complexity and thus require more sophisticated logistic structures. Airfreight makes up for a rather small amount in terms of both ton-kilometers and tons – only around half a percent (Statista 2021a) in comparison to the 8.9 billion tons of goods transported by rails (International Union of Railways 2020) and about 11 billion tons by sea (Statista 2021b) in 2019. When looking at the value of transported goods however, air transport is the preferred choice with about 40 percent of total value of transported goods, including special industrial freight and high-quality consumer goods and postal service. The annual growth rate of air freight continues in exceeding the total growth rate of global freight, attracting special attention from both researchers and businesses. In order to maintain functional and efficient logistic structures it is crucial to plan and prepare for future demand for transportation, whereby this study targets specifically the aviation sector. We develop a global air freight demand model which meets the requirement to be utilized as forecast tool on country- and airport level, supporting a more found derivation of fleet- and airport (hub) development. A disruptive factor in the quantitative approach remains unprecise trucking networks processing airfreight from and to airports, i.e. it is difficult to automatize a clear-cut catchment area of airports regarding freight. Our findings however help limiting disruptions and give a roadmap on how to approach regional airport-economy. While we find a broad variety of approaches to model national- and regional airfreight demand in the literature, recent global air freight models (Airbus 2019, Boeing 2020, Karp Lufthansa Consulting 2020, IATA 2020, 2021, ICAO 2021) are similar in their methodology, forecasting annual average air freight growth between 3.5 % and 4.2 % up to the year 2045. The underlying paper aims to develop the intuitive gravity models (Shepherd 2017) being currently prevalent in literature by utilizing airport fixed effects in order to control for the vast number of unobservable factors. Following this approach leads to highly adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) coefficients, thus making it possible to formulate more precise elasticities for air cargo demand with regards to GDP per capita. Controlling for (micro) unobservable factors on regional level we find (opposing to previous studies) that the annual average oil price does not have a significant impact on air freight; this effect should rather be credited to airport- and/or country-specific time invariant characteristics. In contrast, the annual average kerosene price has a much higher explanatory power than oil prices. Because of correlation issues with GDP per capita, we estimate both coefficients in separate models and apply their calculated impact in the forecast. We find that the kerosene price captures annual time variances and shocks very well and thus is a good indicator for annual fixed effects, while a pure GDP per capita based forecast model with time fixed effects has a good long-run fit. The paper is structured as follows: Chapter 2 looks at current literature with regards to air freight models and forecasts. Chapter 3 describes data and methodology and estimates a variety of models. In Chapter 4 we apply our results to generate several forecast scenarios and discuss the pros and cons of our approach. In that context we will discuss how to employ our findings for regional airport analyses. The paper closes with a brief conclusion and some recommendations for future research in Chapter 5.",2

J. Welfens,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"On September 24th, 2021, the European Institute for International Economic Relations (EIIW/University of Wuppertal) hosted an international workshop in the context of marking the Institute’s 25th Anniversary; it had initially been hoped that postponing the workshop from the originally intended date in 2020 to 2021 would allow to have a normal in person conference, but COVID-19 dynamics continued to disrupt plans, and the workshop took place belatedly in an online format. Founded at the University of Potsdam, the Institute subsequently moved to the University of Wuppertal where, over many years, the EIIW team and guest researchers have contributed greatly to international economic analysis. This has included work for various International Organizations (e.g., the United Nations, International Monetary Fund) as well as research for governments (and public agencies) in the European Union — including the European Parliament and the European Commission — companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) across Europe. The Special Issue presented here provides an exemplary selection of the research in the Institute’s area of expertise. It places an analytical focus on International Economics, climate-policy-related research, International Organizations and economic policy analysis, including some of the first papers with analytical economic findings on the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian war. This special issue thus reflects key fields of International Economics and climate policy as well as research on key aspects of the war in the Ukraine. In the paper of Werner Roeger and Paul Welfens, there is a clear focus on the macroeconomic effects of import tariffs in a model with multinational firms and foreign direct investment (FDI): A major analytical innovation here is that foreign direct investment is included in a DSGE model alongside trade, while traditional models have emphasized just trade therefore omitting an important channel of modern globalization in OECD countries and Newly Industrialized Countries. Thus, one gets new insights into the effects of import tariffs and protectionism, respectively: for the home country, the foreign country and the world economy. The US-China trade conflict as well as US-EU trade conflicts under the Trump Administration is a potentially relevant background and field of application for the new modelling approach presented. The contribution of Samir Kadiric analyzes recent developments in the British and European government bond markets with reference to BREXIT. Firstly, the author examines whether the BREXIT referendum affected the risk premium and, secondly, whether there are any changes in terms of risk pricing following the British referendum. There is a significant impact of the BREXIT referendum on the risk premium in various economies. Moreover, regression results suggest that there was a considerable change in risk pricing following the announcement of the referendum result. Credit default risk and risk aversion play a much more important role in the post-referendum period than was the case prior to the vote. Friedrich Schneider, who has been a pioneer in the international analysis of the dynamics of the shadow economy, presents new results on global changes in the shadow economy: Considering the development of the shadow economy of 36 European and OECD countries over the period 2003–2022 and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 onwards, the average size of the shadow economy of 36 European and OECD countries decreased slightly (relative to gross domestic product). Due to a continued — forecasted — economic recovery in 2022, the average shadow economy of these 36 countries will slightly increase to about 16% of aggregate income — this is the average of all 36 countries included in the analysis. There are considerable differences in the size of the shadow economy across countries; as regards policy monitoring by International Organizations, corruption is often covered in standard approaches; however, shadow economic activities have thus far been given relatively little consideration, despite the fact that in many countries of the world economy, the size of the shadow economy is crucial in economic terms. Kirill Borissov, Lucas Bretschger, and Aleksei Minabutdinov focus on the topic of capital taxation in a greening economy. By adopting a model of endogenous growth with polluting capital and a fixed budget for aggregate emissions, the authors identify a novel and interesting capital tax paradox. The basic perspective relates to pollution abatement efficiency which is growing over time due to technical progress. The authors take a look at long-run capital and consumption which turn out to be inversely related to the initial stock of capital. As a consequence, capital taxation does not harm the economy but actually raises long run consumption and production: This is the “green capital tax paradox.” The analysis explains this, at first sight, surprising result by the fact that early economic activity is harmful because of high environmental pollution. The contribution also presents novel results on the impact of pollution intensity and the rate of technical progress on the greening of the economy and pollution allowance prices. As regards the quantitative contribution, the authors calibrate the model and study economic growth under different assumptions with respect to basic parameter values. With climate challenge remaining a major policy topic in the world economy, this contribution is highly relevant — and also plays a crucial role at a United Nations level (despite the recent Russo-Ukrainian war possibly changing the agenda in major OECD and G20 countries, respectively, for a transitory period). The study by Vasily Astrov, Mahdi Ghodsi, Richard Grieveson, Mario Holzner, Michael Landesmann, Olga Pindyuk, Robert Stehrer, and Maryna Tverdostup from the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw) raises crucial questions with respect to the Russio-Ukrainian war: What are the economic effects of the war for Ukraine, Russia, the EU, and the rest of Europe, respectively? The analysis of the authors sheds an interesting light on the immediate consequences on the one hand, but also on the medium-term structural changes caused by this war on the other. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused a humanitarian crisis and one should anticipate a major refugee wave in Europe. As Ukraine’s Black Sea ports come under Russian assault, Ukraine has lost its ability to sell more than half of its regular exports. Obviously, Western financial support (possibly including considerable IMF funding as well as EBRD support) will become ever more important as the Russio-Ukrainian war continues. Turning to Russia, sanctions will have a very serious impact on the economy, including the financial sector. Discretionary intervention by the Russian Central Bank and the government, including capital controls, have been employed by Moscow to cope with key international challenges. As a result of the war and the Western sanctions, the rest of Europe faces a rise in already high inflation rates. Energy imports from Russia are crucial for many European countries. Aside from energy, the economic fallout via trade for the rest of Europe is likely to be rather modest. There are several key areas of structural change and lasting impacts for the EU as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the broader disruption to international relations caused by the war. The paper by Christof Ruehl places a focus on key aspects of energy sanctions and the world economy — mandated versus unilateral sanctions. This analysis is in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war and the series of sanctions imposed by Western economies, Japan, Australia, and others on Russia. The author points out that during the first 2 months of the conflict, the G7/NATO/EU/US have supported the efforts of Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion. In this context, a combined circa 30% of global GDP — the G7 share of world output — is squaring off against 11% of the world energy production, namely Russia’s share. An analytical focus is on the prospects of sanctioning Russia’s energy production and thereby to undermining Russia’s willingness to wage war against Ukraine. The author emphasizes that in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war, sanctions differ from Western sanctions of the past: Sanctions and embargo proposals are now decentralized decisions made on a country-by-country basis and with “sanction picking” (i.e., no penalty for continuing to consume Russian energy). By contrast, previous sanctions on energy exports had been largely centralized and had a strong enforcement component, e.g., secondary sanctions attached to this. Which of these two approaches will be more successful in maximizing damage to Russian’s energy revenues while imposing minimal damage on the sanctioning countries? The author determines how a consistent strategy should look — an optimal path for energy sanctions should rely on decentralized, unilateral decision combined with other elements. Finally, the paper by Werner Kirsch takes a closer look at the changes in the relative power balance within the European Union for the case of an enlargement to include Ukraine. The Banzhaf index is a very useful way to measure political power — in a quasi-game-theoretical context and considering potential coalition constellations amongst EU member countries — and the changes to be expected in the case of membership of the Ukraine in an enlarged EU28 are quite interesting to study: The main losers in terms of relative power changes — relevant with regard to qualified majority voting at the Council of the European Union — are the large EU countries; small EU countries stand to gain relative power in the context of an EU enlargement should there be the accession of Ukraine. The findings for an enlargement to include Ukraine raise new challenges for the European Union and could also bring about a new debate about adjusting the minimum majority requirement with respect to the population criterion (currently 65% of the EU27 population). Combining selected papers from the EIIW’s 25th Anniversary workshop with recent papers on the Russo-Ukrainian war generates important and original economic insights and creates interesting analytical perspectives as well as new policy conclusions; for an understanding of the main implications for the new world economic order that might follow the end of the war, it is still too early, but economic, institutional, and mathematical/statistical analysis can already provide valuable insights into key issues surrounding the effects of this largely unexpected Russian invasion of Ukraine. Clearly, the Russo-Ukrainian conflict raises not only analytical issues but also has many other perspectives, including the question of how strong individual Western countries should support the Ukraine in its defense vis-à-vis the aggressor. Germany, Italy, Spain, and other EU countries can be expected to raise defense expenditures relative to GDP and meet the 2% NATO target within a few years. Whether or not this will be decisive in forging a renewed solid transatlantic security cooperation remains to be seen. One may hope for a quick round of diplomatic negotiations which could lead to a lasting peace — after which, the rebuilding of the Ukrainian economy would be only one of the major challenges faced in Europe. Certainly, individuals, governments, and International Organizations will be expected to support this process. While Ukraine and Poland had rather similar per capita incomes in 1991, the Polish economic recovery in the wake of the post-socialist recession was much faster than in Ukraine which, however, had a rather different privatization process (with a considerable role played by oligarchs) when compared to Poland. Governments in Warsaw put a considerable emphasis on pro-competition reforms in the privatization process. The latter approach brought significant efficiency gains and EU membership — as a driver of institutional reforms even prior to membership in 2004 — also supported economic growth in Poland. While post-war Ukraine, suffering from the shock of the war, might not be able to quickly reach the per capita income of Poland, it should have new opportunities for economic modernization and international integration once political stability and security can be restored. The benefits of adequate and appropriate reforms of Ukrainian institutions and a consistent economic policy could be rather significant; and it will be interesting to see whether or not the EU could come up with a type of Marshall Plan support program for Ukraine. Whether or not there will be an exodus of Western investors from Russia after the end of the war is not yet clear — the historical precedent of banks from Western European countries leaving Russia in the late nineteenth century may be considered to be a rather bad historical example here. Restoring the world economic order after the war will be a serious challenge and one may have to raise the question of how Western ideas and values can become a more attractive set of institutional elements in a modern Russia (and China) than they seemingly were over the three decades prior to the war. The fact that few politicians and research institutes in Europe seem to have drawn attention in a timely fashion to the impact that Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin and other Russian thinkers from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have had on President Putin raises serious questions about the future research agenda on Russia and Europe, respectively (see, however, the book by the French philosopher Michel Eltchaninoff that already in 2015 has analyzed the background of Putin’s ideology — Eltchaninoff’s book was published in French in that year, a German edition followed in 2016 and an English edition in 2018). A potential broad energy embargo of Western countries against Russia would transitorily reinforce the use of coal in OECD countries and thus reinforce the problem of global warming in a largely unanticipated manner. At the same time, a strong rise of fossil fuel prices in world markets will stimulate substitution dynamics in favor of renewable energy which naturally is an important topic for future research. The EIIW gratefully acknowledges funding from the Schumpeter School Foundation at the University of Wuppertal towards the 25th Anniversary EIIW workshop. International Economics and economic policy issues will obviously rank highly on the agenda of industrialized — and developing countries — in the coming years; hopefully, scientists from all countries will be able to contribute to the analysis and the international debate.",

J. Welfens,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is some evidence that after a long period of increasing globalization, the process has stalled somewhat since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and there are some signs that we have indeed even entered a period of de-globalization (see, for example, Herrero (2021)). This view is fueled by a slowdown of merchandise trade and protectionist measures implemented by various governments around the world as documented for example by Evenett and Fritz (2021). Large countries or trading blocs, in particular, may find it advantageous to impose import tariffs on trading partners aimed at increasing domestic welfare. The theory of optimal tariffs suggests that a (large) country can increase domestic welfare by imposing a tariff unilaterally, due to a terms of trade gain. The terms of trade (TOT) gain arise to the extent to which foreign goods are inelastically supplied. The literature shows that in this case, the TOT effect dominates negative effects implied by distortions to consumption and production resulting from a tariff increase.  (see, e.g., Felbermayr et al. (2011) for a recent analysis on this). In the USA, the Trumpian Trade Policy seen during 2017–2020 partly followed textbook traditional policy. Traditional optimal tariff analysis, with its focus on large open economies, typically considers the trade-off between a reduced world market offer price—in a tariff-ridden setting—and the loss of consumer surplus which occurs in the context of smaller import quantities which occur as a result of higher import tariffs. US President Trump suggested that the trade conflict between the USA and China would result in a net gain for the USA: The USA was a major net importer of goods and services so that a quasi-balanced tariff escalation between the USA and China, respectively, was bound to create a new benefit for the USA as the USA could always go at least one step further in terms of retaliatory measures than the larger Chinese side. Trump’s trade policy was assumed to create sufficiently large additional US tariff revenues that US farmers from the mid-West—typically Republican voters—could be compensated for lower exports and profits from their business with China (e.g., in soya beans). To some extent, the Trump Administration also seemed to follow a tariff-jumping argument: Foreign firms facing reduced market access in the USA might instead consider producing on an enlarged scale within the USA itself which, in turn, would create new jobs and thus offer new opportunities for US workers in certain sectors. Whether or not the Trumpian import tariff policy could be deemed successful could, however, not be assessed within a partial equilibrium approach with a first FDI-related analysis from Welfens (2020, appendix to part IV) which emphasizes the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the fact that a monopsonist position of the USA implies, in the case of outward FDI, that the case of two large countries will bring about a lower stream of foreign profits accruing, for example, from US subsidiaries in China. There is also an interesting empirical LASSO-based approach which compares actual trade policy performance to the development that would have been expected from a “doppelgänger” country—a hypothetical twin country of the USA (Celebi and Welfens 2020).
 It should be noted that foreign direct investment flows markedly increased over the period between 1990 and 2017 (UNCTAD, 2021, see appendix Tab. 1 which shows e.g. that the USA has witnessed an increase of the outward FDI Stock/USA capital stock ratio from 2.7% in 1990 to 12.9 in 2017), but this structural change in the world economy has rarely been considered in International Macroeconomics (Table 1). FDI has also not become a major topic in the international policy debates (e.g., at the IMF, G7 or the G20). In fact, the global rise of foreign direct investment raises new analytical perspectives (Roeger and Welfens 2021; Welfens 2020) and selected new aspects will be identified subsequently. Most of the optimal tariff analysis is conducted with models which exclude FDI. However, FDI now plays an important role and is a constituent part of the globalization process. It is therefore important to analyze the impact of an import tariff in the presence of FDI. Will a reduction in trade be compensated for via increasing FDI flows or is there co-movement between trade and FDI? Neither the theoretical nor the empirical literature is particularly clear on this issue. The so-called tariff jumping hypothesis suggests that an increase in tariffs will attract more FDI inflows. However, there are also arguments which run contrary to this proposition. These are based on the observation that subsidiaries of foreign multinationals face cost increases because of their dependence on imports from their foreign headquarters. There are other papers dealing with optimal tariffs in a policy environment where governments focus on protecting the domestic industry (see, e.g., Blonigen and Cole 2011; Cole and Davies 2011). In this body of literature, it is argued that the optimal tariff with FDI could be lower compared to the case of no FDI. An import tariff becomes less desirable if domestic firms become exposed to competition from foreign multinational companies (MNCs) or when the import tariff also protects foreign MNCs. Blanchard (2010) focusses on the effects of (exogenous) foreign equity holdings in both the export and import sector and argues that this can lower the optimal tariff because the tariff also provides a gain to foreign owners of domestic firms. Domestic MNCs setting up foreign subsidiaries with the purpose of exporting back to the domestic country may provide another reason to lower the import tariff. There is also a literature which links FDI to the thread of import tariffs (see Bhagwati et al. (1987)). For example, Blonigen and Feenstra (1997) find that the threat of protectionism had a significant and positive effect on greenfield FDI in the USA in the 1980s. However, recent work by Görg and Labonte (2011) presents evidence which goes in the other direction. The protectionist measures of the Trump Administration constitute a recent event which is useful in order to study the impact of trade restrictions on FDI. There is one paper by Chahinea et al. (2021) which supports the tariff jumping hypothesis. However, Posen (2018) argues that Trump did not achieve his goal of attracting more FDI. Van der Merve (2021) provides a more nuanced picture. Total FDI inflows to the USA declined after 2016; however, they still remained high relative to post-2008 recession levels and—interestingly—greenfield investment has risen somewhat after 2016. In this paper, we adopt a model perspective to shed some light on the relative importance of the two opposing effects induced by an import tariff on FDI, namely, tariff jumping on the one hand and higher tariffs imposed on the imports of foreign MNCs on the other. We look at the case of both unilateral tariffs and a world-wide increase of import tariffs. We use a two-sector, two-country model, where the two sectors differ mostly with respect to their international activities. One sector (sector 1) sells to foreign customers via exports, while firms in the other sector (sector 2) sell to foreign customers via foreign subsidiaries, i.e. sector 2 engages in FDI activities. Both types of firms solve intertemporal profit maximization problems and make decisions about production, domestic and foreign sales, domestic and foreign investment (in the case of sector 2), and labor input. This set up allows us to study domestic and foreign activities of firms engaging in exports and FDI respectively. Decisions are made subject to a neoclassical production function, where MNCs in sector 2 apply the same technology at home and abroad. We also assume that firms in both sectors exercise market power and charge (identical) mark-ups across the two regions and sectors. Our model allows us to look at the short-, medium-, and long-term effects of permanent tariff increases. Moreover, we can trace the impact of a tariff not only on imports and FDI inflows but also on exports and FDI outflows. This, in turn, allows us to trace the trade balance and primary balance effects of a tariff increase. We assume that labor is inelastically supplied in the foreign and domestic economy; thus, total consumption is a good measure of welfare gains and losses for the representative household. Since our model also calculates the real consumption wage, we can also measure how a (financially constrained) household entirely reliant on labor income benefits or loses from an increase in tariffs. Comparing aggregate consumption effects with the real consumption wage allows to consider the distributional effects between capital owners and workers. Since the welfare effects of a unilateral tariff are eventually the result of a trade-off between consumption and production distortions implied by the tariff and terms of trade gains, a model with a full production sector is useful since it accounts for the productivity effects of the tariff across sectors and regions. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the model (2.1) and the calibrations (2.2) while Section 2.3 presents results of a unilateral permanent tariff increase. In this section, we also provide some sensitivity analysis. Section 3 provides a brief outlook at further extensions in a modern and more realistic modeling environment with active MNC dynamics. Section 4 offers policy conclusions and ideas for further research.",5
19.0,2.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,31 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-022-00535-8,The determinants of sovereign risk premiums in the UK and the European government bond market: the impact of Brexit,May 2022,Samir Kadiric,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On June 23, 2016, the British people voted in a referendum for the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU)—an event which became widely known as “Brexit.” This decision in favor of leave was, broadly speaking, unexpected by most observers. Hence, Brexit represents a unique shock that limits the extent to which previous analyses can be used to understand its effects. During 47 years of membership, a set of complex relationships between the UK and the economies of other EU member states developed. Thus, the departure of the UK from the EU would cause a significant loss for both sides. Against this background, the aim of this study is to analyze recent developments in the UK and the European government bond markets with reference to the UK’s decision to leave the EU and to discuss their implications for both policymakers and economists. Sovereign bond yields play a key role in the transmission process of the central bank’s monetary policy. Moreover, they are generally used as a benchmark to price key interest rates in financial markets, for asset allocation and asset pricing purposes (see ECB (2014a)). Furthermore, from a long-term policy perspective, it is important to understand the main drivers of sovereign risk in order to find an appropriate and effective policy mix and so meet the challenges of Brexit and its aftermath in coming years. This paper is related to the literature which focuses on the effects of the Brexit referendum result on financial markets. Using composite indicators of financial integration, Hoffmann et al. (2020) find that the announcement of the Brexit referendum result led to a decline of the level of financial integration in Europe, although not as strong as during the financial crisis. The estimation results in Belke et al. (2018) reveal significant evidence that an increase in the likelihood of Brexit had a strong negative effect on stock prices, with the largest effect found for UK stocks. In addition, Hill et al. (2019) show that financial and consumer-facing sectors had the highest exposure to the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote. Schiereck et al. (2016) analyze stock and credit default swap (CDS) market reactions in the UK and the EU around the time of the Brexit vote (CDS indicate the price of default risk in financial markets). They find that a short-run drop in stock prices to the referendum announcement was more pronounced than to the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers, particularly for EU banks, although an increase in CDS spreads is relatively small, compared to Lehman bankruptcy. Using an event study methodology, Ramiah et al. (2017) confirm the finding that most economic sectors reacted negatively to the referendum result as indicated by negative abnormal returns; however, the banking sector was affected the most. Using a two-stage estimation process, a subsequent study by Davies and Studnicka (2018) finds that firms with global value chains more strongly oriented toward Europe perform worse than the market as a whole while larger firms seemed to ride out the turmoil of Brexit much more easily than the average firm. Moreover, they find that the market’s reaction to the announcement of the referendum result was persistent. Moreover, Breinlich et al. (2018) analyze the short-run effects of Brexit by studying stock market reactions. Their results suggest that exchange rate movements and investors’ expectations of an economic slowdown were the main driver of stock market reactions to the referendum result. Analyzing the effects of the Brexit referendum on the exchange rate, Belke et al. (2018) assessed that an increase in the probability of Brexit decreases the value of the British pound. Caporale et al. (2018) find that the Brexit referendum led to a significant change in the degree of persistence of the FTSE 100 Implied Volatility Index and of the British pound’s implied volatilities vis-à-vis the euro and the US dollar, respectively. Studying the effect of the Brexit vote on intraday currencies, Dao et al. (2019) observe a substantial decrease in volatility transmission between British sterling and the euro following the Brexit vote due to lower levels of market integration. Pilbeam (2019) shows that the Brexit referendum caused a significant depreciation of the British pound against both the US dollar and the euro. Moreover, analyzing the impact of Brexit-related news on the spot exchange rate of the British pound, Korus and Celebi (2019) find that “bad” Brexit news (higher probability of hard Brexit) are associated with a depreciation whereas “good” Brexit news appreciates the pound sterling against the euro. Focusing on corporate bond markets in the UK as well as in the euro area (EA), Kadiric and Korus (2019) find that the Brexit referendum result had a significant impact on credit spreads. The announcement of the referendum result led to increasing yield spreads in both markets. Furthermore, differentiating between financial and non-financial economic sectors, their results indicate that the impact of Brexit is stronger for financials than for non-financials, especially in the EA where corporate bond spreads in the non-financial sector were hardly or not at all affected by the referendum result. Following up on this work, Welfens et al. (2019) further differentiate corporate bond market in the UK by introducing AA and BBB rating categories as representatives of a higher and lower credit rating quality. Their results suggest that market participants did not make a distinction between AA- and BBB-rated bonds, since corporate bond spreads were affected by the announcement of the referendum result irrespective of the rating category. Belke et al. (2018) elaborate on the impact of Brexit on financial markets, including 10-year government bond yields and sovereign CDS for 10-year bonds. Confirming the results presented by the Bank of England (2016), they find that an increase in the Brexit probability led to a strong decrease in long-term interest rates for the UK and additional “risk-free” countries, respectively, although their results indicate that sovereign CDS for 10-year bonds increased in the UK due to Brexit. Chadha et al. (2018) confirm these results. Focusing on the long-term gilt yield, they find that bond yields decline in the direct aftermath of the referendum. Their findings suggest that Brexit-related uncertainty put upward pressure on UK government bond yields. However, the anticipation of expansionary monetary policy measures appears to have offset any change in risk premiums. Thus, using long-term yields might not be an appropriate way to capture and analyze risk conditions in the government bond markets (see Bernoth et al. (2012) and Gale and Orszag (2003)). On account of this, the present study uses yield spreads as an indicator of a risk premium, calculated as the difference between the respective government bond yield and a “risk-free” rate; in this case, the OIS rate is used. The risk premium is expected to embody the risk conditions exposure of the UK and selected EA countries. The frequency of data is daily, covering the period from October 1, 2014, to March 29, 2019. The choice of the risk premium determinants is mainly based on the theoretical background and on the existing literature in this field. This analysis addresses several questions: firstly, did the UK’s decision to leave the EU (Brexit) have an immediate direct effect on sovereign risk in the UK and other EA countries? Secondly, has Brexit triggered some changes in the pricing of sovereign risk due to expected challenges in the future economic development in the UK and selected EA countries? This paper offers several contributions to the existing literature on the determinants of sovereign bond yield spreads. Firstly, this is to my knowledge the first study that focuses on the potential effects of the Brexit referendum result on risk premiums in the UK and European government bond markets. Secondly, it extends the existing literature on the effects of Brexit on financial markets. Thirdly, analyzing risk premiums in the UK and the EA government bond markets simultaneously allows for direct comparison of Brexit effects in those markets. Fourth, estimating the period before and the period after the announcement of the Brexit referendum result enables an analysis of potential changes in the investors’ risk assessment. Finally, this paper employs a newly developed regional risk aversion variable in order to capture the willingness of investors to bear county-specific risks. There are three key findings of this paper. Firstly, the announcement of the Brexit referendum result led to an immediate increase of the risk premium in the UK and some other selected European government bond markets. Secondly, the results suggest that there is a considerable change in the importance of the determinants of sovereign bond spreads due to the change in the risk pricing triggered by the Brexit referendum result. This holds particularly for the UK, where the credit default risk and risk aversion play a much more important role in the post-referendum period (the period after the referendum and before the day of Brexit implementation on December 31, 2020) than they did before. Thirdly, the empirical results indicate that using regional rather than international risk aversion might be more appropriate in order to capture investors’ risk assessment, especially when analyzing euro area countries. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers the theoretical background and gives an overview of the related literature. Section 3 presents the data used in this study. Section 4 is the core of the paper and analyzes the impact of Brexit, pricing developments, and their implications. Section 5 provides an additional robustness analysis, while Sect. 6 concludes.",

The basic idea behind the currency demand approach is that goods and services sold in the shadow economy are paid for in cash and that, using a cash demand function, it is possible to estimate such goods and services provided and performed, respectively, in return for cash and thus to calculate the volume (value added) of the shadow economy. The MIMIC approach is based on the idea that the size of the shadow economy is not a directly observable figure, but that it is possible to approximate it using quantitatively measurable causes of working in the underground economy (such as the tax burden and the amount of regulation) and using indicators (such as cash and the official labor force participation rate), in which shadow economic activities are reflected. As the MIMIC method only enables relative orders of magnitude of the underground economy of individual countries to be calculated, some SE values calculated with the help of the cash approach are necessary to convert/calibrate the SE values into absolute ones (i.e., in percentage of official GDP or in billions of Euros).
 MIMIC estimation procedure. Source: Medina and Schneider (2018) In the following, the MIMIC estimation procedure (see also Fig. 1) is briefly explainedFootnote 2:

 The first step is that the shadow economy remains an unobserved phenomenon (latent variable) which is estimated using the causes of illicit behavior, e.g., the tax burden and regulation intensity, and indicators reflecting illicit activities, e.g., currency demand and official work time. This procedure “produces” only relative estimates of the size of the shadow economy. In the second step, the currency demand method is used to calibrate the relative SE estimates into absolute figures by using two or three values of the absolute size of the shadow economy from CDA estimations. The following presented estimates are reached using the MIMIC and currency demand methods.Footnote 3",8
19.0,2.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,18 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-022-00536-7,The capital tax paradox in a greening economy,May 2022,Kirill Borissov,Lucas Bretschger,Aleksey Minabutdinov,Male,Male,Male,Male,"There is a rich literature on the optimal taxation of capital. The topic has fascinated many economic theorists, while it has tended to confound economic policymakers. The conundrum is that in reality all major economies tax capital, while a major strand of economic theory concludes that capital should not actually be taxed at all (Judd 1985; Chamley 1986; Chari et al. 2020). The basic intuition for the zero-tax result is that, to maximize efficiency, i.e., to minimize distortions by taxation in an economy, goods ought to be taxed according to their price elasticities. In a framework with intertemporal optimization over an infinite time horizon and with growth being based on capital accumulation, capital supply is very elastic and even infinitely elastic in the long run; a capital income tax would thus induce the “strongest” possible tax distortion. However, this class of models abstracts from various important issues. First, human life is finite and inheritance is a significant source of lifetime inequality. Piketty and Saez (2013) show that under these conditions, there is an optimal tax on inheritance. Second, these authors also argue that in reality agents cannot transfer resources across periods at a fixed and riskless interest rate. With such uninsurable risk, a lifetime capital tax is a useful addition to the inheritance tax. Third, the zero-tax results crucially depends on the assumption of a utilitarian social welfare function and the behavior of the social planner (or the assumed political process). Acemoglu et al. (2011) show that with an independent political process, the best equilibrium for the citizens involves long-run capital taxation provided that the politicians are less patient than the citizens. Kalsbach (2022) derives an optimal capital tax in an economy with the two distinct classes of workers and savers having different preferences with respect to intertemporal optimization. Optimal capital taxation is also a central topic in environmental and resource economics, especially in a dynamic setup. Groth and Schou (2007) analyze the effects of taxing non-renewable resources with those of taxing capital; they find that capital taxes do not affect the long-run growth rate, whereas resource taxes are decisive for growth. Relating capital taxes to pollution becomes obvious when the use of capital is polluting. In the Pigouvian tradition of environmental economics, it is well known that a negative externality has to be internalized either by setting appropriate taxes or by implementing a permit market. This is where we start our analysis and where the paper makes a contribution to the literature. We adopt a simple model of endogenous growth of the AK-type with polluting capital introduced earlier in Borissov and Bretschger (2021). We impose a fixed budget for aggregate emissions, which can be thought of as the remaining carbon in current climate policy. Pollution quantity is governed by pollution intensity and by abatement efficiency, which is improving over time due to technical progress. We state the optimization problem for both the social optimum and the decentralized economy. The paper provides analytical solutions and numerical applications of the base model. For our endogenously growing economy subject to stringent climate policy, we derive a novel and surprising result on capital taxation, which we call a “paradox”. The paradox is that in our setup, long-run capital and consumption are inversely related to the initial capital stock. From this, it follows that positive capital taxation does not harm the economy but actually raises long-run consumption and production. Behind this “capital tax paradox” lies a simple but deep intuition. With a binding emission budget and abatement efficiency growing over time, early abundance of capital is not a blessing but a curse. In an initially wealthy economy, the emission budget is used up too early and too quickly. For welfare optimization, it is preferable to have a large capital stock at a later stage, when abatement efficiency has become sufficiently large. These findings contradict the cited earlier results of literature on capital taxation which can be explained by that fact that earlier models have abstracted from environmental problems which is a serious omission in times of climate change and associated policies. The paper also provides novel results on the impact of pollution intensity and the rate of technical progress on the greening of the economy and the pollution permit prices. In the quantitative part, we calibrate model and study growth and carbon prices under different assumptions on the basic model parameters. We perform these calculations because there is widespread concern that stringent decarbonization will severely harm long-term economic development and disproportionately affect less developed countries. On a positive note, there is growing hope that new technological solutions can support a rapid transition of the global economy to a sustainable state. The present paper aims to address these issues in a second part using the framework from the theory part. In the present context, we will consider three topics. First, we study the impact of the stringency of climate policy on economic development. Second, we assess the different effects of climate policies for developed and less developed countries. Third, the setup is used to show the importance of the technology parameters, i.e., capital productivity and abatement efficiency. The purpose of the second paper part is to show the robustness of the present approach and to contribute to the general understanding of the derived paradoxes. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the underlying theory in a concise manner. Section 3 presents our theoretical results on capital taxation and pollution permit prices. In Section 4, we calibrate the model and derive numerical results for the growth issues at hand. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of the main results.",1

Soon after, the governments of Moldova and Georgia followed suit. With a population of more than 40 million, Ukraine is—by far—larger than any other potential candidate country with the exception of Turkey which has a population of more than 80 million. The accession of Ukraine to the EU or the rejection thereof will have profound and complex consequences in both the political and economic spheres. Many of these consequences are hard to predict. In this note, we look at a computable implication: We investigate the impact an accession of Ukraine to the European Union would have on the distribution of power within the Council of the European Union and compare this with selected other accession scenarios. Since Ukraine is comparable in terms of population size with Spain or Poland, two of the larger current EU member countries, it is interesting to learn the extent to which an accession of Ukraine might change or even disturb the balance of power in the Council. In the following, we measure the influence a country has in the Council by employing the Banzhaf index (for an in-depth explanation of the index itself, please see below or Felsenthal and Machover (1998), Taylor and Pacelli (2010), Kirsch (2016a), and the references provided therein). Changes in the Banzhaf power index were also particularly relevant in the case of BREXIT due to which it was the relatively larger EU countries in the EU27 which gained power, while smaller countries were losing power (Kirsch 2016b); relative winners in the power changes were Spain and Portugal in particular. To the extent that the EU budget lines are influenced by such relative power changes, one may expect that the EU budget will show a change in favor of those countries which are the political power winners in relative terms as measured by the Banzhaf index—an issue which will not be analyzed further herein. The analytical interest of the present contribution places a focus on changes in the internal power balance within the Council of the European Union the context of a future enlargement concerning the accession of Ukraine; indeed, the emphasis is on those policy fields in the EU—which concerns Council of the European Union meetings—which involve majority voting, which excludes issues such as taxation or foreign policy which require unanimous voting. Section 2 takes a closer look at voting requirements in the context of the Council of the European Union and presents results for an enlarged EU (i.e., including Ukraine and some other countries). Section 3 offers basic conclusions.",3

Siklos,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Twice in the past decade alarms have been raised warning us that the forces of globalization might be reversed. The Great Financial Crisis of 2008–9 (GFC) was expected to reduce the openness of economies around the globe. While the near financial meltdown in the second half of 2008 would produce a sharp fall in global trade (e.g., see Baldwin 2009) the slump would prove to be temporary. Despite worries in some quarters about a return to ‘beggar-thy-neighbour’ policies, perhaps in the form of ‘currency wars’ (e.g., see Blanchard 2017), the eventual reaction of central banks, and a determination on the part of the authorities to improve financial regulation and supervision, no doubt contributed to forestalling a reversal of the forces that favor greater financial globalization. Second, the pandemic of 2020 generated interruptions in global supply chains and renewed worries over the stability of the global financial system. The emergence of COVID at a time when populism is seen to be on the rise, fueled perhaps by globalization (e.g., see Rodrik 2020a) has also raised the prospect that a reversal in global trade may eventually take hold. Early indications based on widely used indicators such as Swiss Economic Institute’s Globalisation Index (Gygli et al. 2019; Dreher 2006),Footnote 1 reveal a bending of the curve since an acceleration of trade and financial globalization beginning in the 1990s. However, there is no evidence of a reversal as this is written. It is too soon, of course, to declare that globalization will be reversed, this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is natural to ask whether there are lessons from an earlier period of globalization. Over a century ago, a sequence of events apparently heralded the end of an earlier era of rapid trade and financial integration. That period, sometimes referred to as the first era of globalization, has been studied previously (e.g., see Bordo et al. 2010). Soon after the first era of globalization is believed to have peaked, around the eve of World War I, the global economy would suffer the consequences of the Great Influenza that began at war’s end in 1918 and lasted until 1920. Not surprisingly, the current pandemic has rekindled interest in the topic of globalization, especially in trade which is seen as more vulnerable to interruptions due to health motivated restrictions on the transportation of goods. As a result, some have pointed to the potential risks of a looming de-globalization linked to the current pandemics (e.g., Antràs et al. 2020). Whether and how the current episode of globalization differs from the experience of the 1930s remains unsettled, but many factors were at play (e.g., see Tooze 2014; Accominotti and Eichengreen 2016; Bordo et al. 1999; O’Rourke 2019). Globalization, of course, is also reflected in the evolution of the financial system. Finance operates largely electronically and is more immune to interruptions of the kind triggered by a global virus. This is true now and, as telegraph usage spread and travel became much speedier a century ago, was also a feature of economic life during the first decade of the twentieth century. Today, the combined impact of looser monetary and fiscal policies worldwide is also leading some to worry about rapidly rising levels of sovereign debt. No comparable response can be detected in response to the Great Influenza of 1918–20 though the global conflict that preceded it impacted debt levels.Footnote 2 Unlike today, when granular data are more readily available allowing for a precise and methodical analysis of the eventual consequences of the COVID-19 virus, data limitations are more severe when the consequences of the pandemic of the early twentieth century are considered.Footnote 3 That said, there is some micro level evidence from that time for a few countries that documents how large was the health shock arising from the Great Influenza of 1918–2910 with a range of economic consequences ranging from the short-lived to well over a decade (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2014; Velde 2020; Guimbeau et al. 2020). Interest in the economic consequences of the Great Influenza has recently been rekindled. Nevertheless, as far as I am aware, no one has explored quantitatively how, or if, trade and financial globalization were impacted by the earlier global pandemic. Indeed, several retrospectives about the globalization phenomenon do not explicitly mention the 1918–1920 pandemic (e.g., Baldwin and Martin 1999; Bordo et al. 1999; Schularick and Steger 2006; Rodrik 2020b). Other events, notably the negotiations over the Versailles Treaty following the end of World War I, play a much larger role in retrospectives of the time though not all of these mention the Great Influenza (e.g., Macmillan 2001) in spite of the fact that all of the main characters in Paris at the time, including Keynes, would catch the flu. Indeed, the “…conference became a vector for contagion.” (Carter 2020, p. 64).Footnote 4 Briefly, I find that the state of globalization was quite heterogeneous in 17 advanced and emerging markets considered in this study. To be sure, integration of goods and financial markets was on the upswing beginning the last decades of the nineteenth century, but it was uneven across countries. More importantly, the economic impact of the 1918–1920 pandemic appears to be sensitive according to whether a country was among the combatants in World War I. In terms of globalization the countries directly implicated in the war suffered most from the potential gains from greater openness in trade and financial integration. And yet, the setback to globalization in several, but not all, countries examined in this study was only temporarily. It is difficult to find scarring effects, at least at the macroeconomic level, as a result of the Great Influenza. To be sure, then as now, the benefits and costs of globalization continue to be debated and it will always remain problematic to identify pandemic related economic effects from the economic consequences of World War I. Moreover, while David Hume may have been one of the first to argue that “…kingdom that has a large import and export, must abound more with industry…” (Copley and Edgar 1993, p. 162) not everyone is convinced that globalization in any of its forms is economically beneficial for all concerned. However, globalization nowadays is merely the latest with several precedents reflecting the fact that “…globalizations are cumulative, but also subject to crises and reversals” (Darwin 2020, p. xivQuery). Of course, it can be perilous to draw too many lessons for the most recent pandemic. There are important asymmetries between conditions at the beginning of the twentieth century and the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Nevertheless, it is striking that, despite a global economic depression during the 1930s followed by a second world war, globalization in trade and, eventually finance including a return to freer capital mobility, would resume quickly after the end of the Great Influenza. Indeed, although the first globalization was eventually reversed for a time during the 1930s, the impact of the 1918–1920 pandemic appears to have been transitory. Given the differences between conditions a century ago and today this cannot be taken as a prediction for what to expect on the other side of the COVID-19 crisis. Hence, de-globalization is not a foregone conclusion. We should also not lose sight of the parallels between the early twentieth century and today. Keynes, in preparing readers for his critique of the Versailles Treaty, pointed out that “[T]he inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth…[H]e could secure forthwith …cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country…” (Keynes 1919, p. 10). Similarly, while we refer nowadays to global supply chains, at the time World War I began, it was noted that “dependence of manufactures on an even larger number of raw material inputs…demanded a ‘planetary’ economy.” (Darwin 2020, p. 341) Finally, it appears that the same countervailing forces pushing back against globalization today were also at play back in the early 1900s. “Politics in recent years has erected walls that restrict all these movements.” (Staley 1971, p. 51).Footnote 5 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the economics literature dealing with the 1918–1920 influenza. Given that previous research dealing with various facets of the globalization phenomenon is vast I limit attention to a few select references. Readers will be able to explore the broader literature from these sources. Section 3 introduces the data, and some summary indicators are discussed, prior to conducting an econometric analysis. The focus of the exercise, supported by existing economic theory, is on the impact of the 1918–1920 pandemic on openness and financial integration, conditional on inflation and several other controls, including the impact of World War I, the Gold Standard, and political factors. The resort to annual data, the relative brevity of the period when influenza raged around the globe, and some uncertainty surrounding the precision of estimates of mortality and combat deaths to name two factors, argue for relying on a menu of techniques to ensure some robustness and reliability in the econometric estimates obtained. Section 4 concludes.",1

The ‘founding fathers’ were concerned about the possibility of ‘fiscal dominance’ affecting the new currency. These concerns were understandable. There are many historical examples of countries with high public debt levels seeking to reduce the burden of this debt via policies such as financial repression, exchange rate devaluation, central bank purchases of sovereign bonds and loose monetary policies. By engineering high inflation, the latter policies can at least partially help to ‘inflate away’ a large public debt burden.Footnote 1 Indeed, during the decades that preceded the introduction of the euro, participant countries in the European Monetary System that had higher public debt levels tended to have systematically higher inflation rates. For this reason, the Maastricht Treaty contained several safeguards to prevent fiscal problems from undermining the euro and to separate the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies. An excessive deficit procedure was introduced, policed by the European Commission. The ECB was set up to be a highly independent organisation with price stability as its primary objective. Consequently, it was banned from providing monetary financing to states. Despite these initial intentions, there are now a number of important interactions between fiscal and monetary policy in the euro area. Mario Draghi’s ‘whatever it takes’ speech in 2012, followed by the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme, had a profound influence on euro area sovereign debt markets, with markets coming to see the ECB as a ‘sovereign bond buyer of last resort’. Subsequently, the ECB’s asset purchase programmes saw the Eurosystem acquire a huge portfolio of euro area sovereign bonds. The introduction of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in 2020 meant a further ratchet up in these holdings. This paper discusses the evolution of fiscal-monetary interactions in the euro area and evaluates the implications of the monetary financing prohibition for future ECB policies, focusing in particular on the views of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as expressed in the Gauweiler judgement on OMT and the Weiss judgement on sovereign bond purchases by the Eurosystem. The focus is on reviewing the evidence and exploring the relevant legal issues rather than on presenting a statistical analysis. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the treatment of fiscal policy issues in the EU’s Treaties and the perception of sovereign risk prior to the founding of the euro and during its first years. Section 3 discusses the events that led to the announcement of the OMT programme and its implications for the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies. Section 4 discusses the Eurosystem’s sovereign bond purchases and their implications for fiscal policy. Section 5 describes the ECJ’s interpretation of the monetary financing clause in the Weiss and Gauweiler cases and its implications for the ECB. Finally, Section 6 previews future developments in this area.

J. Welfens,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"For reasons to do with physics, the electricity market must ensure an equality of supply and demand in the network at all times. Therefore, electricity market regulations in OECD countries are generally such that the supply side adjusts to demand curves that change over the course of the day, week, and month; regulatory problems generally occur at the high-voltage and regional/local distribution levels where there are natural monopoly problems (falling marginal costs with increased output from distribution companies), and therefore, price regulation is carried out by national regulators—in the EU27 in line with European Union (EU) frameworks. Within the EU27+UK+Norway area, significant amounts of electricity are also imported and exported at times, and in the first half of 2022—particularly during the summer months—France especially saw uncharacteristically high import volumes, rather than its usual export of electricity to other EU countries. At its core, this was due to the fact that in the summer of 2022, approximately half of France’s nuclear power plants were unable to produce electricity or could only produce reduced amounts of electricity (compared to normal output) due to necessary scheduled repairs and because of unusually low river water levels in several parts of the country. Amongst other things, this increased the demand for electricity in Germany, with substantial amounts of electricity being exported to France at times. In the merit-order approach—as the usual method for determining the electricity supply curve for a specific time window—the rule is that, especially in the case of short-term peaks in demand, gas-fired electricity producers who can react quickly to increases in demand are the last electricity supplier still to gain a foothold on the supply-side. With a low-profit margin, on the one hand, determining the equilibrium price on the electricity market on the other—due to the relatively low costs of nuclear, coal, and renewable energy electricity, this often results in very high profits for the corresponding electricity producers. These high profits (often referred to as “excess profits” in the public debate, which makes the issue sound like a—non-existent—monopoly problem) arise in a market with a homogeneous good, with competition existing at the power generation level. One of the characteristics of the market is that, in the interest of optimal load management or demand timing, electricity distribution companies have entered into contracts with certain industrial companies to offer short-term electricity supply interruptions in return for de facto compensation—visible in the form of a lower electricity price or a rebate. The electricity price in Germany and other EU countries increased very significantly in the first half of 2022, with the electricity and gas price developments running visibly parallel to each other (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2); in other words, there is a positive correlation. Governments could counter gas price shocks and associated electricity price shocks, in particular, via transfers to private households, whose consumption expenditures can thus be supported; or use subsidies in the area of gas-fired power generation in the electricity market, which depresses the price of electricity and thus makes more production profitable while relieving the burden on private households. Corresponding macro-modeling approaches have been conspicuously absent thus far, and such approaches are developed here with a view to determining optimal policy recommendations. In this way, one can analyze, amongst other things, the development of real income, employment, consumption, and government deficits in each case for alternative policy interventions. An important contribution to the debate on the rationality of national and EU policies in Europe. Gas price development (daily values, wholesale prices) in Germany, 2010–2022 Electricity price development in Germany, 2015–2022 (€ per KWh) From a theoretical point of view, the increase in gas prices significantly drives the development of electricity prices in Germany and other EU countries, with electricity price shocks having to be considered in terms of their effect on the industry as well as on private households—ultimately in terms of consumption. In the macroeconomic literature, as in the DSGE macro model, a distinction is usually made between (Ricardian) households that are creditworthy and those whose spending is strictly limited by wage and transfer income. In particular, the macro model aims to illustrate the differences in impact between a gas price subsidy on the one hand and the policy option of higher transfers to households on the other. Beyond the special problems associated with the French energy sector, significant further electricity price increases became apparent in the German electricity market from July 2022, particularly in the form of sharp forward price increases for electricity in 2023. The electricity price for Q1 2023—if the forward price is an undistorted indicator of the future spot electricity price—will rise to a good six times the price of Q1 2022, which is likely to become a huge burden on private households and many electricity-intensive manufacturing companies. In Germany, a special incentive regulation has been in place since 2007 for electricity networks in the area of the high-voltage grid and the regional or local distribution grid. The electricity price formation itself via the Leipzig electricity exchange (with the merit-order approach) is classified as unproblematic by Germany’s Federal Network Agency (2021) [translation by the authors]: 
“While competition works among electricity suppliers and electricity generation is marketed via an electricity exchange, electricity and gas networks are among the so-called “natural monopolies” in which competition has only a limited effect or is completely suspended. This is because, as a rule, it does not make economic sense to set up parallel electricity or gas pipeline networks operated by different companies in a given supply area. From a business point of view, too, there is usually no incentive to set up a parallel pipeline structure to compete with an incumbent supplier. However, to ensure that network operators do not make monopoly profits and that the networks are still operated as cost-efficiently as possible, electricity and gas network operators are regulated.
 
In the interests of private consumers, commercial and industrial customers, and energy supply companies, charges for the transmission of electricity and gas must be calculated transparently and appropriately. In incentive regulation, the regulatory authority does not determine the individual network charge (price on the price sheet).”
 However, in 2022, it became clear that the electricity price formation and the electricity generation level in the electricity sector pose a serious problem, mainly due to the Russo-Ukrainian War and the abnormal export behavior of Gazprom, the Russian gas producer and exporter. Gazprom has arbitrarily cut supply volumes to EU countries. This has made it necessary for gas distribution companies in EU27 countries to buy gas on the world market at significantly higher prices than those stipulated in the supply contract with Gazprom. The merit-order approach to the electricity market, which is widespread in Europe, is proving problematic in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Merit order means that a unit price for electricity is set in an auction model in which the last type of energy still needed to meet demand determines the price for all power plants. In normal times, the merit-order approach is economically sound and provides incentives for the expansion of low-cost energy types, such as renewables (there is, however, one specific problem concerning the expansion of renewables in the merit-order approach if cost differentials between renewable energy power plants and gas-fired power plants, assuming that the latter are the marginal suppliers in the market; see Appendix 1, which suggests that an electricity price cap could reinforce incentives for the expansion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources). However, when a foreign gas supplier with considerable market power in the EU gas market, namely Gazprom, drives up the EU gas price through targeted supply cuts in violation of existing contracts, the merit-order model is characterized by political distorting impulses coming from Russia. On many days or at many different times of the day, gas proves to be the last energy type still used for power generation in the merit-order approach, which, however, leads to the unusually very high electricity price in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war or the Russian gas supply restrictions. Due to the war or partial Russian supply boycott shocks, the gas price in the EU has increased enormously since the summer of 2022. The merit-order approach in the electricity market, which is widespread in the EU27 and the UK, therefore, proves to be economically controversial in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war, as the forward price for gas, which has risen massively since summer 2022 (it is usually a fairly good predictive proxy for the future spot price on the gas market), leads to a very high gas price in the medium term. This also massively increases the price of electricity when the merit-order approach is used, provided, as is often the case, that gas is the last type of energy still realized in electricity generation at certain hours of the day or on certain days. The impression one gets, particularly in Germany, in the summer of 2022 is that policymakers would like to “tax away” the excess profits generated by non-gas-based electricity producers and recycle the revenues to households. These circumstances lead to quasi-artificially increased returns for all other types of energy used in power generation and, ultimately, to exorbitantly high, medium-term electricity prices for households and business as well as the state. These high returns have nothing to do with a monopoly position on the part of non-gas power producers, which could be used to support the argument for state intervention with regard to “excess profits,” but here such returns are simply an expression of the relatively steep supply curve near the equilibrium quantity. The following effects result from sudden increases in gas or electricity prices: Massively increased excess returns for electricity producers using types of energy other than gas, i.e., electricity from nuclear plants, coal, hydropower, and other renewables—the latter being prioritized in Germany according to the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG))—are thus always part of the electricity supply. Due to the increasing use of renewables, the merit-order approach could lead to decreasing electricity prices for many years—before 2022 (see, e.g., Sensfuß, 2013). From an economic perspective, renewable electricity production can technically be viewed as reducing the demand for other types of electricity, which amounts to a reduction in the equilibrium price in the electricity market. A short-term expansion of renewable energies on a significant scale in Germany in 2022/23 is not to be expected due to long approval periods; in the medium and long term, however, it is. In the event of a massive and sustained increase in the relative price of gas and the relative price of electricity (electricity price/gross domestic product deflator), those production sectors that are relatively gas- or electricity-intensive—e.g., steel and fertilizer production and aluminum production, respectively—will become increasingly unprofitable. These are also capital- and knowledge-intensive sectors of the economy that employ a high proportion of skilled workers. The stock of electric cars in the fleets of commercial enterprises or the state as well as of private households will be massively devalued in the event of a massive increase in electricity prices over several years; the purchase of new low-CO2 vehicles of this kind will then drop massively; the stock market value of companies manufacturing electric vehicles will plummet, and some suppliers of electric vehicles will likely exit the market—a medium- or long-term market concentration will then occur. Loan financing of vehicle fleets in companies or for private buyers will become almost impossible with massively increased relative electricity prices. As a result, the planned reduction of CO2 emissions in the transport sector will be fundamentally jeopardized in Germany and the EU. The massive yield increases of non-gas suppliers in the electricity market in the context of Russian gas supply cuts are distortions—as will be shown below—that should be countered by moving temporarily to a modified, regulation of the electricity market, with the EU and EU member states cooperating swiftly in the re-regulation. In addition, the EU should impose a gas import tariff on Russia (Roeger and Welfens 2022), which could significantly lower Gazprom’s net supply price, while the state would have additional revenue to partially financially compensate low-income households and the hardest hit small and medium-sized firms. An EU import duty on Gazprom’s gas supplies should have been agreed and implemented by the EU as early as spring 2022—but nothing happened here, and so Russia was able to strengthen its strategic position of dominance in the EU gas market by cutting volumes vis-à-vis individual EU states. The following analysis briefly addresses the traditional merit-order model in the electricity sector in Section 2 and addresses a reasonable policy option to limit electricity price increases in Germany and other EU countries in the third section. In the fourth section, the macroeconomic simulation analysis on gas price subsidy versus increased transfers to households is presented. There are several new findings with respect to key economic variables. The fifth section concludes with policy conclusions. As regards the expansion of renewable energy-based electricity generation, it is shown in Appendix 1 that the cost-differential between gas-fired power stations and electricity generated from renewable energy sources is critical—large cost differentials imply barriers for the expansion of electricity generation from renewable sources unless there is a price cap and price regulation in the electricity market.",3

19.0,4.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,07 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-022-00543-8,"FDI, liquidity, and political uncertainty: A global analysis",October 2022,Marvin Jahn,Paul Stricker,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, research on the effect of political uncertainty on foreign direct investment (FDI) has proliferated. In particular, the adoption of new measuring methods of political uncertainty has revived this literature strand. Julio and Yook (2016) firstly use the timing of elections to measure the effect of political uncertainty on FDI and find that quarterly US FDI significantly drops before and during elections.Footnote 1 Chen et al. (2019) and Honig (2020) confirm these findings using a global sample and annual aggregate FDI inflows. Others use newly developed uncertainty measures like the Economic Policy Uncertainty index (EPU) by Baker et al. (2016) and the World Uncertainty Index (WUI) by Ahir et al. (2022) to confirm the negative effect of uncertainty on FDI (Avom et al. 2020; Canh et al. 2020; Hsieh et al. 2019; Nguyen and Lee 2021). At their core, these studies are motivated by the real options theory, which states that investors hold back their investment when confronted with uncertainty about the future political environment (Azevedo et al. 2019; Bernanke 1983; Rodrik 1991; Stokey 2016). In a nutshell, the rationale of these theoretical models is that investments are not carried out as long as the information gained through waiting is more valuable than the costs of idle capital. This outcome is contingent on the irreversibility of the investment, as more liquid assets can easily be withdrawn should the uncertainty resolve in an unfavorable environment. Thus, studies investigating the effect of political uncertainty on FDI implicitly assume that their measure for FDI captures somewhat irreversible investments. Given that most studies use aggregate FDI as the dependent variable, this assumption is likely to be false since it is fairly well documented that not all FDI is irreversible. Instead, aggregate FDI inflows also embody highly liquid financial flows, which behave similarly to portfolio debt flows (Blanchard et al. 2016; Kerner 2014). For instance, in 2004, up to 43% of US foreign affiliates’ assets were held in cash or in assets readily convertible to cash (Kerner and Lawrence 2014). Against this backdrop, we re-examine the effect of political uncertainty on FDI using different subtypes of FDI with different degrees of liquidity. We use disaggregated data on equity investments, reinvested earnings, and intra-company debt and gauge their relative degree of liquidity using descriptive statistics and a simple estimation approach. Following the real options theory, we expect more liquid subtypes of FDI to be less responsive to political uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, the three different types of financing have not received much attention in the literature until now. While other subtypes of FDI like greenfield and brownfield investments (Calderón et al. 2004; Harms and Méon 2018; Iamsiraroj and Ulubaşoğlu 2015; Wang and Wong 2009) and sectoral FDI flows (Alfaro and Charlton 2007; Chakraborty and Nunnenkamp 2008; Vu et al. 2008; Vu and Noy 2009; Walsh and Yu 2010) are extensively researched, the distinction between equity, reinvested earnings and debt is largely overlooked (Lundan 2006). This is somewhat surprising since this distinction has policy relevance. The FDI life cycle theory suggests that any FDI endeavor starts with an initial equity (or intra-company debt) investment (Kogut 1986). Any follow-up investments financed through reinvested earnings are conditional on the initial equity investment. Given the high sunk costs of the entry investment, firms tend to be more selective with their initial investments than with their follow-up investments (Barry 2018). As a result, policymakers are generally more interested in attracting new equity-financed projects than follow-up investments based on reinvested earnings.Footnote 2 Furthermore, the distinction is especially relevant for developing countries, as only equity and debt investments infuse fresh foreign capital into the country, while reinvested earnings recycle money that has been in the economy anyway (Kerner 2014). By investigating the effect of political uncertainty on equity investments, reinvested earnings, and intra-company debt, we contribute to two strands of literature. First, we contribute to the literature surrounding political uncertainty and FDI (Canh et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2019; Choi et al. 2020; Honig 2020; Hsieh et al. 2019). In particular, by distinguishing between different subtypes according to liquidity, we are indirectly testing the predictions of the real options theory. Second, by estimating the effects of political uncertainty on different financial flows, we also contribute to the literature on the capital structuring in affiliates. While researchers usually employ firm-level data to elaborate the determinants of the different subtypes of FDI, we broaden the perspective by using aggregates of subtypes (Cull and Xu 2005; Demirbag et al. 2015; Desai et al. 2005, 2007; Nguyen 2016; Nguyen and Rugman 2015). To explore how Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) react to uncertainty and which funds they hold back when uncertainty arises, we deploy quarterly data for equity investments, reinvested earnings, and intra-company debt ranging from 1996 to 2017, covering 76 countries. Following the previous literature, we use election dates to identify periods of high uncertainty and modulate different levels of uncertainty by interacting the election variable with a dummy for a leadership change and a set of indicators for institutional quality. We also check our findings’ robustness by employing the WUI as a more general measure for uncertainty. Since the previous literature found that the investment deterring effect of uncertainty is particularly pronounced in developing countries, we form subsamples according to the income level of the host country (Chen et al. 2019; Honig 2020).Footnote 3 We find a negative effect of elections on reinvested earnings but not on equity and intra-company debt in the full sample. This effect persists while adding a vast amount of control variables and is robust to using different transformations of the dependent variable. A subsequent subsample analysis finds that the effect is driven mainly by high-income countries, where reinvested earnings undergo a sizable cut during an election period. In middle-to-lower income countries, the uncertainty during elections affects equity flows instead of reinvested earnings, but the strength of the effect is moderated by institutional quality. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Literature” reviews the literature on uncertainty and FDI. “On the irreversibility of subtypes of FDI” introduces our liquidity measures and presents our hypotheses. “Data” introduces the data used. “Methodology” explains the methodology, while “Results” presents and discusses the results. “Conclusion” concludes.",

Negative interest rate policies under review,October 2022,Joscha Beckmann,Klaus-Jürgen Gern,Nils Jannsen,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"In June 2014, the ECB was among the first major central banks to lower its policy rate into negative territory (-0.1% on the deposit facility rate). The deposit facility rate was subsequently reduced further four times – most recently in September 2019 to -0.5% – and the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) has become one among several unconventional tools in the ECB’s monetary policy toolkit. Unconventional measures, such as forward guidance and quantitative easing, were introduced because conventional interest policies were constrained by the zero lower bound. All of these measures can transmit via a set of various channels to financial markets, output, and inflation. Compared to other unconventional measures NIRP has a somewhat more direct link to banks and credit supply. From a theoretical perspective, NIRP works similar to conventional interest rate cuts in positive territory. In principle, the transmission channels of interest rate cuts, for example via deposit and lending rate, to output and inflation do not change in negative territory. One key difference is, however, that holding cash, which offers a zero nominal return, becomes more attractive when interest rates are negative. While cash hording in theory lowers the impact of NIRP, there is no evidence that increases in cash holdings have significantly impeded the transmission mechanism of negative rates anywhere until now. In practice, the difficulty for banks to charge negative rates on deposits of firms or private households weighs on bank lending and constrains the application of NIRP. If the pass-through to interest rates on deposits is weaker than to bank lending rates or to other assets of banks, NIRP compresses margins and weighs on bank profitability. Moreover, profitability of banks might be also negatively affected by payments they have to make to the central bank on excess reserves. The resulting reduction in banks’ net worth tends to reduce credit supply and, at some point, further interest rate cuts could become contractionary with respect to its effect on bank lending. This point is sometimes called the reversal interest rate, which represents the effective lower bound for NIRP. The ECB implemented measures to alleviate the negative impact of NIRP on bank profitability. Entering negative territory with interest rates the first time can have a disproportional effect on expectations and risk-taking. If NIRP is not expected to be used by a central bank as an instrument, it will have more than proportional effects on expectations because it will shift the perceived lower bound for policy rates and provide a signal about the future stance of monetary policy. However, this is only a one-time effect that takes place when NIRP is implemented the first time. NIRP can also have a strong impact on risk-taking if economic agents switch to riskier assets just to avoid negative interest rates on their deposits due to psychological reasons. Higher risk-taking can amplify the impact of NIRP but is at the same time also a concern as excessive risk-taking can undermine financial stability. In this paper, we discuss NIRP in the euro area based on theoretical considerations and the empirical evidence. In Section 2, we give a brief overview on the implementation of NIRP in the euro area in the context of other monetary policy measures. In Section 3, we briefly summarise monetary transmission channels from a theoretical perspective with a special focus on NIRP. In Section 4, we discuss the empirical evidence on the impact of NIRP on other interest rates and bank lending, bank profitability, risk-taking, and output and inflation. In Section 5, we conclude with a discussion of NIRP in the context of general findings on the impact of monetary policy on output and inflation, the natural interest rate, and potential negative side-effects.",4
20.0,1.0,International Economics and Economic Policy,05 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10368-022-00549-2,Attracting private capital for development: Are poorer countries less efficient?,February 2023,Dominik Naeher,Raghavan Narayanan,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Mobilizing private capital is increasingly being recognized as a key factor for achieving international development goals. While technological solutions to many challenges faced by developing countries are often readily available, estimates of the United Nations suggest that there is a gap of USD 2–3 trillion per year between the amount of capital needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and the financial resources currently available from government and development aid (UNCTAD 2014).Footnote 1 In response to this need, development banks and organizations are increasingly using their funds to mobilize and leverage private capital (AfDB et al. 2019; World Bank 2020). Despite the prominence of such efforts on the international development agenda, the empirical evidence that allows policymakers to quantify and compare countries’ achievements in mobilizing private capital, map achieved progress against stated goals, and guide decision making, is currently very limited. Specifically, indicators commonly used to capture differences in countries’ performance in attracting private capital are often based exclusively on achieved outcomes (e.g., attracted foreign direct and portfolio investment relative to GDP) which do not account for the different economic conditions and constraints faced by different countries. Given that poorer countries often feature less-favorable infrastructure and economic conditions for generating private capital flows, it is not surprising that many low-income countries are found to perform poorly in attracting private capital according to these indicators (see the results presented in Sect. 4, Fig. 1). It is important to note, however, that the results obtained based on these indicators provide little insights on how efficient countries are in mobilizing private capital, i.e., how well they are performing relative to their potential levels of private capital flows as determined by their domestic economic structure and constraints.
 This paper addresses this gap by using a non-parametric frontier analysis approach based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate countries’ performance in mobilizing private capital relative to their enabling domestic environment. Our results reveal that many low-income countries, particularly in Africa and South Asia, which do not rank high according to achieved levels of private capital flows relative to GDP are in fact performing on or very close to the efficient frontier, indicating that these countries are good performers given the resources available to them. These results thus complement the insights of existing studies by providing a different perspective on countries’ achievements than those obtained from indicators which only capture achieved outcomes. In addition, the frontier analysis allows us to derive quantitative estimates of the untapped mobilization potential in each country, i.e., the magnitude by which countries should in principle be able to increase their private capital flows given their currently available economic resources and conditions. Tracking the performance of countries and regions over time, we find that sub-Saharan Africa experienced the strongest increases in DEA efficiency scores among all regions between 2007 and 2018, indicating that various countries in this region were catching up with the frontier. DEA is a widely used, non-parametric method for estimating production possibility frontiers based on linear programming (some methodological background is provided below; for more details, see Charnes et al. 1978 and Coelli et al. 2005). Our application of DEA is tailored to the context of private capital mobilization and involves three steps. First, we quantify achieved levels of aggregate private capital flows for 135 countries covering all income groups and geographical regions, focusing on foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio equity investment, and private sector borrowing. Second, we use DEA to estimate the empirical production possibility frontier for aggregate private capital flows as a function of countries’ domestic economic enabling environment, which is proxied by a composite index capturing various economic factors and constraints. The selection of the variables included in this index is based on a structured literature review on the factors that are commonly identified as being correlated with countries’ achieved private capital flows. Third, we calculate countries’ performance in attracting private capital relative to the estimated frontier. This allows us to identify those countries that generate relatively high levels of private capital compared to other countries facing similar economic conditions and constraints, and those countries that apparently fall short of their potential. This paper is mainly linked to two bodies of literature. First, our analysis both builds on and expands existing approaches to assess countries’ performance in mobilizing private capital flows. Most studies in this literature use regression-based methods to identify factors that are correlated with indicators of countries’ achieved magnitudes of private capital flows, and estimate the effects of changes in these factors on achieved outcomes (a structured review of this literature is presented in Appendix A). We build on the findings of these studies to inform our selection of variables included as input factors in the DEA. At the same time, we make several contributions to this literature. In particular, by using a non-parametric frontier approach to estimate countries’ relative performance in attracting private capital, we add to the range of methods that has been used in this literature (to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies DEA in the context of private capital mobilization). We argue that the approach proposed in this paper can complement the insights obtained from existing studies in the following ways. First, DEA has the feature that it involves fewer assumptions about the structure of the data than parametric methods such as regression-based analyses. Consequently, the results generated using DEA tend to be easier to interpret and are not subject to the same econometric challenges that studies based on regression analysis typically face.Footnote 2 Another important feature of DEA is that the estimated efficiency scores for a given unit (e.g., country) are based on the performance of a subset of efficient units in the sample with similar enabling factors as the considered unit. In contrast, regression-based approaches rely on comparisons relative to the average performance across all units in the sample. If the considered units are very heterogeneous (as is the case when analyzing countries from different parts of the world with different economic structures and stages of development), then DEA has the advantage that the estimates for any given country are not determined by other countries with fundamentally different characteristics and prospects, but only by those countries that feature comparable values of the included enabling factors. Second, we add to the growing number of empirical studies in macroeconomics applying non-parametric frontier analysis. Existing studies in this literature focus on estimating efficiency of public spending (Gupta and Verhoeven 2001; Clements 2002; Afonso et al. 2005; Herrera and Pang 2005), national transportation and commerce systems (Rashidi and Cullinane 2019; Wang et al. 2020), regional economic integration (Naeher 2015; Naeher and Narayanan 2020), domestic revenues (Bogetić et al. 2021), and energy efficiency (Li et al. 2021). By expanding the application of DEA to the context of private capital mobilization, our analysis generates new results that are useful for guiding policymaking in the international investment and development context. Specifically, the efficiency scores for individual countries that we obtain through DEA can help to inform decisions about how to allocate limited development funds to best leverage private capital by targeting those countries or regions with the largest untapped potential for generating additional private capital flows. These results should be seen as complementing the insights obtained from existing cross-country comparisons of achieved levels of private capital flows which do not account for differences in enabling economic factors across countries.

According to schedule, the European Commission unveiled the first draft for a European CBA in July 2021 (European Commission 2021) which could be implemented as of 2023. The CBA mechanism constitutes a supplementary measure to the European Emissions Trading System (ETS), the EU’s internal carbon pricing system, introduced in 2005, and one of its major instruments for achieving the emissions reduction target the EU committed to under the Paris Agreement and its stepped-up internal reduction target of 55% by 2030 (compared with levels in 1990). The CBA mechanism has two main objectives, both of which are linked to the European ETS. The first objective is to counter ‘carbon leakage’, that is, additional imports due to the relocation of energy-intensive industries to countries without any domestic carbon pricing mechanism (Felder and Rutherford 1993).Footnote 1 By correcting negative externalities associated with CO2 emissions, the European ETS also creates further asymmetries in CO2 costs between the EU and third-country producers, with detrimental consequences for the competitiveness of EU exporters and the Single Market’s locational attractiveness. Given these unintended distortions, the second objective of the CBA mechanism is to improve the export competitiveness of EU exporters by restoring a level playing field. By imposing a particular tariff on EU imports, known as ‘Carbon Border Tax’ (CBT) or ‘carbon tariff’, the size of which depends on the carbon intensity of the imported product, the CBA mechanism will reduce (and in the ideal case eliminate) the existing asymmetries in CO2 costs between the EU and third-country producers in the Single Market. In this paper, we use the structural gravity model of Larch and Wanner (2017) to model the effects of the introduction of a CBA mechanism as envisaged in the current Commission proposal on exports, emissions, GDP and welfare for the EU and the global economy for more than 120 economies. While the focus is on the outcomes for the EU as the entity implementing the CBA mechanism, we also present results for the global economy because of the relevance global emission levels have for the climate. Moreover, the results for partner countries are interesting in light of possible retaliation measures (Felbermayr and Peterson 2020) or countries joining a ‘carbon club’ (Nordhaus 2015). Apart from modelling this ‘base’ scenario, we also provide results for different levels of carbon prices and other design features, including the addition of carbon rebates for exporters, the application of an alternative method for calculating the carbon intensity of imports and a wider industry coverage as the one foreseen in the current proposal. The comparisons of the results from the different scenarios will on the one hand shed light on the effectiveness of the European CBA mechanism as currently proposed and on the other hand reveal how sensitively the CBA mechanism reacts to individual design features. We find that the introduction of the CBA mechanism in the proposed version leads to a decline in EU and world exports. EU GDP and welfare, however, increase due to increased domestic production. Moreover, as the emission-intensive sectors in the EU benefit from the carbon border tax, these will expand, causing EU CO2 emissions to increase. However, at the global level, CO2 emissions fall. Importantly, all global effects are very small in magnitude, amounting to − 0.12% for exports and − 0.08% for CO2 emissions. By changing specific design features, we can show that the effects increase to various degrees, and in some cases also change direction from negative to positive, but in general remain small in absolute terms. Overall, these results suggest that the CBA mechanism is an appropriate, if not very effective, instrument for reducing global emissions and levelling the playing field for carbon-intensive industries. We contribute to the literature by adding a very detailed study on the quantitative implications of the proposal for an EU CBA mechanism in the form it has been proposed. The results obtained for the base scenario are therefore a plausible prediction for the short-term economic and environmental effects of the CBA mechanism. Combined with the most suitable data available on CO2 emissions, including official data on the verified emission in the ETS, we use all available information on the different elements of the CBA mechanism to develop a simple though plausible methodology to calculate expected carbon border tariffs applicable under the CBA mechanism. We feed these tariffs into a state-of-the-art multi-region, multi-sector structural gravity model that allows calculating effects for GDP and emissions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the effects of CBA mechanisms. Section 3 presents the different CBA scenarios investigated and the data used. Section 4 presents the model and the results of the quantitative analysis. Section 5 concludes with some reflections on the policy implications.",1

These firms have to deal with standards and regulations at every stage of their activity. Obtaining information on the requirements is the first step, followed by adapting the production process. But to prove that they have done so, firms need a certification, which eventually must be recognized by the country where they intend to export, leading to additional border-related and conformity assessment requirements (ITC 2015a). All these steps come with benefits and costs. On the positive side, standards and regulations may reduce trade costs by streamlining information regarding the safety, quality, and specifications of products between trading partners. For example, adopting standards may catalyze production upgrading (Maertens and Swinnen 2009) and increase sales on foreign markets (Henson et al 2011). This can also be the result of increased trust by consumers, due to the improved image of the company and the increased demand for the certified product. Eventually, trust may also lead to facilitated custom control regime and a reduction in the associated trade costs (Latouche and Chevassus-Lozza 2015; Volpe Martincus et al 2015). On the negative side, standards and regulations can increase fixed (Bernard et al. 2011) and marginal trade (and production) costs and raise concerns about trade disruption (and distortion). The increase in costs is generally associated with improved production processes, investment in new technology, efficient trade infrastructure, and the use of more expensive shipping methods, which are required to comply with regulations.Footnote 1 The final result is generally an increase in price, due to compliance or quality increase (Hornok and Koren 2015, and Kelleher and Reyes 2014, Fontagné et al. 2015). These are some of the channels identified by the wide trade literature to explain how nontariff measures (NTMs) affect exporters’ performance. Through these channels, previous papers identify how NTMs affect the different margins of trade (intensive versus extensive margins), across firms of different sizes. However, doing this at the firm level requires firm-level data on NTMs, accompanied by detailed information about exporter dynamics. Given the paucity of cross-country datasets including both type of information, firm-level studies have had to focus on analyzing the effects of technical regulations in specific countries or sectors, or to zoom on selected regulations. Examples include Reyes (2011), who analyzes the effect of the harmonization of the standards by the EU countries on US manufacturing firms, or Fernandes et al. (2019), who use the World Bank Exporters Dynamics Dataset in conjunction with data on pesticide standards in food and agriculture products to study the effect of standards on exporters. This paper aims at filling the gap in the literature with an innovative approach. It obviates to the paucity of cross-country firm level data including both exporters’ characteristics and experiences of NTMs by merging country-sector indicators from two distinct firm-level datasets: the novel NTM Business Surveys of the United Nations International Trade Centre (ITC) and the Exporter Dynamics Database of the World Bank, for 18 developing countries. This alternative approach allows building an indicator of how exporters perceive burdensome technical regulations, at the sector-destination level, for each exporting country, from the NTM Business Surveys.Footnote 2 Consequently, this measure—that we explain in detail and define in the next section—can be related to indicators of exporters’ performance from the Exporter Dynamics Database. These indicators, also calculated at the sector-destination level, for each country, are the number of exporters, export value, and market concentration. Fixed effects regression techniques are then used to estimate the relation between technical regulations and firms’ export dynamics, controlling for sector fixed effects. The literature shows that different regulations have different effects on the trade margins. Kareem et al. (2015) show that stricter pesticide control measures decrease both the probability to enter into and the export volumes to the EU market, whereas Chen et al. (2008) find that quality standards and labeling requirements are positively correlated with both firms intensive (average export volume) and extensive margins (measured by the number of export markets and products). Based on the theoretical and empirical literature, this paper attempts to confirm three different hypotheses across 18 developing countries. This allows moving away from country-specific or sector-specific studies. The first hypothesis relates to the export base: burdensome technical regulations can be costly and impede firms to export. This would result in a smaller number of exporting firms in markets where technical regulations are perceived as more burdensome. For example, Fontagné et al. (2015) find that SPS concerns discourage the presence of exporters. We confirm this result across 18 developing countries: the more technical regulations are perceived as burdensome, the lower is the number of exporters in the market. Second, burdensome regulations affect the volume of exports, the so-called intensive margins. Hence, we test the following hypothesis: firms export less in markets where technical regulations are perceived as more burdensome. Fontagné et al. (2015) find that SPS concerns discourage the intensive margins of trade. We confirm these results across different technical measures and across 18 countries. The literature also emphasizes the heterogeneous effects of technical regulations across firms depending on size, productivity, and previous exporter statusFootnote 3 and shows that only firms situated closest to the “efficiency” frontier benefit the most from compliance with NTMs (Augier et al. 2014). We find that burdensome technical regulations affect the export value of smaller exporting firms more than the export value of larger exporters. This is consistent with the findings from the literature, indicating that smaller firms react more strongly to changes in trade costs (Berman et al. 2012; Gopinath and Neiman 2014; Spearot 2013, Chakraborty 2017). Thirdly, by increasing trade costs and the number of exporters, compliance with regulations might alter trade patterns and competition (Kox and Nordås, 2007; Otsuki et al. 2014, Chaney 2008, Bernard et al. 2011, and Crozet et al. 2013). Hence, this paper tests a third hypothesis: markets where regulations are perceived as more burdensome are more concentrated. The results confirm that burdensome regulations are positively and significantly correlated with the exit rate of firms, as well as with the Herfindhal Index (a proxy for concentration), and negatively and significantly correlated with the number of exporters per product. The major contribution of this paper stays in the innovative combination of indicators from two firm-level datasets—the United Nations International Trade Centre (ITC) NTM Business Surveys and the World Bank Exporter Dynamics Database—for 18 developing countries. Doing so allows filling a gap in the literature, whereby firm-level studies had to focus on specific countries, on selected regulations, or on selected sectors, due to the difficulty of acquiring cross-country firm-level data on NTMs as well as on exporters’ dynamics. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the databases used in the analysis and presents how the key indicators are built, as well as some descriptive statistics. Section 3 outlines the empirical strategy. Results are presented in Section 4, which is followed by robustness check (Section 5) and concluding remarks (Section 6).",
