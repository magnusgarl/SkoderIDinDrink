Given that there are many dimensions to climate change uncertainty, questions emerge as to whether a “wait and see” approach is preferable to action now. For example, since we are unsure of future climate change projections and new technology that may be available, there may be a higher pay-off to delaying investment and developing policies to address these issues. An alternative view is that the “deep” uncertainty about climate change is no excuse for (at least some) action now. The paper by Ulph and Ulph presents an argument where inter-temporal uncertainty should lead to policy-makers creating greater incentives in the short-term with the result that commitment to addressing climate change is ‘front loaded’. The specific aspect of uncertainty in their paper is associated with the political process: given that governments are in power for a limited period of time, it may be the case that future governments may not have the same commitment to addressing environmental issues relative to the current one. The uncertainty here may reflect a wide range of factors that may affect a government’s priorities (for example, recession, financial crisis and so on) such that the emphasis on addressing climate change issues becomes diluted. While the current government may be clear about their environmental priorities and set environmental taxes consistent with this, the uncertainty associated with future governments’ intentions causes responses to differ compared with the case where this uncertainty about political priorities would not exist. Ulph and Ulph set up a two period model where the government in the current period has a bias towards environmental issues; there is, however, uncertainty about whether the bias will be sustained in the second period. The current government sets an environmental tax, but there is uncertainty what this tax will be in the next period i.e. there is a lack of commitment because the current government may not be in power in the next period. On the real side of the economy, there is a single firm that invests in R&D (the single firm assumption being employed to limit the externality associated with the firm not capturing the monopoly rent associated with invention i.e. the R&D externality does not exist). In principle, the environmental tax should encourage the firm to invest in more R&D, which will help mitigate the climate issue in the second period. But the uncertainty held by the firm about the priorities of the (different) government in the second period causes the firm to under-invest such that the political uncertainty is associated with too little R&D, irrespective of the optimal policy levels chosen by the current government. In this context, the policy solution is to subsidise R&D; note that the R&D subsidy, in the presence of the political uncertainty, countervails the potential change in bias of the next government. It is necessary because the private firm is wary of the changing priorities of the government while the current government wants to ensure that there is some commitment to addressing environmental issues. Unlike a ‘wait and see’ approach, the R&D subsidy serves to embed the R&D now in face of the potential lack of commitment over environmental policy. Ulph and Ulph deal with a very real challenge: governments are typically short-lived (at least in the context of addressing climate change issues) and the reality of policy-making is that climate change has to compete with many other (often more immediate) issues on the government’s agenda. This is not to interpret the issue as the government (or the public that voted for it) caring less but that the policy agenda can be influenced by unforeseen events. This is different from the ‘wait and see’ scenario as the political uncertainty arises from the lack of commitment in an inter-temporal context where the government may change and the bias towards environmental issues may change with it. In the Ulph and Ulph set up, the solution to this lack of commitment is a subsidy on R&D, but the issue raises a more general question: if the issue is fundamentally one of political commitment, what alternatives are available that could effectively “tie the hands” of policy-makers whatever the issues are faced by this or the subsequent governments? One possibility is a regulator that is independent of government (and therefore safeguarded from the short-lived constraints governments often face); another possibility is the commitment to international environmental agreements where any commitment made would be binding. These options are, of course, not problem-free but the question posed by the Ulph and Ulph paper highlights an important question about sustaining commitment to environmental policies over time. The authors suggested a number of possible extensions. One obvious extension would be to model a stock-externality problem with emissions also in period one. Another one would be to study a multi-country problem and consider whether joining the IEA gives a form of future commitment. One could also take into account the uncertainty about climate change and how the possibility of getting better information in the future may affect current policies.",1

Reaching this target would require near-complete ‘decarbonisation’ of the European power sector: based on the PRIMES EU energy system model, the EU Climate Roadmap 2050 projects 93–99 % reduction of CO2 emissions in the power sector by 2050 compared to 1990 (European Commission 2011a). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the technological options for reducing CO2 emissions from the power generation sector, as well as from other heavy industries. CCS is a process consisting of the separation of CO2 from industrial and energy-related sources, transport to a storage location (such as a depleted hydrocarbon field or a saline aquifer) and long-term isolation from the atmosphere (see e.g. IPCC 2005). CCS could offer a bridge between the fossil fuels dependent economy and the carbon-free future, and figures quite prominently in EU energy and climate policies. The EU’s Energy Roadmap 2050 contains 7 scenarios up to 2050, and on average these scenarios project 133 GW of installed CCS power generation capacity by 2050 (European Commission 2011b). Such large-scale deployment of CCS in Europe would require the development of an extensive international pipeline network to transport around 1 Gt/y of captured CO2 from power plants to the appropriate CO2 storage sites. This paper studies the multilateral strategic game between countries in their negotiations to develop such an international CO2 pipeline network. First we estimate the magnitude of the benefits associated with international cooperation in the development of this pipeline network, compared to a situation in which countries take individual action. The main focus of the paper, however, is to apply cooperative game theory to describe the strategic behaviour of countries in the multilateral negotiations. Since the benefits from international cooperation turn out to be large and positive, the analysis is focused on how the gains from such cooperation could be distributed among participating countries. Equivalently, the paper answers the question how the investment burden of an international CO2 pipeline network would be allocated to the participating countries. In particular, we study how that allocation depends on EU legislation for CO2 pipelines, by considering two possible policy scenarios: national pipeline monopolies on the one hand, and full liberalisation of pipeline construction on the other hand. It should be noted that despite the prominence of CCS in EU energy system projections, the acceptance of CCS is still low in many countries, hence large-scale cooperation still seems challenging. The policy relevance of this paper is first of all that it points out which monetary transfers may be needed in order to achieve cooperation. Secondly, the paper assesses the effect of EU CO2 pipeline regulation options on the cooperation game between European countries. International coordination in the construction of CO2 transport infrastructure can be very beneficial. Indeed, since the costs of a pipeline do not scale proportionally with its transport capacity, substantial cost savings can be achieved by building a backbone of large bulk pipelines that collect CO2 from multiple sources and transport it to the main clusters of CO2 sinks. For that reason, a communication from the European Commission (2010) emphasises the need for a timely start of coordinated infrastructure planning and development at European level. The question then arises what such a European CO2 transport infrastructure would look like. Recent research has produced a number of models that are capable of determining the optimal (i.e. cost-minimising) CO2 transport network that can transport CO2 from sources to sinks, such as Middleton and Bielicki (2009), Broek et al. (2010a, b), Mendelevitch et al. (2010) and Morbee et al. (2010, 2012). These studies, however, do not describe how the necessary coordination to achieve such optimal infrastructure would be realised. The case studies investigated by e.g. Middleton and Bielicki (2009) and Broek et al. (2010a) are focused on single countries or states, where coordination may be relatively feasible. However, the trans-European networks described by e.g. Mendelevitch et al. (2010) and Morbee et al. (2010, 2012) require coordination and joint pipeline infrastructure investment by a large number of countries. The question we study in this paper is how such international cooperation could be structured in order to achieve the benefits of joint infrastructure optimisation. In particular, our paper aims to study how the gains from coordination can be allocated between countries in order to ensure participation in the joint coordination. We analyse the allocation by means of the Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory. Game theory has already been applied to energy networks by e.g. Hobbs and Kelly (1992), who apply cooperative models to short-run electricity transmission games and a dynamic non-cooperative Stackelberg game to long-run electricity transmission capacity decision games. Our model, by contrast, applies cooperative game theory to the capacity decision. Kleindorfer et al. (2001) provide an overview of strategic gaming in power markets, but do not focus on transmission infrastructure. Csercsik and Koczy (2011) study transmission networks—including expansion games—using cooperative game theory in a load flow model of the electricity system, and apply it to a stylised 5-node network. Our analysis is less detailed on the technical side (CO2 transmission is treated here as a simple transport model) but the methodology is applied to an extensive European case study. As mentioned before, the focus of our study is on allocation of the benefits of cooperation, or equivalently, allocation of the network investment cost. Again for the case of electricity, cost allocation has been studied by e.g. Contreras and Wu (2000) and Evans et al. (2003), who use a Kernel approach from cooperative game theory. Gately (1974) provides a game-theoretic analysis of the distribution of the benefits of cooperation in electrical power investments between three regions in the Southern Electricity Region of India. The study considers 5 possible partitions of players, comprising 7 possible coalitions, and compares several game-theoretic methods for distributing the gains from cooperation, with Shapley value and Kernel as some of the possible options. Our model, by contrast, needs to consider a more complex game with 18 players, hence 262,143 possible coalitions and 682 billion possible partitions. As a result, our analysis of the strategic game is less extensive, and considers only the Shapley value as a possible allocation. As is well-known, the Shapley value is an approach for ‘fair’ allocation of gains from cooperation among participating actors. It has been applied to natural gas by e.g. Hubert and Ikonnikova (2009) and Ikonnikova and Zwart (2010), and to CO2 emissions by e.g. Albrecht et al. (2002). In the context of CO2 pipeline networks, the Shapley value can determine the bargaining power of individual countries in the international negotiation on CO2 infrastructure investment, and hence the allocation of the cost burden. The bargaining power of each country, and hence its share of the benefits from cooperation, depends on how easily the country can be circumvented. As can be intuitively expected, countries with large storage potential or a strategic transit position are likely to receive large net benefits from the negotiation, while countries with large excess CO2 quantities (i.e. CO2 captured which cannot be stored domestically) make a net contribution. The results of the analysis are twofold. First, we find that countries with excess storage capacity capture 38–45 % of the benefits of multilateral coordination, implying that the resource rent of a depleted hydrocarbon field (when used for CO2 storage) is roughly \({\$}1\) per barrel of original recoverable oil reserves, or \({\$}2\) per boe (barrel of oil equivalent) of original recoverable gas reserves. This adds 25–600 % to current estimates of CO2 storage cost. Second, countries with a strategic transit location capture 19 % of the rent in the case of national pipeline monopolies. Liberalisation of CO2 pipeline construction at EU level could eliminate the transit rent and is shown to reduce by two-thirds the differences between countries in terms of cost per tonne of CO2 exported. Reaching agreement on such liberalisation may be politically challenging, since the payoffs are shown to be strongly divergent across countries. The paper is structured as follows. First, Sect. 2 describes the potential structure and extent of a trans-European CO2 transport network, and the benefits obtained from international coordination. Section 3 describes our game-theoretic solution concept. Section 4 applies this solution concept to CO2 infrastructure negotiations, under two scenarios: one scenario with national CO2 transport monopolies, and one scenario with liberalised pipeline construction.

Weitzman’s celebrated analysis (Weitzman 1974) sets out conditions under which regulation using a price-based instrument such as an environmental tax on emissions would be more or less efficient than regulation by quantity, such as a system of tradeable emission quotas. Developing this line of analysis, Roberts and Spence (1976) show that in fact a mixed instrument, combining elements of price and quantity regulation, would out-perform either price or quantity regulation alone. In particular, they demonstrate that the expected welfare costs of quantity regulation based on tradeable emission quotas will be reduced if supplemented by an element of price regulation, in the form of upper and lower bounds to the permitted range of permit prices. Judged against the ex post optimum this mixed regulatory regime–with appropriately-chosen parameters-performs better than either price or quantity regulation alone. In this paper, we explore the implications of uncertainty for optimal environmental regulation in a context which extends, and in some respects contrasts with the approach taken by these earlier papers. Like Roberts and Spence we are particularly interested in characterising cases where combined use of two regulatory instruments may be able to achieve outcomes which mitigate the potentially-extreme ex post inefficiencies that arise from dependence on a single regulatory approach. Unlike Roberts and Spence, however, we focus on cases where efficient quantity regulation, in the form of tradeable emissions quotas, is not an available option. This is a case of considerable practical relevance, especially in contexts where the number of firms to be regulated is too small to sustain a competitive market for tradable permits, or where the transactions costs of emissions trading are too high. We therefore focus on an initial regulatory approach based on an emissions tax, supplemented by other instruments with certain second-best limitations. Nevertheless it would be reasonable to anticipate that there would be some symmetry between our analysis and that of Roberts and Spence, and we explore the extent to which this is the case. A second respect in which our analysis develops this earlier literature is that we provide a clearer characterisation of the uncertainties and informational asymmetries, and the way in which these constrain the operation of environmental regulation. Like this earlier literature we consider cases where uncertainty differentially affects governments and firms, and unlike policy-makers, the firms in our model are able to make certain decisions in the light of the true realised state. However, our model involves a richer set of decisions, which provide a clearer context for this asymmetry. In particular, both governments and firms are forced to make decisions about one form of abatement, based on long-term investment, before the uncertainty is resolved. Firms subsequently make a second decision affecting their emissions when they decide on their level of output, and this decision is made after the uncertainty has been resolved. We argue later that this context provides a clearer motivation for the presence of uncertainty, and its differential impact on policy and business decision-makers than the rather ad hoc uncertainty in the earlier literature. The model we consider is one in which a regulatory agency seeks to control pollution from firms which produce a commodity that they sell at an exogenous price. The assumption that the price is exogenous allows us to neglect general equilibrium effects, and to focus on the issues of direct interest. We might for example think of this as a commodity which is traded in a global market, but other interpretations are possible. We represent uncertainty in our model as uncertainty about the output price.Footnote 1 This is unknown to the authorities at the time the regulatory parameters are set, and is unknown to the firm at the time they make long-term irreversible investments in abatement technology, but firms make their output decisions based on the true price realisation. When the world price for the product is high, firms will wish to produce more, and their higher output generates additional pollution. To the extent that pollution abatement can be partly achieved through output reductions, a higher output price translates into a higher marginal cost of pollution abatement. Uncertainty about the costs of pollution abatement can take different forms. One version involves once-and-for-all scenario in which at some future date a state of the world will unfold and then remain unchanged. At the time when policy decisions are made, it is uncertain which state of the world will emerge. With this form of uncertainty it is perhaps difficult to explain why policy cannot subsequently be adjusted in the light of actual circumstances, but a case for a once-and-for-all solution may still be made as argued by Roberts and Spence (1976, p. 193).Footnote 2 A second type of uncertainty arises in a “vibrating” system, in which there is frequent variation in states over time.Footnote 3 If policy cannot be adjusted rapidly enough to changing states, it will be necessary to set available instruments so as to maximise average social efficiency over time or across contingencies. A third interpretation of uncertainty in policy-making is actually an information asymmetry: the government lacks information about circumstances that are crucial for the effects of policy decisions—“inadequate information” or an “information gap” in the words of Weitzman (1974, p. 480.) In our model, we focus on forms of uncertainty that involve a clear temporal sequence rather than information asymmetry, but the uncertainty about the future could equally well be interpreted as a single uncertain event or a rapidly-changing sequence of randomly generated states. Related literature includes a number of studies of instrument choice, and studies of irreversible abatement investment under uncertainty. In the first category, Christiansen and Smith (2011) consider how second-best limitations on available instruments give rise to a case for combined use of multiple instruments, even in the absence of uncertainty. The instrument choice literature also includes discussion of the properties of relative emissions quotas—in other words, quotas defined relative to output - which will tend to encourage abatement, while having a lower impact on output decisions than absolute quotas. Ebert (1998) for example, considers a model of relative standards in a context with no uncertainty and identical firms. He characterises the optimal relative standard where it is the only instrument employed and shows that it is never equivalent to an optimally chosen environmental tax. The literature on irreversibility in abatement investment includes a number of papers looking at the timing of abatement investments, assuming a stochastic time path for demand or output price (see e.g. Xepapadeas 2001, and Chao and Wilson 1993). In this context investors have the option to delay irreversible investment, and will choose to do so in states where prices are unfavourable. As a result, the market price for emissions allowances will exceed the marginal cost of abatement investment by an amount which can be interpreted as an option value. In our model, these issues do not arise, as we assume that a single investment (commitment) decision is made, and that the firm has no choice about timing. 
Baldursson and Fehr (2004) set up a model where profits are uncertain due to uncertain future number of firms and uncertain polluting emissions prior to abatement. They consider a long-term irreversible investment under uncertainty and a short-term abatement decision after the uncertainty is resolved, with both decisions affecting polluting emissions. This is a distinction similar to ours. Most of the analysis is devoted to quota regimes, but they also briefly address a tax regime. By the assumptions of their model the marginal profitability of investment is deterministic, in contrast to the model we present in this paper. Due to this assumption, Baldursson and Fehr’s model achieves cost efficiency in emission reductions through the conventional result that all abatement activities are carried out up to the point where the respective marginal abatement costs are equated to the tax. This property does not hold in our model, and it is this which creates the case for combined use of multiple instruments In the next section we set up the basic economic model, and we characterise the behaviour of firms in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we consider policy when the regulator is confined to using an emissions tax as the sole instrument. Sections 5 and 6 then show how the availability of an additional instrument, in the form respectively of regulation of abatement technology or subsidy to abatement investment, can improve the regulatory outcome. Section 7 draws some conclusions.",12

While economists frequently consider these ethical considerations in terms of the formulation of the appropriate welfare objective for policy-makers to pursue, an equally important issue is how far individuals themselves take these factors into account when deciding what actions to take and what policies they are willing to support. This raises the important question of the extent to which policy action might be needed if individuals themselves are willing to alter their behaviour as they recognise the potential harm that their actions might cause. As both Stern (2007) and Galarraga and Markandya (2009) point out, climate change represents one of the largest externalities that society has had to face, and, like all externalities, the fundamental need for policy intervention arises from free-riding behaviour—in this case not just by individuals and companies but also by governments. In the classical analysis of externalities, free-riding arises because individuals are purely self-interested, and so perceive that, while they bear all the costs of changing their consumption behaviour, they may get only a very small gain in terms of the reduced damage that they themselves will suffer. In the extreme case, individuals may calculate that their emissions are so insignificant relative to the total, that total emissions and hence any damage that they (and others) might suffer will be unaffected by whatever consumption choices they make.Footnote 1 In these circumstances individuals make their consumption choices ignoring any effect these choices have on climate change and the damage it will cause.Footnote 2 The classic prescription is the introduction of a Pigovian tax (equal to social marginal damage) so that individuals face the full economic cost of their consumption decisions. It is sometimes thought that if individuals are not self-interested, but instead are altruistic and so take account of the effect of their actions on others, this may overcome free-riding behaviour. However, as we will show, as long as individuals continue to believe that total emissions are completely unaffected by whatever they do, then however much they care about others, their behaviour will not change, and the optimal policy is to impose exactly the same tax as if individuals were self-interested. For individual behaviour to change, individuals need to make their consumption decisions in a different way. While there have been a number of theories of pro-social behaviour, these typically involve individuals obtaining some kind of utility gain from behaving morally. In this paper we propose a new theory of moral behaviour whereby individuals recognise that they will be worse off by not acting in their own self-interest, and balance this cost off against a hypothetical moral value of adopting a Kantian form of behaviour, that is by calculating the consequences of their action by asking what would happen if everyone else acted in the same way as they did. We show that Individuals behaving this way will adjust their behaviour to take account of the impact of their decision on themselves and others. If individuals behave in this way, then altruism matters and the greater the degree of altruism the more individuals cut back their consumption of a ‘dirty’ good. Nevertheless the optimal environmental tax is exactly the same as that emerging from the classical analysis where individuals are purely self-interested. A key result of this paper is that the existence of altruistic and ‘moral’ behaviour does not change the socially optimal tax on an environmentally harmful good. Johansson (1997) previously modelled the socially optimal tax on an externality for different types altruism and compared it to the standard Pigovian tax level. Contrary to our results he finds that depending on the type of altruism analysed, the socially optimal tax on the externality can be higher, lower, or equal to the Pigovian tax. However, Johansson (1997) uses a different approach to analysing the case where individual’s behaviour is driven by something other than maximising their utility (Genuine Altruism), and finds that the optimal tax is lower than under standard theory.Footnote 3
 The paper will proceed as follows. In Sect. 2 we conduct a brief discussion of the literature on pro-social behaviour and altruism. Section 3 then develops the model, starting with standard theory excluding any form of altruism in Sect. 3.1. This serves as counterfactual to the remaining analysis. We then proceed in Sect. 3.2 to layer on a type of Pure Altruism that will be defined carefully in what follows. Section 3.3 then turns to the central element of this paper by developing the theory of moral behaviour. Finally, Sect. 4 will present a brief discussion of the model and the results.",26

Rather early on in the application of CV to the valuation of environmental goods, researchers found that providing respondents with new or differently-phrased information on these goods could change measures of willingness to pay (Thaler 1980). This should not come as a surprise, as the same phenomena apply to goods and services traded in markets—what people know about the characteristics of a good, and of substitutes and complements, can co-determine their values (Milgrom 1981; Munro and Hanley 2002). In this paper, we present an approach for controlling for the effects of different information sets provided to respondents in a very popular class of generalized multinomial logit (G-MNL) models. Specifically, we allow information to affect both preferences and the mean and variance of individual-specific scale parameters in a random utility model (RUM). In this way we incorporate both observed and unobserved preference and scale heterogeneity to investigate differences across and within information treatments. As a result, our technique better controls for different information effects than existing methods in the literature. Random Utility forms the basis for many applications of both stated and revealed preference approaches. In a random utility model, the formulation of the utility function leads to an empirical model in which the observed choices of an individual are used to link choice alternatives with utility levels. An agent’s utility depends on a deterministic component \(V\) and a random component \(\varepsilon \) (McFadden 1974). The deterministic component, \(V\), is comprised of estimated preference parameters which map attributes and individual characteristics to utility. The introduction of the error term \(\varepsilon \) is due to the researcher’s inability to observe all attributes of choice and all significant characteristics of respondents which influence her choices (McFadden 1976).Footnote 1 Pragmatically, this makes it possible to explain why apparently equivalent individuals (equal in all attributes which can be observed) may make different choices. Variation of the random component of utility \((\sigma _{\upvarepsilon })\) relative to the magnitude of the deterministic component is often called the scale parameter. As the scale parameter increases, the size of the deterministic portion of utility increases relative to the idiosyncratic portion of utility. Thus as the scale parameter increases, respondents’ choices appear less random from the econometrician’s perspective.Footnote 2 As a result, it influences the confidence intervals of WTP estimates. Consistent with the literature, our study is predicated upon the notion that altering the information set presented to a subject in a stated preference study could affect the predictive power of the econometrician’s RUM (Carson and Czajkowski 2014). For example, if subjects have a more complete information set, it could lead to the value of certain attributes of a public good being estimated more precisely. In this paper, we propose a methodology for making the preference and scale parameters a function of the information set a respondent holds and, as a result, provide a method for accounting for the effects of information in random utility-based stated preference methods. Using a simple theoretical model, we highlight how this approach is consistent with modeling agents as Bayesian updaters who incorporate newly presented information provided during a study into their stated preferences. Our approach also provides a convenient way for combining datasets from two different but related CV studies for joint estimation thereby increasing estimator efficiency.Footnote 3 Seen in this light, our approach is based on an extension of the generalized multinomial logit (G-MNL) model (Fiebig et al. 2010). Most generally, the approach allows for a flexible treatment of both observed and unobserved preference and scale heterogeneity. We illustrate our approach by applying it over preferences for biodiversity conservation. Biodiversity conservation is a well-suited public good for our study for two reasons. First, the non-use benefits of enhanced biodiversity conservation in the case examined here are non-rival and non-excludable in consumption. Second, there is no well-functioning market for biodiversity meaning that stated preference methods are common in evaluating management options for this type of good. Our results confirm that the estimated contribution of the deterministic portion of respondents’ utility relative to the stochastic element both varies across individuals and is sensitive to the information set they are given. In contrast, changes in the information provided did not influence the preference (taste) parameters of respondents’ utility functions. We find, then, that from the econometrician’s perspective, the information set provided to respondents may affect the precision with which the deterministic portion of utility is estimated, rather than the level of coefficient estimates. This finding is consistent with subjects refining their preferences for biodiversity conservation over the econometrician’s observable characteristics as they are presented with different information sets. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 begins with an overview of information effect studies in stated preferences. We then conduct a brief theoretical modeling exercise which shows variance in preferences for a good could vary with informative signals about the good if consumers are Bayesian updaters. Section 3 offers precise discussion of how scale and preference heterogeneity has been modelled in discrete choice studies. We then set out a new approach to represent differences in unobserved preference and scale heterogeneity in combined datasets, namely differences in mean preference and scale coefficients, as well as differences in their variances. The design and implementation of a choice experiment with two information treatments is then described. Results from applying this framework to our study follow, and we conclude with some observations on implications for future work.",42

Walker,Hans-Peter Weikard,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is a general recognition that cooperation is needed for the management of international fisheries to ensure the sustainability of stocks. With this in mind, regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) were set up to facilitate cooperation. The need for cooperation has sparked a recent literature concerned with the potential for, and the stability of, such agreements (e.g., Kaitala and Lindroos 1998; Bjørndal et al. 2000; Lindroos 2008; Pintassilgo and Lindroos 2008; Pintassilgo et al. 2010; Breton and Keoula 2012; Rettieva 2012; Punt et al. 2012; Bjørndal and Lindroos 2012). Such research is especially important because RFMO agreements are not binding or enforceable (Bjørndal et al. 2000). Much of the literature rightfully focuses on the potential for cooperation and the new-member problem (for a summary see Bailey et al. 2010). In addition to these established research lines, recent research has begun to focus on the issue of changes in stock location which is likely due to climate change (Cheung et al. 2009). For example, mackerel stocks in the North East Atlantic have recently shifted northwards (Jansen and Gislason 2011). This has led to unilateral setting of national fishing quotas which constitute a violation of the existing RFMO agreement (Arnason 2012 and Haraldsson and Carey 2011). Ellefsen (2012) studies this specific problem with a calibrated model to assess the effects on the stability of the RFMO after the entrance of Iceland into the game. In general, uncertainty regarding the effects of climate change on stocks and the inflexibility of agreements to changes in stock locations have also been shown to be a significant barrier to maintaining cooperative agreements (Miller and Munro 2004). Further motivation is provided by Munro (2008) who calls for more applied game theoretic research on this issue. In addition to Ellefsen (2012), three other studies address changes in stock location. Ekerhovd (2010) is concerned with both the area which is under RFMO management and the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of given countries, wherein those countries have exclusive fishing rights. Ekerhovd (2010) considers changes in the shares of stock of blue whiting distributed between the high seas and EEZs and shows whether or not coalitions are stable. The scenarios of changes in stock location have a strong impact on the stability of coalitions. Further, Brandt and Kronbak (2010) consider the case of cod in the Baltic under IPCC climate change scenarios. They analyse the size of the possible set of cooperative agreements under changes to recruitment and size of the stock. They conclude that cooperative solutions are less likely under changes in stock location. The most recent work, by Ishimura et al. (2012) has been concerned with the Pacific sardine under climate variability and its exploitation by Mexico, Canada and the USA. Different cooperative and non-cooperative regimes are analysed. They conclude that unilateral efforts to maximise conservation and management benefits would not be successful under climate change. The stability of the different cooperative and non-cooperative regimes is, however, not analysed. This paper conceptualises the stability of cooperation under changes in stock location and hence adopts a different approach from Brandt and Kronbak (2010), Ekerhovd (2010), Ishimura et al. (2012) and Ellefsen (2012). Cooperation is most beneficial when the RFMO is a “Grand Coalition” consisting of all nations with a genuine interest in a given stock. Accordingly, we examine the stability of Grand Coalitions for a fixed number of players under changes in stock location. Changes in stock location can be included in a model by allowing for changes in the “catchability” (usually denoted by \(q\) in the standard Gordon–Schaefer model). Catchability is normally considered to represent the fishing technology and thus the productivity of fishing effort. As a stock of a constant size changes its position relative to the fishing harbours of different countries, we can consider their productivity of effort as changing. This would be due to changing sailing time before reaching fishing grounds or an increased concentration of fish in proximity to the harbour. We assume that the productivity of fishing effort is determined only by the stock location and therefore that fishing technology is identical across states. This approach is most suitable for high seas fisheries where changing stock location does not affect the spatial distribution of stock across EEZs. We also assume that climate change, while it affects location, does not affect other aspects of the biology of the stock. In addition to addressing the theory of changes in stock location, and in order to address the question of how fully cooperative agreements can be stabilised, we use two solution concepts. First, we employ a variant of the farsightedness concept which is based on farsighted conjectures (Chwe 1994). Farsighted conjectures are used in the context of a Great Fish War by Breton and Keoula (2012). In comparison to Nash conjectures, farsighted conjectures do not restrict players to remain in the coalition structure resulting from the deviation of another player. Farsighted conjectures therefore allow players to respond to deviations by making further deviations. Second, we employ the internal stability (IS) solution concept. This is based on Nash conjectures and is used most frequently in the literature. Nash conjectures do restrict players to remain in the coalition structure resulting from the deviation of another player. This paper analyses implications of changes in stock location for the stability of Grand Coalitions under these different solution concepts. Comparing results under different solution concepts allows us to analyse the degree to which the (credible) responses to deviations, as conjectured by farsighted players, can affect the stability of Grand Coalitions under changing stock location. Our study uses analytics to explore the characteristics of a farsighted solution concept in the symmetric setting and to derive some basic results in the asymmetric setting. A more detailed analysis of the asymmetric case is achieved via sensitivity analyses, which allow us to draw conclusions about the effects of asymmetry and changes in stock location on internal and farsighted stability in 3- and 4-player games. This article makes three contributions to the literature. Firstly, we broaden the literature on asymmetric fishing games by comprehensively analysing the effects of asymmetric catchability. This builds on work by Pintassilgo et al. (2010). In turn, and secondly, this allows us to produce a theoretical framework to analyse the effects of changes in stock location on the stability of cooperation. Thirdly, and as will become clear later in this article, we develop a modified solution concept based on farsighted stability which addresses the problem of myopia while also being applicable in asymmetric coalition formation games which use sharing rules. We now continue into our model and analysis.",3

Over the last 25 years, governments world-wide have begun to make increasing use of policy instruments such as “green” taxes and tradable pollution permits in an attempt to achieve environmental targets in a more cost-effective manner. One high-profile example is the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for carbon emissions. Another is the recently-ended programme of \(\hbox {SO}_{2}\) credit trading in the U.S. The use of incentive-based policy mechanisms has also increasingly found its way into policy-making in the area of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services delivery. For instance, so-called “payments for ecosystem service” (PES) schemes have been promoted in the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy and have also been implemented in many EU countries as part of a package of agri-environment schemes. However, applying incentive-based instruments to achieve an improved delivery of ecosystem services from private land (comprising much of Europe’s forests and almost all of its agricultural areas) has proved difficult in many cases. Dating from the millennium ecosystem assessment (MEA 2005), the concept of ecosystem services has dominated public and scientific discussion of the role of “nature” in supporting human well-being. Exercises such as TEEB (http://teebweb.org) and the UK NEA (http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/) have highlighted the types of ecosystem services which are produced by the functioning of ecosystems and the biodiversity which they contain; how these services enhance human well-being, and what their economic value of such benefits might be; and the factors which explain trends in ecosystem extent and condition over time. The supply of ecosystem services and biodiversity typically goes unrewarded by market forces owing to missing markets: private landowners usually receive no direct financial reward for enhancing or protecting biodiversity, owing to the non-rivalness and non-excludability of these benefits (Hanley et al. 2006). Indeed, protecting biodiversity typically comes at an opportunity cost to landowners—for example, if it requires forgoing profitable land conversion or intensification. Similar arguments hold for the supply of many ecosystem services. Given the many market failures which characterize the supply of ecosystem services and the conservation of biodiversity, scholars have investigated the properties of alternative designs of PES schemes to partly correct these market failures (e.g., OECD 2010a; Wünscher et al. 2008; Engel et al. 2008; Miteva et al. 2012). However, the TEEB and UK NEA exercises reveal substantial gaps in our knowledge; not only over how to value changes in ecosystem services and biodiversity, but also on how to best design effective PES markets (Banerjee et al. 2013; Polasky et al. 2014). This paper attempts to shed some light on the main lessons we have learnt from the disciplinary perspective of environmental and resource economics.Footnote 1 We review the key literature on how incentive-based environmental policy can be utilized to encourage the private provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation.Footnote 2 However, we will first present a bird’s eye view of the main incentive-based mechanisms that have been developed in the context of pollution control, since this was the problem which first shaped economists thinking on the use of incentives to improve environmental performance in an optimal or a cost-effective manner. Once this account has been established, we aim at showing how such schemes have been “translated” for use in the context of biodiversity protection and conservation. Given the succinct nature of this review, our paper does not aim to provide an exhaustive account of the historical tracks of incentive-based mechanisms in both these domains. However, by sketching the main policy developments over time in the domains of pollution control and biodiversity conservation, we aim to provide readers with an impression of the current status of the literature in order to draw a future research agenda. In Sect. 2 we will start by sketching the origins and main developments in incentive-based policy mechanism for pollution control. Here we will particularly discuss the main properties of (Pigouvian) taxes and tradeable pollution markets, and will try to establish and identify the current status of these mechanisms. This will serve as a stepping stone for the discussion of the main developments and implementation of incentive-based schemes in the context of biodiversity conservation in Sect. 3. As we will see, this academic discussion has mainly been centred around the use of payments for biodiversity protection, including the use of conservation auctions. Finally, in Sect. 4 we make some concluding comments and suggest some elements of a future research agenda.",43

Rincón,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Producing biofuels in developing countries is a contested issue. Some view biofuels as a threat to food security and caution against local production (Runge and Senauer 2007; Molony and Smith 2010). Others see biofuels as an export opportunity, similar to traditional crops like tobacco and cotton, that could create jobs and raise incomes in rural areas (Müller et al. 2008; Pingali et al. 2008; Ewing and Msangi 2009). Studies of biofuel production in low-income countries find mixed evidence to support either view. Economic outcomes, including food security, depend on local contexts, production technologies, and institutional arrangements (Girard and Fallot 2006; Clancy 2008; Phalan 2009; Duvenage et al. 2013). In Mozambique, for example, producing feedstock on plantations generates more economic growth, whereas smallholder farming is more effective at reducing poverty, despite displacing food production (Arndt et al. 2010). Another contested issue is biofuels’ contribution to climate change mitigation. Growing feedstock can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and biofuels can substitute for fossil fuels. A number of studies confirm this potential to reduce emissions (e.g., Hill et al. 2006). However, if uncultivated lands are cleared to make way for feedstock, then the carbon released may take decades to offset. In Brazil, for example, Fargione et al. (2008) finds that it would take 300 years to offset the carbon released from tropical deforestation to produce soybean-biodiesel. As with economic outcomes, the net emissions from biofuel production depend on local contexts, including farming practices and the type of land cover converted to feedstock (Andrade de Sá et al. 2012). There is a large literature on the global effects of biofuels, including food production, land use change and GHG emissions (see, for example, Rosegrant et al. 2008; Timilsina et al. 2012; Timilsina and Mevel 2012). These studies typically focus on biofuel production in more developed countries and then consider its implications for commodity trade and prices in low-income countries. There are few country-level studies that consider the implications of local biofuels production in low-income countries. Since country studies are not constrained by global datasets, they can be more detailed than global studies and focus on the choice of technologies and production scales (see Arndt et al. 2010, 2012c; Quintero et al. 2012). To our knowledge, however, there are no country studies that quantitatively examine the joint effect of biofuels production on GHG emissions and socioeconomic outcomes. This is an important omission since many developing countries are promoting biofuels, but emissions constraints could alter their choice of technologies and institutional arrangements and, by doing so, limit biofuel’s effect on economic growth, food security and poverty. It could also determine countries’ access to export markets where demonstrable emissions reductions are a prerequisite, such as the European Union (EU). In this paper we present an integrated approach to evaluating biofuels’ environmental and economic impacts. We use a series of models to simulate the establishment of a sizable biofuels industry in Tanzania. These sequentially-linked models account for natural resource constraints; emissions from land use change; economywide growth linkages; and household poverty. The models are used to evaluate trade-offs between environmental and economic outcomes. In our simulations we consider various policy options for producing sugarcane-ethanol, including production under small and large-scale farming systems and on forest, grass and already-cultivated lands. Our findings indicate that, in the absence of emissions constraints, the economically optimal biofuels strategy for Tanzania involves smallholder farmers growing feedstock on currently unused land. Smallholder production systems lead to more poverty reduction with only a slightly smaller gain in economic growth. This is consistent with an earlier study that focused exclusively on biofuel’s economic impacts in Tanzania (Arndt et al. 2012c). However, we find that there is a much larger role for large-scale plantation farming when emissions constraints are imposed. This is because large-scale farming systems are more effective at curbing emissions from land use change and maximizing economic growth, while still reducing poverty and food insecurity, albeit by less than under a smallholder-oriented strategy. Climate change mitigation therefore alters the optimal biofuels strategy for Tanzania, suggesting a trade-off between environment and socioeconomic objectives. The next section describes the Tanzanian economy and its potential for local biofuels production. We then describe the methods used to measure emissions and economic outcomes before presenting and discussing our results. The final section summarizes our findings and discusses their implications for biofuels policy and future research.",16

Many major settlements have developed in low-lying coastal zones, often driven by the importance of water transport. The prospect of a changing sea level has significant direct implications for most countries and many major cities around the world (Nicholls et al. 2007), and is often cited as one of the reasons for concern about climate change (Smith et al. 2009). Moreover, the coastal impact category is one of the most important ones in comparative terms. For instance, Ciscar et al. (2014) consider eight different impact categories (including e.g. agriculture, energy, tourism and forest fires) in an assessment of climate impacts in Europe, without public adaptation. They found coastal damages to be the most important impact category among the market impacts. An indication of the scale of the people and economic activity potentially impacted by sea-level rise (SLR) is suggested in Dasgupta et al. (2009) who use satellite data of land usage to calculate the percentage of GDP and population that would be impacted by multi-metre SLR in 84 developing countries. In these countries it is estimated that roughly 2 % of GDP and population are within the inundation zone for a 2-m SLR. Other studies identify significant potential impacts at regional and local scales. For instance, Heberger et al. (2011) analyse key categories of infrastructure located in coastal zones in California. They note that if sea-level rose by 1.4 m, 56 schools, 13 healthcare facilities and 330 sites containing hazardous materials would be at risk from a 100-year flood event. They also identify 28 wastewater treatment plants and 30 coastal power plants that would be at risk under such circumstances. Other studies identifying micro-scale impacts include Delta Committee (2008) and Koningsveld et al. (2008), for the Netherlands, Breil et al. (2005), for the city of Venice, Saizar (1997), for Montevideo, Morisugi et al. (1995), for Ise Bay in Japan and Smith and Lazo (2001) who summarise country-level and sub-country-level studies from all continents. Losada et al. (2013), which investigates the impact of rising sea levels around the Latin American and Caribbean coast, emphasises the importance of considering changes in storm surges and extreme coastal events.Footnote 1
 There is considerable uncertainty over the amount of SLR that should be expected as a result of climate change. Estimates for this century range from a few decimetres to multi-metre rises, depending crucially on the response of large ice sheets to a warming climate. Nicholls et al. (2008) investigate the global impact were extreme SLR to occur. Specifically, the paper considers the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is assumed to cause an additional 5 m of SLR. The earliest year considered for complete collapse is 2130 (representing very fast collapse), and later dates are also considered. This work utilises the DIVA model, and considers the impacts from land loss, wetland loss, protection costs and forced migration. The model allows for coastal land to either be defended (if the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs) or abandoned (if not). Different types of impacts are estimated, including, for the most extreme scenario, the cost of coastal protection, which would rise to around $30 billion per year by the end of the century, and the number of people forced to migrate, which would peak at around 350,000 people per year in the 2040s. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models can be used to assess the overall economic implications of SLR, on top of the direct economic impacts. An early CGE study looking into the economy-wide impacts of SLR is Darwin and Tol (2001). The paper utilises the Future Agricultural Resources Model (FARM), which contains an eight-region CGE model, to investigate the economic implications of a 0.5 m SLR. The economic loss is modelled as a loss of production capital. The article demonstrates clearly the importance of changes in consumer prices caused by SLR impacts, as well as the importance of international trade, both of which are captured within a CGE framework, but not with direct cost estimates. 
Deke et al. (2001) also use a global CGE model and assume that all threatened coastal zones are protected, so that the shock is the cost of protection, which is subtracted from investment elsewhere in the economy. The welfare losses across the eleven world regions considered range from \(-\)0.006 % in Western Europe to \(-\)0.309 % in both India and Pacific Asia. The main reason for the relatively low welfare losses is that the SLR projections are at the low end of the IPCC range (13–14 cm by 2100). 
Bosello et al. (2007) employ the GTAP-EF CGE model,Footnote 2 which divides the world into eight regions, assuming 25 cm SLR by 2050. They emphasise the need for general equilibrium effects to be considered, arguing that estimates using direct costs alone can be significantly biased, typically underestimating the costs. Bosello et al. (2012) use the same model to make a more detailed assessment for EU countries using direct costs from the DIVA model as an input. It is interesting to note that only land losses and adaptation costs are used when entering shocks into the CGE model, with land losses being used to shock productive agriculture. The other components of SLR damages, mainly sea floods and migration costs are not integrated.Footnote 3 Indeed, the authors note that this approach “neglects potential effects on infrastructure, physical capital or on labour productivity caused for instance by forced displacement” (p. 74). SLR could also influence economic growth, which is addressed in Hallegatte (2012), who inter alia considers a reduction in usable capital. Though the impact of temporary flooding on growth is found to be more ambiguous (whether damage from a natural disaster leads to a lower or higher growth path appears to be dependent on the region and the disaster in question), some of the damage would result in a permanent capital loss. This would most likely reduce long-term growth rates, and supports the notion that at least some of the economic loss can be modelled by a reduction in capital stock. The main purpose of this article is to explore in detail the economic implications of extreme SLR scenarios, without public adaptation, under a CGE modelling setup. In particular, our paper explores two aspects not considered so far by the literature. First, we analyse the general equilibrium effects of SLR impacts for very high SLR scenarios. Three specific SLR scenarios are modelled with the DIVA model. The first one concerns a moderate SLR profile and the other two much higher SLR profiles (of 1.4 and 2 m by 2100), associated with significant ice sheet loss. Second, this study integrates a wider range of SLR damage categories into a CGE model, deriving therefore more comprehensive estimates of economic impacts. This is in contrast to studies that have focused only on land losses, which represent a small share of the total economic damages due to SLR. In this paper we explicitly model the other key impacts, mainly the economic damages associated with forced migration and sea floods. The damage estimates used in this paper are those without public adaptation. In cases where the damages exceed the cost of adaptation—through public sector interventions such as sea dykes and beach nourishment—countries or regions would rationally be expected to take measures to protect their coastlines. Allowing for public adaptation would reduce the damage estimates (or at least not increase them since only cost effective protection is permitted), perhaps considerably in some cases (see for example, Fankhauser 1995; Bosello et al. 2012). The estimates calculated in this paper highlight the potential damage costs that could be used to justify investment in coastal protection. Moreover, thanks to the use of the CGE methodology, private level adaptation is also considered in the analysis as all the market adjustments happening via price changes are considered in the assessment (see e.g. Aaheim et al. 2012). The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains and justifies the selected SLR scenarios. The economic estimates of the SLR direct costs from the DIVA model are explained in Sect. 3. Section 4 first outlines the main features of the CAGE computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, and the implementation of the SLR shocks into the CGE model. Section 5 reports the results and Sect. 6 concludes. The “Appendix” details the mathematical model statement for the CAGE model.",23

Such resources, which are shared by a group of users, are often associated with over-exploitation, a tragedy of the commons (Hardin 1968), unless the user group finds a way to cooperate (Ostrom 1990). The collective behaviour of CPR users, for example, if, when and how they manage to cooperate or not, has been extensively studied but most of this research focuses on static and institutional aspects (such as wealth inequality, user heterogeneity, role of punishment and communication, etc.) and, hence, assumes, implicitly or explicitly, no or simple resource dynamics (see, e.g., Ostrom et al. 2002; Poteete et al. 2010 for overviews). Natural goods and services stem from ecosystems with complex dynamics, including, for example, non-linearities and multiple stable states (Holling 1973; May 1977; Levin 1998). An increasing amount of empirical evidence suggests that if some critical threshold is trespassed (e.g., below some natural resource stock level), a large, dramatic transformation can interrupt smooth changes in the ecosystem, creating a regime shift (Scheffer et al. 2001; Biggs et al. 2012). A regime shift can lead to abrupt and potentially persistent changes in the system’s function and structure and, hence, negatively influence the growth of natural resources that stem from the ecosystem. Case studies have documented regime shifts in many different types of ecosystems and at various scales, ranging from local to global (Folke et al. 2004; Rocha et al. 2015)Footnote 1. There is, for example, scientific evidence suggesting that such changes may occur in the Barents Sea, a region hosting one of the most productive fish stocks in the world (ACIA 2005; Wassmann and Lenton 2012). Expected large negative (in some cases even catastrophic) changes in aggregate human welfare and in its distribution are at stake (IPCC 2014). Human activities generate such shifts to an increasing extent, e.g., through resource extraction and pollution, and their frequency seems to be increasing (Steffen et al. 2015). Hence, it is important to study how resource users react to, and deal with such abrupt changes, which are triggered through their own actions, i.e., endogenously driven. Our objective is to understand how users, sharing a CPR, make decisions in such a context. More specifically, when there is a critical stock threshold, below which the resource growth rate drops substantially, how will such a latent shift influence institutional arrangements that emerge, e.g., patterns of communication and cooperation? What implications will there be for individual exploitation and cooperation strategies over time and consequently overall resource management? For example, should we expect an increase or a decrease in the frequency of tragedies of the commons? The purpose of this study is to address exactly these questions, which is, to our knowledge, the first attempt. In order to advance the understanding of patterns of behavior of resource users and communities facing regime shifts, we argue (in line with Ostrom 2006) that a multi-method approach is necessary. Such an approach would, for example, combine insights and predictions generated from theory and modeling with data collected through empirical and experimental methods. To our knowledge, however, there are no empirical studies that can complement existing theoretical work on behavioral responses to regime shifts (see Sect. 2). It is very challenging to collect empirical field data on collective behavior with regards to regime shifts. Sufficient data (both ecological and socio-economic) must contain precise information about the resource and management situation before and after the shift for the studied system. This is hardly available (Walker and Meyers 2004). Another approach would be to collect relevant data from different case study sites along some biophysical gradient (in our case that could be the likelihood of a regime shift) to see if it correlates with a cooperation gradient. Such an endeavor would be very useful, but at the same time, extremely time consuming (if at all possible). For these reasons, we chose to rely on the experimental method to generate data. We performed a framed laboratory experiment and compared two experimental treatments. In both treatments, subjects played a dynamic CPR game, but whereas some groups faced a simple (a logistic type of) resource dynamics, other groups faced a more complex resource dynamics with an endogenously driven abrupt change. Our experimental results show that such an endogenously driven abrupt drop in the resource renewal rate leads to less over-exploitation and more efficient resource management. We argue that the threat of reaching the resource stock threshold triggers more effective communication within the group. This enables commitment for cooperation and knowledge sharing about the resource dynamics, which leads to better performance.",24

This is especially true in the realm of public goods provision, where property rights are not always well defined and market prices to guide welfare analysis and decision making are often missing. Substantial differences between WTA and WTP were first observed in hypothetical questions involving public goods (see Cummings et al. 1986). Since then many empirical studies have, almost without exception, reported large WTA–WTP disparities (e.g., Horowitz and McConnell 2002; List 2003). Within an expected utility framework, substitution and income effects have been put forward to explain the observed WTA–WTP disparities (e.g., Hanemann 1991). However, studies by Sudgen (1999) and Horowitz and McConnell (2003), among others, show that the observed differences cannot be reasonably explained by income and substitution effects only. With expected utility theory failing to fully explain the patterns observed in the empirical literature, prospect theory has become the main alternative theory of decision behaviour under risk since Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Key elements of the original version of the theory are that: (1) people value losses higher than gains, leading to a disparity between WTA and WTP (loss aversion); (2) the marginal value of both gains and losses decreases with their magnitude. These two properties give rise to an S-shaped value function that is asymmetric around the reference point (steeper for losses than for gains). Other, extended versions of prospect theory have been developed since Kahneman and Tversky (1979). For example, cumulative prospect theory considers the cumulative probability distribution function of all prospects instead of the individual prospect probabilities (also known as rank dependence), and allows for different probability weighting functions of gains and losses (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). Various other theoretical models of reference dependence, for situations with and without risk, have been developed in recent studies (e.g., Kőszegi and Rabin 2006; Neilson 2006; Loomes et al. 2009). Empirical evidence on loss aversion is abundant in general (e.g., Horowitz and McConnell 2002), but for preferences regarding public environmental good provision it is limited (for exceptions, see Bateman et al. 2009, and Brouwer and Schaafsma 2013). In this paper we add to the literature by empirically testing the combined effects of loss aversion and changing the value of the reference point on WTA and WTP value functions and the WTA–WTP disparity. To our knowledge these latter effects have not been studies before. For this purpose we develop a choice experiment in a case study area where changes in future flood probabilities may cause substantial damage. Stated preference methods such as contingent valuation and choice experiments are rarely used in flood valuation studies (Brouwer et al. 2009; Dekker et al. 2014), but there is an emerging stated preference literature on demand for flood insurance, both in developed and developing countries (Botzen and Van den Bergh 2009, 2012; Brouwer and Akter 2010; Brouwer et al. 2014). These studies typically investigate household WTP for flood insurance under different flood probabilities and damage cover. The general expectation underlying WTP for flood control or insurance is that people are risk averse when their decision involves potential losses under low probability-high impact conditions, and the corresponding individual choice behaviour is motivated by a desire for security. A study by Brouwer and Schaafsma (2013) is the only study we know of that examines both WTP and WTA in the context of increasing flood probabilities. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background and our research hypotheses. Section 3 discusses the design of the choice experiments and the welfare measures used. Section 4 is dedicated to statistical design and data collection, while Sect. 5 discusses results of statistical tests and the statistical model used for data analysis. In Sect. 6 we discuss the estimation results. Section 7 is aimed at hypothesis testing and presents our findings regarding the effects of reference dependence on the WTA and WTP value functions, and on the WTA–WTP disparity. Section 8 concludes.",19

Fast forward, in the 1970s, a similar argument based on population growth, diminishing returns to labor and fixed supply of land was made by the Club of Rome in its publication “The Limits to Growth” (Meadows et al. 1972). The authors argued that given a growing world population and finite resources, human society will eventually run out of resources, which will put a physical limit to growth. One major weakness of the limits to growth argument, however, is that it was based on models that ignore any feedback within the economy, or any technological response to increasing scarcities. Those models are at odds with the history of the industrialization of western economies, which demonstrates substantial amounts of technological change and productivity improvements in the face of resource depletion. Without technological progress indeed, additional units of capital would yield a decreasing marginal product as natural resources deplete. However, as Nordhaus et al. (1992) argue, technological progress can, under some conditions, overcome resource constraints and diminishing returns to capital. In fact, the increasing scarcity of a resource may provide incentives to search for new technologies (”backstop technologies”) that will rely upon less scarce inputs (Dasgupta and Heal 1974). That is, investments in technological change will compensate for increasing scarcity, and move the economy toward techniques that are less reliant upon increasingly scarce natural resources. Under this optimistic and broadly accepted view, many economists, climate scientists and policy makers alike (e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Metz et al. 2007) and the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (Stern et al. 2006)) express their belief that innovations are not only crucial for development; they also have the potential to direct an economy towards a greener and more sustainable future (Bretschger 2015). Over the last decades, economic models linking the engine of growth—namely innovation and diffusion—and the environment, have considerably evolved. Twenty years ago, technology was still often modelled as an exogeneous and autonomous process and empirical work on measuring technical progress, as initiated by Griliches (1990), was still in its infancy. Much has been achieved over this period and the objective of this article is to provide a succinct overview of the main developments in this field of research. As very good reviews already exist in the literature (Jaffe et al. 2003; Popp et al. 2009; Popp 2015), we only provide here a brief and non-exhaustive overview aiming at taking stock of the current literature and charting issues for a future research agenda. In Sect. 2, we briefly review some of the main theoretical developments. In Sect. 3, we provide a summary of the empirical work highlighting current gaps in metrics and knowledge.

To correct for these market failures the first-best policy has to be two-pronged: a carbon tax that must be set to the social cost of carbon (SCC) which equals the present value of all future marginal global warming damages resulting from burning one extra unit carbon today,Footnote 1 and a renewable subsidy that must be set to the social benefit of learning by doing (SBL) which equals the present value of all future reductions in the cost of renewables from using one unit of renewable energy today. Politicians are, however, keener on the carrot than the stick and thus prefer subsidies to taxes. Thirty years of international climate negotiations have failed miserably and national renewable policies may be called for when agreements on international carbon taxation fail to materialize. This brings us in the realm of second-best economics. Our objective is, therefore, to investigate how well a second-best Markov-perfect optimal subsidy for renewable energy productionFootnote 2 performs in the absence of a carbon tax in the decentralized market economy compared with the first-best climate policy and business as usual. Second-best issues are omnipresent in public economics but rarely discussed in climate change economics.Footnote 3 Grimaud et al. (2011) analyse optimal first-best and second-best climate policies in a decentralized market economy with directed technical change and endogenous growth. Kalkuhl et al. (2013) use a sophisticated IAM of growth and climate change with stock-dependent fossil fuel extraction costs to investigate the impact of optimal second-best renewable energy subsidies when carbon taxation is infeasible in a decentralized market economy.Footnote 4 These studies find that a second-best subsidy is an apt measure for compensating the missing carbon price but assume that policy makers can commit to announcements about future policies even though given the forward-looking nature of scarcity rents on fossil fuel there is an incentive to re-optimize and deviate from announcements about future policies. We therefore study the time-consistent Markov perfect second-best optimal policy and find that the loss of commitment has significant costs in terms of welfare and environmental damage. We characterize the equilibrium conditions for the first-best and second-best policy in an integrated assessment model (IAM) of growth and climate change with stock-dependent extraction costs, ongoing technical progress, and structural change. We assume that renewable energy is a perfect substitute for fossil fuel.Footnote 5 This implies that there are discrete phases of energy use, which allow us to calculate the optimal second-best policies with and without commitment in a relatively straightforward way. We also assume that fossil fuel is exhaustible. The price of fossil fuel thus contains two forward-looking elements: the scarcity rent (the present discounted value of all future increases in extraction costs resulting from an extracting an extra unit of fossil fuel) and the carbon tax. The endogenous scarcity rent responds to expectations about future policy and in particular falls in response to expectations of future subsidies for renewable energy production. In the absence of a carbon tax, market prices for fossil fuel thus fall in this second-best setting, leading to increased carbon emissions relative to business as usual which has been coined a weak Green Paradox (Sinn 2008; Gerlagh 2011). The second-best Markov-perfect climate policy assumes, in contrast, that policy makers cannot commit to announced future renewable subsidies and therefore is set to the social benefit of learning. If commitment is credible, policy makers can improve on the Markov-perfect second-best optimal renewable subsidy by pushing the subsidy above the SBL, thereby compensating for the lack of a carbon tax. It brings forward extraction of fossil fuel at the cost of accelerated global warming in the short run, because fossil fuel owners fear that their resources will be worth less in the future. However, compared with business as usual, either second-best policy locks up more fossil fuel in the ground and curbs global warming in the long run but less so than in the first best. Our second-best Markov-perfect framework allows to investigate whether the extra fossil fuel that is locked up forever is big enough to avoid a strong Green Paradox (Gerlagh 2011). Our calibrated IAM suggests that the first-best climate policy requires an aggressive and temporary renewable subsidy for the next few decades and a gradually rising carbon tax to price out fossil fuel with the required carbon tax to keep out fossil fuel in the carbon-free era, eventually falling with time. Given our specification of global warming damages, the first-best climate policy enforces a carbon budget of 320 GtC and brings down the maximum global mean temperature to 2.1 \(^{\circ }\)C. With commitment the second-best subsidy for renewable energy fully compensates for the missing carbon tax such that the transition to carbon-free energy coincides with first-best. The lacking carbon tax, however, induces higher fossil fuel of 60 GtC during the fossil era and thus peak warming increases somewhat to 2.3 \(^{\circ }\)C. The second-best Markov-perfect renewable subsidy is relevant in the more realistic case that commitment is infeasible and uses a significantly higher carbon budget of 1080 GtC, which implies much higher peak warming of 3.5 \(^{\circ }\)C. This compares to a business as usual outcome of 2500 GtC carbon burnt and pre-industrial temperature increases of 5.1 \(^{\circ }\)C. There is no strong Green Paradox as the Markov Perfect second-best renewable subsidy without commitment reduces social welfare relative to under first best by 95% of initial GDP compared to a welfare loss of six times initial GDP under business as usual. Being able to commit brings this figure down to 7%. However, policy makers have an incentive to renege after some time has lapsed by increasing the renewable subsidy and bringing forward the carbon-free era even more and locking up even more carbon in the crust of the earth. Section 2 discusses a simple two-stock model of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and global mean temperature due to Golosov et al. (2014) and discusses our benchmark specification of climate damages which are bigger at higher temperatures than Nordhaus (2008, 2014) following recent suggestions by Stern (2013) and Dietz and Stern (2014). Section 3 formulates the command optimum for our general equilibrium IAM of climate change and Ramsey growth. Section 4 derives the market outcome of our IAM and shows how to derive the optimal first-best and second-best Markov-perfect climate policies. Section 5 offers policy simulations and highlights the effects of first-best and second-best Markov-perfect climate policies on untapped fossil fuel, the time it takes to phase in renewable energy and to reach the carbon-free era, and welfare. There is also a discussion of the second-best optimal policy if pre-commitment is feasible. Section 6 concludes.",23

Recently, this debate has been re-cast in terms of supporting a shift towards ‘Green Growth’ (OECD 2011; UNEP 2011), generally understood to be about “fostering economic growth and development while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies” (OECD 2011, p. 18). Such a profound transformation, it is argued, calls for policies that would “foster investment and innovation which will underpin sustained growth and give rise to new economic opportunities, (OECD 2011, p. 18). A crucial role in promoting green technological change is played by the price of polluting inputs. Both the theoretical (e.g. Acemoglu et al. 2012) and the empirical literature (e.g. Popp 2002; Calel and Dechezleprêtre 2016; Noailly and Smeets 2015; Aghion et al. 2016) show that a high price of polluting inputs relative to cleaner factors of production supports the development of clean technologies. Policies that imply a decrease in the price of polluting inputs can hence have as an unintended consequence a slowing down of the process of transition from current growth patterns to more virtuous ones. One is immediately lead to think of the much debated, notorious energy subsidies that make fossil-based energy ‘too cheap’ (Davis 2014; Coady et al. 2015). There are, however, situations where even environmentally motivated policies may lead to reductions in prices. Policies that reduce the future profitability of a stock of a non-renewable resource, for example, may lead to a price reduction in the short run and to the front-loading of resource use, a ‘Green Paradox’ (e.g. Sinn 2008; Gerlagh 2011; Van der Ploeg and Withagen 2012). The presence of implementations lags in policies that make future fossil fuel use less attractive—climate change mitigation or acid rain policies, for example—induces an initial reduction in the price of fossil fuels (Di Maria et al. 2012, 2014a, b). In this paper, we discuss how pollution policy design needs to be adapted in the presence of a policy implementation lag when emissions stem from the consumption of a non-renewable resource. In particular, we investigate second-best climate change policy when a substantial implementation lag co-exists with pre-existing suboptimal policies.Footnote 1 In our model, carbon emissions are a by-product of the use of a non-renewable resource, and damages arise from the accumulation of a stock of carbon in the atmosphere. We assume that the policy-makers can credibly commit to a future policy—for example by establishing legally binding targets. We introduce policy lags by requiring that, once the new policy is enshrined in law, it can only be modified with a (sizeable) lag, e.g. due to the complexities of the political process. We also explicitly allow for the presence of pre-existing taxation or, more realistically in the case of fossil fuels, subsidies. In this context, we show that the (second-best) optimal tax needs to be adjusted in order to correct for both the marginal damages accrued during the interim phase, and the distortion to the private returns to extraction caused by the pre-existing policies. The optimal second-best tax becomes negative, i.e. resource owners receive a subsidy to extraction once regulation becomes effective, when the net present value of interim phase damages and pre-existing subsidies is sufficiently high. We also find that, contrary to the case of the optimal first-best resource tax, the second-best tax is unique. This paper contributes to different strands of the literature. First, it contributes to the literature on optimal taxation of non-renewable resources in the presence of stock externalities by introducing unavoidable implementation lags.Footnote 2 Few papers to date have discussed the effects of implementation lags in the context of non-renewable resource taxation. Di Maria et al. (2012) study implementation lags in climate policy using a model with multiple non-renewable resources, and focus on the case of a constant, exogenous cap on the flow of emissions. They show that emissions increase in the period between the announcement of the cap and its implementation. Eichner and Pethig (2011) use a two-period, three-region model with non-renewable resources and show, among other things, that an expected, exogenous tightening of the (unilateral) second-period cap by one of the countries, might lead to a global increase in emissions in the first period. Relative to these earlier contributions, our emphasis is on optimal (rather than exogenous) policy in the presence of implementation lags. Second, our abundance effect is in the spirit of the ‘Green Paradox’ literature started by Sinn (2008). In this context, we are one of the first papers to discuss exhaustible resource taxation in a second-best world.Footnote 3 Van der Ploeg (2016) treads on similar ground, although his analysis focuses mostly on international aspects such as carbon leakage. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the first-best outcome, i.e. optimal taxation in the absence of an implementation lag, to be used as a benchmark. Section 3 contains the derivation the optimal second-best pollution tax to be announced at the start of the planning horizon and implemented with a lag. Subsequently, we discuss its properties and the conditions under which it becomes a subsidy. We conclude with a discussion of the possible effects of pre-existing fossil fuel subsidies on optimal policies.",6

The reuse of previously developed land can also improve the attractiveness of an area through the removal of neighbourhood eyesores, the clean-up of contamination if present, the creation of new jobs, new housing, or new commercial or industrial uses of the land, and, by keeping cities compact, can also conserve biodiversity and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (Alberini et al. 2005; Thornton et al. 2007; Williams 2012; Tang and Nathanail 2012; Wernstedt et al. 2013; Otsuka et al. 2013; Linn 2013; Dixon et al. 2006; Dixon and Adams 2008; Schulze Bäing and Wong 2012; Alberini 2007; Haninger et al. 2014). There are more than 66,000 hectares of previously developed land, or brownfields in England, mostly located in the high-growth areas of greater London, the South East and East, that would be suitable to accommodate more than 200,000 new homes (DCLG 2015). The redevelopment of brownfields in England is, therefore, of major interest to planning agencies and developers. In this paper we aim to investigate the determinants and the barriers of brownfields reuse in England using econometric techniques supported by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data. Specifically, our study addresses English brownfields regeneration agenda with three related questions: (i) what (local) characteristics make a site more likely to be regenerated? (ii) has brownfields regeneration mostly occurred in city centres? (iii) should size and location specific policies be suggested to better tackle brownfields reuse? Using data from the National Land Use Database for more than 21,000 brownfield sites, we explore the site characteristics that make a brownfield more likely to be regenerated. Specifically, we look at how the following variables have had an impact on the reuse of a site: previous use, site size, ownership type, whether the site is located in a city, a metropolis, or in rural areas, geographical location, and other geographical based variables, such as the population density and the index of deprivation of the area where the site is located, and the distance to the city centre. Our analysis aims at providing policy makers with indications to what has limited brownfields regeneration and what has favoured the reuse of previously developed sites in England. Our approach, based on observed data on the revealed preferences of local authorities’ brownfields regeneration projects, sheds lights on the successes and limitations of brownfields regeneration in England. Results from this analysis can provide guidance on where the government should act to lower barriers for brownfields regeneration. Our analysis explores the effect of spatial unobserved variables affecting the decision to reuse brownfield sites by first using a spatial probit model that assumes the same spatial effect across all brownfields, and then by relaxing this assumption and allowing for different forms of unobserved spatial effects at local authority level using spatial random effects, spatial random parameters and spatial latent class models. We find that, despite the apparent success achieved by the national brownfields policy most brownfields redevelopment has happened in “easy brownfields”. More resources, attention and specific policies are needed to redevelop “difficult brownfields”, such as large sites, sites that have previously been used for commercial and industrial activities, and sites that are located in the poorer and bleakest areas of cities and regions of England. Our spatial models find that brownfields reuse decisions are considerably affected by unobserved heterogeneity at local authority level, indicating that reuse decisions at brownfield sites should exploit the local specific characteristics of the areas where brownfields are located and therefore support the existence of local planning agencies responsible for driving the reuse of brownfields at local authority level, rather than having a national regeneration agency overlooking the reuse of brownfields. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows: section two provides an overview of the brownfields regeneration policy, with a particular focus on England; section three reviews the literature on the barriers and drivers of brownfields redevelopment; section four describes the English dataset of previously developed land; section five presents the economic and econometric models; section six reports the results of the analysis; section seven concludes the paper with a discussion and some policy considerations.",26

Already in 1992, in relation to the normative principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, it was postulated in Article 3 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that “..., the developed country parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.” Originally, attributing a leading role to industrialized countries was mainly motivated by distributional motives since these rich countries have a higher capacity to bear the burden of mitigation measures and, at the same time, have been responsible for the major share of greenhouse gas emissions in the past. But, in the spirit of the “bottom-up-approach”, the postulate for leadership is also based on the expectation of a “motivational push” caused by the leaders: By adopting a pioneering role and by setting a good example, these countries should induce other countries to follow suit in the provision of the global public good “climate protection”. In practice the leadership idea has become prominent in the EU, and especially in Germany, since it serves as a justification for far-reaching activities in climate and energy policy, e.g., for the 20:20:20 goal and for the subsidisation of renewable and also nuclear energy in European countries. According to the theory of public goods that has become an important tool for the theoretical analysis of global climate policy (e.g., Sandler 1997; Barrett 2005, pp. 1462–1465; Cornes 2015), a positive effect from leadership is not the normal case. Rather, the standard model of voluntary public good provision predicts that increased public good contributions by the leaders have a negative effect on the public good contributions of the followers. Against the background of this pessimistic view, the main objective of this paper is to show how, by enriching the standard model of voluntary public good provision with elements of behavioural economics, positive effects on the followers’ public good contributions may result so that leadership becomes successful, which in theoretical terms means that the follower’s reaction path is upward sloping and the contributions of both countries are strategic complements. The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we provide a review of the existing theoretical literature on the effects of leaders’ behaviour on followers going beyond the public good model. In Sect. 3, we present and interpret various types of psychological preferences as different kinds of inequality aversion, a desire for reciprocity and impure altruism in the sense of warm-glow-of-giving. In Sect. 4, we then show how, in an otherwise standard static two-country model of voluntary public good provision, the inclusion of such psychological components into the follower’s preferences may entail a positively sloped reaction function of the follower, thus making leadership successful. In Sect. 5, we consider a public goods model with conjectural variations to show, how increased public good contributions by the leader may influence the expectations of the follower so that he is motivated to increase his public good contributions. In Sect. 6, these results are illustrated by an example. Finally, in Sect. 7, we briefly discuss some implications for climate policy, which follow from our theoretical analysis.",29

Greenhouse gases mix immediately once in the atmosphere, so that it does not matter whether emissions take place in China, India, Africa, Europe or the Americas. Global warming can therefore be characterised as a global externality. A key concept in the economics of climate change is the social cost of carbon (SCC). The SCC is the present value of all current and future damages to aggregate economic production caused by the global warming induced by emitting one ton of carbon today. There is a whole industry of trying to assess these damages and also a literature on what kind of ethical and risk considerations drive the rate used to discount these damages. The main point is, however, that if the global warming externality is the only market failure on the planet (and it clearly is not), the policy makers of the world should ensure that carbon is priced uniformly throughout the planet at a level equal to the SCC (Chichilnisky and Heal 1994). This carbon price can be realised through a uniform global carbon tax or through a worldwide system of trade carbon permits as this is the most efficient way of curbing emissions. van der Ploeg and Withagen (2014) and Golosov et al. (2014) show how the optimal SCC is calculated in general equilibrium and is the key driver of phasing out fossil fuel and phasing in renewable energy. Such a worldwide system of pricing carbon can only be sustained if rich countries in the world compensate the poor countries with lump-sum transfers. Since after decades of climate summits such a system of global carbon pricing and lump-sum transfers is still not in place, one has to consider second-best arrangements where only part of the world prices carbon, or at different rates (cf. Chichilnisky and Heal 1994; D’Autume et al. 2016). This leads to the inevitable problem of international carbon leakage. Even those countries that try to price carbon, have to face the political realities that policy makers tend to commit to future climate policies and to procrastinate. They also tend to prefer the carrot of a renewable energy subsidy to the stick of an effective and credible carbon price. This leads to Green Paradox effects. Both leakage and Green Paradox effects render climate policy less effective than they would have been otherwise. In this Special Issue to mark the completion of an Advanced Instigator Grant of the European Research Council, Kverndokk et al. (2017), Gronwald et al. (2017) and Mulatu (2017) deal with and add new insights into these two key reasons for frustration of first-best climate policies. These papers are discussed and put in context in Sect. 2. Another reason why climate policy is frustrated in practical policy making is, for example, that carbon prices often hit the poorest people of society hardest and thus politicians have little appetite to implement carbon pricing. Section 3 discusses two papers in the Special Issue that deal with politics of climate policy. Carattini et al. (2017) study voting on energy taxes which helps to understand public resistance to environmental policy measures. Dao et al. (2017) deal with the intricate issues of how to tackle intergenerational distributional consequences of climate policies. Section 4 discusses in some detail the emerging literature on tipping points and catastrophes including the contribution by Tsur and Zemel (2017) to the Special Issue. Section 5 discusses the estimation of damages from climate change including the contribution of Howard and Sterner (2017). Section 6 concludes with a brief agenda for future research.",1

Howard,Thomas Sterner,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Climate change is one of the preeminent policy issues of our day, and the Paris agreement signals some international agreement that action is urgently needed. The social cost of carbon (SCC) is one of the primary tools for calibrating the socially optimal policy response, particularly in the U.S. under the Obama Administration. The SCC is estimated using integrated assessment models (IAMs), which capture the various steps in the climate and economic processes that translate a marginal unit of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions into a measurement of economic damage. While accuracy within each of these steps is necessary to precisely estimate the SCC, accurately calibrating the climate damage function—which we define as translating a temperature change into a percentage change in GDP—is critical.Footnote 1 Given the considerable uncertainty in climate impacts, meta-analyses of climate damage estimates are a key tool for depicting the relationship between temperature and climate damages, so as to communicate the current state of knowledge to model developers (Van den Bergh and Button 1999). By clarifying this relationship and the uncertainty underlying it, meta-analyses also explain to policymakers arguably the best assessment of the risks that climate change poses to the global economic system and to human well-being.Footnote 2
 Due to a dearth of global damage estimates, past meta-analyses (Newbold and Marten 2014; Nordhaus 2013; Tol 2009, 2014) conducted relatively limited analyses of the temperature–damage relationship. It is fair to say that the first damage studies made the very reasonable choice of using simple “back of the envelope” estimates for damages. Gradually, the number of studies increased as methodologies improved, and authors were able to gather small datasets varying from 13 to 43 damage estimates (acquired from 13 to 17 early studies) as a basis for assigning damage values. However, we believe that these earlier analyses are quite limited and potentially biased because these datasets were characterized by non-independent observations (Aldy et al. 2010; Van den Bergh and Botzen 2015). Many observations were estimated using similar methods and models, and very often undertaken by the same authors and thus had some element of duplication. The idea of using meta-analyses to summarize the state of knowledge is well established. However, it becomes problematic to work with averages of earlier values if those estimates come from only a very limited number of pioneering authors who have published several estimates each. In fact, 5 of 13 studies used in the regression by Nordhaus (2013) were Nordhaus’ own earlier estimates, and an additional four were from the other two main modelers in the IAM literature. Given the small sample sizes available in the literature, authors of these prior meta-analyses simply regressed global climate damages (measured as a percentage of global GDP) on global temperature change (assumed to be relative to the pre-industrial period) and calculated basic ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors. In doing so, they did not account for duplication or dependency of damage estimates. The consequence is an exaggerated sense of knowledge about the temperature–damage relationship and a greater weighting of estimates from established authors in the field (who tend toward the enumerative strategy) and away from new authors such as Burke et al. (2015) (who tend toward statistical-based strategies); see also Sterner (2015). These earlier meta-analyses find that global climate damages increase at an increasing rate, though they differ in the exact rate of change; see Fig. 1. Specifically, the models predict a wide range of potential damage estimates from 1.9 to 17.3% of GDP for a 3 \(^{\circ }\hbox {C}\) increase in global average surface temperature. While these earlier estimates represent strong first steps in understanding the temperature–damage relationship, they are potentially biased due to these data limitations and the limiting effect of the estimation techniques employed. This is particularly true when they are used to predict the damages from higher temperatures, since there is a large sensitivity to the choice of functional form. Temperature–damage relationship for previous meta-analyses and the preferred regression [regression (4) on Table 2] from our study. This figure compares damage functions corresponding to previous meta-analyses to damage functions corresponding to the preferred regression [i.e., regression (4) in Table 2]. Following Nordhaus (2013), we multiply the coefficients of the preferred regression specification corresponding to non-catastrophic impacts (t2 and prod_t2) by 25% when constructing the damage functions to account for potential omitted non-catastrophic impacts of climate change There are several sources of bias in previous empirical estimates of the temperature–damage relationship. First, because the data are dependent on one another due to similar underlying estimation methods, authors, and models (Tol 2009; Aldy et al. 2010; Dell et al. 2014; Van den Bergh and Botzen 2015; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017), OLS is inefficient and the resulting standard errors are biased. More importantly, as indicated above, due to the common practice of citing earlier estimates and updating previous estimates in the literature, the resulting estimates suffer from multiple (duplicate) publication bias. Ours is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper to apply this rigorous meta-analysis concept fully in climate economics.Footnote 3 Given that older (i.e., less up-to-date) damage estimates tend to be cited multiple times (Van den Bergh and Botzen 2015), we expect this to bias downward the temperature–damage relationship. Second, earlier estimates also suffer from omitted variable bias due to a failure to account for whether the underlying damage estimates captured non-market and catastrophic climate impacts in addition to market impacts (Van den Bergh and Botzen 2015; JEP 2015) and to control for whether market impact estimates included potential impacts on economic productivity. Third, earlier studies potentially suffer from publication bias by relying exclusively on published studies (Ackerman and Stanton 2010; Havranek et al. 2015). Fourth, there are several citation errors with respect to damage estimates (JEP 2015),Footnote 4 in particular with respect to the measurement of temperature (Gelman 2014). Last, high-temperature damage estimates (corresponding to temperature changes above 4 \(^{\circ }\)C) have an undue impact on the estimated temperature–damage relationship over the critical time period of the twenty-first century, despite these estimates’ empirical shakiness and overreliance on extrapolation (Van den Bergh and Botzen 2015); for example, Tol (2014)’s results are extremely sensitive to the inclusion of its sole high-temperature damage estimate (see later discussion). By dealing systematically with these biases, this paper identifies a significant downward bias in the literature of the effect of temperature change on global climate damages. Our aim is thus to improve understanding of the temperature–damage relationship by advancing the meta-analysis techniques pioneered by Tol and Nordhaus. A meta-analysis is not necessarily synonymous with “truth,” but we presumably all agree that if we are going to do a meta-analysis, every effort should be spent on trying to do it is as well as possible. By conducting an exhaustive search of the published and grey literature to assemble a larger dataset, we are able to conduct a meta-analysis using more data-intensive techniques that can more accurately capture this relationship and the uncertainty underlying it. Specifically, using weighted least squares and calculating cluster-robust standard errors at the model level, we regress climate damages on an adjusted measurement of temperature change squared and its interaction with indicator variables for whether the model captures non-market, productivity, and catastrophic climate impacts. By dropping duplicate damage estimates and high-temperature damage estimates, we explore the impact of duplicate publication and other biases on the temperature–damage relationship. In doing so, we are able to better characterize the current state of knowledge with respect to the temperature–damage relationship. To understand the potential effect of the previous bias on the SCC, we re-calibrate the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, which is generally seen as the first and most respected IAM, by replacing its damage function with the preferred specification of the temperature–damage relationship and re-estimating the SCC. Our paper is structured as follows. First, we discuss the history of global climate damage estimates. Second, we discuss the relevant meta-analysis literature in the context of global climate damages. Third, we describe the creation of our datasets. Fourth, we present the econometric model used for our meta-analysis of willingness to pay. Fifth, we present our regression results with respect to the temperature–damage relationship. Sixth, we provide a short sensitivity analysis. Seventh, we discuss the interpretation of our results as a damage function. Finally, we conclude.",105

(2010), Bruns and Kalthaus (2017, forthcoming) noted that a dummy variable for one country (New Zealand) is missing in the reported regressions for solar patents.Footnote 1 The authors have re-estimated the models including the dummy variable, and the corrected results are reported alongside the original results in the table below. The first part of the table corresponds to the results presented in Table 5 in the original paper. The second part of the table corresponds to the results presented in Table 6, where the policy dummies other than those of primary interest (feed-in tariffs and renewable energy certificates) are combined into a single variable to avoid potential multicollinearity. The third part of the table corresponds to the results presented in Table 7, where we also drop the Kyoto Protocol dummy variable. Given the focus of the paper on the role of feed-in tariffs and renewable energy certificates on patented invention of different renewable energy sources, it is important to note that the variable capturing feed-in tariff levels is now insignificant at the 5% level for the first model estimated (the p value is now 0.063). However, it remains significant when the other policy dummy variables are combined into a single variable to avoid multicollinearity (Tables 6, 7 in the original paper). The inclusion of the missing dummy variable also results in the loss of statistical significance and a much lower magnitude for the coefficient for electricity price. The change in this result is now consistent with the result for electricity prices for the other technologies reported in the paper, and is in line with results from other studies (e.g., Nesta et al. 2014). In addition, results for two policies represented only by dummy variables change: Investment incentives now have a statistically significant impact in the first model estimated, whereas guaranteed prices do not. The results remain similar when combining all other policies into a single dummy variable for Tables 6 and 7, with a slight gain in precision. Total EPO patent filings are no longer significant in the specifications corresponding with Tables 5 and 6, which is now in line with the results presented for renewables in general. As this variable is simply a control for cross-country differences in patenting behavior, this change suggests that fully capturing all country fixed effects is sufficient to control for cross-country patenting differences.",15

Later on, these measures were intensified with a tax on landfilling, a landfill ban and recently an incineration tax. Dutch municipalities are responsible for waste collection and they applied policies to stimulate the separation of waste. The way citizens pay for waste collection differs by municipality. Since the nineties, more and more Dutch municipalities have implemented unit-based user fees [see also Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2014)]. On average, Dutch municipalities recycled 50 % of their waste in the period 1998–2012, which is still below the target of 65 % as proposed by the European Commission in July 2014. The Dutch recycling rate, at approximately 50 %, is far above the EU average of 42 % [see Eurostat (2014)]. In the past decade, it has been the Dutch administration’s policy to increase recycling rates at the curbside. Despite heavy policy efforts such as separate curbside collection of paper, glass, plastics and compostable waste and the provision of special containers in many municipalities, the recycling rate dropped slightly from 50 % in 1998 to 48 % in 2012. By law, Dutch municipalities are obliged to collect two types of waste at the curbside: unsorted (household) wasteFootnote 1 and compostable waste such as vegetable, food and garden waste. Curbside collection of compostable waste started in January 1994. Its introduction was an important measure in increasing the amount of separately collected compostable waste. Furthermore, since 1994, the municipalities have been obliged to provide an infrastructure for the separate collection of glass, paper and textiles. They are not obliged, however, to collect these streams at the curbside. In most Dutch municipalities, recyclables can be discarded at drop-off facilities. Also in most Dutch municipalities, there is a curbside collection program for paper organized by local associations such as sports clubs and schools. In addition, since January 2010, municipalities are obliged by law to collect plastic packaging separately. For the Netherlands, Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2014) show that between 1998 and 2010 there has been an increase in facilities at drop-off points in central locations for collecting different waste streams such as paper, glass, textiles and plastic packaging. Dutch door-to-door collection of recyclables increased as well—for compostable waste and paper at the end of the previous century and for plastics since 2009. In the literature, there is discussion about which method (curbside collection or drop-off centers) is most effective in collecting recyclables. For US municipal data, Beatty et al. (2007) show that the marginal impact of expanding curbside collection on recycled quantities is small, because curbside programs ‘cannibalize’ returns from drop-off centers. In fact, for aluminum and glass, the authors cannot reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between increased curbside access and the quantity recycled. However, for plastics, they find a significant relation between the percentage of the population served by curbside programs and the amount recycled. Several Dutch municipalities introduced unit-based pricing (UBP) of unsorted and compostable waste as a measure to stimulate both the separate collection of recyclables and a reduction in the total amount of waste. In the last ten years, more and more Dutch municipalities have implemented unit-based user fees. By 2012, 36 % of Dutch municipalities had implemented such a system, while this share was only 15 % in 1998. Based on 1998–2000 Dutch municipal data, Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2004) find sizeable and significant effects, resulting in less unsorted and more recyclable waste. For the weight and bag-based system in the Netherlands, Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2004) reported a significant elasticity close to one for compostable waste and around 0.7 for unsorted waste. These elasticities are above those normally reported in the literature as shown in a meta-study by Bel and Gradus (2016). These elasticities are more in line with Huang et al. (2011) for US bag/tag-based system if the estimates are limited to UBP-municipalities. Based on data until 2005–2006 and corrected for environmental activism or municipal fixed effects, the effects of UBP-systems on the amount of waste still remain large [see Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2009) and Allers and Hoeben (2010)]. For the period 1998–2010, a similar picture is seen, although there is some evidence that especially the effectiveness of the administrative complex weight-based pricing system deteriorates over time [see Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2014)]. For the Netherlands, empirical evidence suggest that one fifth to a quarter of the UBP-reduction in unsorted waste is due to better recycling of paper, glass and textile, which are collected free of charge [see Allers and Hoeben (2010) and Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2014)]. Compostables are still a quarter of total waste, although the effect differs widely between the country-side and cities, and whether collection of compostables is penalized as well. Most of this literature is based on quantities and not on recycling rates. However, recently, Lakhan (2015) shows with Canadian municipal data that pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) schemes increase recycling rates significantly. Other authors claim that non-monetary initiatives, such as the provision of frequent curbside recycling services, increase recycling as well [see, for example, Callan and Thomas (1997, (2001), Kinnaman and Fullerton (2000), Ferrera and Missios (2005), Kipperberg (2007) and Usui (2008)]. Based on UK municipal panel data, Abbott et al. (2011) study the determinants of dry recycling and composting rates separately. They suggest that in explaining the variation in the total recycling rate, it is helpful to disaggregate into dry and composting recycling. For composting, there is a complex relationship between the frequency of its collection, the collection frequency for residual waste and the type of container. In addition, Abbott et al. (2011) show that there is evidence that a lower collection frequency of residual waste increases dry recycling rates. This is interesting as some policy advisers in the Netherlands suggest that reducing the residual waste collection frequency could encourage recycling as well [see Reus and Jonkergouw (2013)]. For the Netherlands until now, no attention has been given to the effectiveness of curbside collection of recyclables. This was due to a lack of data. In this contribution, we fill this gap in the literature, using a large panel data set (1998–2012) for the Netherlands with information on local waste policies. In addition, we distinguish between unsorted, compostable, paper, glass, textile and plastic waste.Footnote 2 Furthermore, we analyze whether the type of curbside container (mini-bin, duo-bin for two different types of waste,Footnote 3 bag or crate) influences the results. We are also able to include (municipal) fixed effects as we have a large panel. Previous research with cost functions has shown the importance of including fixed effects [see Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2015)]. Moreover, Palatnik et al. (2014) show for the Netherlands that the combination of UBP with door-to-door recycling is associated with a 40 % reduction in unsorted waste generation relative to a setting with only drop-off or limited door-to-door recycling or no UBP. Therefore, to investigate such interaction effects, we construct a variable combining UBP with the number of types of recyclables collected door-to-door and a variable combining the existence of drop-off centers with curbside collection. We show that such multiplicative interaction effects are not present in our model. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, data and method are discussed. Estimation results are given in Sect. 3 for recycling rates and in Sect. 4 for the interaction effects. Finally, Sect. 5 contains some conclusions.",27

Barbier,Mikołaj Czajkowski,Nick Hanley,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the seminal study by Kriström and Riera (1996), economists have debated whether and how the willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental improvement varies with respect to income, and what the likely magnitude of that income elasticity might be. There is evidence from consumer expenditure surveys that environmental quality could be a luxury good, implying that the income elasticity of demand is higher than one (Ghalwash 2008). In contrast, studies that directly estimate the income elasticity of WTP for environmental improvement find that this elasticity is typically less than one (Kriström and Riera 1996; Ready et al. 2002; Hökby and Söderqvist 2003; Jacobsen and Hanley 2009; Czajkowski and Ščasný 2010). Others have shown that the theoretical relationship between the elasticity of demand and the income elasticity of WTP is not straightforward for environmental public goods, and that knowledge of the one does not necessarily provide information on the other (Flores and Carson 1997; Ebert 2003). Whether the elasticity of the WTP for environmental improvement with respect to income is constant is yet to be resolved. There is a growing theoretical literature suggesting that this parameter is unlikely to be constant (Flores and Carson 1997; Ebert 2003; Hökby and Söderqvist 2003). Similarly, some theoretical explanations of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) are consistent with the marginal WTP for reducing pollution varying with income (McConnell 1997; Stokey 1998; Andreoni and Levinson 2001; Israel and Levinson 2004). In contrast, recommended guidance principles for benefits transfer are often based on the assumption that the income elasticity of these WTP values is constant (Pearce 2006; Ready and Navrud 2006; Czajkowski and Ščasný 2010; Lindhjem and Navrud 2015). The purpose of this paper is to explore both theoretically and empirically whether or not the WTP for pollution control varies with income. A theoretical explanation is presented of how the income elasticity of WTP for more of an environmental good—or less of an environmental bad—varies with income. We then undertake an empirical investigation of whether or not the income elasticity is constant, based on a large multi-country dataset of individual WTP survey responses for environmental improvements in the Baltic Sea. Following Andreoni and Levinson (2001), Israel and Levinson (2004), McConnell (1997) and Stokey (1998), our theoretical model demonstrates the conditions under which the elasticity of the marginal WTP for reducing pollution with respect to income is likely to be constant. However, in contrast to these earlier models in which environmental quality is controlled in a social planner’s problem, the model developed here is based on a representative agent’s decision whether or not to contribute some portion of their income to pollution reduction. Since our derivation of the income elasticity is based on preferences, it enables a comparison with theoretical explorations in the environmental valuation literature that distinguish the income elasticity of WTP from the demand for environmental quality with respect to income (Flores and Carson 1997; Ebert 2003; Hökby and Söderqvist 2003). Our model indicates that the income elasticity of the marginal WTP for pollution reduction is only constant under very restrictive conditions, and moreover, confirms that a constant elasticity is not necessary for generating an environmental Kuznets curve relationship between pollution levels and income per capita. Although the main objective of our theoretical model is to show conceptually what might influence the income elasticity of the marginal WTP for pollution reduction, and how this elasticity might vary across people, actually determining whether this elasticity is constant is primarily an empirical issue. Consequently, the aim of our empirical analysis is to test the null hypothesis that the elasticity of the WTP for pollution control with respect to income is constant. To do this, we make use of a large multi-country dataset from a contingent valuation study of the benefits of meeting nutrient reduction targets for the Baltic Sea (Ahtiainen et al. 2014). The survey was aimed at estimating the WTP for reducing eutrophication in the Baltic Sea, with respondents drawn from 9 littoral countries—Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden. Due to the large differences in respondents’ income levels between and within these countries, the dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine the income elasticity of WTP for reducing eutrophication across a very wide range of household income levels—from less than 500 to over 5000 euros (EUR) per month. We employ the Box-Cox model to test our null hypothesis, which is rejected. We find that the income elasticity of the WTP for eutrophication control is increasing and concave, and that it behaves similarly irrespectively of model specification. It takes values of 0.1–0.2 for low-income respondents and reaches 0.6–0.7 for the highest income levels observed in our dataset. This result is consistent with previous findings (Ready et al. 2002; Czajkowski and Ščasný 2010). The outline of our paper is as follows. The next section develops our theoretical model of the WTP for pollution reduction, which we use to derive the conditions under which the income elasticity of this WTP is constant. Next, we discuss the implications of this model for deriving an environmental Kuznets curve relationship between pollution levels and income per capita and for non-marginal pollution reductions. The subsequent sections of the paper develop our Box-Cox regression model for testing the null hypothesis that the elasticity of the marginal WTP for pollution control with respect to income is constant, and apply this model to our case study of eutrophication control in Baltic Sea countries. We conclude by discussing our theoretical and empirical results, and their implications for future research.",44

One reason for this is that there are differences in the spatial configuration of these goods—so that preferences adapt to individuals’ home environments (Nielsen et al. 2007) and the availability to them of substitutes (Munro and Hanley 1999). Another line of reasoning concerns residential sorting: people’s preferences for environmental goods partly determine where they choose to live, so that measures of preferences tend to be correlated with measures of environmental quality or with distance to environmental amenities (Timmins and Murdock 2007; Timmins and Schlenker 2009; Baerenklau et al. 2010). Recent developments in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) allow the researcher to obtain rich datasets containing detailed information about the spatial configuration of environmental goods, and to investigate spatial patterns in stated and revealed preferences for such environmental goods. In this paper we use GIS data related to forest characteristics in Poland as variables explaining the variation in the publics’ Willingness To Pay (WTP) for changes in forest attributes resulting from the implementation of a new country-wide forest management and protection program. Individual-specific WTP values are derived from a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) study. Spatial regression methods are used to investigate the relationships between stated WTP for changes in national forest management, and the characteristics of forests where people live. This shows that WTP is higher the closer people live to their nearest forest, but WTP is also higher the scarcer forests are in the area where they live (that is, the lower is the fraction of forest cover to total land area). We also investigate spatial patterns in latent classes which represent heterogeneity in preferences, finding that such latent clusters of preferences in space do indeed exist. Identifying such clusters, we argue, is useful for policy-making and environmental management. The literature devoted to spatial dependencies in economic values of the natural environment includes revealed preference studies where GIS data are used to identify characteristics of environmental goods. For example, Schläpfer and Hanley (2003) use this approach to investigate preferences for landscape protection programs, and Termansen et al. (2008) investigate recreational values of forests in Denmark using site choice data for 52 forest sites whose characteristics (forest area, share of coniferous forests and distance to the site) are described using GIS data. Baerenklau (2010) incorporates latent class modelling into a travel cost count data approach to deal with un-observed heterogeneity in the population of potential back-country hikers. Our approach differs in making use of a stated preference method which can estimate a wider set of values than those related to recreational use alone. We also derive maps of spatial clusters in WTP values for forest attributes. Spatially-referenced environmental data has also been used extensively in stated-preference studies. For example, Jørgensen et al. (2013) use GIS data on distance to the Odense River as an explanatory variable in contingent valuation study. GIS data is also used in the development of benefits transfer models based on stated preference data (e.g., Bateman et al. 2011). More relevant for this paper are studies where GIS data has been used to investigate the spatial distribution of WTP derived from DCE studies. Examples of this approach include non-parametric analysis of respondents’ WTP for choice attributes. Campbell et al. (2008) applied Moran’s I statistic and confirmed significant global spatial clustering of the WTP estimates and that these estimates exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation even over relatively large spatial areas. In a follow-up paper, Campbell et al. (2009) find further evidence of an intrinsic spatial influence on WTP. They used Kriging methods as a means of benefit transfer to illustrate spatial variation and regional disparities in WTP. As a further example, Johnston et al. (2011) use the Getis–Ord statistic to locate welfare hot-spots. Parametric analysis of estimated WTP was applied by Abildtrup et al. (2013), Broch et al. (2013) and Yao et al. (2014). In both of these studies of forest values, random effect panel models were used with socio-demographic and spatial data as explanatory variables to explain variation in individual WTP values for changes in forest management. In Abildtrup et al. (2013), spatial heterogeneity in WTP for forest attributes (tree species, facilities, hiking paths and access to water) was modeled using binary variables equal to one if a forest with corresponding attributes was within 10 km radius from an individuals’ home. Choice data came from an internet sample of residents in Lorraine, in Northern France, and concerned enhancements in the recreational resources of local forests, Similarly, Yao et al. (2014) used data on forest size and distance from respondent’s homes to capture spatial dependencies in WTP for enhancement of biodiversity in New Zealand forests. Finally Broch et al. (2013) included spatial variables as covariates directly into a DCE model. The main objective of our paper is to identify spatial determinants and spatial clustering of WTP for forest attributes in Poland. We argue that spatial variability has implications for the design and acceptability of forest management policies. To do this we firstly estimate a Mixed Logit (MXL) model using the public’s DCE responses to derive individual WTP values, and then use these individual-specific WTP estimates as dependent variables in a GIS-based spatial regression. This approach very much follows that of Abildtrup et al. (2013) and Yao et al. (2014). However, our paper extends the existing literature of spatial heterogeneity of preferences in three ways. Firstly, our GIS dataset contains much more detailed information about forest characteristics than any of the earlier approaches. Secondly, for the second stage of the analysis, spatial econometric models were applied to recognize the inherent spatial autocorrelation of WTP. Thirdly, we apply a spatial latent class analysis to identify clusters of respondents with similar preferences for forest conservation. This proves to be a useful exercise in revealing spatial patterns of values.",62

The Effects of Emotions on Stated Preferences for Environmental Goods,December 2017,Nick Hanley,Christopher Boyce,Michael Townsend,Male,Male,Male,Male,"What determines the variation in stated preferences for environmental goods? Researchers have investigated the effects on willingness to pay (WTP) of observables such as income (Jacobsen and Hanley 2009), experience with and knowledge of the good (LaRiviere et al. 2014; Czajkowski et al. 2015), and location (Schaafsma et al. 2013; Termansen et al. 2013); as well as exploring ways of modelling un-observed heterogeneity (Hynes et al. 2008). In this paper, we explore the possible impacts of another set of factors on the variation in stated preferences, namely an individual’s emotional state at the time of the survey. A large literature in behavioural sciences and psychology suggests that emotions affect people’s decisions in a wide range of settings (Loewenstein 2000; Elster 1998). This evidence, which we summarize in Sect. 2 of this paper, is largely obtained in the context of actual choices and behaviours. It might therefore be reasonable to speculate that emotions will also affect stated choices. However, behavioural intention is not identical to actual behaviour. For example, the theory of planned behaviour (see e.g., Ajzen 1991) suggests that a behaviour is influenced primarily by the intention to achieve the behaviour and the degree of perceived (and actual) control over the behaviour. Although the theory of planned behaviour has been shown to account for substantial amounts of variance in intention and behaviour (Armitage and Conner 2001), the relationship can depend upon intermediated factors such as individual attitudes to the behaviour in question and social norms about the behaviour (Ajzen 1991). Thus, whilst emotions have been shown to affect actual behaviour, they might not necessarily affect stated choices in the same way, if for example emotions influence intentions or perceptions about control (Ruthig et al. 2007). Nevertheless, it would be expected that if emotions were to influence intentions or control perceptions, they may still play an important role, albeit a slightly different one to that of actual behaviour, in stated choices. It is this role which this paper investigates. If there are effects of changing emotions on revealed or stated choices, this could pose a challenge to the interpretation of benefit-cost measures of value, since these are based on a model of rational choice and stable, consistent, and complete preference sets for each individual (Brown et al. 2008; Rabin 1998). If revealed or stated values are dependent upon an individual’s emotional state at the time benefits or costs are measured, then this introduces a source of context dependence which the Kaldor–Hicks criterion underlying Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) was not intended to deal with.Footnote 1 For example, a change in emotional state post project implementation could mean that those who gain are no longer willing to pay enough to compensate losers, even though the project had passed the CBA test before implementation. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of emotions referred to as incidental emotions. These emotions, such as sadness or happiness, occur at the moment of a choice decision, but are un-related to the payoffs from the decision at hand. Our experimental set-up uses stated choice modelling to estimate preferences over changes in an environmental good in an experimental laboratory setting, with a series of treatments designed to induce a given emotional state in respondents prior to their stated choices. The emotional states are sadness, happiness and a neutral state. We induce these different incidental emotions using an established practice in behavioural science. We subsequently test whether the inducement procedure worked in terms of inducing the targeted emotional state, and find that it did. The materials used to induce the targeted emotional state are un-related to the environmental good, since otherwise participants would feel they were being manipulated in terms of stating their choices for changes in the good (beach quality). Our main hypothesis is that variation in emotional state experienced prior to participation in the stated choice experiment has a significant effect on stated preferences (and thus on Willingness To Pay) for changes in an environmental good. That is, we test whether variations in emotional state can help explain preference heterogeneity. Based on inferences one can draw from the psychology literature, we also test whether a respondent’s emotional state impacts on the randomness with which they make their choices in the stated preference exercise.",20

In addition, Olmstead and Rhode (2015) in their historical evaluation of animal disease policy in the United States point out the large share of compensation (indemnity) payments in the total cost of a range of disease eradication attempts. Nevertheless, as argued by Olmstead and Rhode “eradication... would demand devising incentive-compatible compensation schemes” (p. 279) which would “create incentives for farmers to participate” (p. 283) in reporting disease outbreaks on their farms. However, such compensation payments to farmers have often been criticised,Footnote 1 and government agencies under pressure to reduce them. In this context Bicknell et al. (1999) report that the New Zealand Animal Health Board’s “latest national Tb strategy” stipulates that “compensation payments will be reduced” (p. 514) and on this basis they proceed to evaluate the impact of eliminating compensation payments on farmer behaviour. Using “a dynamic bioeconomic model of livestock disease control” (p. 501) they find that although “producers take a more active role in controlling the spread of disease within their herds”, in the presence of voluntary testing for disease “the elimination of compensation leads to a decrease in testing activity” (p. 514). As a consequence, where disease notification is mandatory Bicknell et al. (1999) point out that “the elimination of compensation payments may prompt non-compliant behaviour” (p. 514). Moreover, this problem of clashing incentives for on-farm biosecurity versus reporting disease outbreaks in the context of compensation payments has been highlighted again recently by Hennessy and Wolf (2015) who suggest that “compensation must be sufficient to ensure early reporting but not so large as to discourage appropriate levels of biosecurity effort” (p. 1). But in developing this argument Hennessy and Wolf (2015) then go on to cite the analysis of Gramig et al. (2009) and on this basis reach the conclusion that “a simple one-size-fits-all indemnity payment could not deal with both problems” (p. 9)—which is at odds with actual disease control policy where “Animal health authorities have relied on a single mechanism—indemnities—to facilitate both ex ante biosecurity effort and ex post reporting” (p. 9). However, although Hennessy and Wolf (2015) “explore the incentives that indemnities offer”, they do so using “a direct, discursive and non-mathematical approach” (p. 2). Therefore, this conflict between the widespread and on-going animal disease policy of using a single incentive mechanism, compensation payments, to deliver both “appropriate levels of biosecurity” and “ensure disease reporting” and Hennessy and Wolf’s conclusion that such an approach “could not deal with both problems”, suggests it might be worthwhile undertaking a more mathematical approach to analysing this situation, with a view to throwing more light on the trade-off of farmer incentives associated with varying levels of compensation payments. Such an analysis is reported in what follows. Section 2 develops a simple model of farmer decision-making in the presence of the threat of animal disease—and where the farmer must make sequential decisions regarding: (i) whether to choose to undertake voluntary on-farm biosecurity measures which are costly, but which would reduce the risk of a disease outbreak; and (ii) whether to comply or not with the mandatory requirement to report (notify) an outbreak of disease should it subsequently take place on the farm. It should be noted at this point that although the choice of whether or not to report a disease outbreak fits readily into such a binary choice format, framing the decision about investing in on-farm biosecurity measures as a binary choice is less realistic. More specifically, farmers are likely to have a range of biosecurity measures to choose from, with associated implications both for the cost of implementation and for the impact on the risk of an outbreak. In addition, this specification in effect excludes consideration of both spatial and temporal externalities in relation to disease outbreaks. Therefore, while this simplified approach is maintained for the analysis to follow, its implications for policy are considered in the Conclusion.Footnote 2
 This model is then subjected to a numerical analysis in Sect. 2, which evaluates the role of a range of policy and other parameters of the farmer’s decision environment in determining the scope for animal health agencies to use compensation payments to provide appropriate incentives both for the implementation of on-farm biosecurity and for compliance behaviour in relation to disease reporting. Note in this context that the parameter values used in the numerical analysis are largely chosen for illustrative purposes. In particular, the NAO report cited above points out that the UK’s Animal Health Act 1981 “requires compensation to be based on the value of the animal immediately before it became infected”—where the government’s interpretation of “value” “is that compensation will be based on ‘market value”’ (NAO 2002, p. 82). Therefore, the exploration in what follows of the scope for such payments to be varied is in effect a hypothetical consideration of cost-effectiveness options within the context of the legal requirement for compensation to be paid as provided by the UK’s Animal Health Act 1981. Finally, the Conclusion provides both a brief summary and a discussion of policy implications, with particular reference to the issues of spatial heterogeneity in disease prevalence, flexibility in the implementation of on-farm biosecurity and the contribution of the paper to the debate over the size of compensation payments as required by UK law.",9

Horan,David Finnoff,Jason F. Shogren,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Wildlife vectors transmit infectious pathogens within and between species, posing significant risks to both ecological and human health (see for example Daszak et al. 2000; Economist 2005; Jones et al. 2008).Footnote 1 Managing these risks cost-effectively requires taking both an ex ante and ex post perspective into consideration—the pre- and post-pathogen states of the world—as these states are ecologically and economically linked (Perrings 2005; Finnoff et al. 2016). Indeed, it is well-established that the state of the non-invaded system typically plays an important role for pathogen invasion success (Case 1990; Namba and Takahashi 1993; Gilligan and van den Bosch 2008), particularly for at-risk wildlife populations (Daszak et al. 2000, 2001 and Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). This means ex ante management affects the odds and potential magnitude and economic consequences of invasion, with the ex ante incentives for investing in protection depending on the expected management of the ex post system. Public health agencies and organizations appear to recognize these linkages, as investing in ex ante disease prevention has become a priority and a key element of the “One Health” approach to disease management (e.g., CDC 2011; The World Bank 2013). Yet most bioeconomic pathogen models have focused on the ex post state—optimal management given a pathogen has already been introduced into the system (e.g., Horan and Wolf 2005; Fenichel and Horan 2007a, b; Horan and Melstrom 2011; Horan et al. 2011a, b). This approach treats the ex post initial conditions as exogenous, implying that managers are unable to take actions to affect the odds and potential magnitude of invasion.Footnote 2 The limited bioeconomic research on ex ante management (Horan and Fenichel 2007; also see Berry et al. (2015) for a human disease application) considers the role of prevention efforts in reducing the likelihood of an outbreak, but generally treats the initial conditions for any potential outbreak as exogenous. This is a concern given that multi-stability can arise in systems invaded by harmful pathogens (Kremer 1996; Chakraborty et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2011), which means the conditions of the system at the time of the outbreak might critically affect ex post outcomes (Dasgupta and Mäler 2003; Brock and Starrett 2003).Footnote 3
 
Finnoff et al. (2016) recently examined the optimal ex ante management of a native species when this management affects the likelihood and magnitude of a potential non-native species invasion. They showed how both the bioeconomic multi-stability of the invaded system and uncertainty about the invasion can create economic non-convexities that yield multiple candidate solutions to the ex ante optimization problem. In their model, the native species acted as a form of natural insurance-cum-prevention: a larger stock of the native species had the dual effect of reducing the likelihood of an invasion, and of increasing the likelihood that any invasion would lead to the more desirable basin of attraction. Our analysis examines the management of pathogen invasion risks to a native wildlife population. This analysis is based on Finnoff et al.’s (2016) model, except that we introduce a key difference in the nature of the endogenous risks. Specifically, the wildlife population does not provide natural insurance-cum-prevention in the current setting. A larger wildlife stock does provide natural insurance in our model. However, a larger and denser wildlife stock is subject to greater invasion risks, at least for some densities. This means we have a compound probability problem in which the wildlife stock has opposing effects on the two forms of protection, prevention and insurance (also see Finnoff et al. 2013 on compound lotteries in endogenous risk models). This means the net effect of conservation on protection endogenously depends on whether the natural insurance or natural prevention effect of natural capital dominates at the current state. Moreover, investments in anthropogenic prevention and in natural capital are complements for conveying prevention in our model, whereas they are always substitutes in Finnoff et al.’s (2016) analysis. This has implications for the mix of controls. As with Finnoff et al.’s (2016) analysis, we find that endogenous invasion risks and ex post economic multi-stability can create ex ante multi-stability. However, the magnitudes of the equilibrium wildlife stock levels relative to the risk-free case, and the incentives for pursuing the various equilibria, differ in our model relative to Finnoff et al. (2016). These differences stem from the different tradeoffs associated with anthropogenic and natural prevention and insurance in the current model. In our numerical example, the natural insurance effect dominates the natural prevention effect.",3

Ecological systems experience significant dynamics while changes in the natural environment may affect the economy with major time delays. The depletion of non-renewable resources and the accumulation of pollution stocks create a direct link between the present and the future, i.e. the current state of the economy and its future capacity. Every ton of carbon emitted today will have a long-lasting impact on future climate conditions and every ton of raw material extracted from the ground will not be available in the future if not fully recycled. Investments in energy-intensive sectors like buildings, infrastructure, and transportation have an inherent long-run character so that current decisions affect the ecology and the economy over a very long period. Time is also crucial when applying cost-benefit analysis which requires using intertemporal discount rates. Finally, time is the central issue for all reflections on intergenerational equity which are increasingly important with global pollution problems such as climate change. Classical economics integrated nature into the theory by using the factor land, but did not particularly highlight the importance of time. The focus on the static or “natural” price precluded a separate analysis of transition periods and long-run dynamics. It was one of the great achievements of Böhm-Bawerk (1884) to assign the complex issue of time its place in the theory. He explained the rationale of positive interest rates by explicitly distinguishing consumption goods and capital inputs according to different points in time. The new concept of capital induced the notion of time preferences, which in turn led to the concept of time-discounting in modern macroeconomics and climate studies. The seminal contribution of Hotelling (1931) on exhaustible resource use documents that resource economists were among the pioneers exploring the long-run dynamics of the economy. In various other areas of environmental economics the time dimension has played a central role in modeling since then. Prominently, exploring the long-run interlinkages between the economy and the climate system requires assigning time a prominent place in modeling. The question of how to introduce specific aspects of time and timing into the theory has fostered continual reflections in many areas of economics; for an early informal survey see Rosenstein-Rodan (1934). Some specific aspects of time are worth mentioning. Remarkably, the constraint of time is the same for all individuals, governments, and firms irrespective of all other conditions. Notwithstanding, individuals’ focus, longevity and preferences may differ markedly, which may lead to considerable friction and externalities between these groups. Moreover, time can neither be stored nor accumulated. However, when other goods are stored and accumulated, it is exactly time which mainly determines the value of these activities. It is true that all economic activities take time but that in many theories this aspect of reality is entirely disregarded. This is not a deficiency in general as the need for complexity reduction in economic models is large. The requirement of mathematical formalization often limits the numbers of aspects which can be included in a model while providing the clear benefit of consistent theory-building.",2

In the European Union (EU), local bodies at the municipality level are legally obliged to provide a collection system for MSW, in agreement with the regulations and guidelines set by EU directives, national laws, and regional plans. The EU directives posit that MSW should be handled and disposed close to the location where it is generated: to achieve this objective, each EU member state designs territorial areas where to treat and dispose MSW generated by the local households. This policy is rooted in the  two pillars of Self-Sufficiency Principle (SSP) and Proximity Principle (PP). These principles impose the establishment of an integrated network of municipal waste treatment facilities in order to ensure to each community a self-sufficient disposal and recovery capacity, such that waste is processed in the proximity of where it is generated. The resulting policy is aimed to reach two main goals: the first is to prevent the creation of pollution havens in regions with low environmental standards; the second is to enhance local communities’ awareness of their environmental responsibilities.Footnote 1 From an economic viewpoint, however, the policy has also an impact on the market structure of the waste sector. The current regulation, in fact, limits the choices of the local collectors, that cannot transport waste to disposal facilities in neighbouring areas. As a result, local disposers face a more limited number of competitors (if any) and, as a result, are likely to have more market power. The MSW industry has a vertical structure, reflecting the three main phases of MSW processing. In the first phase households generate MSW.Footnote 2 The second phase is the collection of MSW: a municipality based collector picks up waste from the households. In this phase households do exert some effort to separate recyclable from undifferentiated waste. This is an important activity reflecting another principle on which the current EU regulation is based: the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). According to it, all subjects acting along the goods production and retail chains are responsible for the final diversion of those goods when transformed into waste. As a consequence, the EPR and its reuse-recover targets potentially  reduce the amount of waste that reaches disposal facilities. In the third and last phase, the collector brings the waste to a disposer that processes MSW: undifferentiated waste is either processed in a landfill or by an incinerator. Separated waste, instead, is recycled directly by the collector. Mainly due to scale and density economies, the collection phase can be considered a legal monopoly; moreover, the public/merit good nature of MSW advocates for the implementation of a compulsory public service.Footnote 3 The disposal segment instead could in principle operate in a more competitive regime. The provisions of the SSP and of the PP, however, force collectors to find a disposing facility inside a defined territorial area and among a restricted number of disposers, allowing the latter to potentially exploit a scarcity rent. Whereas the interrelationship between waste regulation and competition at the disposal segment is a more general issue, the EU case is of particular interest because of the inconsistency between the treatment of MSW vis à vis industrial and hazardous waste. It is noteworthy, in fact, that the same principles (the SSP and the PP) do not apply to industrial waste: despite the higher environmental hazard, the latter can be sent to any licensed disposal facility in the world, effectively allowing more competition between disposers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the impact of regulation and, in particular of the SSP and of the PP, on the market outcomes in the EU waste sector with a particular focus on the resulting incentives for households and collectors to engage in waste separation and recycling. To this end we set up a simple spatial model of MSW production, collection and disposal. The model allows analyzing the major economic effects of the EU policy and, in particular, the costs and benefits of the SSP and PP provisions. The analysis provides relevant policy implications. First of all, we confirm that the SSP and PP principles of the EU waste regulation, limiting competition between disposers, increase the cost of MSW collection to the local community. Second, however, we also highlight a subtler consequence of such principles: the higher cost of disposing MSW leads households to exert more effort and, in turn, increase the amount of separated collection, decreasing instead the waste sent for disposal. The latter  substitution effect may be a less intended implication of the current EU regulation and it constitutes, perhaps, a further rationale behind the imposition of the SSP and PP principles. Aggregate level evidence from the 27 EU countries suggests indeed a negative correlation between the percentage of unselected MSW processed by a disposer (landfill or incinerator) and the average disposing costs (\(-0.65\)) and a positive correlation between the percentage of separated waste and the average disposing costs (0.73). The latter is illustrated in Fig. 1. As liberalization in other regulated sectors (e.g. gas, electricity) has led to a decrease in the final price to users, we may conjecture that a similar process in the MSW segment would increase the percentage of disposed waste and reduce households’ effort for separated collection. Separated collection and the cost of landfill. Source: Eurostat (2010) To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first papers to model the MSW industry in all its segments and participating agents. Most of the existing literature on MSW and its management has focused on either: (i) the environmental implications of waste and policies to correct welfare distortions (Davies and Doble 2004; Jenkins et al. 2004; Caplan et al. 2006) or (ii) competition for the market (Demsetz 1968), according to which natural monopolies can be managed by private firms whose right to operate is entrusted by the government via competitive tendering (Williamson 1976; Laffont and Tirole 1994, Ch.7). We focus instead on competition in the MSW market (Porter and Linde 1995; Crocker and Masten 1996; Massarutto 2007). Furthermore, a stream of literature, initiated by the seminal work in Fullerton and Kinnaman (1995), highlights the role of price differences to environmental choices. The emphasis is on waste dumping, a prominent source of harsh environmental damage that has been further studied also by Choe and Fraser (1998, 1999), Shinkuma (2003), Almer and Goeschl (2010), D’Alisa et al. (2010), D’Amato and Zoli (2012), inter alia. Unlike most of this literature, we do model the vertical structure of the MSW sector.Footnote 4 Moreover, our work  complements the recalled literature by emphasizing a different channel through which price differences matter, i.e. the incentives for separated waste collection, and underscoring that such price differences arise in the EU due to the very peculiar regulatory structure of MSW. Furthermore, the model in this paper can be adapted to address a number of other relevant and related issues. For example, Silvestri (2014) focuses on related issues like: (a) other possible policy instruments to achieve the objectives of the current regulation but limiting the distortions; (b) the analysis of the implications of the sector’s structure for the entrance of new disposers. Finally, whereas our paper addresses regulation in the European MSW sector, the implications of our analysis may go beyond and find a wider application in contexts where relaxing waste regulation has a likely “pro-competitive” effect on segments of the MSW chain. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce a spatial model of the MSW sector, capturing many of the characterizing features of the EU case. The model is solved in Sect. 3 and the “status quo”, in which the SSP and PP are enforced, is compared with a scenario in which the regulation is relaxed and the disposal sector is exposed to more competition. In Sect. 4, we focus on the surplus and welfare implications of our analysis. Section 5 provides an illustration based on the special case of symmetric areas. Finally, Sect. 6 briefly discusses the main results and concludes. All proofs are in the Appendix.",6

Studies of common-pool resource dilemmas (CPR) analyze harvesting decisions within groups in repeated games with the aim of identifying conditions under which groups self-organize so as to prevent resource exhaustion (Ostrom et al. 1994; Ostrom 1992, 2006; Sigmund et al. 2010; Janssen et al. 2011). In most studies, group members harvest resources in the absence of any between-group spillovers. However, 85% of Africa’s water resources are composed of large river basins that are shared between several countries (Ashton 2002). Conflicts over water or fishing camps are frequent and are likely to escalate in the future because of climate change (Pomeroy et al. 2007; Mwiturubani 2010; Downing et al. 2014). How does intergroup conflict affect in-group behavior under resource uncertainty? Would a danger of sudden resource depletion encourage random acts of violence? To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose an experimental research design to examine the causal relationships between resource uncertainty, intergroup conflict and intragroup cooperation in the CPRs. Formally, we present experimental evidence from a 2-way mixed design experiment with two-between-group factors: (1) the presence (or absence) of shocks that can destroy a part of resources; and (2) the availability of intergroup conflict. Our approach is motivated by the fact that the intensity and severity of natural disasters is expected to increase in the forthcoming years due to climate change (IPCC 2007). There are concerns that climate change will escalate conflicts over renewable resources, which are already under threat or in a state of decline. The empirical evidence from 183 pre-industrial societies indicates that resource volatility, rather than consistent resource scarcity, makes war between them more likely (Ember and Ember 1992). Also recent studies have shown that climate-related disasters increase the instances of intergroup conflicts (e.g. Harari and La Ferrara 2017), Hsiang et al. (2013) find that changes in climate towards warmer temperatures and more extremes rainfall increase the frequency of intergroup conflict by 14%, while Schleussner et al. (2016) report a coincidence rate of 9% between armed-conflict and climate-related natural disasters over the period of 1980 and 2010 globally. So far, we know surprisingly little about specific mechanisms through which resource uncertainty affects intergroup conflict over resources and in-group harvesting in CPRs. The relationship between natural resources and conflict remains a much debated topic in economics (Mildner et al. 2011; Nillesen and Bulte 2014). According to the first view, conflict results from resource scarcities, which leads to unequal resource distribution (Homer-Dixon 1994; 1999). From this perspective, deprived groups are forced to fight over resources for survival. However, there has been little empirical evidence to support this view (De Koning 2007; Mildner et al. 2011). Instead, studies point out increasingly that resource abundance and greed drives conflicts more often than grievance (Collier and Hoeffler 2004). For instance, armed conflicts in many Central and West African countries have been financed with revenues from selling timber, which has been referred to in the literature as “forest wars” (FAO 2005; USAID 2005; De Koning 2007). In our design, we consider conflict by greed. We model the probability of winning in conflict as proportional to the difference in resources between groups. As a result, groups, which conserve resources, are also more likely to defeat their opponents. The design of our experiment allows us to compare our results to the preceding studies. In particular, research has shown that intergroup conflict increases within-group cooperation in experiments, where conflict is exogenously imposed on group (e.g. Rapoport and Bornstein 1987; Abbink et al. 2012; Cardenas and Mantilla 2015). We take here a different approach and examine the probability that a group would raid another group to take its resources in a controlled laboratory conditions, which allows us to study factors conducive to conflicts. Would the possibility of conflict make subjects conserve resources so as to increases their chances of winning? A combination of “in-group love” and “out-group hate” has been referred to in the literature as parochial altruism (Choi and Bowles 2007). Would it evolve under resource uncertainty? Formally, we report the results from a laboratory experiment, where subjects decide how many resources to harvest from a common pool of resources. In the baseline scenario, subjects harvest resources repeatedly within groups from the renewable resource, which re-grows according to the logistic curve. Group members face the temptation to maximize their harvests so as to accumulate more profits. However, if the resource becomes exhausted, everyone in the group loses his/her payoffs. In this context, we study how harvesting is affected by random shocks which diminish resources in the shock treatment. Shocks can be thought of as, for instance, weather shocks or climatic events capable of destroying all, or part of, the common-pool resources. We find that subjects harvest significantly less resources if their group experienced a negative shock to resources in the previous round. This can be explained by the fact that shocks diminishing resources increase the probability of resource collapse, which can only be reduced by groups constraining their harvests. The probability of resource collapse can be also reduced by ‘taking’ resources from the out-group. In the conflict treatment, after harvesting decisions, subjects vote on whether to engage in conflict over resources with another group. Conflict occurs only if the majority of members in either group vote for it. Subsequently, one third of the resource is transferred from the losing to the winning group. This can be interpreted as the winning group annexing the land, which is rich in resources, from the losing group. Our theoretical prediction is that groups refrain from conflict in the equilibrium. This relates to the fact that on average groups have nothing to gain from conflict as we set the expected gain from conflict equal to 0. Yet, we find that conflicts occur frequently. In one-third of cases, conflicts take place almost in every round and are very destructive. In particular, resources are destroyed by repeated attacks by out-group members. The possible explanations behind frequent conflicts are the overestimation of the probability of winning, ‘the pleasure of being nasty’, moral hazard, or excessive risk-taking. In particular, the results from our experiment indicate that the possibility of conflict under resource uncertainty leads to moral hazard. It seems that groups protect themselves from resource exhaustion in the presence of shocks by taking resources from the out-group instead of reducing extraction. Our formal approach relates to the theoretical and experimental literature on the effect of environmental uncertainty on the equilibrium outcomes in the common-pool resource games (Budescu et al. 1992, 1995; Rapoport et al. 1993; Biel and Grling 1995; Hine and Gifford 1996; Botelho et al. 2014; Aflaki 2013; Antoniadou et al. 2013; Kimbrough and Wilson 2013; Safarzynska 2013; Blanco et al. 2016a, b). In a standard harvesting set-up, individuals request resources from the common pool [e.g. Rapoport et al. (1993)]. Resources are drawn from a uniform distribution each period. If the sum of individual extractions exceeds the realized size of the resource, the resource is destroyed and players receive nothing. Otherwise, players receive amounts equal to their individual requests. Rapoport and his co-authors show that if the risk associated with the resource size is high enough, this can lead to more consumption. In the discussed setting, the availability of resources in the future is independent of current decisions. Similarly, in the dynamic CPR game by Walker and Gardner (1992), players decide repeatedly on the allocation of a fixed amount of endowment between private activity and investment in the CPR. The probability of the game continuation is a function of aggregate group investment in a given period. The authors show that CPRs are destroyed in all cases, and rather quickly. In Walker and Gardner (1992) , similarly to paper by Rapoport et al. (1993), the size of the resource does not dependent on decisions of players in previous rounds. A number of papers have introduced uncertainty to the public good experiments, where subjects are asked to allocate tokens to the public good, which otherwise they can keep for themselves (Dickinson 1998; Gangadharan and Nemes 2009; Blanco et al. 2015). The number of tokens allocated to the public good is then multiplied by a factor greater than one, and distributed among group members. It has been shown that making returns from aggregate group investments uncertain lowers individual contributions to the public good (Dickinson 1998; Gangadharan and Nemes 2009). Blanco et al. (2015, 2016b) use a different setting, where subjects are asked to withdraw funds from the group fund to the private account, instead of contributing to the public good. The authors show that introducing uncertainty over the size of the group fund or the probability of destruction of some funds therein increases appropriation from the group fund. The discussed approaches fail to capture the important aspects of dynamics of renewable resources, like groundwater systems, fisheries, and forests (Botelho et al. 2014). To address this, in our experiment, resources are renewable. As a result, decisions of subjects in the current period affect the renewal rate of resources in the future, harvesting possibilities, as well as the probability of the game continuation. We find that in this setting uncertainty makes subjects conserve resources. In the design of the conflict scenario, especially when specifying the probability of conflict, we followed the literature on contest games, where the probability of winning is proportional to investments in conflict made by competing groups (see for overviews Garfinkel and Skaperdas 2007; Sheremeta 2017). In a typical contest game, several parties or individuals spend resources to secure a prize for themselves (e.g. Bornstein 2003). If a group wins, the prize is distributed among group members equally, otherwise investments are lost. It has been shown that group competition leads to higher level of cooperation and lower levels of free-riding (Bornstein and Erev 1994; Gunnthorsdottir and Rapoport 2006; Abbink et al. 2010). For instance, Abbink et al. (2010) find that conflict expenditures of groups are substantially larger than those of individuals, and both are above the equilibrium. In this paper, we apply a similar approach to Abbink et al. (2010) setting and extend it to the common-pool resource dilemmas. We find that intergroup cooperation is conditional on the outcomes of past conflicts: subjects reduce their harvests only after losing resources in conflict, but they increase extraction after receiving resources from the out-group. The reminders of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 3, we discuss the experimental design and its theoretical predictions, followed by results in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",12

However, climatologists emphasise that the real threats of climate change are the non-marginal effects when the climate system shifts to a system with different dominant feedbacks and different equilibria (Lenton and Ciscar 2013). The point where such a shift occurs is called a tipping point (Biggs et al. 2012). The literature on the economics of climate change has started to incorporate tipping points in the analysis (e.g., Kopits et al. 2013; Pindyck 2013). For example, several authors have used the DICE model—a prominent integrated assessment model for climate change (Nordhaus 2008)—to study the effect of climate tipping points (Keller et al. 2004; Lemoine and Traeger 2014; Cai et al. 2015; Lontzek et al. 2015). This paper focuses first on theory, and more specifically on a potential climate shock that would lead to an adverse productivity shock in a Ramsey growth model, with uncertainty about the time, impact and type of such a climate catastrophe. The productivity shocks may arise from flooding of cities, sudden increased occurrence of storms and droughts, abrupt desertification of agricultural land, or reversal of the Gulf Stream (e.g., Alley et al. 2003). We show that the economy needs to respond in two ways to such potential shocks. First, carbon needs to be taxed (or priced via a global market for carbon emission permits) to curb the risk of climate calamities as the hazard of a catastrophe increases in the stock of atmospheric carbon. Second, precautionary adjustment to the capital stock is needed to cope with the possibility of an abrupt jump in consumption at the tipping point. The second response follows from adjustments to the Keynes–Ramsey rule in the Ramsey growth model with tipping, which is the focus of a companion paper (van der Ploeg and de Zeeuw 2018). This paper focuses, in contrast, on the social cost of carbon or the optimal carbon tax. In order to make our results comparable with early literature on integrated climate assessment, we also allow for gradual marginal climate damages (e.g., Tol 2002; Nordhaus 2008; Stern 2007; Golosov et al. 2014). We show that the optimal carbon tax consists of two catastrophe components and the usual component internalising marginal damages. The catastrophe components are the risk-averting part and, what we call, the raising-the-stakes part. The first component reduces the probability of tipping, whereas the second component internalises the effects on expected after-calamity welfare. We offer explicit expressions for the optimal tax on carbon and we show, in a calibrated Ramsey growth model for the world economy, how big the increase in the carbon tax is, as compared to the carbon tax that is only based on marginal damages. In this paper, we consider other types of shocks caused by climate tipping as well. A sudden acceleration of carbon emissions, because of a reduction in cooling when ice sheets such as the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet melt away (e.g., Oppenheimer 1998),Footnote 1 or a sudden release of methane buried in sea-beds and permafrost (e.g., Dutta et al. 2006), because of rising sea temperatures, are other tipping points. We view them as a sudden increase in the climate sensitivity, which is the temperature rise from doubling the carbon stock, and we derive the optimal response to a potential tipping point in the climate sensitivity. We also consider the implications of recoverable catastrophes in this paper, such as a sudden rise in the carbon stock or a sudden destruction of a part of the capital stock. Furthermore, we show the effect of an increasing marginal hazard rate (as a function of the stock of atmospheric carbon), which captures the increasing marginal probability of tipping. Finally, we allow for investments in adaptation capital, as an alternative way to counter potential adverse effects of climate tipping. This paper emphasises the need for an appropriate carbon tax, besides adjustments in saving, in the face of potential tipping points driven by global warming in a standard Ramsey growth model. Clarke and Reed (1994), Tsur and Zemel (1996) and Gjerde et al. (1999) also analyse catastrophes with hazard rates, but they do not have Ramsey growth and thus no need for additional adjustments in capital. Gjerde et al. (1999) consider carbon cycle and temperature modules with gradual and catastrophic damages and provide simulation studies of the effects of pending catastrophes on temperature and the economy, but they do not present the optimal carbon tax or the need for adjustments in saving. Smulders et al. (2014) discuss the need for precautionary saving to deal with an impending disaster, but their analysis uses a constant hazard rate, whereas our analysis highlights the effects of endogenous hazard rates that depend on global warming (represented by the carbon stock). Engström and Gars (2016) study catastrophes within the model of Golosov et al. (2014), but the special assumptions needed to get tractable solutions of this model remove the incentive to have adjustment in saving to cope with a pending catastrophe. Our study focuses on the theory first, in a Ramsey growth model, to highlight the need for an additional tax on carbon as well as adjustments to capital, and then presents illustrative quantitative results in a simple calibrated model of the world economy. Other studies have focused on catastrophes and extreme events but not in the context of general equilibrium models of Ramsey growth and climate change. Barro (2013) studies the optimal investment needed to curb the probability of an environmental disaster but abstracts from the precautionary adjustment of capital. Weitzman (2007) highlights the fundamental uncertainty at the upper end of the probability distribution of possible increases in temperature and corresponding damage, and shows that the policy consequences of a fat instead of a thin tail can be dramatic. Martin and Pindyck (2015) study the ‘strange’ implications for the cost–benefit analysis of a cascade of catastrophes within a partial equilibrium context. Pindyck and Wang (2013) use a general equilibrium framework to obtain a price of insurance against catastrophic risks. Section 2 presents our model of growth with tipping points and only catastrophic damages. Section 3 shows that the optimal response requires precautionary capital adjustment and, if the hazard increases with atmospheric carbon, taxing carbon to curb the risk of tipping. Section 4 allows for gradual as well as catastrophic damages from global warming and decomposes the optimal carbon tax into the usual social cost of carbon (i.e., the present value of marginal gradual damages) and the extra carbon taxes that are needed to curb the risk of climate tipping. It also discusses regime shifts with a sudden increase in climate sensitivity, and recoverable catastrophes that destroy a part of the capital stock or that lead to a sudden release of atmospheric carbon. Finally, investments in adaptation capital are discussed. Section 5 concludes.",19

Climate policy has to deal with several intertemporal, geophysical, and interregional aspects. To discuss these issues, we use a framework consisting of an economic part (to describe the use of fossil fuel use and its substitute renewable energy, carbon sequestration with trend growth and sector-specific rates of technical progress, global damages to economic production) and a climate part (to describe the dynamics of atmospheric carbon and global mean temperature). This framework allows us to derive welfare-maximising climate policies as simples rules for the optimal carbon price (equal to the social cost of carbon), the rate at which renewable energies are substituted for fossil fuel, the fraction of fossil that is abated by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), the optimal timing of the transition to the carbon-free era, the maximum cumulative emissions (or the carbon budget for short) and the maximum warming level, and the amount of fossil fuel locked up forever in the crust of the earth. The geophysical, ethical and economic drivers of climate policy can thus clearly be identified. We highlight various features. Regarding the ethics of climate policy, we allow discount rates to decline with the horizon at which costs and benefits are evaluated. Since the costs of global warming occur many decades or even centuries into the future, this has important implications for policy. This feature is known as hyperbolic discounting and has been put forward by Laibson (1997). Following von Below (2012), Schmitt (2014), Belfiori (2017), and Barrage (2018) we also allow policy makers to have a lower ethical discount rate than the market. Both these features allow us to take a stance between the low discount rate used by Stern (2007) and the high discount rate used by Nordhaus (2008): policy makers use lower discount rates for long-run than for short-run appraisal of costs and benefits and may be more farsighted than the market. Both features generally lead to time inconsistency. Given simplifying assumptions, problems of commitment do not arise in our model.Footnote 1 Regarding the geophysical drivers of climate policy, apart from our benchmark of simple linear carbon and temperature dynamics used by atmospheric physicists (e.g., Joos et al. 2013; Allen 2016; Aengenheyster et al. 2018) and economists (e.g., Hassler and Krusell 2012; Golosov et al. 2014; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016; Rezai and van der Ploeg 2016; Gerlagh and Liski 2018), we also allow for a model of carbon dynamics with the positive feedback loop that get unleashed as the capacity of the oceans to absorb carbon diminishes (Millar et al. 2017). Finally, regarding the political drivers of climate policy, we extend our simple rules to allow for non-cooperative decision making to illustrate the point of international free riding and the less ambitious climate policies that result from this (Barrett 2003). This addresses the problem of free riding and is relevant as long as there are no international climate deals with appropriate international transfers to ensure that the global carbon price indeed gets implemented throughout the world economy. Our objective is not to present any novel theoretical results, but to present a simple framework that is consistent with a large and sometimes hard to comprehend integrated assessment literature. We have used our framework for undergraduate and graduate teaching and in discussions with policy makers and interested lay persons. We have found it useful to highlight the drivers on climate policy and to illustrate various assumptions regarding the ethics, economics, geophysics and politics underlying climate policy.Footnote 2 Our contribution ties in with the emerging literature on simple and robust rules for the optimal carbon price (e.g., Nordhaus 1991; Golosov et al. 2014; Rezai and van der Ploeg 2016; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016; Allen 2016; Dietz and Venmans 2018; van der Ploeg 2018; van den Bremer and van der Ploeg 2018). We also offer simple rules for the optimal transition time to the carbon-free era and the amount of locked up fossil fuel. These simple rules take advantage of the much faster convergence of Ramsey economic growth dynamics than that of the carbon cycle, thus greatly simplifying the complexity of the underlying system. The resulting rules are easy to understand, calculate, explain, and communicate. Furthermore, being simple feedback rules, they appear robust to different model specifications as they perform well in a wide variety of integrated assessment models (Rezai and van der Ploeg 2016; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016; Barrage 2014). A multitude of very large and detailed Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of the economy and the climate are able to generate numerical simulations of the optimal global price of carbon, the implied optimal substitution rates of renewable energies for fossil fuel, and the optimal sequestration rates. Although such IAMs give careful suggestions for climate policies, the key determinants of these are difficult to understand. Furthermore, it has been argued that in providing exact numbers they appear more precise than the underlying science would permit and misrepresent the deep uncertainties surrounding global warming damages and the social cost of carbon (e.g., Pindyck 2013; Wagner and Weitzman 2015; Stern 2016). We therefore prefer a clear and transparent approach in which all the drivers of climate policy are immediately apparent. To our benefit, recent insights in atmospheric science suggest that global warming is well explained by cumulative carbon emissions rather than the stock of carbon in the atmosphere (e.g., Allen 2016), even though large-scale IAMs have sophisticated and high-dimensional models to describe the carbon cycle and temperature responses to emission impulses. Our back-on-the-envelope IAM is adapted from the most widely-used IAM, i.e., DICE (Dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy; Nordhaus 2008, 2014). In this IAM economic activity requires energy in production which in turn is generated using a continuum of technologies and energy sources. The energy mix with the lowest unit costs use fossil energy use only and have the largest amount of carbon emission per unit of energy. As more renewable energies are substituted for fossil fuel, the cost per unit of energy becomes more expensive whilst the carbon emissions per unit of energy fall. This substitution is driven by a spectrum of carbon-free technologies, ranging from energy-saving to renewable energy generation in combination with gas-fired power plants. The most expensive fuel mix is fully carbon-free and is referred to as the “backstop” technology. Given our current technological knowledge, one can think of this backstop as CCS which takes carbon directly out of the atmosphere when using fossil fuel and then stores it underground as the most carbon-persistent production processes (such as metallurgical ones or air travel) cannot be decarbonised at current capabilities. We thus make explicit the difference between substitution of less carbon-intensive fuel in the energy mixFootnote 3 and carbon capture and sequestration. This distinction is important as both instruments differ in their long-term effects: renewable energy create a legacy of unused fossil fuel deposits which can become economically lucrative if future policy becomes less ambitious while CCS bear the risk of leakage (Belfiori and Iverson 2018). Like DICE, our benchmark IAM computes cumulative carbon use and does not speak to the issue of stranded carbon assets directly. However, we include an extension where the cost of extracting fossil fuel rises as less reserves are left in situ, which allows the economic analysis of stranded carbon assets too. We also give extensions to allow for research and development in renewable energy production and for CCS becoming more expensive as available CO2 reservoirs are being used up.Footnote 4 We thus present a back-of-the-envelope IAM and derive simple rules for the optimal carbon price and climate policies. Section 2 sets up the model. Section 3 derives our simple rule for the optimal price of carbon and the optimal rates of substituting renewable energies for fossil fuel and of CCS. Section 4 discusses the timing of energy transitions, carbon budgets, and peak warming for different policy regimes arising under the optimal climate policy. Section 5 presents the optimal climate policies for our benchmark calibration. Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 discuss the sensitivity of optimal climate policies to different assumptions regarding the ethical, economic, geophysical and political drivers of climate policies, respectively. In particular, we allow for hyperbolic discounting and positive feedbacks resulting from capacity for absorbing CO2 diminishing as the oceans heat up. Section 10 concludes.",19

The indicator of choice for economic impacts in these models is GDP. Efforts to expand the framework offered by the Nordhaus DICE/RICE models have taken two directions. Some authors have tried to improve the modelling of the biophysics and the economics that underline the model, especially towards the treatment of climate change uncertainties and adaptation (Lontzek et al. 2016; Cai et al. 2015; De Bruin et al. 2009; Oritz et al. 2011). Other contributions aim at going «beyond GDP» and offer a broader view of climate impacts (Pezzey and Burke 2014; Collins et al. 2017). Among such broader measures, the variation of “comprehensive wealth” in a given country (Stiglitz et al. 2009) is gaining prominence. Inclusive Wealth is understood in this context to include all types of capital stocks from which a country derives benefit flows generating well-being. Such stocks include but are not limited to natural capital, produced capital, human capital, and social capital. As discussed in Hanley et al. (2015), a theoretical elaboration of this perspective on wealth was summarized by Dasgupta (2009), based on a number of contributions (Arrow et al. 2012; Dasgupta 2001; Pezzey 2004; Weitzman 1997). Various authors (Fleurbaey 2015) have demonstrated how the rate of change of comprehensive wealth is an indicator of the sustainability of the development path adopted by the considered economy. This rate of change in wealth has been termed “Genuine Savings” (GS). Whilst GS and changes in comprehensive wealth are now reported as country-level indicators of sustainable development (e.g. Greasley et al. 2014), there has been limited use of such indices in the evaluation of climate change policies. To our knowledge, the only exceptions are Stiglitz et al. (2009) and Pezzey and Burke (2014). Our aim in this paper is to further the literature on climate change assessment using (a) GS as a comprehensive measure of impacts and (b) a detailed production structure for the resource use and environmental impacts of the world economy. To this end, we use an integrated assessment model (IAM) based on the RICE model, combining an optimizing central planner with a series of resource balance models and a life cycle perspective on environmental impacts, based on previously-published work (Tokimatsu et al. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). The use of three resource balance models and one simplified climate model allows us to map resource use to an extended production function via 10 sectors representing the economy. Then, inventories reflecting this resource use by the 10 sectors are used as inputs in a lifecycle impact assessment (LCIA) model to generate environmental impacts related to 4 “policy goals” concerning human health, biodiversity preservation, resource use and ecosystem functioning preservation. Lifecycle impact assessment (LCIA) can be described as a framework to capture a wide range of environmental impacts related to the consumption of goods and services «from cradle to grave». Impacts are included at all geographical levels over the whole lifecycle. Our modelling endogenously computes GS under a range of future scenarios based on differences in climate policy, biodiversity preservation, resource conservation and ecosystems management. We are therefore able to (a) compute “current value” GS based on simulated comprehensive investment flows at given future points in time t under a range of future scenarios and (b) offer an assessment of the evolution of GS in the coming decades based on the long run consequences of climate change, demographics and energy and resource needs. Such a model can be used in a policy appraisal context. Policy options could be evaluated in terms of their effects on long-run development prospects via their impact on GS, as both theoretical and empirical work has shown how GS is a forward-looking indicator of changes in future consumption (Greasley et al. 2014; Hanley et al. 2015). Our results are presented with respect to a business-as-usual scenario where the environmental consequences of production do not generate costs for producers. We then internalise those costs as an additional cost on production, before testing various policy-induced constraints on CO2 emissions, biodiversity reduction, resource use patterns and population dynamics. For the policy options considered in this paper, we find GS as estimated by our model to be declining over time. In some scenarios, GS turns negative between 2050 and 2100, showing unsustainability in development. Unsurprisingly, the lower the expected productivity growth, and the faster the expected population growth, the quicker GS turns negative. Under most scenarios, implementing more stringent climate policies will have a positive impact on GS, as the environmental cost weighing on production is alleviated. However, the most stringent policies can also place such a high burden on production that they have a negative impact on GS, as gross and net savings fall faster than the environmental cost. In Sect. 2 we review the literature on climate policy economic impact modelling, and discuss the theoretical underpinnings for GS in this context. In Sect. 3 we present our modelling framework and explain how we derive GS from our detailed natural resources allocation and environmental impact minimization mechanism. In Sect. 4 we present our scenarios and calibration and in Sect. 5 our results and sensitivity analysis. In Sect. 6 we discuss academic and policy consequences and future steps to popularize GS as an indicator of choice for sustainability assessment in a climate change context. Full details on model structure and functioning can be found in a set of appendices at the end of the paper.",9

The standards have played a key role in curbing automotive fuel consumption. Recently, CAFE standards have been radically reformed in terms of stringency and structure. The standards for model years (MYs) 2012–2016 improved the combined fleet average fuel economy of new passenger cars (PCs) and new light-duty trucks (LDTs) to 32.5 miles per gallon (mpg) in MY 2016 (based on estimated sales data), compared to 29.3 mpg in MY 2010. The standards for MYs 2017–2021 are projected to achieve 40.3–41.0 mpg in MY 2021, and the provisional standards for MYs 2022–2025 aim at 48.7–49.7 mpg in MY 2025.Footnote 1 In addition to increased stringency, CAFE standards have also undergone significant structural and design changes. From the 1970s until recently, CAFE standards required an automaker’s average fuel economy in each vehicle category to meet a specified level, which is common to all automakers.Footnote 2 The new CAFE standards have completely reformed this structure. The three most important instruments introduced are footprint-based targeting, intra-firm credit transferring, and inter-firm credit trading. Footprint-based targeting makes an automaker’s standards dependent on the size (footprint, i.e., the area enclosed by the points at which the tires touch the ground) of the vehicles it sells. Roughly speaking, the smaller the average footprint of a manufacturer’s fleet in a category, the better category-average fuel economy it is required to achieve. Relative to the conventional standards that are independent of vehicle size, footprint-based standards aim to discourage automakers from downsizing vehicles to meet CAFE standards: vehicle downsizing is the easiest way to improve fuel economy, but smaller vehicles are considered to involve higher fatality risks in case of traffic accidents. Footprint-based targets may favor automakers who tend to produce large vehicles and thus face less stringent standards under the new approach. The other two instruments intend to provide flexibility in how to meet the standards, and thus reduce the overall compliance costs for automakers. Intra-firm credit transferring allows an automaker to over-comply in a category and earn credits, then use the credits to offset under-compliance in another category. With inter-firm credit trading, an automaker can sell extra credits from over-compliance to other automakers; conversely, one can buy credits from other automakers to offset under-compliance. The three new instruments have structurally changed CAFE standards, and can have various impacts on the vehicle market and gasoline consumption. A number of previous studies use policy simulation to analyze how CAFE standards and other policies affect consumers, producers and gasoline consumption. For example, Goldberg (1998), Kleit (2004), Klier and Linn (2012), Jacobsen (2013) and Whitefoot et al. (2012) examine tightening of CAFE standards. Bento et al. (2009) look at an increase in gasoline taxes. Austin and Dinan (2005) compare the effects of tightening CAFE standards and increasing gasoline taxes. This paper also simulates CAFE standards, but centers around a different aspect than most of the above-mentioned studies. Specifically, I focus on the design of CAFE standards, rather than their stringency, by simulating counterfactual policies that differ in structure, but not in stringency. These counterfactual policies are with or without the three instruments above. Some of the previous studies include analysis on the design of CAFE standards in addition to tightening. Coleman and Harrington (2010) and Whitefoot et al. (2012) look into footprint-based targets and intra-firm credit transferring between categories, but not inter-firm credit trading. Austin and Dinan (2005) simulate inter-firm credit trading, but not footprint-based targets or intra-firm credit transferring.Footnote 3 This paper adds a few distinctive features to the previous studies on the design of CAFE standards. First, I consider all the three new instruments of the reformed CAFE standards, including the case in which they are in effect at once as in the actual reformed standards. Second, I set parameters of counterfactual rules, which determine fuel economy standards for each automaker, in such a way that the market average fuel economy in simulated market equilibrium is essentially the same across all policies. This ensures that different policies are almost at the same level of stringency as measured by market average fuel economy. The difference between any counterfactual policies is less than 0.1% in this paper, while it is in some cases larger than 1% in Coleman and Harrington (2010), for example. As we want to evaluate the effectiveness of different policy instruments in terms of social welfare (automakers’ profits \(+\) consumer surplus − fuel use externalities), it is important that counterfactual policies featuring these instruments are at the same level of stringency. Otherwise, it is unclear whether differences in simulation outcomes are attributable to differences in design or stringency. Third, I make use of a variant of the recent approach developed by Bento et al. (2009) that simultaneously estimates consumers’ vehicle purchase and utilization decisions. This approach can analyze the two connected decisions in a unified framework that is consistent with economic theory. Previous studies on the structure of CAFE standards model vehicle choice decisions only. Because the value of fuel economy to consumers depends on how much the vehicle is driven, incorporating a model of VMT (vehicle miles traveled) demand is important for evaluating policies relating to fuel economy and gasoline consumption. The simulations carried out in the paper provide a number of interesting implications about the three instruments, as compared to the traditional structure that sets identical standards for all automakers, and does not allow intra-firm transferring across categories or inter-firm trading. First, introducing footprint-based targets has only a small impact on market-level outcomes such as consumer surplus and aggregate gasoline consumption. As for the profits of individual automakers, footprint-based targets relatively benefit those firms that tend to sell large vehicles and thus get their standards relaxed, compared to those selling small vehicles. Second, allowing intra-firm credit transferring (but not inter-firm trading) is effective in reducing aggregate gasoline consumption, relative to the traditional structure. This policy induces automakers constrained by CAFE standards to make LDTs more fuel efficient but PCs less efficient, and then transfer credits across the two categories to comply. Because LDTs are typically driven for longer distances than PCs (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2006), this leads to a reduction in aggregate gasoline use (by 0.1–0.3%). Third, introducing inter-firm credit trading lowers the aggregate compliance costs to achieve a given level of market average fuel economy by $110–$140 million in comparison with the traditional structure. Inter-firm trading shifts the role of improving fuel economy at additional production costs to automakers that can do so relatively cheaply. With the compliance cost reduction, inter-firm credit trading increases social welfare: the policy with inter-firm trading gives the highest social welfare among the counterfactual policies considered. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sets used in the study. Section 3 considers the demand side of the new vehicle market, and estimates a model of consumers’ vehicle and VMT choices. Based on the results of Sect. 3, Sect. 4 simulates four counterfactual CAFE policies to evaluate and compare the effects of footprint-based targeting, credit transferring, and credit trading. Section 5 concludes.",4

Dasgupta and Heal (1979: Ch. 3) formulated the situation to be studied as a one-stage symmetric game involving herdsmen grazing their cattle on a piece of communal land. It was shown that if, as is typically the case in village grazing fields in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, access to the common is restricted to a well-defined group of herdsmen, the implicit rent each herdsman earns in a non-cooperative equilibrium is less than what each would have enjoyed had they cooperated. The authors also showed that if the size of the group was to increase indefinitely, each herdsman would introduce a vanishingly small herd, but the total number of cattle in the field would expand to the point where aggregate rent is zero. The distortion created by each herdsman is no doubt small if the group size is large, but the sum of those small distortions is not small. The situation where access to a common is unrestricted was first studied by Gordon (1954). Although he did not offer a formal analysis, the methods deployed by Dasgupta and Heal (1979) can be extended to complete his account. Suppose the number of potential herdsmen is unlimited but entry into the common involves a small fixed cost. The situation can be modelled as a two-stage non-cooperative game: Herdsmen decide whether to enter, following which those who have entered choose the size of their herds. It can be shown that in symmetric sub-game perfect Nash equilibria the number of herdsmen who enter tends to infinity and the aggregate rent from grazing the common tends to zero as the cost of entry becomes vanishingly small. Rent dissipation is a reflection of overgrazing. But there is a further concern, that in time overgrazing could lead to the common’s destruction even if it was in the herdsmen’s collective interest to preserve it over an indefinite future. The situation would be as though each herdsman discounts the output from the commons at a higher rate than he would have, had the group acted collectively. In his famous paper on open-access resources, Hardin (1968) implicitly considered a dynamic setting. The grazing field can then be thought of as a renewable natural resource. If the rate at which cattle consume fodder exceeds the field’s regenerative capacity by a finite margin, it is doomed. Although Hardin (1968) did not offer a formal analysis, he insisted that unrestricted freedom in the commons leads in time to their ruin. And he dubbed the processes unleashed by that freedom, the “tragedy of the commons”.Footnote 1 Identifying Hardin’s processes in situations where agents choose the size of their herds strategically over time has not been found to be easy; which is why the theoretical literature on the fate of commons in dynamic settings remains sparse.Footnote 2 It has been customary to study strategic behaviour among a group of identical agents consuming a common-property renewable natural resource. The payoff to an agent is the discounted sum of net utilities (utility minus harvesting costs) over time. Utility is assumed to be a monotonically increasing, concave function of personal consumption, and harvesting costs are linear and independent of the resource stock.Footnote 3 The optimal rate of resource exploitation when the agents fully cooperate has been characterized by Clark (2010). The idea here, on the other hand, is to determine (symmetric) Markov perfect Nash equilibria of the corresponding non-cooperative game. Computation of equilibria has proved to be hard. Particular forms of the utility function have been assumed so as to obtain clear results concerning the circumstances in which the resource would be exhausted in finite time even when preservation is in the collective interest. Those results identify, conversely, the circumstances in which a common would be preserved indefinitely even if consumers were not to cooperate. To see how far informed intuition can help us to probe the fate of common-property resources, notice that it would be collectively optimal to deplete a renewable natural resource if its growth rate at the point where the stock is vanishingly small (call it r) were less than the rate at which agents discount the future (call it \(\delta \)).Footnote 4 But if it is in the collective interest to deplete a resource, then other things equal non-cooperation among the agents should be expected all the more to lead to its depletion. The theoretically interesting case for study is thus \(r>\delta ;\) which is what we assume throughout this paper. Our aim is to uncover the circumstances in which non-cooperation leads to resource depletion even though it is in the collective interest to preserve it. We also want to identify those circumstances where a resource would be preserved indefinitely even if users were not to cooperate. The economics of common-property resources in a timeless setting tells us that the group’s size (call it N) is a critical factor. Because N is finite, each agent’s consumption has a discernible, negative impact on others’ welfare. The larger is N, however, the smaller is an individual’s impact on others even while aggregate consumption is larger. That suggests the larger is N, the greater is the wedge between the fate of a common under cooperation and non-cooperation, respectively. Assuming that \(r>\delta \), the question arises whether there is a threshold value of r (call it h(N)), such that under non-cooperation a common would be preserved if \(r>h(N)\) but would be ruined if \(r<h(N)\). In their analysis of a complete capital model, Mitra and Sorger (2014) obtained the precise form of h(N) and showed that it is an increasing function of N. The informal picture of an open-access resource that Hardin (1968) drew is however of a common that is teeming with people because of unrestricted entry. It is then tempting to uncover the fate of open-access resources by letting N go to infinity. That is the route Dasgupta and Heal (1979: Ch. 3) took in their timeless model. If N is large, each person’s equilibrium consumption is no doubt small, but the resource to population ratio is also small. In the limit the resource to population ratio is zero, which is an awkward feature of the model.",11

When contemplating the introduction of environmental taxes, governments often consider whether such taxes, besides helping to achieve environmental goals, should also play a larger role in achieving other social and economic targets, such as reduction in unemployment rates. Previous studies, however, found that policies that reduce unemployment rates tend to be costly in terms of other policy objectives as they reduce private incomes, including those of people who are on state benefits.Footnote 1 This makes it politically difficult to implement environmental policies. As a result, to make green tax reforms socially acceptable, economists have argued that complementary policies such as public spending cuts could be used to reduce the environmental tax burden on private sector income (see Koskela and Schob 1999; Bovenberg 1995). This paper evaluates the implications of this argument for unemployment and social welfare for the case of developing countries. The theoretical framework features an economy with three sectors: urban formal, urban informal, and rural agricultural. Following Pissarides (2000), search and matching frictions form the distinction between formal, or “regulated” jobs, and informal, or “unregulated” jobs. Workers in the informal sector search for jobs in the formal sector, and the unemployment rate is defined as the proportion of the labour force that is in informal-sector self-employment. The economy imports both energy and capital at given world prices to use as inputs in registered production activities. I consider three public spending policies: (1) as part of a revenue-neutral policy, (2) fixed, and (3) varying endogenously with GDP. As such, I study how various assumptions about public spending impact the effects of environmental policies on unemployment and social welfare. In this way, I am also able to compare the results with previous studies that have focused on revenue-neutral policies. Environmental policies considered in the paper are in the form of increases in energy tax rates. The model is calibrated to match some key aspects of labor markets in Mexico and is solved numerically. The three main findings of the paper are as follows. First, I find that the income of agricultural workers fall under all policy scenarios, even though they do not pay energy taxes. This is because the higher burden of taxation imposed on the unemployed prompts them to escape the brunt of taxation by searching for a job in the formal sector or by migrating into rural areas. This inflow of labor into the agricultural sector pushes wages down in that sector. This is the key difference to previous studies of the double dividend in the context of developed countries, as it shows the importance of modeling the Harris–Todaro effect (1970) when measuring the incidence of higher energy taxation on poverty within the context of developing countries. Second, I establish that relative to the scenario of revenue-neutral public policy, environmental tax policies with requirements on public spending, such as (2) and (3), are associated with a larger reduction in the unemployment rate and a lower reduction in after-tax private income. Intuitively, since labor taxes have a broad tax base, when public revenues are fixed there is less scope for the reduction of labor taxes under a revenue-neutral policy compared with when public spending is fixed or if the level of revenues can adjust endogenously. If it is also possible to reduce public spending, then the level of required public revenues can decline by more, which creates extra budgetary room for a further reduction in labor taxes, prompting an even larger increase in employment and a lower reduction in formal-sector after-tax income; in fact, the after-tax wage of formal workers increases in this case. Third, I evaluate the welfare implications of two environmental tax reforms under a taxation scheme that gives rise to a double dividend,Footnote 2 and under the assumption of either fixed or varying public spending. Public spending is assumed to affect households’ utility. I find that a given environmental tax policy reduces overall social welfare and the utility of each group of workers in the economy. The equivalent variation of a given energy tax reform is lower when public spending varies endogenously compared to when public spending is fixed, even though the former policy has a smaller negative impact on household incomes. Finally, sensitivity analysis also reveals that even though a double dividend occurs in the model at the expense of private-sector after-tax income, especially of those who are on state benefits, this result depends critically on the expenditure share of energy when formal sector production is modeled with a standard Cobb–Douglas function and a revenue-neutral green tax reform. Intuitively, with a smaller expenditure share of energy, a decline in energy demand due to higher energy taxes reduces costs, or equivalently results in a smaller tax burden. These findings thus provide guidance to economists trying to garner support for the implementation of environmental tax policies in developing countries. The model suggests that policymakers in developing countries hoping to improve the labor market effects of environmental policies through lower public spending will likely be unsuccessful, as public services are important determinants of households’ well-being in those countries. These results should, however, be seen as highlighting this trade-off when implementing complementary policies aimed at improving the labor market effects of green tax reforms, rather than providing conclusive proof of the incompatibility of green tax reforms with development and poverty alleviation policies in less developed countries. The model abstracts from studying alternative ways of reducing the tax burden on labor (which are beyond the scope of the current paper), which could be potentially more acceptable for economic and political reasons. The results also emphasize the importance of modeling the features relevant for developing countries when assessing consequences of environmental tax reforms in those countries. More broadly, the results show that the context in which environmental taxation is introduced and the package of complementary reform measures are extremely important, given developing countries’ emphasis on the equity and distributional aspects of green policies. Developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change and resource depletion, and therefore need to embrace policies that help to stimulate economic growth and to promote environmental sustainability, including environmental fiscal reforms. Specific green growth instruments should be identified and used according to the context. This paper contributes to this policy analysis by studying the implications of environmental fiscal reforms, accompanied with reduction in public spending, for job creation and social welfare. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the search and matching model of an economy with an informal sector and rural–urban migration. Section 3 outlines the parameterization of the model. Section 4 discusses results of the policy experiments. Section 5 evaluates the welfare effects of green tax reforms. Section 6 examines the sensitivity of these results to changes in the values of some parameters and functional form. Section 7 concludes.",7

Yet over the years, the concept has been applied more expansively to account for the fact that environmental regulations establish use or quasi-ownership rights to polluters who are generally qualified for and subject to regulatory review or modification. In this context, “transaction costs” refer to the costs of the regulatory requirements implementing the policy objective (Krutilla and Krause 2010). It is acknowledged that the regulatory design can be used to reduce transaction costs in two ways: choosing the point of obligation that minimizes transaction costs (Krutilla and Krause 2010; McCann 2013) and excluding smaller participants who pay disproportionately large transaction costs in relation to their pollution (Schleich and Betz 2004). For instance, when it comes to the climate change discussion, the general view is that regulating \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions upstream in the fossil fuel chain yields lower transaction costs than regulating polluters downstream since consumption of fuel usually is much easier to monitor than emissions. Furthermore, the number of emitters is larger than the number of firms producing or importing fuel (Crals and Vereeck 2005; Keohane 2009; Metcalf 2009; Mansur 2012). It is also acknowledged that the administrative costs faced by smaller emitters can be disproportionately high compared with the costs for large emitters. One example of this is the Directive of the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which enables small emitters to be excluded from the EU ETS, with the primary aim of reducing the administrative burden on these installations (European Parliament and Council 2009). Nevertheless, the Directive requires that excluded installations are subject to a domestic scheme that will deliver an equivalent contribution to emission reductions as the EU ETS. Despite a growing body of research on the advantages of emissions taxation vis-à-vis emissions trading, and some theoretical studies analyzing the implications of the existence of transaction costs for optimal taxation (e.g., Yitzhaki 1979; Polinsky and Shavell 1982) and emissions trading (e.g., Stavins 1995; Montero 1997), to the best of our knowledge there are no previous studies analyzing empirically whether carbon taxation entails lower transaction costs than emissions trading, mainly due to the absence of case studies where such a comparison is feasible. The present paper contributes to filling this gap by examining the case of Sweden, where a number of polluting firms have been subject to a \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax since 1991 and to the EU ETS since 2005. These policies have overlapped since 2005 implying that a large number of firms have complied with both regulations simultaneously. This provides us with an excellent case study as it allows us to measure transaction costs incurred by firms regulated by these two environmental policies and to disentangle transaction costs of a given policy from other firm-specific variables that might affect the costs themselves. To empirically compare the transaction costs of the \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax and the EU ETS, we combine primary and secondary sources of information. Regarding the primary information, in 2013 we conducted a survey asking a relevant sample of Swedish firms a series of questions regarding the monitoring, reporting, and verification costs incurred as part of complying with the \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax and/or the EU ETS in 2012. Following previous studies, we proxy transaction costs of regulations with the time spent on these activities (internal costs) and the external and capital costs they entail.Footnote 1 The primary information was combined with other firm-level data including data on \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions, employment, and revenue. This combined dataset allows us to develop a comparative analysis of the MRV costs incurred by firms under carbon taxes and tradable emission permits. It also enables us to identify differences across sectors, economies of scale, and the rationality for exclusion of smaller participants. From the perspective of firms, all regulations imply implementation costs, including establishing internal/external administration for monitoring, reporting, and verification, quantifying emissions for the base period, familiarization with allocation rules, software and trading platforms. The focus of our analysis is on transaction costs of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of emissions since these costs are relevant for both our studied instruments and since empirical evidence indicates that these costs, at least in the case of the EU ETS, are the most important costs of compliance, with a share that might exceed 70% of the total transaction costs (see, e.g., Jaraitė et al. 2010; Heindl 2012). Hence, our study does not concern implementation costs as both the \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax and the EU ETS have been in place for many years and trading costs only pertain emissions trading programs. Furthermore, it is worth noticing that our study does not aim to generalize about the transaction costs of taxation and emissions trading per se, since the point of regulation (e.g., upstream vs. downstream regulation) is not held constant between the Swedish \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax and the EU ETS. Rather, our aim is to describe the differences in transaction costs of MRV between two regulatory designs broadly discussed in the context of climate change mitigation. Our results indicate that the MRV costs are lower for \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) taxation than for the EU ETS, which confirms the general view that regulating emissions upstream via a \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax yields lower transaction costs vis-á-vis downstream regulation by means of emissions trading. Additionally, our results indicate that there is a significant degree of heterogeneity in the transaction costs of the firms in our sample. Moreover, for some of the firms, the transaction costs are high, especially when we compare them with the actual price of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions under both policies. This is an interesting finding, especially considering that most studies comparing environmental regulations disregard the role of transaction costs. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly describe the Swedish \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) tax and the EU ETS, as well as the main MRV procedures of these policies. In Sect. 3, we discuss the theoretical aspects of MRV costs. In Sect. 4, we present the primary and secondary data. Section 5 contains our empirical analysis of the data. Finally, Sect .6 synthesizes our findings and concludes the paper.",9

We mainly focus on hydro-meteorological disasters (e.g. floods, storms, droughts) and geophysical disasters (e.g. earthquakes, tsunamis), and the physical and monetary damage caused by these disasters. As documented by Cavallo and Noy (2011), these types of disasters are fairly common events across the globe, and occur with increasing frequency. For example, in the Asia-Pacific region, the most afflicted region, the incidence of natural disasters increased from 11 events per country in the 1970s to 28 events in the 2000s. In Western Europe, events per country and decade increased from 5 to 15 over the same time period. To date, there exists a large and increasing empirical literature investigating the economic impact of natural disasters (e.g. Raddatz 2007; Noy 2009; Loayza et al. 2012; Fomby et al. 2013; Cavallo et al. 2013; Felbermayr and Göschl 2014; Cavallo and Noy 2011 for a survey). One perhaps surprising conclusion suggested by the literature is that disasters do not necessarily decrease output and GDP per capita in the subsequent three to five years after the event. Loayza et al. (2012), for example, find no significant impact on a country’s GDP and industrial output across all disasters. In contrast, when floods are investigated separately, they are found to stimulate GDP while droughts are found to harm GDP in developing countries (but not everywhere). Similarly, Fomby et al. (2013) find a positive effect of floods and a negative effect of droughts but no effect of earthquakes and storms on post-disaster GDP in developing countries. Using counterfactual analysis, Cavallo et al. (2013) find that disasters exert no significant influence on medium-run and long-run output when they control for potential post-disaster outbreak of social conflict. These empirical observations seem puzzling when analyzed within the context of conventional neoclassical growth theory. Once we acknowledge that disasters destroy (potentially severely) the productive potential of an economy, we would expect that they harm subsequent economic performance. It is true that the neoclassical growth model predicts that the growth rate after an exogenous loss of capital stock (or other productive factors) is positive. This phenomenon is known as catch-up growth from below towards the steady state. GDP per capita, however, is predicted to fall short of its pre-disaster level according to conventional growth theory.Footnote 1 In this paper, we show how a simple extension of the neoclassical growth model can be used to reconcile theory with empirical evidence and how the model can be used to motivate the diverse post-shock macroeconomic outcomes found in the disaster literature. The key ingredients are the introduction of variable labor supply and the distinction between productive capital stock and durable goods (like cars, furniture, or household appliances). In line with conventional theory, the model predicts that an exogenous loss of capital stock reduces post-disaster GDP. An exogenous loss of durable goods, in contrast, drives GDP above its pre-shock level. The reason is that individuals, suffering from the implied negative wealth shock, supply more labor. On the other hand, households want to (quickly) rebuild the stock of durable goods. The higher level of durable goods investment during the reconstruction phase also lifts labor demand. Higher employment in conjunction with an undestroyed capital stock implies higher output per capita during the reconstruction phase. Considering simultaneous shocks on both state variables, the model predicts a negative impact on GDP for disasters destroying predominantly productive capital and a positive impact on GDP for disasters destroying predominantly durable goods. No significant effect on GDP is predicted when the effects on firm capital is somewhat smaller compared to that on durable goods. The theory is not only helpful to explain the frequently insignificant impact of disasters on GDP, it can also rationalize those cases for which the literature finds significant GDP effects. Intuitively, we may expect that droughts exert a negative impact on GDP because they leave durable goods mostly intact and destroy predominantly firm capital. This is in particularly the case in largely agrarian societies (where capital stock consists of seeds, livestock etc.). Conversely, we expect that floods are more likely to stimulate GDP because they damage predominantly durable goods like cars, furniture or household appliances. In support of our proposed mechanism, some studies have documented positive employment effects of disasters (Leiter et al. 2009; Ewing et al. 2009). In order to present the mechanics behind the “durable goods–channel” in the cleanest way we first discuss the case of a small open economy with perfect capital mobility. This shuts down the “capital-channel” because the capital stock is pinned down to its steady-state value. In this framework, we generally prove that disasters damaging durable goods lead to higher GDP in the short and long run. We then turn to the case of a closed economy and show that the main mechanics are preserved while another amplifying effect occurs through intertemporal substitution. Households want to reconstruct their destroyed stock of durable goods quickly and increase their durable goods purchases in the aftermath of the disaster. Since international capital markets are no longer available to smooth consumption, resources for this purpose are freed by reducing investments in productive capital and by reducing consumption of nondurable goods. In order to mitigate the drop in consumption, households are motivated to raise their labor supply even further than in the case of a small open economy. Because disasters may not only destroy physical capital and durable goods but also houses, we extend the benchmark model by residential housing. We show that the main mechanisms generating a negative, insignificant, or positive impact of disasters on output are still at work in the extended model. Furthermore, the model offers an additional channel through which a disaster might leave GDP unaffected: if a disaster leaves physical capital intact but destroys durable goods and residential housing, there exists a positive impact on GDP through higher labor supply, and a negative impact on GDP through a lower service flow from housing. When both effects balance each other, GDP is predicted to remain unaffected by a disaster. Our analysis of the individual effects of disasters on firm capital, durable goods, and residential housing shows that GDP can be a very misleading indicator of the economic damage caused by natural disasters. This is most obvious when we compare a disaster that destroys “only” productive capital with another one destroying additionally durable goods (and residential housing). The GDP damage is larger for the first one while the welfare loss is larger for the second one. In order to discuss these outcomes explicitly, we augment the quantitative discussion of our disaster economies by a welfare analysis and show large welfare losses from diasters that leave GDP more or less unaffected. There exists a small theoretical literature assessing the general economic impact of disasters (West and Lenze 1994; Rose and Liao 2005; Henriet et al. 2012). These studies focus mainly on a sectoral decomposition of the impact of disasters and do not try to explain the (potentially non-negative) impact of disasters on aggregate GDP. Crespo Cuaresma et al. (2008) speculate that disasters may exert a positive impact on GDP through creative destruction. The proposed mechanism works through opportunities to update the partially destroyed capital stock. However, scrutinizing the mechanism in a theoretical model, Hallegatte and Dumas (2009) found that it cannot account for a positive response of GDP on disasters. Another strand of related literature discusses how mitigation policies affect the economic consequences of disasters (see e.g. Kellenberg and Mobarak 2008; Hallegatte 2013, and Posch and Trimborn 2013). Ex ante mitigation in response to disaster risk exposure is certainly an important aspect for a proper quantitative assessment of the impact of disasters on GDP. In the context of our model, however, it is important to emphasize that taking ex ante mitigation into account would not change any of our qualitative results. Mitigation would reduce the amount of capital and durable goods that get destroyed by a disaster but it would have no effect on the relation between the type of destroyed assets and GDP growth in the aftermath of the disaster, which is the focus of our study. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present supporting evidence on the association between the type of disaster and its impact on GDP. In Sect. 3 we introduce the general model, in Sect. 4 we discuss the case of a small open economy, and in Sect. 5 we discuss the closed economy case. In Sect. 6, we specify the model numerically and investigate post-disaster adjustment dynamics quantitatively. We provide estimates of the disasters’ impact on GDP and aggregate welfare under varying assumptions about the physical impact of disasters. Throughout the paper we focus on economic or “material” effects and ignore the fact that natural disasters kill people. The welfare estimates should thus be understood as lower bounds of the actual damage caused by natural disasters. In Sect. 7 we extend the model by a residential housing sector. In the main text, we assume that households own their houses. In the “Appendix”, we show robustness of results against an alternative setup in which households rent housing services from firms. Section 8 concludes.",9

The answer to this question requires a clear metric of inter-temporal social welfare, against which alternative investments and policies can be compared. The choice of social welfare function (SWF) determines a social discount rate (SDR), which reflects the rate at which society is willing to make inter-temporal trade-offs of consumption. Discounting the future is an essential step in social cost–benefit analysis (CBA) since it identifies which investments or policies have a rate of return sufficient to raise social welfare. CBA is central to the economic analysis of public interventions, so an important question is therefore: do governments really reflect societal preferences in their choice of the SDR (at least insofar as societal preferences are revealed by private decisions)? The empirical analysis in this paper suggests that the UK government might not. The SDR determines the weight that is placed on future costs and benefits in CBA, summarising how the SWF accounts for well-being in the future. Increasingly these days, public policy has implications for the well-being of successive generations, not just the current one. Climate change mitigation, nuclear energy and the valuation of natural capital are all examples of such policies (Arrow et al. 2013a, b; Gollier 2012; NCC 2017; Fenichel et al. 2016). Whether or not, or how much to invest in intergenerational projects is extremely sensitive to the SDR. For this reason, determining the SDR has been described as “one of the most critical problems in all of economics” (Weitzman 2001). This paper focusses on the way in which social welfare is measured by Her Majesty’s Treasury in the UK, and the SDR that it uses in its guidelines on CBA: the “Green Book: Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government” (HMT 2003). Every department in the UK Government is obliged to follow the guidelines in the Green Book in evaluating public projects, and so it has considerable influence. The SDR that HM Treasury uses is a risk-free Social Rate of Time Preference (SRTP) calibrated according to the Ramsey Rule: \( SRTP = \delta + \eta g \). The SRTP reflects the typical discounted utilitarian inter-temporal SWF in which the instantaneous utilities of a representative agent are discounted at a rate \( \delta \), the elasticity of marginal utility is \( \eta \) and per capita growth rate of consumption is \( g \). Two critical features of the Green Book guidelines on the SDR are analysed in this paper. Our primary focus is on the elasticity of marginal utility, \( \eta \), which is a key determinant of the SDR. \( \eta \) reflects the responsiveness of the representative agent’s marginal utility to changes in consumption, and determines the “wealth effect” (\( \eta g \)) in the SDR. Given the sensitivity of project appraisal to the SDR it is surprising to find that the estimation of \( \eta \) has not received much serious attention. Furthermore, the attention it has received has led to considerable disagreement on the matter, sometimes creating more heat than light (Stern 2007; Dasgupta 2008; Nordhaus 2007). One source of disagreement on this matter concerns the appropriate source of information with which to calibrate the SWF: subjective normative/prescriptive views or positive/descriptive data (Arrow et al. 1996; Dasgupta 2008). The analysis in this paper takes the view, widely held amongst CBA practitioners, that the SWF should reflect the preferences observed in society. Within the Ramsey framework \( \eta \) can be interpreted as reflecting a societal preference for consumption smoothing, inequality aversion or risk aversion. Implicit to the Ramsey approach is that \( \eta \) ought not to depend on the domain (inequality, inter-temporal substitution, substitution between goods, and risk aversion) in which the agent is making decisions. That is, aversion to differences in consumption is the same regardless of whether it occurs between individuals today, across time or across risky scenarios. Using revealed preference methodologies in each of these domains we provide new estimates of the elasticity of marginal utility for the UK. This allows us to empirically test the theoretical proposition of parameter homogeneity across domains.Footnote 1 Although our focus is mainly on revealed preference methodologies this is certainly not to say that we think stated preference approaches are incapable of providing credible estimates of \( \eta \). One important feature of the studies that we present however is the fact that they all use secondary data. The second focus of the paper is on the term structure of the SDR. The Green Book recommends a declining term structure of discount rates for costs and benefits with longer maturities. This guidance is also routinely followed in public policy appraisal.Footnote 2 The precise shape of the term structure depends on the nature of the SWF, but also on the level of persistence in the diffusion of the growth of consumption. The current Green Book term structure is not based on a thorough empirical analysis of the time series properties of UK growth (see Groom and Hepburn 2017). In order to provide a more robust basis for the guidelines on long-term CBA, we estimate an empirical term structure of discount rates for the UK, by estimating the growth diffusion process in the UK and calibrating using our estimates of \( \eta \). The results of our analysis provide grounds for believing that the Green Book guidelines might need to be updated on two counts. First, a meta-analysis of the four new estimates of \( \eta \) plus another recently-provided estimate indicates that they are not significantly different from each other, yet significantly different from unity. That is, the hypothesis that \( \eta = 1 \), the value used to calibrate the SWF and SDR in the Green Book, is rejected. In short, HM Treasury is not valuing social welfare in accordance with the preferences revealed by UK citizens, no matter in which domain these preferences are revealed. Second, neither does the Green Book term structure of the SDR reflect societal preferences for the distant future, given how growth is expected to diffuse. The estimated impact of persistence on the term structure of SDRs does not provide justification for the current SDR being as low as 1% for horizons of 300 years. The term structure should decline to around 2.5–3% at most. The analysis in this paper is timely since in March 2018 HM Treasury published its conclusions following what was colloquially referred to as the “refresh” of the Green Book guidelines. Our results suggest that the way in which HM Treasury evaluates social welfare in both the short- and the long-run should probably also be refreshed. Yet the influence of this recommendation goes further than this. It has recently been recommended that discounting procedures used by the Office for National Statistics in the calculation of the UK National Accounts should be harmonised with the Green Book.Footnote 3 Our recommendations could influence the estimation of the National Accounts, including those for human and natural capital.Footnote 4 Further afield, the US National Academy of Sciences recently released guidance on the estimation of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) (NAS 2017). Its lengthy chapter on social discounting concludes that Ramsey discounting is a desirable approach to the evaluation of the SCC, and emphasises the need for robust methodologies for the estimation of its parameters. Recent debate suggests that revealed preference estimates of such parameters are more acceptable in the US (Drupp et al. 2018). So the methods and procedures we use might provide guidance for future work in the US and elsewhere.Footnote 5 Finally, while our focus has been on the importance of estimating the elasticity of marginal utility for CBA, the results of this paper are also relevant to the evaluation of non-marginal interventions, such as Integrated Assessment Modelling of climate change mitigation and macro-economic policy simulations. Such analyses require a direct calibration of a social welfare function.Footnote 6 Our results therefore provide a revealed preference benchmark for a broader range of policy evaluations, beyond the confines of CBA. The paper proceeds as follows. We first provide some background on social discounting and the Ramsey Rule. We then utilize five revealed preference methodologies to estimate η: the equal-sacrifice approach, the Euler-equation approach, the Frisch additive-preferences approach, an approach based on insurance and the subjective-wellbeing approach.Footnote 7 We estimate the first four of these methodologies improving on previous empirical work in several important ways. First, for the equal-sacrifice income tax approach we obtain a representative estimate of η by appropriately weighting by the number of income tax payers in each tax bracket. Second, we analyse unique historical data on income tax schedules stretching back to 1948 and address a number of technical issues thrown up by earlier research. Third, we estimate the Euler equation using data from 1970 to 2011 checking carefully for the existence of parameter stability and endogeneity. Fourth, in undertaking the Frisch additive-preferences approach, we test the underlying assumption of additive preferences, something ignored by previous research. A meta-analysis of the estimates is then undertaken to obtain a single ‘best’ estimate and test our hypotheses concerning the homogeneity and value of η. Finally, we estimate a growth diffusion process for the UK and calibrate the term structure of the SDR using our estimate of η. Taken together, our empirical evidence shows that HM Treasury’s calibration of social welfare arguably does not adequately represent society’s revealed preferences for the short- and the long-run.",32

Cason,Frans P. de Vries,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Emissions trading schemes are increasingly being employed across the globe as a prominent market-based environmental policy instrument to curtail emissions cost-effectively. Competitive emissions trading programs can equalize marginal abatement costs (MAC) across firms so that the abatement target is reached efficiently. Alongside this general static efficiency result, however, is sparse evidence concerning the incentives that tradable permit markets create for investment in the development of advanced abatement technology. Our study aims to fill this gap by providing experimental evidence on such investment behaviour, providing some initial empirical insight into the dynamic efficiency performance of tradable permit markets. Technological innovation is important for pursuing sustainability in many pollution control problems. Following Kneese and Schultze (1975), who stressed the importance of understanding the long run impacts of policy on developing and adopting environmentally benign technologies, a considerable theoretical literature has emerged trying to rank different policy instruments, especially with respect to the incentives for technology adoption and diffusion (see, e.g., Requate 2005). Only a very limited number of papers have examined the inducement effects of policy on investment in research and development (R&D). Montero (2002) theoretically analyses how grandfathered and auctioned permits (alongside standards) induce firms to invest in environmental R&D. Assuming homogeneous firms, Montero finds that grandfathering and auctioning generate equal R&D incentives when both permit and output markets are competitive. This contrasts with Cramton and Kerr (2002) who argue that emissions trading schemes where permits are auctioned would feature a stronger dynamic efficiency performance compared to markets where permits are allocated based on grandfathering. Their argument follows from the existence of two effects: an abatement cost effect and an emissions payment effect (Fischer et al. 2003). The former effect refers to the lower MAC from innovation; the latter effect reflects the downward pressure of innovation on the equilibrium permit price, hence reducing scarcity rents. The emissions payment effect implies that the benefit from innovation due to innovators’ (successful) investment spills over to non-innovating firms. Under auctioning, this benefit translates into a lower price that non-innovators pay for permits to cover their emissions. The emissions payment effect is non-existent under grandfathering, because in the aggregate the gains and losses to net buyers and sellers cancel out. Therefore, a permit system based on auctioning would provide stronger innovation incentives given the absence of scarcity rents to innovating firms.Footnote 1 The allocation mechanism is a key issue in view of design, implementation and potential (dynamic) efficiency of many different types of markets, ranging from rights-based fisheries management (Anderson et al. 2011) to emissions trading (Lyon 1982; Goeree et al. 2010; Grimm and Ilieva 2013). For instance, the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is currently transitioning from mostly grandfathered to mostly auctioned permits. Botelho et al. (2011) study the EU ETS market institution in the laboratory by comparing the performance under a full auctioning and full grandfathering rule, and they provide experimental evidence showing that total abatement costs are similar under both allocation mechanisms. This finding confirms the standard static efficiency result mentioned above. Moreover, their study also shows that auctioning can allocate permits more accurately across sources. This allows sources to reach the minimum abatement cost solution more effectively because less post-allocation permit trade between sources is required. The way that permits are allocated across sources may also affect the incentives to invest in R&D. A novel feature of our emissions trading experiment is the introduction of R&D investment to lower MAC. Given the lack of detail in investment data from existing field markets (such as the EU ETS), our study can be helpful in assessing the implications from changing the allocation rules on R&D investment behaviour. It can also more cleanly identify causality, which is challenging in the field due to endogenous policy choices. To investigate this issue experimentally, our study exogenously varies the permit allocation mechanism as the main treatment variable. However, since investment directed at advancing pollution abatement technology is typically associated with uncertainty (e.g., Weber and Neuhoff 2010), the novelty of our study involves the inclusion of a stochastic impact of R&D investment on the MAC reduction. Alongside innovators’ assessment of future market conditions, it is the inherent uncertainty associated with R&D investment that seems to have played an important role in the decline—and perhaps under-investment—in inventive activity under two flagship cap-and-trade schemes in the United States: the SO2 emissions trading market and the NOx budget program (Taylor 2012). Our experimental permit market thus enables us to identify specifically the causal impact of the permit allocation mechanism on dynamic efficiency when the cost-reducing effects of R&D are non-deterministic, albeit in a stylized but carefully controlled laboratory environment. Cost uncertainty and the aforementioned emissions payment effect gives rise to stochastic permit prices. In a real options model, Zhao (2003) theoretically addresses this interdependency under a tradable permit system with grandfathering as well as emission charges and finds that abatement cost uncertainties reduce the investment incentives of firms. In a laboratory setting, Ben-David et al. (1999) study the functioning of a tradable permit market by varying the degree of cost heterogeneity regarding abatement technology. Their study shows that increased cost heterogeneity does not have a significant impact on trade volume, although they do find some evidence of reduced trading volume from higher price variability. Overall they find that market efficiency is inversely related to abatement cost heterogeneity. In a follow-up study, Ben-David et al. (2000) explore in an experimental tradable permit market (under grandfathering) the impact of uncertainty on permit prices, trading volume and abatement levels assuming irreversible investment in abatement technology. Alongside uncertainty regarding the timing of a reduced permit allocation, they include treatments that vary the size of the increased stringency through a tighter emissions cap. They observe no impact of these uncertainties on trade volumes and permit prices. Ben-David et al. (2000) argue that the irreversible nature of investment in abatement technology may be one of the reasons that permit buyers may delay their decisions to invest and abate less until they obtain more knowledge about the uncertainty in future periods. Our experiment extends their study by introducing uncertainty about the cost-reducing impact from innovation through R&D investment decisions. Moreover, the earlier research implements a random but exogenous permit price, hence ignoring the aforementioned emissions payment effect from innovation. By contrast, in our experimental market the permit price is endogenously determined through market trading and it depends on the R&D investment decisions made by all firms. Closer to our study, Camacho-Cuena et al. (2011) compare the adoption incentives of advanced abatement technology in an emissions trading experiment under permit auctioning and grandfathering. Their results reveal the absence of an adoption differential and show that both auctioning and grandfathering are equivalent for static and dynamic efficiency. More recently, Taschini et al. (2014) explore the timing of (irreversible) adoption decisions of abatement technology in the laboratory under a grandfathering allocation rule only. The authors build in abatement cost uncertainty by assuming that emissions are stochastic. In such a setting, Taschini et al. find that firms tend to invest in the adoption of abatement technology faster when a strict enforcement mechanism is in place that penalizes firms when facing emissions in excess of permit holdings. Suter et al. (2013) also focus on adoption of existing technology, but in a context of water quality trading markets featuring a limited number of firms, and they show that traders tend to over-invest in technology that requires (large) capital investments. This over-investment holds especially for those traders who experience more restricted abatement opportunities due to their use of high-cost abatement technology. Over-investment is also found in Gangadharan et al. (2013), who examine the role of banking in conjunction with opportunities to invest in abatement technology and uncertainty about the future permit allocation. In a tradable permit market experiment based on a grandfathering allocation rule, one of their key findings is that in situations where both banking and investment is allowed, the degree of over-banking is reduced relative to a treatment with only the option to bank. Our paper extends the above research by concentrating on the interaction between the permit allocation mechanism and the R&D investment decisions by explicitly acknowledging the stochastic nature of R&D investment rather than stochastic emissions as in Taschini et al. (2014). In our experimental analysis we compare the economic gains from actual investment levels to the gains from R&D choices that lower abatement costs efficiently by optimally trading off marginal investment costs and marginal impacts on abatement and permit prices. Like Suter et al. (2013) and Gangadharan et al. (2013), traders over-invest in new technology, and this occurs in both allocation mechanism treatments. Contrary to the study of Camacho-Cuena et al. (2011) on technology adoption, in our experimental permit market with stochastic R&D we find that auctioning results in significantly greater R&D investment compared to grandfathering. This outcome could be driven by the fact that our permit markets are not strictly perfectly competitive, as permit prices and transaction volumes sometimes deviate from competitive equilibrium levels, as well as misperceptions about opportunity costs compared to explicit costs. More precisely, under auctioning every single trader is a permit buyer and benefits from lower abatement costs and lower permit prices driven through successful R&D investment, i.e., the strategic effect is positive for each trader. In contrast, under grandfathering traders who are permit sellers suffer from a lower permit price when R&D investment is successful, i.e., the strategic effect is negative for permit sellers and positive for permit buyers. Sellers should recognize that the lower permit prices reduce their opportunity costs of compliance, just as these lower prices reduce the buyers’ explicit compliance cost. Existing experimental evidence indicates, however, that people treat realized gains and losses differently from opportunity costs (Lind and Plott 1991) and they must learn to react properly towards opportunity costs (Wråke et al. 2010). The symmetry in the trader pool composition leads to stronger overall R&D investment incentives with auctioning—relative to grandfathering—in a strategic market environment. This finding is in line with one of the theoretical results obtained by Montero (2002), suggesting that when both the permit and output market are imperfectly competitive, auctioning provides more R&D incentives than grandfathered permits. However, as our theoretical model does not include an output market, our experimental evidence is accordingly obtained without any consideration of output market effects.",6

Two particular areas of PES improvement that have been extensively considered are the enhancement of their cost-effectiveness and their conservation efficacy. Mechanisms for awarding PES contracts via spatially coordinated auctions have recently been explored as a promising design feature that could improve both the cost of delivery and environmental benefits of PES (de Vries and Hanley 2016; Hanley et al. 2012). PES auctions are reverse or procurement auctions which competitively allocate contracts to deliver ecosystem services (ES), favouring bidders who offer to supply these services at a lower price. This scheme is usually believed to be able to deliver cost savings by mitigating ‘information rents’, namely the potential extra profits to ES suppliers arising from their private information about their own opportunity costs of ES provision (Arguedas and van Soest 2011; Ferraro 2008). A prime example of PES auctions is the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) (Stubbs 2014), along with multiple state-level conservation auctions in Australia (Whitten et al. 2013). Further, considerable scientific evidence has emerged showing the enhanced ecological benefits of contiguous—as opposed to dispersed or isolated—conservation (Margules and Pressey 2000; Williams et al. 2012). In order to incentivise contiguous conservation, some PES programmes pay ES suppliers an extra so called ‘agglomeration bonus’ (in addition to the basic PES payments) to set aside adjacent lands (Parkhurst et al. 2002). Practical applications of this PES design include the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) in Oregon and a Swiss agri-environmental programme that provides a network bonus.Footnote 1 Whereas the conservation auction mechanism is relatively familiar to PES policy makers, the agglomeration bonus is more novel and largely in the test-bed stage. In the work of Parkhurst and Shogren (2007, 2008), the agglomeration bonus was found to be able to induce contiguous conservation in laboratory settings. Subsequent experimental studies further explored the performance of this innovative instrument under different conditions of communication among subjects (Warziniack et al. 2007), different group sizes (Banerjee et al. 2012) with different information flows (Banerjee 2018; Banerjee et al. 2014), and under varying transactions costs (Banerjee et al. 2017; Ferré et al. 2016). Other laboratory studies investigated the agglomeration bonus in auction settings. But those studies mostly concerned the effects of other auction rules, rather than the pure treatment effects of agglomeration bonuses per se (in auction settings). For instance, Reeson et al. (2011) explored two auction rules intended to overcome efficiency loss over multiple bidding rounds (whether winners in previous rounds are allowed to modify their bids in later rounds and whether the end-point is known to bidders). Banerjee et al. (2015) tested whether rent-seeking behaviour would be encouraged if the priority to conserve adjacent lands is revealed to bidders. In the study of Krawczyk et al. (2016), spatial coordination in conservation auctions is produced by varying the metric by which bids are judged, to increase the chances of bids from neighbours being successful. The study of Fooks et al. (2016) represents a rare example that assessed the pure treatment effects of agglomeration bonuses in conservation auctions. Most of the empirical evidence to date on the agglomeration bonus comes from laboratory settings using student subjects.Footnote 2 However, much less is known about the performance of this PES design aspect within the relevant population of interest (Cason and Wu 2017). This would require undertaking experimental methods in the field using actual professional land holders. Beyond the scientific usefulness of exploring PES design aspects in the field, there is perhaps an even more compelling policy reason for doing so: policy makers often find recommendations based on student samples to be unconvincing and even irrelevant (List 2011; Lusk and Shogren 2007), despite increasingly reported similarities in results given by student subjects and field professionals (Fréchette 2016; Suter and Vossler 2014). It is, thus, imperative that researchers move their ex ante policy evaluations into the field so that they can better communicate to policy makers the usefulness of instruments such as PES. This is even more compelling in countries (such as China) where the usefulness of experimental methods in designing policies is still lagging behind. Our study aimed to address this need by undertaking perhaps the first such framed field experiment with actual ES suppliers in which we tested the performance of the agglomeration bonus in a simulated forest-based PES auction. Subjects were recruited from peasant farmers in rural areas of China who typically held small forest plots. These forest lands were often officially owned by village collectives, but the use rights have been largely allocated to individual peasant households using fixed-term contracts. These peasants, thus, hold ‘quasi-private’ forest rights and could become ES suppliers in a forest-based PES programme. Many of them indeed had experience of participating in land-based PES programmes. By moving the experimental auction from lab to the field, this study attempts to enhance our understanding of the reaction of actual ES suppliers to agglomeration bonuses in an auction setting. Our investigation into the spatially coordinated PES auction is especially pertinent to PES policy-making in rural China. Triggered by catastrophic floods in the late 1990s, several influential land-based PES schemes have been rapidly unfolding, such as the Sloping Land Conversion Programme (SLCP) and the Ecological Public-Benefit Compensation Programme (EPBFCP).Footnote 3 The designers of these schemes have aspired to enrol more contiguous plots in pursuit of both enhanced ecological benefits and savings in administrative costs that this offers. However, the progress of this agenda has been hindered due to lack of effective policy instruments. The government’s previous efforts to promote contiguous enrolment in these PES-akin programmes relied heavily on command-and-control policies, which may have diminished the degree of voluntary participation of Chinese ES suppliers in these PES schemes, undermining their effectiveness. PES programmes in China have usually targeted remote rural areas where education levels and experience with complex market interactions are limited. Faced with a complex PES mechanism, individuals might have difficulties understanding the incentive mechanisms and hence make economically sub-optimal decisions. If so, the added value of these innovative PES features could be brought into question. This study thus provides one of the first attempts to provide an ex ante experimental investigation of the viability and performance of the agglomeration bonus in PES auctions in the context of rural China, in the sense that we draw lessons about the ability of land managers to understand and respond to the complex incentive mechanisms. To achieve this, we first seek to directly discern misperceptions and anomalous bidding patterns by closely scrutinizing the subjects’ bids and their responses to a quiz exercise and debriefing questions regarding the auction rules and the rationales behind their bids. Further, we attempt to assess whether our experimental PES auctions that provide agglomeration bonuses are able to deliver the theoretically predicted effects. In developing the study, the authors collaborated with government agencies (primarily with the State Forestry Administration of China). Our intention was to exemplify to Chinese policy makers the usefulness of experimental methods as a tool to inform policy design. Our results (derived from actual forest land owners) would serve as a ‘proof of concept’ for the potential use of the agglomeration bonus beyond the laboratory setting. So, in sum the contributions of this paper do not only speak to the applied experimental literature (via our findings from exploring the agglomeration bonus in a more realistic field setting), but also speak to the broader policy literature on the development of PES. We add to the academic voices that have argued that in order for these markets to be developed, it is imperative that we produce a critical mass of such ‘evidence based’ studies (Ferraro and Pattanayak 2006; Baylis et al 2015). Lastly, the policy significance of the study is further heightened by the fact that it takes place in China which is potentially the world’s largest ecosystem service market (for carbon, water and forest related services). Hence, understanding how more complex design rules for PES can work in this region is of particular significance for the wider development and proliferation of such market based instruments in developing and transition economies. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical model which describes the optimal bidding strategies in a PES auction, and how these strategies are adapted in response to the introduction of the agglomeration bonus. These theoretical predictions give rise to several testable hypotheses which were examined by a framed field experiment as specified in Sect. 3. Section 4 reports the data, analytical methods and empirical results. The paper concludes in Sect. 5 with a discussion of the key findings of the study as well as the implications for PES policy making in rural China.",18

Aggregate global emissions cause climate change, and therefore emissions in one country do not just cause a negative externality in that country but also in every other country. At the same time, the damage experienced from climate change may be much more significant in some countries compared to others. Governments can implement an emissions tax to make individuals internalise the economic cost of their consumption causing emissions. Such a tax may reduce emissions to the degree that it maximises the welfare of that country, taking as given the emissions in other countries and the resulting damage for that country, but ignoring the effect of the country’s emissions on other countries. While this corrects for individuals’ free-riding behaviour within a given country, it is now governments that are free-riding by ignoring the effect the country’s emissions have on other countries. And if every country acts that way, such a non-cooperative equilibrium will lead to higher emissions and lower welfare compared to the global cooperative solution where global aggregate welfare is maximised and global damage is fully internalised. For example, Ploeg and Zeeuw (1992) demonstrate this outcome by modelling the Pigovian taxes for a global externality when each country sets their own tax in a non-cooperative way and compare it to the global cooperative solution.Footnote 1 Furthermore, Aronsson and Löfgren (2001) develop a dynamic two-country model of a global externality and evaluate the non-cooperative and cooperative equilibria with regard to valuation problems implicit in environmental accounting. While we know that in the absence of a global regulator countries have no incentive to cooperate, there are a number of approaches that aim to show how the cooperative global optimum might be achieved nevertheless. For example, Barrett (1990) explores how cooperative agreements might arise in case of global externalities. He first shows that the biggest discrepancies between the cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria arise for global externalities that carry significant damage but are costly to reduce (such as climate change), and also for low damage externalities that can be reduced at relatively low cost. He further summaries a number of approaches that might lead to a cooperative equilibrium, among which is the aspect of morality where governments may be guided by some moral concerns rather than just maximising their countries’ welfare. Similarly, Barrett (1994) looks at self-enforcing international agreements, which may either be modelled as members maximising the collective net-benefits or as an infinitely repeated game. He shows that neither approach can sustain full cooperative behaviour when the differences between the net benefits of the global cooperative solution and the non-cooperative solution are large. When looking at international cooperation in climate change policy, it is sometimes thought that if one country leads with climate mitigation measures, others will follow. Game theory dictates that leadership in climate action is generally not successful and will actually lead to a reduction in other countries’ efforts. However, Buchholz and Sandler (2017) show that this may be overcome when elements of behavioural models are incorporated, for example when the follower country has non-selfish preferences or the leader’s actions have an influence on the follower’s belief about the leader’s behaviour. Furthermore, while emission permit based mechanisms, such as used in the Kyoto protocol, are deemed to be of limited potential to establish sufficient international cooperation, there are other proposals, for example the price influencing climate protection scheme put forward by Nordhaus (2006).Footnote 2
Altemeyer-Bartscher et al. (2010) further develop this approach by proposing a scheme that includes side-payments. The literature also points to the importance of measuring and considering the ancillary benefits of climate protection because regional secondary benefits of climate protection efforts may overcome free-riding behaviour (e.g. Markandya and Rübbelke 2004), and in particular in conjunction with side-payments or tax transfers (e.g. Altemeyer-Bartscher et al. 2011; Markandya and Rübbelke 2012; Altemeyer-Bartscher et al. 2014).Footnote 3 Other contributions in the area of global externalities and taxationFootnote 4 evaluate the effects of labour mobility (e.g. Aronsson and Blomquist 2003; Bierbrauer et al. 2013),Footnote 5 non-competitive markets (e.g. Tahvonen 1995), Veblen effects (e.g. Aronsson and Johansson-Stenman 2014, 2015),Footnote 6 and the existence of abatement activities that only mitigate local pollution in addition to those that mitigate global pollution (e.g. Pittel and Rübbelke 2017). The potential for free-riding at the government level is of course a result of free-riding at the individual level. This paper aims to combine the issues of free-riding at the individual level and at the country level with the concept that individuals may exhibit altruistic concern for others, in their own country and in other countries. Altruism in the form where an individual’s utility is to some degree a function of others’ utility, but not a specific component of it, is generally referred to as Pure Altruism.Footnote 7 Applications of this type of altruism are often used in smaller environments such as the family where one might care about the welfare of specific individuals (for example Becker 1974, 1981). In large-scale contexts it can also be assumed that an individual cares for the total or average welfare of all other individuals in the population (e.g. Johansson 1997; Daube and Ulph 2016). The model developed in this paper is closely linked to the model setup used in Daube and Ulph (2016) and extends their static model of Pure Altruism to a setting of multiple countries. Their model demonstrates that as long as individuals continue to believe that total emissions are unaffected by their consumption choice, then no matter how much they care about the welfare of others, their behaviour will not change.Footnote 8 Furthermore, it shows in a single country context that the optimal tax is still the standard Pigovian tax equal to social marginal damage. Daube and Ulph (2016) start with a model of Pure Altruism, but its main contribution from there is the development of an alternative theory of behaviour where individuals do not necessarily act in a utility-maximising way, but may base their consumption decision on a hypothetical moral benefit determined by asking what would be optimal if they and everybody else were to make the same choice.Footnote 9 The model in this paper will first be developed under standard theory with self-interested individuals only, and then add individuals’ altruistic concern for the utility of others. Individuals in any given country may exhibit a different level of altruistic concern for the total utility in their own country compared to the concern for total utility in other countries. Indeed, individuals can have different levels of altruistic concern for every country. Intuitively, it is plausible to assume that an individual may care more for the well-being of the people in their own country, or people closer to the individual, compared to individuals who may live half way around the world. The analysis starts from individual behaviour but focusses mostly on socially optimal levels of consumption under the non-cooperative solution where governments individually aim to maximise their country’s welfare, and compares it to the cooperative solution where global welfare is maximised. This paper makes no efforts to show how such a global equilibrium may be achieved but simply compares the consumption levels under those different equilibria. The main results are: Individuals’ altruistic concern for the welfare of others (Pure Altruism) will alter the non-cooperative equilibrium resulting from domestic social planners and lead countries to internalise some, but not all, of the damage caused by emissions in their country, depending on the level of altruistic concern relative to the concern for themselves and others in their country. However, altruistic concern will also alter the welfare-maximising global optimum, requiring a lower level of emissions as individuals effectively experience damage from the externality through the direct effect of their country’s damage function on personal welfare, and the effect of altruistic concern and thus the damage individuals in other countries experience from the externality. Since socially optimal consumption in the global optimum then depends on the relative levels of altruistic concern, the degree to which damage is internalised in each country will now differ across countries and thus there is no single global tax rate to achieve the optimum, contrary to the case of standard theory. In a non-cooperative equilibrium of two countries a population increase in one country may either increase or decrease equilibrium consumption in another country, depending on the relative size of the countries (with and without altruism). The paper will proceed as follows. Section 2 describes the basic model setup. Section 3 will then develop the general model and evaluate the results under standard theory. This serves as counterfactual to the analysis with Pure Altruism in Sect. 4. Section 5 will then look at comparative statics analysis with respect to population sizes, before Sect. 6 provides some concluding remarks and presents ideas for potential further research.",2

Two strands of literature can be distinguished. The first strand of literature studies uncertainty and IEA formation with the focus on the role of learning, but under the assumption of risk neutrality. Ulph and Ulph (1996) and Ulph and Maddison (1997) compare the fully cooperative and the non-cooperative scenarios when countries face uncertainty about damage costs. They show that the value of learning about damage costs may be negative when countries act non-cooperatively and damage costs are correlated across countries. Na and Shin (1998), Ulph (2004), Kolstad (2007), Kolstad and Ulph (2008, 2011) have considered how the prospect of future resolution of uncertainty affects the incentives for countries to join an IEA. Kolstad and Ulph consider a model where countries face common uncertainty about the level of environmental damage costs.Footnote 3 Three scenarios of learning are considered: with Full Learning, uncertainty about damage costs is resolved before countries decide whether to join an IEA; with Partial Learning, uncertainty is resolved after countries decide whether to join an IEA, but before they choose their emissions levels; with No Learning, uncertainty is neither resolved before stage 1 nor stage 2. They showed that the prospect of learning, either full or partial, generally reduces the expected aggregate payoff in stable IEAs. In particular, Kolstad and Ulph (2008, 2011) showed that Partial Learning would yield the highest aggregate payoff for only a small proportion of parameter values. For a significant majority of parameter values, the highest expected aggregate payoff arose under No Learning. Hence, it is better to form an IEA before waiting for better information: removing the “veil of uncertainty” seems to be detrimental to the success of international environmental cooperation. All these models have assumed that countries are risk neutral. However, in the climate context, risks are highly correlated and hence possibilities for risk sharing are limited so that the assumption of risk aversion may be quite relevant. Therefore, we extend the two-stage coalition formation setting by Kolstad and Ulph (2008) by departing from the assumption of risk neutrality. In this paper, we allow for countries to be risk averse, and show that if countries have a relatively high degree of risk aversion, then for a majority of parameter values Full Learning yields higher expected aggregate utility than No Learning. This may help to explain why it has taken such a long time between the start of the process of tackling climate change (the Kyoto Protocol) to reach a more substantial agreement in Paris—countries are risk averse and so needed to wait until they had more information about the risk of climate change before committing to significant action to tackle climate change. The second strand of literature studies uncertainty and IEA formation with the focus on the role of risk aversion, though under the assumption of No Learning. Endres and Ohl (2003) show in a simple two-player prisoners’ dilemma, using the mean-standard deviation approach to capture risk aversion, that risk aversion can increase the prospects of cooperation once it reaches a certain threshold. The reason is that the benefits of mutual cooperation increase relative to the payoffs of unilateral cooperation and no cooperation because cooperation reduces the variance of payoffs. The more risk averse players are, the more attractive cooperation becomes compared to free-riding. In their model, there is a first threshold above which the prisoners’ dilemma turns into a chicken game and a second threshold above which the game turns into an assurance game. Compared to their paper, we allow for an arbitrary number of players, model cooperation as a two-stage coalition formation game and consider explicitly the role of learning. Bramoullé and Treich (2009) consider risk-averse players in a global emission model, in which all players behave non-cooperatively as singletons. They show that equilibrium emissions are lower under uncertainty than under certainty, as part of a hedging strategy, but the effect on global welfare is ambiguous. The authors also find that emissions decrease with the level of risk aversion. Unlike our paper, Bramoullé and Treich are not concerned with learning and coalition formation. Boucher and Bramoullé (2010) consider the effects of risk aversion on coalition formation, but only with No Learning. They analyze the formation of an international environmental treaty using a similar coalition game and payoff function as adopted in this paper. Using an expected utility approach, their analysis focuses on the effect of uncertainty and risk aversion on signatories’ efforts, the participation level in an agreement and expected aggregate utility. They show that if additional abatement reduces the variance of countries’ payoffs, then, under risk aversion, an increase in uncertainty tends to increase abatement levels and may decrease equilibrium IEA membership while the reverse is true if additional abatement increases the variance of countries’ payoffs.Footnote 4 In this paper, our model of No Learning satisfies the first condition, but we extend the analysis of Boucher and Bramoullé (2010) by considering also Partial Learning and Full Learning. Thus, taken together, in our paper, we generalize the analysis of Kolstad and Ulph (2008) by allowing for risk aversion, and the analysis of Boucher and Bramoullé (2010) and Endres and Ohl (2003) by considering the role of learning. The key findings are that as countries become more risk averse it is no longer the case that for most parameter values the scenario of No Learning yields the highest expected aggregate utility, but increasingly it is the scenario Full Learning. Moreover, the set of parameter values for which the scenario Partial Learning yields the highest expected aggregate utility, which is a small subset of such values when countries are risk neutral, becomes slightly larger as countries become more risk averse. Thus, we qualify the negative conclusion about the role of learning in a strategic context if players are sufficiently risk averse. As in Kolstad and Ulph (2008), our model consists of a two-stage game of IEA formation. The damage cost from global emissions is uncertain and three learning scenarios are considered. Risk aversion is incorporated into the model, through risk preferences and the expected utility framework. In our model, emissions last for just one period, which may seem restrictive in the context of dynamic environmental problems such as climate change. However, it has been shown in the literature on IEA formation under uncertainty that one period models produce similar results to multi-period models. For instance, Kolstad and Ulph (2008), using a one-period model, and Ulph (2004), using a two-period model, found similar results regarding the implications of different scenarios of learning for the size of an IEA and expected welfare.Footnote 5 Taken together, the tension we seek to capture in our modeling is between No Learning, where countries decide to join an IEA and base their decisions for ever on expected damage costs ignoring any later information, Full Learning where countries delay making any decision to join an agreement until (almost) all uncertainty about damage costs has been resolved, or Partial Learning where countries start the process of joining an IEA knowing that as they get better information they will be able to use that to adjust their emissions policies. This would seem to be particularly relevant to the kind of situation to which Weitzman (2009) has drawn attention—a small probability of catastrophic climate change—but also generally, given the continuous updates in recent years about expected damages from climate change. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we set out the theoretical model and present our general results in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents some additional results based on simulations, while Sect. 5 summarizes our main conclusions and implications for future research.",3

Inattentive Respondents in Discrete Choice Experiments,August 2019,Erlend Dancke Sandorf,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The purpose of many stated preference surveys is to derive willingness-to-pay or welfare measures to use in cost benefit analysis. Over the past two decades, stated preference practitioners have increasingly relied on internet panels to administer surveys and gather data (see Lindhjem and Navrud 2011b, for an overview). Respondents in such surveys are required to exert considerable effort to provide thoughtful and accurate answers to truthfully reveal their preferences. This has led several researchers to voice concerns regarding respondent and response quality in such panels (see e.g. Börger 2016; Börjesson and Fosgerau 2015; Gao et al. 2016b; Hess et al. 2013; Lindhjem and Navrud 2011a; Windle and Rolfe 2011; Baker et al. 2010; Heerwegh and Loosveldt 2008). These concerns range from speeding behavior and inattentiveness to respondents trying to qualify for panel membership or survey participation by acting dishonestly (fraudulently). These “low-quality” respondents have been identified through low-probability screening questions (Gao et al. 2016b; Jones et al. 2015b), “trap-questions” or “red herrings” (Baker and Downes-Le Guin 2007; Baker et al. 2010), and hidden speeding metrics (Börger 2016). Once identified, these respondents have commonly been excluded from the panel or analysis (Jones et al. 2015b; Baker et al. 2010). In this paper we argue that simply excluding these respondents from the sample is misguided and unnecessary,Footnote 1 and that inattentiveness or dishonesty can show itself as additional heterogeneity. As such, we make hypotheses regarding these respondents’ behavior and instead use models that are able to capture this. We identify two main groups of respondents using a combination of information gathered by hidden speed metrics and follow-up questions. In the survey, we provided information about the good to be valued and the discrete choice experiment using two information videos. By measuring how long respondents stayed on the survey pages with the videos, we know that if they moved ahead with the survey in less time than it would take to watch the video, then they cannot have watched it to completion, and we classify them as inattentive. In the follow-up questions we asked respondents whether they watched the entire video to completion. By combining these two pieces of information we create a measure of dishonesty, or a willingness to deceive.Footnote 2 Inattentiveness is associated with speeding and dishonesty is likely associated with a fear of being disqualified from the survey coupled with social desirability bias. Since, the type of “trap question” used to identify dishonest respondents is distinctly different from those used in the literature to identify fraudulence, we provide a discussion of these approaches in Sect. 2. We hypothesize that inattentiveness is symptomatic of spending less effort throughout the survey. It is reasonable to assume that a respondent spending less effort also spends less time carefully deliberating on their choices. Indeed, looking at speeding behavior Börger (2016) found that respondents rushing through the survey had relatively more stochastic choices as seen from the econometrician’s point of view, which can partly be explained by less deliberation, and Gao et al. (2016b) find that respondents failing a trap question had larger variance in their willingness-to-pay estimates. Furthermore, when individuals face complex and difficult choices they tend to fall back on simplifying strategies and heuristics to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice and hence the effort necessary to make it (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier 2011). One such strategy, which we test in this paper, is ignoring one or more of the attributes in the choice tasks, also known as attribute non-attendance (AN-A) (see e.g. Campbell et al. 2011; Hensher et al. 2005). We hypothesize that inattentive respondents are more likely to ignore attributes. For example, if you do not pay close attention throughout the survey, then it is possible that you also pay less attention to all of the attribute information provided in the choice tasks. Failing to consider the actual choice behavior of respondents can lead to biased estimates and wrong inferences drawn regarding preferences. Given this we identify and test the following two hypotheses: (i) inattentive respondents have a relatively more stochastic choice process, and (ii) inattentive respondents are more likely to ignore attributes on the choice cards. The majority of discussions relating to dishonest respondents deal with those who fraudulently tries to qualify for panel membership or survey participation (Baker et al. 2010). It is believed that these respondents are “in it for the money” or want their opinions heard (Baker et al. 2010), and as such they are a source of possibly lower quality answers. However, this is mostly related to ‘opt-in’ panels and surveys. In our case, where initial sampling to participate in the panel and survey was random, there is less information to form a priori hypotheses. That said, given the way we are identifying dishonest respondents in this paper—as a sub-group of inattentive respondents—we would expect that their behavior is either less or more extreme, relative to inattentive ones. As such we test the same hypotheses for dishonest respondents. To test our hypotheses we develop a modeling framework that can jointly test both hypotheses. The model extends those used in Thiene et al. (2014) and Campbell et al. (2018) by using a mixed logit to capture preference heterogeneity, and Thiene et al. (2014) by inferring attribute non-attendance allowing for all possible AN-A patterns. The model allows us to capture possible scale differences and respondents ignoring attributes up to a probability. Our results show that inattentive respondents have a higher cost sensitivity, are more likely to have a small scale parameter, and are more likely to ignore the non-cost attributes. These results are largely driven by respondents failing to watch the information video about the discrete choice experiment, attributes and levels. While confirming previous results that inattention is linked to higher error-variance, we show that it might not be inattention in general that is the problem, but rather inattention at a crucial point in the survey, which led to a lack of information on how to complete the choice tasks. This suggests that proper information provision is crucial and can to some extent avoid respondents ignoring attributes. Furthermore, we find that inattentive respondents are more likely to attend to the cost attribute. This suggests a strategy involving focusing on the more familiar or self-explanatory attributes. In line with most results in the attribute non-attendance literature (see e.g. Colombo et al. 2013; Campbell et al. 2008; Hensher et al. 2005), we find that considering such behavior leads to substantially lower willingness-to-pay estimates. The rest of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 provides background to the investigations undertaken in this paper, Sect. 3 outlines the theoretical framework, Sect. 4 introduces the empirical case study and data, Section 5 discusses the results and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",13

(2012) revealed that 64% of marine fisheries have a stock below the maximum sustainable yield and that 18% of them are depleted. According to Caddy’s estimate in 1997, there are around 1000–1500 transboundary fisheries around the globe.Footnote 2 Given the tragic situation of the world’s fisheries—especially because shared stocks are more prone to overexploitation or depletion (McWhinnie 2009)—studying this large number of fisheries that span over the countries is particularly important for policy making. A possible way to manage such resources is through the formation of intergovernmental institutions, known as Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). However, in 2014, according to Barrett (2016), there were only 17 RFMOs, and only a subset of these covered transboundary fisheries. While some of the international fishery agreements have been successful, others have had challenging histories. An example of a fragile agreement is the Pacific Salmon Treaty between Canada and the United States in early 90s: a few years after the treaty was signed in 1985, the parties could not continue to abide by the agreed harvest shares due to climate variations, and they were on the verge of a fish war in 1993.Footnote 3 In this paper, I develop a theoretical framework to understand the economic forces behind the decision-making of harvesting countries in the context of the international fishery agreements about transboundary resources. In other words, the framework assumes that the coastal states have agreed on a certain total allowable catch (TAC) and on a sharing rule under an international agreement; the focus of the paper is to examine whether the countries are able to comply with the agreement. Countries normally have access to information about the assessment of fisheries. Sometimes the information is disseminated publicly. For example, international research institutions such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Ransom A. Myers (RAM) Legacy, the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) and the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) provide information in support of international agreements either globally or to their corresponding intergovernmental commissions and so to all involved coastal states. This paper assumes that the harvesters receive public information and, as in Roughgarden and Smith (1996) and Sethi et al. (2005), that estimates of the size of biomass have some measurement errors. This leads to ‘biological’ uncertainty in the decision-making of appropriators. This paper takes two key observations into account. First, information on stock assessment can also be privately collected: countries today use more and more sophisticated assessment technologies to estimate the fish population, such as aquatic drones or sonar technologies. The main research question is how obtaining heterogeneous information about the health of fisheries affects the decisions of coastal states regarding compliance with their agreement. Private assessments,Footnote 4 although highly correlated between countries, have an individual measurement error or noise. For the two countries in the model, the expected payoff of each country depends on its belief about the stock; but it also depends on ‘higher-order beliefs’: its belief about the other country’s belief about the stock, its belief about the other country’s belief about the country’s belief about the stock, and so on. Thus this noisy private information leads to strategic uncertainty about the behaviour of the other harvesting country. The second observation is about ecological variations and regime shifts in marine ecosystems. These regime shifts cause collapses of fisheries and can be both human-induced or occur exogenously. Change of temperature and change of chemistry may be a result of waste, greater concentration of CO\(_{2}\) in the water and plastic pollution, which all lead to a break in ecological web mechanisms, loss of resilience of ecosystems and a reduction in biodiversity across the world. This type of regime shift of marine fisheries, which is mainly due to the global-scale influence of human behaviour, is well-documented in science: to name a few, see Cheung et al. (2010), Berkes et al. (2006) and Folke et al. (2004). There are other types of ecological changes, which can be the result of physical variability. These factors, which can also lead to regime shift, are exogenous to humans’ actions and have a more predictive trend. For examples, El Niño (which normally occurs every three to five years) and La Niña (occurring more frequently), lead to periodic variations of sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean and compound anthropogenic damage to coral reefs and a break in the food chain (Redondo-Rodriguez et al. 2012). Furthermore, Chavez et al. (2003) have proved the existence of multi-decadal regime shifts in the entire Pacific Ocean due to large-scale changes of thermal structure and oceanic circulations, where in each regime (that lasts around 25 years) the population of either anchovies or sardines becomes dominant and the biomass of the other species collapses. This paper uses a model in which the fishery is threatened both by harvesting activities of the countries and the exogenous ecosystem factors. An example of this is that the population of capelin fish in the Barents Sea has collapsed twice in 20 years due both to overexploitation and to multi-species-ecosystem effects (Hjermann et al. 2004). Thus the model focuses on a fishery which undergoes a catastrophic situation of depletion at a certain point in the future, as the result of ecological factors. Specifically, a two-period model is presented, while the setup also deals with the possibility of countries’ triggering the catastrophe at an earlier date. The results of this model help a potential (intergovernmental) manager of the stock to explain the economic rationale of overfishing and the driving forces of the early collapse of such fisheries. I model the interaction of countries in a coordination setup: that is, payoffs are strategic complements. While coordination and trust play a crucial role in environmental economics, coordination models with perfect information typically have multiple equilibria, reducing the predictive power of the models. The first equilibrium selection technique suggested in this paper is the risk-dominance criterion of Harsanyi and Selten (1988). This criterion implies the selection of less risky actions and leads to a unique equilibrium strategy under precise public and private information. For the game of incomplete information, where assessments are noisy, another equilibrium-refinement technique is studied. As the private information becomes ‘almost precise’ (although the level of the stock will never be common knowledge), the coordination game will inevitably have the unique equilibrium of ‘global games’ in Carlsson and Van Damme (1993) and Morris and Shin (1998). Global games is terminology chosen by Carlsson and Van Damme (1993) to refer to games of incomplete information with strategic complementarities in payoffs, where as a result of receiving almost precise private correlated signals about the underlying state variable, the game has a unique prediction. In Sect. 5 there is a discussion of the proposition that if the private information is almost precise, rationality inevitably enforces the unique equilibrium of global games; thus this equilibrium-refinement criterion is not an arbitrary choice. The resultant unique equilibrium helps the researcher or the potential manager of the resource to derive a conclusion about the interaction of the harvesting agents, and to find the likelihood of overfishing at each level of (the assessment about) the stock. In addition, as the global-game equilibrium threshold coincides with the risk-dominant threshold in the precise-signal game,Footnote 5 it provides a tractable framework for policy implications in common-property fisheries. Indeed, one of the contributions of this paper is using the equilibrium-uniqueness results to derive optimal levels of policy-related parameters: overfishing cost and the TAC of transboundary fisheries. The structure of the paper is as follows: the related literature is reviewed in Sect. 2; the model is introduced in Sect. 3; next, in Sect. 4 the model is analysed under precise assessments and the risk-dominance equilibrium refinement is discussed; then, in Sect. 5 by assuming imprecise assessments the model is examined under biological and strategic uncertainties, and the global-game equilibrium refinement is introduced; the conclusion is in Sect. 6 and extended proofs are provided in Appendix.",5

Against this backdrop, linkage has become high on the climate policy agenda because it has potential to unleash cost-efficiency gains and help ratchet up ambition. Although most jurisdictions with operating or planned ETSs have engaged in some form of linking negotiations, links are difficult to agree and remain few and far between. Indeed, the multi-faceted nature of linkage as well as growing heterogeneity in market designs and governance frameworks pose many challenges to prospective partners (Ranson and Stavins 2016). First, discrepancies in autarky prices reflect different ambition levels or views about the desirable price signal (Fankhauser and Hepburn 2010).Footnote 2 Although a wide autarky price gap would increase attendant economic linkage gains, this may also raise concerns about rent transfer, equity, exported abatement co-benefits and so on, thereby impeding on the political feasibility of a link. Second, a certain degree of design harmonization is required to ensure market compatibility and avoid disruptions to the linked system, which also reduces regulatory autonomy (Jaffe et al. 2009).Footnote 3 Third, even when jurisdictions have compatible systems and are seeing eye to eye in terms of ambition, there are still risks that link outcomes do not unfold as anticipated. For instance, linkage creates exposure to ‘imported risks’, i.e., developments originating abroad that propagate throughout the linked system (Flachsland et al. 2009). Therefore, forging linkage agreements that reconcile and accommodate every party’s interests is proving difficult and the most suitable way for interconnection may well fall short of a full, unrestricted link, at least in the near term. Two types of approaches can be contemplated to palliate the acknowledged difficulties in initiating linkage. First, interties through a common hub might constitute a first step toward further market integration, e.g. networking or indirect linkage via offsetting.Footnote 4 For instance, Jaffe et al. (2009), Tuerk et al. (2009) and Fankhauser and Hepburn (2010) conceived of a progressive mechanism of market integration via unilateral connections to the Clean Development Mechanism, envisaged as a common hub in the Kyoto era.Footnote 5 Second, permit trade restrictions might be established in the perspective of full linkage. According to Mehling and Haites (2009), «a bilateral link can be approached gradually; quantity restrictions could be applied to the other scheme’s units initially and can be loosened over time as the effects [associated with the link] become clear». In essence, restrictions provide levers to adjust for the reach of the link and their potential is threefold. First, they can contain some link-induced effects (e.g., price variation or abatement relocation) that otherwise stymie link formation (Jaffe et al. 2009; Schneider et al. 2017).Footnote 6 Second, they can provide leverage in linkage negotiations through induced rents or revenues (Gavard et al. 2016). Third but not least, they can help gradually overcome some obstacles to full linkage while giving a taste of it, essentially facilitating negotiations by breaking down a lengthy linking process into progressive steps in the sense of ‘linking by degrees’ (Burtraw et al. 2013).Footnote 7 Our focus primarily lies on the latter aspect. Indeed, such a gradual approach and the various forms it may take have not yet been analyzed carefully. We consider three main types of link restrictions, namely quantitative transfer limits, border taxes on permit transfers and exchange rates on permits’ compliance values. We also discuss two other forms of restrictions, namely unilateral linkage and discount rates. To evaluate their relative effects we use a partial-equilibrium model of linkage between two markets in a static and deterministic framework. Our stylized model is simple which offers analytical tractability and, crucially, enables us to compare all types of link restrictions in a unifying framework.Footnote 8 This greatly enhances insight and constitutes our first contribution. No less importantly, our model has enough structure to highlight key differences across restrictions. In particular, we adopt a descriptive approach in comparing their relative implications in terms of cost efficiency, location and volume of abatement, price formation and inter-jurisdictional distributional aspects. By design, therefore, we lack a normative criterion for establishing a clear ranking between them.Footnote 9 However, we take our modelling results, along with lessons we draw from real-world experiences with emissions trading and linkage, as a basis for a policy-oriented discussion of the comparative merits of each restriction—thereby offering a policy menu, as it were—especially in their ability to initiate linkage and gradually scale up the link. This is our second contribution. Restrictions are distortionary and drive a wedge between jurisdictional prices relative to a full link.Footnote 10 Hence, they create a trade-off between eliminating some impediments to linkage and undermining a fundamental reason for linking in the first place, i.e., cost efficiency. More precisely, by fixing the maximum authorized net permit transfer, a quantitative restriction provides a direct quantity handle on the reach of the link but the ratio of inter-system price convergence is unknown ex ante. Symmetrically, a border tax sets the price ratio but there is uncertainty about the resulting permit transfers. In both cases, the restricted link outcomes are comprised between autarky and full linkage, and aggregate emissions are constant. Just like a border tax, an exchange rate specifies the ratio of jurisdictional marginal abatement costs in equilibrium but further alters the relative compliance value of permits. Aggregate emissions are thus allowed to vary as a result of inter-system permit trading. On the face of it, quantitative restrictions seem to be the natural route to full linkage between two quantity instruments. However, under a binding quantitative restriction two distinct jurisdictional prices coexist and inter-system transaction prices may not reflect marginal abatement costs, which can generate uncertainty about price formation and undesirable price fluctuations. The binding restriction also generates a scarcity rent whose distribution across jurisdictions is not clear ex ante. Quantitative restrictions can thus lead to uncertain distributional effects and weakened price signals, which may impair the transition to a full link. Some of these aspects can be mitigated under a border tax on permits. First, since the price ratio is fixed by the tax rate, there should be less undesirable price fluctuations and transaction prices should convey better information on marginal abatement costs. Second, where a quantitative limit creates a rent whose inter-jurisdictional distribution is uncertain, a tax raises revenues collected by a given jurisdiction. Some distributional aspects of the link can thus be better managed and tax revenues can be seen as a form of inter-jurisdictional transfers which might help spur cooperation. Border taxes, however, may be more complicated to implement and pursue legislatively speaking, for instance at the EU level. By altering the fungibility of jurisdictional abatement efforts, exchange rates can be employed to adjust for differences in programmes’ stringencies—and potentially other economic as well as non-economic criteria. In addition, we show how exchange rates, when skillfully selected, have potential to increase ambition over time. On the flip side, however, difficulties precisely pertain to the selection and subsequent adjustment of the exchange rate, which might possibly lead to environmental and economic outcomes worse than autarky. Therefore, this analysis allows us to pinpoint comparative advantages and weaknesses for each restriction. Although there is no ‘ideal’ transitional restricted linkage, we finally show how experience suggests that unilateral linkage—whereby permits can flow in one direction but not vice versa—can be a practical way of gradually approaching a full, two-way link.Footnote 11 By comparing all types of restrictions in a unifying framework, we complement and provide an analytical underpinning to Schneider et al. (2017). Closer to our model, but conceptually different, Rehdanz and Tol (2005) and Eyckmans and Kverndokk (2010) consider trade restrictions as an expedient for importing jurisdictions to deter exporting jurisdictions from issuing additional permits relative to autarky—a perverse effect occurring when inter-jurisdictional permit trading in the future is anticipated as first shown by Helm (2003).Footnote 12 The rest of the related literature largely resorts to CGE-based simulations. For instance, Bernstein et al. (1999), Bollen et al. (1999) and Criqui et al. (1999) compared the economic consequences of different emissions trading scenarios to understand the opportunity cost of quantitative restrictions under the Kyoto Protocol.Footnote 13 In particular, Ellerman and Sue Wing (2000) demonstrated the monopsonistic effects and rents induced by restrictions on permit imports. More recently, trade restrictions gained renewed attention in the context of linking and networking. For instance, Burtraw et al. (2017) quantify the impacts of a link between the California ETS and RGGI with a 3-for-1 exchange rate in comparison with full linkage (1-for-1 trading) and Gavard et al. (2016) appraise the benefits of a quantity-restricted link between China and the US (or Europe).Footnote 14 In practice, restrictions have been used to regulate offset credits for ‘supplementarity’ reasons in the form of both quantitative and qualitative limits on compliance usage and discount rates on compliance value (Trotignon 2012; Braun et al. 2015; Gronwald and Hintermann 2016).Footnote 15 To the best of our knowledge, the closest example of border taxes on inter-jurisdictional abatement transfers was on exports of Chinese Certified Emission Reductions, whose purported objective was to split the CDM rent between the government and projects owners (Liu 2010; Zhu 2014). The distortionary effects, tax incidence and revenue potential of the CDM levy were also analyzed by Fankhauser and Martin (2010). So far, exchange rates have not been used to regulate uniformly-mixed pollutants but are contemplated in the context of networking. Usually they are advocated for non-uniformly mixed pollutants to account for the heterogeneity in both pollutants and reception points, and were for instance considered in the ozone-targeting RECLAIM programme (Tietenberg 1995; Johnson and Pekelney 1996).Footnote 16 Finally, linkage has sometimes been initiated via restrictions, as attest transitional one-way links integrating Norway and the European aviation sector to the EU ETS. The remainder proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets forth the unifying modelling framework. Section 3 describes the implications of each link restriction analytically. Section 4 provides a policy discussion on the relative merits of each restriction with a special focus on the transition to full linkage. Section 5 concludes. An Appendix contains the analytical derivations and proofs (A), numerical simulations (B) and endogenizes domestic cap selection (C).",9

Such interventions may take many forms, but fundamental to economic interests are those which affect prices and/or incomes. Discrete choice models are conventionally estimated on individual-level preference data, whereas planning authorities are focussed more on the preferences of the market or society as a whole. This provokes an interesting question of how discrete choices can be defensibly aggregated, so as to yield market- or societal-level forecasts of quantity demanded and welfare following price and/or income changes. In what follows, we will conceptualise the interaction between choice and demand in terms of Small and Rosen’s (1981)Footnote 1 model of discrete–continuous demand. According to this model, an individual is offered a set of mutually exclusive goods from which he/she is invited to select their preferred good (e.g. choice of recreation site) and, conditional upon that choice, the individual consumes a quantity of a commodity (e.g. number of trips to the chosen site). The principal outcome of S&R’s paper is the derivation of a consumer surplus measure specific to the discrete choice component of the discrete–continuous demand.Footnote 2 S&R’s consumer surplus measure is defined in terms of the representative consumer (Gorman 1953), and conveniently allows the aggregation of discrete choices across individuals. However, as is widely acknowledged, a limiting property of S&R’s measure is that non-linear income effectsFootnote 3 of price (and lump sum income) changes are excluded. This property straightforwardly ensures path independence (Morey 1984), but is rather strong, and potentially introduces bias into the resulting measure of surplus. Recognising this limitation, a number of contributors (e.g. Hau 1985; Jara-Díaz and Videla 1989, 1990; McFadden 1995; Herriges and Kling 1999; Karlström 1999; Karlström and Morey 2001; Dagsvik and Karlström 2005; de Palma and Kilani 2011) have explored methods for estimating the corresponding Hicksian compensating variation. The attraction of the compensating variation is that, unlike S&R’s measure, it elicits a path independent measure of consumer surplus—even when non-linear income effects are admitted. Against this background, the present paper will seek to make four contributions: Following a brief overview of S&R’s welfare measure and elucidation of its underlying assumptions (Sect. 2), we will translate S&R’s algebraic presentation into a diagrammatic one using indifference maps. Using S&R’s model of discrete–continuous demand, we will develop an intuition for modelling linear income effects and/or substitution effects of price changes through the ‘numeraire’ good (Sect. 3). Whilst S&R’s paper devotes only passing comment to the numeraire good, the present paper will show that it plays a crucial role within S&R’s consumer surplus measure. With a few exceptions (e.g. Karlström and Morey 2001; de Palma and Kilani 2011), the literature has devoted limited discussion to the intuition behind non-linear income effects in discrete choice consumption contexts. Using S&R’s model of discrete–continuous demand, we will develop an intuition for modelling non-linear income effects of price changes through the conditional demand (Sect. 4). Despite the interest in measuring the Hicksian compensating variation, practical application has hitherto been impeded by the computational requirements of the candidate methods. Against this background, we will propose a simple method for approximating the Hicksian compensating variation (also Sect. 4), and illustrate its application using analytical and empirical examples (Sect. 5).",6

Tyner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In recent decades, economic expansion and population growth have triggered acceleration in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the most important contributor to global warming (Kouhestani et al. 2016). The pace of climatic changes without mitigation projected by scientific consensus is dramatic and poses grave consequences for the global economy and food security (The CNA Corporation 2007). Most economic sectors contribute to GHG emissions, among them, agricultural activities, non-renewable energy generation, and transportation based on fossil fuels are the major contributors (IPCC-WGIII 2014b). Agriculture alone was responsible for about 11% of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions in 2012 (Annex 1). Agricultural emissions can be associated with intermediate input use (e.g., N2O from fertilizers), primary factors (e.g., CH4 releases from rice land and livestock production) and sectoral outputs (Golub et al. 2010; Herrero et al. 2016; US-EPA 2006). There is a plethora of literature that describes the interaction among climate change, crop production, and food security. These studies show that under adverse effects of climate change on agricultural activities, many regions can suffer from deficiencies in their food supply (Burke and Lobell 2010; Challinor et al. 2014; Gregory et al. 2005; Lobell et al. 2008; Rippke 2016; Schmidhuber and Tubiello 2007; Stern 2007). Climate change can negatively affect crop productivity in many regions across the world depending on the location and type of crop (IPCC 2007; Nelson et al. 2010; Ouraich et al. 2014; Qaderi and Reid 2009; Stern 2007). Additionally, the demand for most agricultural products is often inelastic. Hence, a negative shock in food supply results in food price increases (Lobell et al. 2011; Roberts and Schlenker 2010). This could limit the ability of some regions to provide enough food for their population (GCEC 2014; Nagy 2006; Stern 2007). Governments are worried about the negative impacts of climate change on their societies, as pointed out by Former President Obama, climate change is the ‘greatest long-term threat facing the world’ (Julie Hirschfeld Davis MLaCD 2016). Thus many nations have agreed in collaborating to mitigate climate change. Forests help to reduce GHGs by sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere as part of their photosynthesis process (Daniels 2010; US-DOE 2010). For this reason, reforestation and reduction of deforestation have been recognized as efficient and effective alternatives to mitigate climate change. A substantial body of evidence suggests that this method is relatively less expensive than other types of mitigation (Adams et al. 1999; Golub et al. 2010; Richards and Stokes 2004; Sheeran 2006; Sohngen and Mendelsohn 2003; Stavins 1999), bringing the attention of policy makers in the last quarter century (Goetz et al. 2013; Golub et al. 2009; Stern 2007; US-DOE). Previous literature has evaluated the impacts of FCS incentives on the global food supply. Golub et al. (2013) have found that FCS incentives could increase livestock and food prices. Hussein et al. (2013) have made a similar argument and concluded that a FCS subsidy could elevate poverty in less developing countries due to its adverse impact on food price. While these seminal papers highlighted the implications of a FCS policy for food prices, they did not include the fact that climate change may reduce crop yields in future, and that could increase the food price impacts of this policy. These papers limited their analyses to about $27/tCO2e carbon price. This level of carbon price induces limited expansion in FCS. To achieve a larger expansion in FCS a higher carbon price is needed (Golub et al. 2010). For instance, Sohngen (2009) has shown that for a maximum 2 °C temperature change scenario, FCS should increases by 178% between 2010 and 2100, and that requires about $130/tCO2e carbon price to compensate the opportunity costs of land transferred to forest. This author has stated that a large expansion in FCS could largely increase food prices, and that further elevates the opportunity costs of FCS. The evaluation of an aggressive FCS policy in the presence of climate change effects on crop yields has not been carefully evaluated. Thus, more research is needed in evaluating the economic net benefits of reducing climate change effects, the types of mitigation methods and the cost of delaying efforts (The Whitehouse 2014). This paper aims to improve our understanding of the interplay between climate change, mitigation policies, and their impacts on the global economy by addressing the following important questions: What is the cost of emissions reduction with no FCS incentive? What is the mitigation cost incorporating FCS? What are the impacts of FCS on food security? What are the consequences for the global economy and food production when crop productivity is affected by climate change? And, what is the economic value of reducing crop yield losses? To fulfill our objectives, we elaborate a multidisciplinary approach (Fig. 1). The main component of this approach is a modified version of a well-known computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-BIO-FCS. This model is used to evaluate the economic and land use impacts of emissions reduction targets and policies under alternative climate scenarios. The examined climate scenarios are RCP8.5 and RCP4.5. The first scenario represents the case of business as usual with no mitigation effort. The second scenario implements a global target to reduce emissions by 50%, according to the Paris accord. To achieve this level of emission reduction, we examined two alternative polices: (1) A global uniform tax on all types of GHGs (in $/tCO2e) and (2) a global uniform tax plus an equivalent FCS subsidy. For the given emission reduction target, the implemented CGE model endogenously determines the corresponding tax/subsidy rates in $/tCO2e. To take into account the impacts of climate change on crop yields, we collected data on the existing projections for future changes in crop yields for the examined climate change scenarios. These projections were obtained from the existing estimates developed by the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project (AgMIP) (Villoria et al. 2016). These projections and the emissions reduction target were introduced as exogenous shocks to the CGE model for each alternative policy (either tax or tax-subsidy). We chose a comparative static framework because using a dynamic framework requires many exogenous assumptions that, in turn, impact the results of the analysis. Our objective was to isolate the impacts of climate change shocks and the carbon tax and FCS subsidy policies over an intermediate time horizon. Framework of the GTAP-BIO-FCS model Our research contributes to the literature in several ways: (1) It develops a new CGE model entitled GTAP-BIO-FCS, which unlike its predecessors is suitable for the economic analysis of different mitigation practices including carbon tax, FCS, and biofuel production; (2) It provides evidence of the impact of FCS incentives on food security; (3) It highlights the economic and environmental consequences of including climate change crop yield impacts in the mitigation analysis.",21

The induced innovation hypothesis, first specified by Hicks (1932) and more recently restated in relation to environmental policy by Porter (1991), suggests that environmental regulations, along with resource prices, can be a source of technological change. According to the hypothesis, to comply with environmental or energy-efficiency standards, firms will allocate more resources into developing relevant technologies and/or lowering the production costs of these technologies. This leads to advances in environmental or energy-efficient technologies (“induced” or “directed” technological change) and lowers the compliance costs. This paper empirically tests the hypothesis in the context of road transport, one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions that makes up 10% of global emissions in 2010 and 23% of US emissions in 2016, for example (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014; Environmental Protection Agency 2018). Specifically, I estimate how Japanese automakers’ production possibility frontier (PPF) between fuel economy and other relevant attributes (e.g., horsepower) improved from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. Japanese fuel economy regulations started to be tightened in the 1990s, preceding the tightening or introduction of similar regulations in other regions, including the US and the EU. Using vehicle characteristics data (rather than patent data as in almost all the previous studies on induced innovation in environmental or energy-efficient technologies), I investigate whether the technological progress achieved by Japanese automakers accelerated after the regulatory tightening. Previous studies show empirical evidence of technological change induced by environmental/energy-efficiency regulations or energy/fuel prices.Footnote 1 Newell et al. (1999) analyze technological change in energy efficiency based on product-level data for air conditioners and water heaters in the US market, finding that the direction of technological change is responsive to energy prices for some products and that government energy efficiency standards also have a significant impact on the average energy efficiency of the product menu. Based on US patent data, Popp (2002) studies the impact of energy prices on innovations in energy-saving technologies, noting a strong, positive impact of energy prices on the number of new patents. Similarly, Popp (2006) uses patent data from the US, Japan, and Germany to examine the innovation in and diffusion of air pollution control equipment, observing that innovation responds to regulatory pressure. There are other studies in the literature, such as Lanjouw and Mody (1996), Jaffe and Palmer (1997), Brunnermeier and Cohen (2003), Nesta et al. (2014), and Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2016), that also use patent data to estimate the degree of induced innovation. Given the economic and environmental significance of the auto industry, several studies look particularly into (induced or overall) technological change in vehicle fuel economy or emission control technologies. Berry et al. (1996) estimate automakers’ production cost functions for the period 1972–1982, when gasoline prices increased rapidly and vehicle emission and fuel economy standards were tightened. Using plant-level cost data, they show that (per-vehicle) production costs increased over the period, even after controlling for changes in vehicle characteristics. Additionally, by analyzing patent data, they observe that patent applications linked to combustion engines increased significantly, implying faster technological progress. An important implication of the results of Berry et al. (1996) is that rising gasoline prices or tightened regulations lead simultaneously to increased production costs and technological progress, both of which can improve fuel economy. Knittel (2011) examines fuel economy trends in the US, using vehicle-level specification data and an empirical framework which is similar to this paper’s in that fuel economy is regressed on other vehicle attributes and firm and time fixed effects. He focuses on the overall rate of technological progress (part of which may be induced by government regulations and fuel prices) and finds steady trends of fuel economy improvement (conditional on other vehicle attributes and firm fixed effects) in the US between 1980 and 2006. According to his estimates, the early 1980s, when gasoline prices were high and the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were tightened, saw the fastest pace of improvement, which likely resulted not only from (autonomous and induced) technological progress but also from the increased production costs associated with fuel economy, as suggested by Berry et al. (1996).Footnote 2 He also states that his estimates may be biased because these incremental production costs are unobservable and thus omitted.Footnote 3 Haščič et al. (2009) use international data on patent activity to show that environmental regulations and higher fuel prices encourage innovations in automotive emission control technologies for local air pollutants. Based on US patent data on energy-efficient automotive technology, Crabb and Johnson (2010) measure technological progress induced by high oil prices and the CAFE standards, finding robust empirical evidence for the impact of oil prices, but none for the CAFE standards. By analyzing firm-level patent data from multiple countries, Aghion et al. (2016) observe that “clean” innovations in the auto industry (for example, innovations associated with electric, hybrid, and hydrogen vehicles) are stimulated by high fuel prices. These previous studies on induced innovation in energy efficiency or pollution control are based on patent data (except for Newell et al. (1999) on air conditioners and water heaters), whereas I examine induced innovation by using product characteristics (vehicle specifications) data. In this regard, this paper is similar to Newell et al. (1999) and Knittel (2011) discussed above. While patents are an essential part of innovation, energy efficiency patents themselves do not reduce energy consumption or carbon emissions; they must be adopted in marketed products to achieve this goal (technology adoption and commercialization). It is, therefore, worthwhile to measure the extent of induced technological change that materializes in marketed products. I intend to fill the gap in the literature between induced innovation as measured by patent counts, which has been empirically confirmed by many studies, and improved environmental performance or energy efficiency as observed in actual product characteristics. An issue in estimating induced technological change using product characteristics data is how to distinguish it from the effect of increased production costs. The findings by Berry et al. (1996), as described above, suggest that both technological progress and increased production costs presumably helped improve fuel economy after the tightening of the Japanese regulations. However, it is practically impossible to observe how much is spent on various fuel economy-improving systems and devices of each vehicle (hence the omission of the costs by Knittel (2011)). This paper intends to address the problem by analyzing vehicles produced by Japanese automakers and sold in the US, with vehicles produced by selected American and European automakers and sold in the US serving as a control group. There are a few key observations for this research design. First, these non-Japanese automakers’ sales in the Japanese market were so small that the Japanese fuel economy regulations were unlikely to affect their technology. That is, only Japanese automakers potentially experienced innovations induced by the Japanese regulations. Second, the Japanese regulations were the main factor in inducing technological progress in fuel efficiency during the period of the analysis (1985–2004). Fuel economy regulations in the US and the EU remained almost unchanged or had not come into effect in this period. Fuel prices were relatively stable or slowly decreasing in most countries, including Japan, the US, and the EU. This implies that, other than the Japanese regulations, there were few, if any, factors that would have induced technological progress in fuel efficiency in these markets during the period. Third, the paper’s regression analysis indicates that Japanese vehicles sold in the US market were not subject to the added production costs resulting from the Japanese regulations. Then, the regulation-induced innovation, which presumably benefited the production of these vehicles too, can be observed in them without being confounded by the induced extra costs. Under these circumstances, the paper’s empirical strategy, which compares the US-market fleet of Japanese automakers (the treatment group) with that of selected American and European automakers (the control group) in a difference-in-differences framework, reveals (a lower bound of) the effect of technological progress induced by the Japanese regulations. This is because (1) comparing the two groups in a difference-in-differences framework will “difference out” the trends that are common to both groups, such as autonomous technological change, and (2) the effects specific to Japanese vehicles in the treatment period are attributable to the technological progress (rather than the incremental production costs) induced by the Japanese regulations. In practice, the effect of induced innovation estimated from this framework should be interpreted as a lower bound of the actual effect for a few reasons that are discussed in Sect. 4, such as the possibility that an induced shift of a Japanese automaker’s PPF might not fully transfer to the production process of its US-market fleet. This empirical strategy is similar to the one taken by Popp (2006) and Aghion et al. (2016) in the sense that induced innovation is identified by exploiting international differences in environmental regulations or fuel prices and the variation across firms in the relative importance of different national markets in their sales. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s fuel economy test data for each vehicle configuration sold in the US from the 1980s to the 2000s, I estimate how the fuel economy of the vehicles in the treatment and control groups improved over time, conditional on other attributes such as horsepower and engine size. The analysis reveals whether the Japanese automakers’ rate of improvement in (conditional) fuel economy accelerated relative to that of the non-Japanese automakers once the tightened regulations in Japan started to affect the former (but not the latter) in the second half of the 1990s. The estimation results provide evidence of substantial induced technological progress. Across different settings, the estimated lower bounds for the effect of induced innovation are generally in the range of 3–5% (with significance at the 5% or 10% level in most cases). That is, induced technological change enabled the average vehicle to be at least 3–5% more fuel efficient, holding other vehicle attributes and the production cost constant and setting aside the autonomous factors (e.g. autonomous technological change) that would have occurred even in a counterfactual case of no regulatory change. Stated differently, the effect of induced innovation is at least as large as what would have resulted from such autonomous factors over 4–7 years even with no inducement from fuel economy regulations or fuel prices. Thus, this paper illustrates that new patents induced by government regulations, which are analyzed and evidenced by the previous studies, are indeed adopted in actual products sold in the market and contribute to significant improvements in environmental performance or energy efficiency. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical framework to analyze the determinants of automotive fuel economy. Section 3 describes fuel economy regulations and trends in Japan. Section 4 explains the data used for the empirical analysis and discusses the empirical framework. Section 5 presents the estimation results, and Sect. 6 concludes the study.",8

This elegant paper is taught in all introductory courses of the discipline around the world. Almost five decades after its appearance, this paper is still playing a crucial role in shaping the debate about whether a carbon tax is better than a market for emission permits when costs and benefits are uncertain. The main message of the paper is that the market/quantity approach should be preferred when the marginal damage function is very steep at some concentration threshold. By fixing a quota of emissions below the threshold guarantees that it will never be crossed. On the contrary, the tax/price approach should be preferred when the marginal abatement cost function is very steep at some abatement target level. By fixing a tax on carbon guarantees that abatement costs will remain under control in all states of nature. Marty was perfectly right to analyze that the uncertainty surrounding the damage and abatement functions is the crucial ingredient that needs to be examined before shaping an optimal policy. The remaining difficulty today is that the sources of uncertainty are extremely difficult to quantify. For example, we are still unable to quantify the positive and negative feedback loops in the dynamics of climate, and therefore the location of the potential catastrophic thresholds of concentration remains ambiguous. We also face deep uncertainties about the abatement costs to which we will be confronted in one and two decades. Moreover, it is crucially important for the actors of the energy transition to provide credible signals about the price of carbon that should prevail for these time horizons. Should we commit to high carbon prices in the future to promote the green R&D and the early adoption of green technologies, with the risk of having to revise the price downward in case of an unexpected radical green innovation? Or should we commit on an emission target as those that have been promised in the “Nationally-Determined Contributions” of the Paris Agreement of 2015? Those hot questions today were already at the core of Marty’s paper of 1974!",

One component is used to estimate the value of travel time for each individual in the sample. The second component incorporates that value of travel time into the travel cost variable that is used in the estimation of the site demand. While the travel cost demand curve is estimated using the widely applied count methodology, the travel time component of the model is based on a discrete choice stated preference method. Our approach avoids arbitrary assumptions about an individual’s value of time in an appealing way. It also allows quite intricate valuations since the stated preference portion of the model can accommodate a wide range of travel modes, time constraints, family situations and other considerations that can affect the value of one’s time when traveling for recreation. The individual level approach to valuing travel time utilized in this analysis is made possible by relatively recent advances in modeling preference heterogeneity in stated preference studies. The advances allow the derivation of posterior estimates of each individual’s taste parameters. We argue that utilizing individual-specific values of travel time savings, based on respondents’ stated preferences, provides a feasible method for empirically incorporating the value of travel time into travel cost demand studies. Through an empirical illustration we show that the proposed approach is tractable. All it requires is the inclusion of only a few discrete choice experiment (DCE) questions in a TCM survey and a proper econometric treatment. Our results show that using arbitrary assumptions concerning individuals’ value of travel time savings (VTTS) equal to a given share of their wage rate (e.g., 1/3) are largely unfounded. First of all, nearly half of respondents say they do not wish their journey to the site was shorter, indicating positive utility of leisure travel. Those who wished to shorten the journey were willing to pay amounts which appear only mildly correlated with their estimated wage rates. Overall, the average consumer surplus per trip calculated from the model with individual-specific VTTS were the closest to the model which used respondents’ full wage rate included for respondents who said they wish their journey was shorter (and zero for others). We suggest using this approach as the second best, in the case eliciting individual specific VTTS was not possible. In 1965 Becker postulated that “time can be converted into money”. The basic idea is that people choose how much labor to supply, given a constraint that total time available is divided among work, leisure, and travel. At its bare bones, this model implies that travel time is valued at the after-tax wage rate. This is because the Becker model assumes that time can be transferred freely between work and leisure, so any marginal savings in travel time can be used to increase labor income. This model has been expanded in many directions. A common starting point is DeSerpa (1971). This model assumes that utility is affected by commodity bundles \(X = (X_{1} , \ldots ,X_{n} ,T_{1} , \ldots ,T_{n} )\) where \(X_{i}\) denotes some quantity of the i-th good, while \(T_{i}\) denotes the amount of time allocated to the i-th good. These goods can include both travel to a recreational site and time onsite. \(T_{w}\) denotes time spent at work (which may increase or decrease utility). Each activity has a minimum time requirement \(\bar{T}\) (hence constraint \(T_{i} \ge \bar{T}\)). There is also an overall time constraint \(T_{w} + \sum {T_{i} } \le T^{0}\). The budget constraint is \(P_{i} X_{i} \le Y + wT_{w}\), where \(Y\) is unearned income. As a result, the problem can be stated as: This problem can be solved by formulating a Lagrangian function, in which each constraint is associated with a Lagrange multiplier indicating how tight it is (i.e., the rate at which utility could be increased by relaxing it a little). Let \(\lambda\), \(\mu\), and \(\kappa\) be the Lagrangian multipliers for the budget constraint, the overall time constraint, and the activity-specific time constraints, respectively. The solution to the optimization problem yields: Equation (2) states that value of time as a personal resource (or simply value of leisure) equals wage rate plus the value of utility from work. If \(T_{i}\) in Eq. (3) is not restricted to its minimum then by the virtue of complementary slackness condition its multiplier would be zero. Which in turn implies that VTTS = 0 and that \(\frac{{\partial U/\partial T_{i} }}{\lambda } = w + \frac{{\partial U/\partial T_{w} }}{\lambda }\), that is, the value of marginal utility from the activity \(i\) would be equal to value of leisure. In other words, if a person spends on an activity more time than the minimum required (the constraint \(\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\kappa_{i} } (T_{i} - \bar{T}) \ge 0\) is not binding), such activity would be what DeSerpa (1971) calls a pure leisure good and its value equals to the value of time as a resource. On the other hand, if \(\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\kappa_{i} } (T_{i} - \bar{T}) = 0\) then \({{\kappa_{i} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\kappa_{i} } \lambda }} \right. \kern-0pt} \lambda }\) can be interpreted as value of time saved (VTTS) in the activity \(i\). Most work in the transportation field assumes traveling is a means to an end and travel time is a disutility to be minimized. However, in the recent years new concepts emerged, including the so-called positive utility of travel, which suggests that travel can provide benefits and may be motivated by factors beyond reaching activity destinations (see, e.g., Mokhtarian and Salomon 2001; Mokhtarian 2005). Positive utility of travel implies that \(\partial U/\partial T_{i}\) is positive. In the extreme case, if positive utility of time offsets \(w + \frac{{\partial U/\partial T_{w} }}{\lambda }\) then VTTS would be zero. However, note that VTTS = 0 does not mean that the value of time is zero. Time is scarce and the time spent on traveling to the site as well as the time spent on the site is time that could have been devoted to other activities. The value of those lost opportunities is the time cost of the trip. It is important to distinguish between VTTS and the value of time in terms of lost opportunities. If the main goal of the analysis was to estimate benefits from a new road or any other public investment that would result in time savings then the analysis should focus on monetizing benefits from time saved. However, if the goal is to estimate consumer surplus from visiting a given site then the analysis should focus on estimating the alternative cost of time. Unfortunately, in the cases when \(\frac{{\partial U/\partial T_{i} }}{\lambda } > 0\), VTTS will underestimate the true value of time and the more similar the value of travel is to the value of time on-site, the larger the discrepancy between VTTS and the value of time in terms of lost opportunities will be. The incorporation of the value of travel time in the TCM studies has been a source of concern since the earliest applications of this method (e.g., Clawson and Knetsch 1966; Johnson 1966). Researchers disagreed not only about how much the travel time is worth but also whether it should be included it in the model at all. Cesario (1976) provided an early cogent discussion of the incorporation of the value of time into travel cost models. Despite the decades of research into the value of time, Randall’s (1994) observation that “the cost of travel time remains an empirical mystery” remains valid and estimating the value of travel time (or, in most cases, rather the opportunity cost of time) remains a frequently discussed problem in the literature on TCM (e.g., Fletcher et al. 1990; Garrod and Willis 1999; Hanley and Barbier 2009). Early on McConnell (1975) stressed the need to estimate the value of time before incorporating it in the demand function. However, uncovering the rate of substitution between money and time was long considered empirically intractable (as these trade-offs are endogenous and unobservable), even if conceptually possible. Cesario’s (1976) suggestion that commuter’s travel time values of 25–50% of an individual’s wage rate was widely adopted. Using a fraction of wage rate has remained probably the most common approach, with the compromise value of 33% being the most broadly accepted level (Hellerstein and Mendelsohn 1993; Englin and Cameron 1996; Garrod and Willis 1999; Gürlük and Rehber 2008; Egan et al. 2009; Huhtala and Lankia 2012). Critics of the wage-based approach note that it makes little sense for those without reported wages, the method would suggest their marginal utility of time is zero. That is clearly not the case (Feather and Shaw 1999; Parsons 2003).Footnote 1 Englin and Shonkwiler (1995) developed a model linking a count travel cost to a confirmatory factor analytic model. The confirmatory factor analytic portion allowed a travel time value to be imputed for each individual and incorporated into the cost of travel. In a further development, Feather and Shaw (1999) used shadow wages (the values of extra units of leisure time) as the opportunity cost of travel time and compared this with previous approaches (using a fraction of wage rate and hedonic wage equations). On average, their estimates were better adjusted to the observed wage rates for different employment categories of respondents, compared with the wage rate predicted by the hedonic model. Recent work has focused on the relationship between one’s work and life schedule and the value of time in recreational travel. The early discussion of these issues was put forth by Bockstael et al. (1987) who proposed a general framework on how to incorporate time in TCM studies, based on insights from the labor literature. Demand for time depends on whether an individual can freely substitute recreation for work (interior solution) or has fixed work hours (corner solution). Most recently, Larson and Lew (2014) empirically implemented a system of joint labor-recreation equations to capture these effects. Palmquist et al. (2010) employed a joint revealed stated preference approach to deal with fundamental lack of substitutability of recreation time for other forms of time. Both of these efforts seek a structural analysis of the value of time that looks at the relationship between the demand for time and hence value and flexibility to substitute time. A second recent strand of work has focused on revealed valuations of travel time. Fezzi et al. (2014) utilized a natural experiment where recreationists had a choice of a toll road which was faster or not paying a toll and taking more time to reach the recreation site. This is a novel approach and very robust but it is also specific to a particular site and so will be subject to the usual limitations if the values are transferred to other settings. Wolff (2014) utilized speeding behavior as a function of gasoline price to identify the value of time. This is also revealed preference approach and so is excellent for the area studied but again the values must be transferred to use in other settings. Early suggestions to combine TCM with contingent valuation or contingent behavior questions (Cameron 1992a, b; Adamowicz et al. 1994; Englin and Cameron 1996) explored the methodological issues without paying specific attention to the opportunity cost of time. For example, Englin and Cameron (1996) added contingent behavior questions to a TCM study but these questions referred to general trip costs and not specifically to the opportunity cost of time. Nevertheless, such an approach makes it possible to impose exogenously varying travel costs and could be applied to opportunity cost of time too. Álvarez-Farizo et al. (2001) adopted contingent valuation to estimate the value of leisure time for use in recreational models and confirmed a significant variation in leisure time values. Building on Shaw (1992), Casey et al. (1995) offered an alternative approach, indicating that individual preferences regarding time are better reflected by the opportunity costs of time associated with a particular aspect of recreation than the wage. After all, the latter measures the trade-off between work and leisure more generally. They complemented a standard travel cost survey with a contingent valuation question about peoples’ willingness to accept compensation to forgo a precisely defined recreational experience and used these results to derive the value of leisure time. Ovaskainen et al. (2012) directly elicited a stated value of time using a contingent valuation survey. Finally, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2019) in the context of recreation demand for fishing trips found that individual value of leisure time is substantially different from one’s implied wage rate. In light of the above challenges of incorporating meaningful estimates of the opportunity cost of time into recreational demand models, in what follows we propose to combine TCM with a DCE that would indicate how much each respondent values travel time. Compared to most of the above ideas, ours is more flexible and it is very precise in that we obtain specific estimates on the opportunity cost of time for each respondent in any potential setting. We explain this approach by first reviewing the methodology required by the TCM and DCE studies, with a particular focus on econometric derivation of individual-specific values of travel time savings. We then move to an empirical illustration of our approach, which is compared with traditional treatments of value of travel time savings. Our case study not only serves as an example of the methodology we propose, but also illustrates that the usual approach of assuming that respondents’ values of travel time savings are proportional to their wages is largely unfounded. The last section offers discussion of the results and conclusions.",18

Various authors argue that capitalism may inhibit corporate environmental performance, because private industry will invest in the most profitable technologies, which leads to a focus on the cheapest rather than environmentally responsible processes (Williamson et al. 2006; Bell 2015). Other authors argue that economic freedom in markets and competition stimulate corporate environmental performance (CEP) (Baughn et al. 2007; Jackson and Apostolakou 2010; Kinderman 2012; Hartmann and Uhlenbruck 2015), and businesses has expressed its interest in adopting a more extensive CEP approach conditional upon receiving greater freedom from the state (Kinderman 2008). While others have considered the benefits and costs of regulation (cf. Brammer et al. 2012; Agan et al. 2013); we look at the broad measure of economic freedom. Economic freedom means that property rights are secure and that individuals are free to use, exchange, or give their property to another as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others (Gwartney and Lawson 2003). Economic freedom declines if the government intervenes through taxation, trade tariffs or other trade barriers, or regulations of credit, output and labor markets. A stronger protection of property rights has been found to lead to environmental improvements (Ioannou and Serafeim 2012). Free trade, another exponent of economic freedom, has however, ambiguous effects. Whereas the so-called gains-from-trade hypothesis presumes that trade has a positive effect on the environment; the so-called race-to-the-bottom hypothesis states that open countries adopt lax environmental standards and become pollution havens in order to attract multinational corporations or export pollution-intensive goods (Frankel and Rose 2005). A literature study of Carson (2010) shows that the supporting empirical evidence of either hypothesis remains scant and fragile. Also for state regulation, evidence is mixed. Camisón (2010) found that the effectiveness of coercive regulation in promoting environmental innovation is lower than voluntary policies. Demirel et al. (2018) found that effective environmental protection entails collaboration between government regulation and voluntary environmental measures. Coercive legislation does not leave much room for flexibility and voluntary choices by managers and frequently pushes the manager to adopt environmental measures without considering effectiveness (Daddi et al. 2016). For economic freedom more generally, Jackson and Apostolakou (2010) argue and found that firms in liberal market economies outstrip firms in coordinated market economies, because their voluntary CEP initiatives substitute for the lack of government interventions. Kinderman (2012) stated that during the period of rapid deregulation and liberalization in the UK (a typical liberal market economy) CEP not only developed and thrived, but even managed to outperform the previous economic model in terms of corporate accountability and corporate standards. We contribute to this literature, presenting evidence for an important modification of the argument of Jackson and Apostolakou (2010) and Kinderman (2012) that companies voluntarily adopt a more extensive CEP approach if the state reduces its interventions: the positive effect of economic freedom on CEP is conditional on internal motivations to CEP. The literature on motives for corporate social performance (CSP) (which includes corporate environmental performance) distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic motives (Muller and Kolk 2010).Footnote 1 An extrinsic motive encourages CEP if it is instrumental for other goals, such as financial performance or the company’s reputation. Intrinsic motives perceive CEP as an end in itself, independent from other benefits. Intrinsic (environmental) motivation may stem from personal satisfaction of engaging in CEP when executives enjoy helping others or from a sense of responsibility to contribute to society and the welfare of future generations (Lindenberg 2001). Previous studies have focused on drivers external and internal to the firm (Weaver et al. 1999; Aguilera et al. 2007; Bracke et al. 2008; Haller and Murphy 2012), but did not consider that the influence of internal drivers interact with the external drivers. We fill a gap in this literature studying this interaction, exploiting the variation between companies in their environmental motivation and between countries in their level of economic freedom. We hypothesize and test that economic freedom increases CEP for firms with internally motivated managers, e.g. through voluntary actions (Alberini and Segerson 2002), while absence of economic freedom increases CEP for firms without. Our paper thereby fits in a growing literature that considers more ‘behavioral’ drivers for environmental performance (Croson and Treich 2014). We focus on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), as the managers’ values and motives play a relatively important role for these (Revell et al. 2010). We use a recent survey with entries for 4338 companies from 12 European countries; we interact managerial motivation with country economic freedom to test its effect on environmental performance. The use of survey data allows us a deeper look into motivation, complementing previous studies that focus on public structural data (cf. Bracke et al. 2008; Haller and Murphy 2012). Our paper thus makes two major contributions to existing literature. First, we extend and deepen existing literature on institutional drivers of CEP by arguing that the impacts of market institutions on CEP depend on their virtuous interaction with internal motivations towards CEP. Second, we test empirically if and what kind of motivation interacts with economic freedom in their influences on CEP. We exploit a sample of SMEs from 12 European countries that provides a good setting for such a study because of the prominence of manager’s personal motivations in CEP strategies of SMEs.",9

These externalities result mainly from inappropriate manure management and the overuse of external inputs such as fertilizers and concentrates feeds in intensive dairy production systems. They impact directly on the local environment causing damage to the ecosystems and human health (Cecchini et al. 2018; McLellan et al. 2018; Erisman et al. 2011). Although the European Union (EU) through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), has enacted a number of environmental policies (for example, the Nitrates Directive and the Water Framework Directive) aimed at ensuring sustainable agricultural production, excess nutrient from dairy production remains an issue of serious concern in the continent (European Communities 2010). The proper management of negative agricultural externalities require that they are measured and incorporated when evaluating production performance (Skevas et al. 2018; Pérez-Urdiales et al. 2016; Orea and Wall 2017; Mamardashvili et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2014, 2016; Picazo-Tadeo and Prior 2009; Tyteca 1996). It is difficult to manage what you cannot measure. Unlike the desirable outputs, (milk for example), the undesirable outputs are not accounted for in the market place, either from an individual producer or society’s perspective, and are therefore not costed. In fact, they are not often taken into consideration by the farmers in making their production decisions. The implication of this is that, their economic values are unknown and difficult to assess such that the undesirable outputs are usually in excess of what can be considered as economically and environmentally sustainable. With less quantitative information about the degree of damage undesirable outputs inflict on the environment, the formulation of appropriate and efficient agri-environmental policies acceptable to all stakeholders within the dairy production system becomes difficult. The knowledge of a composite environmental efficiency index and marginal abatement costs of nutrient surplus would provide room for assessing the economic impacts of different farms strategies aimed at reducing polluting emissions and consequently climate change effects. Also, an estimate of the abatement costs of nutrient surplus can provide the relevant parameters in the design of incentive mechanisms relating to the reward for efficient management of negative production externalities by public decision makers. By quantifying the opportunity costs of reducing N surplus, policy makers can better understand the burden that abatement costs would have on the performance of the dairy farms. This will be relevant in making economic and policy decisions affecting the design of regulatory environmental policies and the management of dairy farms. The dairy sector is an important agricultural sub-sector on the island of Ireland which comprises Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (see Fig. 1). The dairy sector accounts for about 32% of the total agricultural output in both countries (CSO 2018; DAERA 2017; DAFM 2017). However, compared to other agricultural sectors, the dairy sector in both countries has the highest stocking densities and fertilizer inputs, putting pressure on the environment (Buckley et al. 2016). There are indications that the expansion of the dairy sector resulting from the abolition of the milk quotaFootnote 1 regime in 2015 after 31 years of its existence might lead to further environmental concerns. Already, the elevated nutrient concentrations contribute significantly to the problem of environmental pollution and puts pressure on marginal habitats and landscape features. There is widespread water quality issues with some of the water bodies usually exceeding the 50 mg/l limit on the levels of nitrate allowable in drinking water. Agriculture account for more than 30% of the incidence of water pollution on the island of Ireland (Cave and McKibbin 2016; Summary of Findings of Northern Ireland 2012; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2017). More than 50% of all rivers in Northern Ireland are classified as “moderate/poor status”. and about 70% of lakes are classed as eutrophic under the “water framework directive” (Cave and McKibbin 2016; “Summary of Findings of Northern Ireland Nitrates” 2012).The situation is similar in the Republic of Ireland where about 69% of the transitional water bodies, 43% of rivers and 54% of lakes are classified as moderate or worse status (EPA 2017). The quality of surface waters in the region has remained relatively static in the last few years and the objective of the water framework directives to achieve a 13% improvement in surface water standards between 2010 and 2015 has not been achieved (EPA 2017).

In this paper we employed the parametric hyperbolic environmental technology distance function approach in a stochastic frontier framework to analyse the environmental performance and consequently estimate the abatement costs (shadow price) of N surplus in dairy farms on the island of Ireland. The farm level N pollution costs ratio and its determinants are also analysed using the within-between (WB) farm random effect modelling approach. The contribution of this paper to the existing literature is three-fold. Firstly, this work provides the first attempt to parametrically estimate the environmental performance and shadow price of N surplus in dairy farms using a hyperbolic distance function approach with farm level panel data. The applied hyperbolic environmental technology distance function is less restrictive compared to the output or input distance function allowing for more robust estimates to be obtained. Secondly, the comparison of environmental performance and shadow price of N surplus in two separate countries with differing, but largely pasture based dairy production systems gives room for greater generalisation of results and provides the basis for spatial comparison of the environmental performance of different dairy production systems. Thirdly, this is the first study to investigate the factors influencing the N pollution cost ratio in dairy farms employing the within-between econometric approach. The methodology is able to analyse the within (time) and between (individual) effects in a single model of the Random effects (RE) modelling framework. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we review relevant empirical literature. We describe the methodology used in the research by illustrating the theoretical framework in Sect. 3 while in Sect. 4 we provide a detailed description of the data and empirical specification of the model. The estimated results are reported and discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6 by presenting an overview of the study outcomes alongside relevant policy recommendations.",24

Adetutu,Thomas G. Weyman-Jones,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Fuel subsidies are often employed by developing countriesFootnote 1 as instruments to alleviate poverty and promote social welfare. According to the IMF, global energy subsidies amounted to $5.3tn in 2015, with developing countries sacrificing, on average, around 7% (versus 1.9% for OECD countries) of their GDP to provide these subsidies. The IMF computation of global fuel subsidies defines them as arising when consumer prices are below supply costs plus environmental costs and general consumption taxes, rather than simply the difference between consumer prices and supply costs. Policies to use subsidisation of this nature may arise for a variety of socio-political reasons including help for low income households, and, as the IMF suggests, the degree of distortion from the equilibrium price may be considerable. We are careful in this paper not to use the term welfare optimum to identify the second-best outcome that arises from the countervailing forces of market power and subsidy because we have not explicitly included estimates of the social cost of carbon.Footnote 2 These would be needed if the aim was to pin down the welfare optimal outcome. For a sound and comprehensive treatment of that approach, see Parry et al. (2014). A major consensus in the fuel subsidy literature is that they distort prices and lead to socially inefficient levels of consumption (e.g. Davis 2014; Coady et al. 2017). First, they constitute a drain on government budgets, often resulting in scale imbalances. Second, they stimulate the overconsumption of oil resources, thereby limiting global efforts towards reducing greenhouse emissions. Third, the overconsumption arising from fuel subsidies indicate misallocation of scarce resources.Footnote 3 Finally, fossil fuel subsidies encourage the “lock-in” for fossil-based technologies by limit the adoption of more efficient (low-carbon) technologies since they lower the opportunity cost of fossil fuels below consumers’ willingness to pay.Footnote 4 On the other hand, a large body of evidence in the industrial organization literature indicates that the excessive mark-up arising from the exercise of market power results in producer cost inefficiency and the loss of consumer surplus (e.g. Martin 1988; Delis and Tsionas 2009). However, conservationists prefer the excessive mark-up over cost as a necessary condition for capturing the external cost of environmental damage from fossil fuel consumption (see Medlock 2011). Although higher prices might eliminate overconsumption and internalise the negative externality arising from pollution, deadweight losses can also arise from excessive mark-ups (Newbery 1995). The price distortion due to market power in fuel supply is only aligned with the environmental cost signal if it exceeds any market power distortion that applies to prices in general. While we do not have specific evidence on this, retail petroleum supply is widely recognised to be dominated by large scale private and state-owned companies. It is also the case in many developing countries that retail petroleum prices are administered through state owned suppliers which may pursue both revenue-raising and socio-political goals. This factor could offset the market power impact and, if so, would contribute towards any finding that the subsidy effect dominated the market power effect in the determination of the price signals.Footnote 5 Given the presence of these two market distortions (subsidies and market power); the problem facing the social plannerFootnote 6 is well encapsulated in some salient questions: is there a countervailing offset from these two opposing forces? Can these two offsetting distortions conceivably achieve a second-best optimum? What is the net impact of these two distortions? The intention in the paper is to investigate this trade-off between the upward pressure on fuel prices from exercise of market power and the downward pressure from fuel subsidies, recognising that both effects have an impact on the demand for emission-creating fuel. Thus, the emissions impact is left implicit rather than being treated as an explicit emissions-directed policy.Footnote 7 Since we have not attempted to take marginal external costs in the form of the social cost of carbon into account as well as the subsidy and market power aspects, we must be clear that the analysis in this paper is about the trade-off between fuel price subsidy and market power alone. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to investigate the extent to which a subsidy to reduce the fuel price moves the economy away from the first best equilibrium that would prevail in the absence of market power. If market power is present as well then this may reduce the divergence from the optimum arising from a subsidy, if the market power effect stands in for what would be the impact of tax to reflect marginal external cost. This potential trade-off is essentially reflected by the plots in Fig. 1, which illustrates the relationship between petroleum subsidy share of GDP and petroleum-related carbon emissions in 2013. As seen in Fig. 1, there is a positive correlation between emissions from petroleum use and fuel subsidies, demonstrating that high welfare-based petroleum subsidies are not compatible with fossil-related emissions reduction. Petroleum Subsidy % of GDP versus Carbon Emissions in 2013 A necessary condition for the design of policy instruments and interventions in energy markets is a clear understanding of the interaction between jointly reinforcing market failures. Second, understanding the trade-off between these market distortions provides valuable insight on the potential net effect of policy interventions. This is because policies targeted at one market failure may affect the outcome of policies required to address the other. To answer the interrelated questions above, we derive a price setting model for gasoline across developing countries which embodies fuel consumption subsidies and market concentration. Our aim is to provide a joint estimation of these market distortions and the implicit trade-off between both forces. As far as is known, this study is the first to assess the trade-off in gasoline markets in this way, and it is a timely contribution to the ongoing discussion on the low-carbon development of emerging economies. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects a 50% rise in transport sector emissions by 2030, relative to 2015 levels; driven mainly by regional shifts in transport energy use.Footnote 8 This study therefore assesses two of the critical determinants of these regional shifts. To give a flavour of our approach, petroleum subsidies will be measured as the difference between domestic retail fuel prices and international spot prices, adjusted for transport, distribution and retail costs, while marginal supply cost is the ex-refinery price similarly adjusted; both variables are sourced from the IMF. Our empirical strategy embodies an instrumental variable (IV) system of equations where we combine a demand model with a model of supply aspects of the market. We are able to identify three important parameters: (i) a parameter representing the impact of gasoline subsidies (ii) a market conduct parameter to capture the role of market concentration, and (iii) the semi-elasticity of demand, to account for consumer behaviour. Our empirical tests are based on a comprehensive data set for 68 developing countries, covering the period 2000–2013.Footnote 9 We provide econometric evidence that the distortions arising from petroleum subsidies far exceed the inefficiency resulting from market concentration. Specifically, the subsidy effect is more than four times the market power mark-up. These fuel subsidy distortions are consistent with our finding of some incomplete cost pass-through into retail gasoline prices, which we estimate at 0.67 in the short run and 0.84 in the long run, i.e. after the elapse of 5 years. The short-run estimate is significantly different from one at the one percent significance level, but the long-run estimate is not. Underlying our findings is the instrumentation for gasoline subsidies, which reveals the overbearing influence of the equity objectives of oil-producing countries, which are fulfilled by endowment distribution through end-use petroleum subsidies. Our results therefore indicate that the deadweight loss from policy failure far exceeds the inefficiency losses arising from market failure/mispricing. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a review of related literature on pass-through and market power. Sections 3, 4 and 5 describe the theoretical model, the estimation strategy and estimation issues. Section 6 describes our data set, while Sect. 7 contains the econometric results and study findings. Section 8 concludes.",3

These services are, however, threatened by continuing degradation of the environment and impacted by eutrophication and coastal erosion, among others. Consequently, policies such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; EU 2008) have been put in place to sustain and improve environmental conditions. However, the effectiveness of measures is disputed and future developments remain unclear. In this nexus of impacts, environmental responses, and policy measures, it is important to evaluate how the citizens of the riparian countries might be affected by changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we focus on the question of how potential future changes in environmental conditions affect the recreational benefits provided by the Baltic Sea. We employ the contingent behavior (CB) method for valuing their potential changes due to improvements and deteriorations in environmental conditions in three riparian countries of the Baltic Sea (Finland, Germany, and Latvia). The CB method is an extension of the travel cost (TC) method, employed predominantly to determine the recreational benefits of natural sites. While the TC method is restricted to valuing recreational benefits under current conditions, the CB method allows evaluating changes outside of the range observed today (Eiswerth et al. 2000; Englin and Cameron 1996). The CB method builds on reported recreational behavior in the past and future recreational behavior contingent on scenarios of varying environmental conditions. Consequently, it combines revealed and stated preference techniques employed in environmental economics to evaluate the welfare impacts of environmental changes. There are numerous stated preference valuation studies on water quality, also in the context of the Baltic Sea (e.g., Nieminen et al. 2019; Pakalniete et al. 2017; Ahtiainen et al. 2014; Kosenius 2010). However, there are fewer revealed preference studies for valuing water quality changes (Czajkowski et al. 2015) and the number of CB studies is limited, in particular in the context of water quality changes with only one study referring to the Baltic Sea (Lankia et al. 2019). Existing CB studies focus mostly on other decision contexts than changes in marine water quality, such as changing access to recreation sites (Barry et al. 2011; Rolfe and Dyack 2011), water levels (Eiswerth et al. 2000), catch rates (Alberini et al. 2007), and reef quality (Kragt et al. 2009, Bhat 2003). Moreover, they mostly rely on on-site sampling for single sites and account for changes of only one environmental attribute in the CB scenarios (e.g., Barry et al. 2011; Rolfe and Dyack 2011; Kragt et al. 2009). Exceptions are Hanley et al. (2003) and Lankia et al. (2019). While the former study investigates the effects of bacteriological contamination along Scotland’s south-west coast, the latter focuses on swimming activities in Finland using water clarity and sliminess as indicators for water quality. In both studies, several sites are pooled and treated as one generic site. If several sites are pooled, the reference environmental quality, i.e., the status quo (SQ), is likely to differ between recreation sites.Footnote 1 However, information on the SQ at the visited site is a prerequisite to value environmental changes. Both Hanley et al. (2003) and Lankia et al. (2019) use perception data, i.e., the respondent’s own assessment of the current environmental state, to construct the SQ quality, which is then individual-specific. We extend this literature in at least three directions. First, we examine preference asymmetries for improvements and deteriorations of environmental quality in the CB setting. In previous CB studies, only Lankia et al. (2019) have examined asymmetric preferences. However, they only had two water quality attributes which were combined into a single variable with three levels (poor, intermediate, and good) in the analysis. They did not find asymmetric preferences for improvements and deteriorations for the combined variable. In the choice experiment literature, a few studies have incorporated individual-specific SQs and asymmetric modeling (Ahtiainen et al. 2015; Glenk 2011; Masiero and Hensher 2010; Lanz et al. 2010; Hess et al. 2008), finding consistent evidence of asymmetric preferences. We build on this literature and assess the relative importance of five environmental attributes (water clarity, blue-green algal blooms, algae onshore, number of bird, plant, and fish species, and facilities at the site) taking asymmetric effects of improvements and deteriorations of the individual attributes into account. This has, to the best of our knowledge, not been emphasized and analyzed in such detail before in revealed preference studies. Second, pooling several sites in a TC or CB analysis implies that the visited site needs to be specified by the respondents. In earlier TC or CB studies pooling several sites, respondents only provided information about the perceived quality of a site without locating it explicitly (e.g., Lankia et al. 2019). Other studies use the postal code of the area where the recreational visit took place to locate the site (Czajkowski et al. 2015), which is associated with uncertainties about the exact location of the site. Hanley et al. (2003) use the names of the beaches to specify the visited sites, which is feasible only due to the relatively small number of beaches considered in the study. Overall, there is a tendency in former pooled TC and CB studies that the spatial location of the recreation site is only coarsely defined. We used specific survey software called Maptionnaire with an integrated mapping tool for collecting the survey data. This allowed our respondents to interactively specify their residence and recreation sites directly on an online map, which enabled us to determine distances between the place of residence and recreation sites. Finally, although there are a number of valuation studies for the Baltic Sea area, these are mostly stated preference studies (for recent reviews see Sagebiel et al. 2016 and Bertram and Rehdanz 2013). Considering revealed preference studies, there is only one recent TC study in the context of the Baltic Sea area (Czajkowski et al. 2015); earlier TC studies include Vesterinen et al. (2010), Soutukorva (2005), and Söderqvist et al. (2005). We extend this literature by estimating recreational benefits provided by the Baltic Sea based on the CB method. This allows us to evaluate changes in environmental conditions beyond the observed state in a revealed preference setting. We do so by providing estimates of recreational benefits separately for three riparian countries of the Baltic Sea, namely for Finland, Germany, and Latvia, which also allows for country-wide comparisons of recreational behavior. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the data and study design including survey design and implementation, information on the environmental attributes and CB scenarios, as well as information on the calculation of travel costs. In Sect. 3, we present the econometric approach before we move to the presentation of the results in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, we discuss the results and conclude.",13

Welfare Effects of Real-Time Retail Pricing Under Carbon Taxation and Variable Renewable Electricity Supply,January 2020,Christian Gambardella,Michael Pahle,Wolf-Peter Schill,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Facing the challenge to accommodate increasing shares of variable renewable electricity supply, regulators, academia and practitioners consider price-responsive demand as an integral part of low-carbon power markets (Joskow 2012; Kopsakangas et al. 2012; Mills and Wiser 2014; ACER 2014; CEER 2014; IEA 2016; BMWi 2016; The White House 2016; CAISO 2017). Several jurisdictions in the U.S. and Europe with different renewable supply shares have started to roll out advanced metering infrastructure at large scale, or are planning to do so. While this would technically allow consumers to receive and respond to price signals in real time, it is unclear at what stage of renewable market penetration the resulting benefits would outweigh the related costs. This paper analyzes how and why the gross welfare gains from implementing real-time pricing could change under carbon emissions taxation and growing variable renewable supply shares. While the majority of electricity consumers usually faces time-invariant retail prices, introducing real-time retail pricing that reflects the temporal variation in the marginal costs of electricity supply is often found to result in significant allocative efficiency gains (Borenstein and Holland 2005; Borenstein 2005; Holland and Mansur 2006; Joskow and Tirole 2007; Allcott 2011, 2012). It seems likely, however, that these gross welfare gains would be outweighed in many markets by the relatively high upfront costs of advanced metering infrastructure as well as by the related transaction costs, deeming the large-scale roll-out of real-time retail pricing inefficient (Leautier 2014). The market penetration of variable renewable energy technologies (VRE) such as wind or solar is widely assumed to change this in part because of the projected increase of wholesale price volatility, which is seen to drive the welfare loss from consuming either “too little” or “too much” under common flat retail rate schemes (Allcott 2011; Borenstein 2012; Leautier 2014; Mills and Wiser 2014; ACER 2014; IEA 2016). We quantify the change in the potential gross welfare gains from introducing real-time retail pricing (RTP) for different carbon taxes and variable renewable market penetration rates. We investigate the economic mechanisms underlying these changes and whether they are associated with wholesale price volatility as common intuition would suggest. To do so, we simulate long-run market equilibria, applying a deterministic electricity market model following Borenstein and Holland (2005), which mimics a competitive wholesale and retail market with exogenous shares of real-time and flat-priced consumers. Our model adaptation includes endogenous investment in variable renewable generation technologies, which is induced through taxing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel technologies. We calibrate the model to German market data using long-run projections about technology-specific cost parameters. We conduct a comparative static welfare analysis of varying RTP consumer shares, carbon taxes and renewable supply shares in total annual electricity supply. Our research complements related studies which ignore the welfare effects of RTP between zero and very high renewable supply shares and thus do not account for different stages of renewable market penetration (Chao 2011; Kopsakangas et al. 2012; Fell and Linn 2013; Brouwer et al. 2016). Our main finding suggests that the welfare gains from real-time pricing change in a U-shaped fashion with the carbon tax. Contrary to common intuition, this means that high shares of variable renewable electricity supply do not necessarily imply high welfare gains from introducing RTP (cf. Mills and Wiser 2014). For a wide range of carbon tax scenarios, we find that these welfare gains can actually be higher in cases where carbon taxation does not induce renewable supply compared to cases where carbon taxes and renewable supply shares are relatively high. Hence, given that introducing real-time pricing in conventional electricity markets may result in net losses when accounting for related infrastructure costs, as found by Leautier (2014), for instance, current roll-out plans for smart meters in U.S. and EU markets might be too optimistic about the renewable supply share at which real-time pricing is becoming net beneficial. Moreover, while wholesale price volatility is an important driver of the potential welfare gains from real-time pricing, our results suggest that it does not fully explain the observed changes of welfare gains across different carbon tax scenarios. Specifically, welfare gains can be comparatively low even if wholesale price volatility is comparatively high and vice versa. Hence, to the extent that smart meter roll-out policies are based on the expectation that price volatility has sufficiently increased and that it is the sole driver of efficiency gains from time-based pricing schemes, these policies might be misguided (cf. Allcott 2011; Borenstein 2012; Leautier 2014; ACER 2014; IEA 2016). We instead illustrate that the U-shaped change in the welfare gains from real-time pricing closely follows the changing inefficiency arising from “under-consumption”. That is, the extent to which flat-priced consumers consume “too little” during low-price periods changes with the carbon tax and renewable supply share. Specifically, we can show that the average level of under-consumption initially decreases with the carbon tax and increases again as soon as it induces market entry of wind and solar capacity. Changes in the levels of under-consumption result from a shift in the wholesale price distribution towards a higher mean, combined with an increasing incidence of zero-prices as soon as renewable technologies enter the market. As a result, the inefficiency arising from under-consumption gradually increases, leading to gradually increasing welfare gains from RTP. Initially, however, carbon emission taxation leads to a more elastic aggregate supply curve, since the marginal costs of carbon-intensive and less carbon-intensive fossil-fuel technologies converge. This results in lower retail price spreads and thus also decreasing welfare gains from adopting real-time pricing. The paper proceeds as follows.

In the canonical form, the regulator has to set the policy before the realization of the cost shock and rank the alternative instruments, e.g. a Pigouvian tax or an emissions quota, based on their expected welfare performance. Whether one instrument dominates over the other depends on the relative slopes of the marginal benefit and marginal damage curves. Such an information structure provides a relatively accurate description for many real world policies, such as those in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), where the regulator must set the cap for the next regulation period before knowing the true abatement cost realization. To complicate matters, banking of allowances is also a typical feature of emission trading systems. Using a two-period model setup, the prices versus quantities approach has been applied to determine the conditions for intertemporal trading of allowances, i.e., banking and borrowing, to improve expected welfare relative to taxes and no-banking cap-and-trade systems (Yates and Cronshaw 2001; Feng and Zhao 2006; Weitzman 2018).Footnote 1 The conclusions from these studies seem somewhat surprising: banking and borrowing can improve the expected welfare outcome only if the regulator uses intertemporal trading ratios which are designed to modify the rate of return of banked allowances.Footnote 2 However, such trading ratios are not explicitly used in real world policies. Instead, emission trading systems impose restrictions on borrowing of allowances from future allocations. This creates a policy and theory challenge since it is not fully known how the cap should be set when only banking (saving) of allowances is possible but borrowing is not, and how such restrictions influence the welfare ranking of policies in the prices versus quantities setup. The purpose of our paper is to solve the dynamic policy rules for setting the periodic cap when the regulation problem has an infinite horizon and when banking of allowances is possible (but not borrowing), and to evaluate the welfare performance of the alternative rules. The policy rules are derived from the regulator’s goal of maximizing the net present value of net benefits from the emissions, given that the regulator can set the cap for each period after observing cost realization in the previous period. We use the regulation of flow pollutants as our policy example, with the steepness of marginal damages allowed to vary to represent different pollutants. We furthermore use a simple IID shock process to capture the perpetual uncertainty in marginal benefits which gives rise to stochastic allowance demand and, hence, creates an incentive and opportunity for banking. Banking of allowances complicates the regulation problem in two important ways in the infinite horizon prices versus quantities setup. First, it raises the question of time consistency of the policy plan, which stems from the information structure of the regulation game (Lintunen and Kuusela 2018). Namely, the decision to save allowances depends on the expectations of the allowance price in the next period; however, the next period’s allowance price depends on the regulator’s cap decision which is set after the banking decision has been made. Hence, before actually deciding the cap for the next period, the regulator may want to directly influence the price expectations to further control the emissions outcome in the current period. However, such a policy is not time consistent since the regulator may have an incentive to deviate from the plan at some subsequent point in time (Groot et al. 2003). To credibly steer the price expectations, the regulator has to be able to commit to the cap rule. Second, the presence of banking motives separates the allowance market realizations into two distinct contingencies: one where the emissions cap is binding and one where it is not. By a binding cap, we refer to a market outcome where all available allowances are used in the current period and hence no allowances are saved to be used in the subsequent period. A non-binding cap refers to a situation where some share of the available allowances are banked and not used in the current period. Whether the cap binds or not in any given period will be a stochastic outcome that is influenced by the regulator’s policy and by the strength of the banking demand. While the possibility of a binding cap may first seem unlikely, we show that these two possible outcomes are integral features of the regulator’s dynamic policy rules. In fact, the dynamic adjustments to allowance injections prevent the accumulation of allowance surpluses and hence support the possibility of binding outcomes.Footnote 3 The main contribution of our paper is to derive a policy rule that relies on the regulator’s ability to commit to a cap in the presence of allowance banking demand, and to compare its welfare performance to three alternative policy instruments. The first alternative is the time consistent policy rule with banking, which we formulate as a purely forward looking Markov perfect solution. Markov policy is consistent by definition since the regulator’s policy is conditional only on the current state of the regulation game (e.g. Groot et al. 2003). We show that the regulator’s commitment solution and the Markov solution differ mainly in the way they account for possible shock contingencies. The commitment regulator takes into account all shock contingencies, whereas the Markov regulator simply disregards the non-binding shock contingencies when choosing the optimal cap. Hence, the commitment policy provides a better expected welfare outcome since the regulator controls both binding and non-binding market outcomes. The two other alternative instruments are an emissions tax and a cap-and-trade without banking. The regulator’s credibility and the ability to commit to a policy rule, or lack thereof, have been identified as important determinants of environmental policy outcomes (Helm et al. 2003; Brunner et al. 2012; Ulph and Ulph 2013; Jakob and Brunner 2014). In studies of banking and borrowing, on the other hand, the regulator’s commitment has been an explicit, but often overlooked, assumption (Yates and Cronshaw 2001; Newell et al. 2005; Feng and Zhao 2006). Lintunen and Kuusela (2018) have recently characterized the consistent policy in a cap-and-trade system with banking that is subject to persistent business cycle shocks.Footnote 4 However, their results focus on the constant marginal damage case, where the Pigovian tax is always preferable to a quantity-based instrument, and they do not solve the model with commitment. The present paper focuses on the general case where marginal benefits and damages are important determinants of the welfare ranking of the different environmental policies. The above features also set our paper apart from a related body of research on credibility and commitment in environmental policies (Ulph and Ulph 2013; Jakob and Brunner 2014). Most importantly, the role of banking has not been included in previous studies focusing on policy commitment. Banking of allowances can be understood as a form of forward-looking, speculative storage (e.g. Wright and Williams 1982; Deaton and Laroque 1992). We show that, given the presence of banking motives, the commitment and Markov rules generate a “hybrid policy” with both price and quantity features. The resulting “policy locus” has a form of an inverted L-shape, with the discounted expected price determining the horizontal part and the cap determining the vertical part. The horizontal part forms an endogenous price floor which becomes an essential feature of the dynamic policy rules. The advantage of hybrid policies has been recognized and modeled at least since Roberts and Spence (1976) and Weitzman (1978). This literature typically finds that hybrid policy instruments, by combining elements of price-based and quantity-based regulation, can improve the expected outcomes from regulation (Pizer 2002; Grüll and Taschini 2011; Mandell 2008; Burtraw et al. 2010; Fell and Morgenstern 2010; Wood and Jotzo 2011; Fell et al. 2012a). Previous research has recognized that banking of allowances for future use is another form of a safety valve (Newell and Pizer 2003a; Newell et al. 2005).Footnote 5 However, a formal analysis of the optimal hybrid policy with endogenous price floor is missing in the prices versus quantities literature. Recently, Weitzman (2018) finds using a two-period model with additively separable damages that it is never optimal to allow banking and borrowing of allowances, since either a tax or a cap without intertemporal trading is always more efficient. Feng and Zhao (2006) show that the option to bank and borrow allowances enhances welfare when the marginal benefits are steeper than the marginal damages. However, for this result to hold requires the design and use of intertemporal trading ratios. In contrast to these studies, we demonstrate that a cap-and-trade system with banking but no borrowing can in fact dominate alternative policy instruments, even without such trading ratios. This occurs in pollutant cases where the marginal benefits and marginal damages have similar slopes in absolute terms. Such dominance holds for both the commitment rule and the time consistent Markov policy. The difference of our results in comparison to previous findings is explained by the non-linear policy locus in our model that can mimic the marginal damage function better than simple price and quantity instruments. The welfare effect of allowing banking but not borrowing has also been analyzed in a related paper by Fell et al. (2012b). They conduct a welfare analysis based on optimal firm decisions under uncertainty while the allowance allocation path, i.e. the emissions cap, is exogenously given. We depart from this by identifying and solving the regulator’s periodic allowance allocation rule both with and without commitment. Using quadratic benefit and damage functions, we demonstrate how the optimal banking policies operate and highlight the important determinants of the policies, such as the discount rate and the degree of uncertainty in the shock process. For example, we show that the commitment solution tries to keep the expected emissions at the same level as an optimal tax or a cap-and-trade policy without banking. Our welfare comparisons reveal that the banking policy with commitment is never the worst instrument (but in some instances equally bad as the worst alternative), whereas the Markov policy can become the worst instrument when marginal damages have a steep slope and the discount rate is small. Our results demonstrate the value of commitment which is defined as the welfare advantage of the commitment solution over the Markov solution. Finally, we also show that the commitment cap is greater than the Markov cap in certain contingencies but smaller in others. While we do not focus on analyzing any particular emissions trading system, our modeling work and results provide useful information for interpreting and guiding the developments of real world systems, such as the EU ETS. Recent changes in the EU ETS have emphasized and strengthened rule-based approaches to adjusting the cap in response to business cycle fluctuations (Perino and Willner 2016; Perino 2018).Footnote 6 In principle, such rules function similarly to our dynamic policies. Given the absence of allowance price targets in the EU ETS, such new rules can be characterized to bear more resemblance to the Markov policy in our paper than to the commitment policy. Our results suggest that the value of commitment becomes greater when the market discount rates are low (or when the compliance period is short) and when the degree of uncertainty around the demand shock is high, i.e., when banking demand is expected to be strong. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 first presents a model of speculative banking demand, followed by the regulator’s dynamic policy with and without commitment. Section 3 presents and derives the optimal no-banking cap policy and the emissions tax policy. Section 4 demonstrates and compares the performance of the different instruments using quadratic benefit and damage functions. Section 5 provides a discussion and conclusions.",7

Weitzman,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Abatement of carbon dioxide (\(\hbox {CO}_{2}\)) emissions is today’s premier global public good.Footnote 1 It is difficult enough to resolve a local public goods problem within a jurisdiction having effective governance with an ability to levy payments. But when the problem is international in scope, and where there is no overarching top–down international governance structure, it can render a global public goods problem virtually unsolvable. The key issue here is the notorious free-rider problem. Everyone wants to free ride off the contributions of others. A jurisdiction bears the full costs of its abatement, but it only reaps a fraction of the global benefits. The result is a non-cooperative selfish equilibrium where everyone abates far less than would be socially desirable in a cooperative solution. The key issue is that it takes a strong government to enforce a socially desirable cooperative solution. In the global arena there is no such strong international government with powers to assign \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions targets and enforce penalties for non-compliance. Reduced to its core essence, the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) is strictly a bottom–up voluntary agreement based on a periodically repeated ‘pledge and review’ process. Just before a performance period, at the end of the previous performance period, each country volunteers a ‘nationally determined contribution’ (NDC) for its own \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions. After a performance period (5 years), actual emissions should be reported but there are no penalties for a country not complying with its own volunteered NDC. In this sense the Paris Agreement is doubly voluntary: The self-announced pledges are strictly voluntary in the first place, and compliance with the previous self-announced pledges in the performance period is also strictly voluntary. The Agreement talks about developed countries aiding developing countries with financial support for ‘sustainability’ based on climate mitigation and adaptation, but the cash flows have thus far been meager. Not surprisingly, there has been broad take-up of such a strictly voluntary agreement. Before the U.S. dropped out, the Paris Agreement nominally covered countries accounting for some 97 per cent of world \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions (see e.g. Chen 2017). There is widespread acknowledgement that the highly under-ambitious NDCs actually named are not nearly enough to keep global warming on a track below the stated goal of no more than a worldwide average temperature increase of \(2\,^{\circ }\hbox {C}\) (see e.g. Levin and Fransen 2015). On the positive side, the Paris Agreement has highlighted the importance to the international community of dealing with climate change. And it encourages credibly transparent standards of reporting, monitoring, and verification by each participating country, which is a necessary first step for any accord. The Paris Agreement also contains a commitment for countries to pledge, review, and re-pledge new intended NDCs periodically (every 5 years), hopefully inspiring ever-greater levels of NDC ambition over time (Paragraphs 4.8–4.9). What is the underlying ‘model’ of human behavior that might allow the Paris Agreement to be seen as a step toward a resolution of the climate-change externality? There appears to be an implicit assumption here that \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) polluters will significantly drive down their emissions voluntarily based largely on altruism and ‘blame and shame’ from others, without any top–down setting of emissions targets or enforcement of penalties for non-compliance. If only everyone followed the full golden rule, the global-warming problem could be solved. The Paris Agreement might then be seen as a first tentative step toward demonstrating the spirit of golden-rule-like behavior, which might hopefully inspire further steps toward even more golden-rule-like behavior by inspiring ever-more-ambitious NDC targets in a virtuous circle. There seems to be little question but that some jurisdictions throughout the world have gone beyond the most narrow definition of pure self-interest in proposing relatively more ambitious emissions targets, even if this level of ambition still falls well short of full golden-rule behavior. Altruism may thus help somewhat, and is to be encouraged, although it remains to see whether and to what extent ambitious emission targets will be met. Generally, most economists would express at least partial skepticism about the golden-rule model because it is typically difficult to resolve free-rider problems by altruism alone. This paper goes to the opposite extreme of altruistic behavior by examining the consequences of a model of pure self interest. A jurisdictional cap-and-trade system assigns allowances of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) caps to emitters within a jurisdiction and then allows (or even encourages) internal free trade in permits. Total emissions of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) must equal the sum of all allocated caps. Regulators of a cap-and-trade system can thus control the total amount of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions within their jurisdiction by controlling the sum of all allocated caps. As economists have long emphasized, a cap-and-trade system is cost effective because it minimizes total abatement costs for each chosen level of total \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions via ensuring that every emitter in the jurisdiction sets its marginal cost of abatement equal to the equilibrium price of permits. Economists have typically advocated linkage of different cap-and-trade jurisdictions by rough analogy with the beneficial linkage of free-trade areas and on the more specific basis that this will ensure cost effectiveness among the linked jurisdictions.Footnote 2 An unlinked cap-and-trade system guarantees cost effectiveness only within its own jurisdiction. A linked cap-and-trade system goes further by also ensuring cost effectiveness among the linked jurisdictions taken as a whole. The argument for linkage based on cost effectiveness might make sense when there is an overall top–down governance structure that can force Pareto-improving side payments among the linked participants. But absent such a powerful overall governance structure, this cost-effectiveness argument in a strictly voluntary cap-and-trade system loses its force. Cap-and-trade jurisdictions that have linked their cap-and-trade systems will issue their own voluntary caps on the basis of a host of domestic political-economy considerations including, prominently, self interest. Narrow self interest, which is being modeled in this paper as if it were the sole motivation, will cause linked jurisdictions to pay relatively little attention to what is for them a strictly hypothetical argument about minimization of overall compliance costs. Be that as it may, there is a widespread feeling among most economists that linking cap-and-trade jurisdictions is a good idea. The generally favorable attitude toward linking has found its way into the Paris Agreement. Paragraph 6.2 of the agreement outlines a framework for recognizing traded obligations (called ‘internationally transferred mitigation outcomes’) so that double counting is avoided because a party to the agreement is allowed to include traded reductions undertaken by another party to count toward the first party’s NDC. Paragraph 6.3 states that: ‘The use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes to achieve nationally determined contributions under this Agreement shall be voluntary and authorized by participating parties’. The inclusion of articles 6.2 and 6.3 opens the door to linking cap-and-trade systems (or, indeed, any market-based mechanisms). While linking may give some jurisdictions incentives to choose more ambitious caps, it could also give other jurisdictions incentives to choose less ambitious caps. It is a seeming paradox that cap-and-trade among the parties to the Paris Agreement might lead to even higher emissions. If linking cap-and-trade systems does little more than replace one non-cooperative equilibrium with another, it will still be a far cry from the more cooperative outcome that might accompany a genuine international governance structure. The insight that linking voluntary cap-and-trade systems may lead to higher levels of pollution emissions is not new.Footnote 3 The most complete rigorous analysis of this possibility is the pioneering work of Helm (2003), who models both unlinked and linked cap-and-trade systems as a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium among self-interested countries. With a fairly general treatment of environmental pollution damages, he finds that overall effects on total emissions are ambiguous and he derives moderately complicated conditions for when pollution is increased or decreased by linking. He addresses some additional results with the use of quadratic abatement costs functions. In the present analysis all theoretical results are based on quite general assumptions about abatement cost functions. In the theoretical analysis we found it desirable to stick to this assumption because there is lack of an empirical basis for the assumption that quadratic cost functions represent a realistic approximation. However, an appropriate and widely accepted specification for the damages of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions within a relatively short (5–10 year) period is that marginal damages are constant for each jurisdiction (although they can differ among jurisdictions). With this defensible assumption, which the existing literature has not yet focused upon, the analysis is significantly clarified and yields simple closed-form expressions for all (linked and unlinked) \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) permit prices. Some sharp insights are then available. How a linked jurisdiction sets its voluntary caps relative to actual emissions (and whether the jurisdiction buys or sells \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) permits) is fully characterized by a simple linear proportionality condition that depends only on the difference between the jurisdiction’s marginal damages and the average marginal damages of the entire linked system. Some implications for linked and unlinked voluntary \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) cap-and-trade systems are derived and discussed. The theoretical analysis and its implications are illustrated with a numerical example. In this part of the paper we have specified the abatement cost functions as quadratic while the marginal damages are constant (as in the theoretical parts).",13

Failing to do so will result in climate change, associated with significant economic and social damages (e.g. IPCC 2014; Nordhaus 2006; Stern 2007). Acknowledgement by governments of the need to reduce emissions has recently resulted in an international agreement to limit the average temperature increase to two degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels (United Nations 2015). Passenger car transportation is a major contributor of harmful emissions. As the fleet of passenger cars remains running predominantly on gasoline and diesel, the sector accounted for 12% of total emissions in the European Union in 2016 (EEA 2018). Moreover, while total emissions have fallen since 1990 in every other sector, emissions in transport have increased by 17% since then (EEA 2018). In order to reverse this trend, governments in many parts of the world have implemented a number of policy measures. Within the EU, \(\hbox {CO}_2\) standards are imposed on car manufacturers and a \(\hbox {CO}_2\)-labelling scheme has been introduced to inform car buyers about the emissions of cars. On a national level, governments have introduced a variety of measures, including \(\hbox {CO}_2\) taxes on the purchase of cars, taxes on fossil fuels, fuel-blending requirements for renewable fuels and subsidies on alternative-fuel cars, often combined with each other. Despite all these measures, 97% of the existing EU fleet in 2016 and 91% of the new cars in the Netherlands in 2018 were gasoline and diesel cars (ACEA 2018). It is clear that the market for clean cars remains underdeveloped but the question is to what extent this can be attributed to the preferences of consumers for polluting cars. At least two other reasons hamper the development of the market for clean cars. The first is an information asymmetry problem. In the EU, consumers obtain information about the level of a car’s emissions through \(\hbox {CO}_2\) labels, which are based on laboratory measurements (Haq and Weiss 2016). It is becoming increasingly apparent that real-world emissions of cars deviate from lab-tested emissions and that this gap has increased over time (Fontaras et al. 2017), partly caused by cheating behaviour on the emission measurements by some car manufacturers (Paton 2015). As a result, these labels are untrustworthy and, therefore, consumers may not express their intrinsic willingness to pay (WTP) for clean cars in the market. The second reason is caused by the fact that alternative-fuel cars remain emerging technologies. In addition to a limited number of models to choose from, consumers worry about the unavailability of refuelling stations for alternative fuels (Ziegler 2012; Hackbarth and Madlener 2016) and long refuelling times in case of electric vehicles (Egbue and Long 2012; Hackbarth and Madlener 2016). This leads these type of cars not to be considered as serious alternatives to many consumers. To be able to assess the potential for emission reductions in passenger car transport, the intrinsic willingness to pay of consumers needs to be understood. Studies that have assessed the WTP of consumers for cars with lower emissions find a wide range of estimates. These studies include Hackbarth and Madlener (2016), Achtnicht (2012), Tanaka et al. (2014) and Hidrue et al. (2011), where the last two focus only on electric cars. These studies report a WTP a one-time premium ranging from €5 to €1432 to reduce a vehicles emissions by 1% (Hackbarth and Madlener 2013, 2016; Tanaka et al. 2014; Hidrue et al. 2011) or from €13 to €127 to reduce a vehicles emissions with 1g of \(\hbox {CO}_2\) per kilometre for the median person (Achtnicht 2012). This translates to minimum estimates of the WTP per tonne of \(\hbox {CO}_2\) of €89 and €256 for two reference groups (Achtnicht 2012). Also related to this paper are studies that use various other applications to study the valuation of consumers for climate change mitigation. These include Alberini et al. (2018) and Longo et al. (2008) (policy scenarios), Roe et al. (2001) (green electricity), Brouwer et al. (2008) and MacKerron et al. (2009) (airfare), and Löschel et al. (2013) and Diederich and Goeschl (2014) (EU ETS). The estimates of these studies for the WTP to reduce \(\hbox {CO}_2\) emissions by one tonne range from €6 to $967 (approximately €780).Footnote 1 An overview of the estimates for \(\hbox {CO}_2\) emission reductions in the stated-preference literature is included in Alberini et al. (2018). In contrast to the previously mentioned studies, Bigerna et al. (2017) estimate the WTP for emissions based on revealed preference data (converted from elasticities of demand for conventional fuels) and find a mean WTP of €7 per tonne. Almost all papers that study the WTP within transport estimate the WTP for clean cars, except for Achtnicht (2012). From a policy perspective, however, it is more relevant to know the WTP for emission reductions because it are the emissions that lead to climate change and should therefore be targeted by policies. Not surprisingly, the benefits of climate change mitigation policies are typically denoted as the avoided damages in euros/dollars per tonne of emissions (i.e. the social cost of carbon). This paper investigates the preferences of consumers for emission reductions in passenger car transport. Our main research question is: how much are consumers willing to pay to reduce \(\hbox {CO}_2\) emissions in passenger car transport? In addition, based on our WTP estimates, we specifically investigate the distribution of the WTP for hybrids, a promising clean car type. Lastly, we want to understand the socio-economic factors that contribute to the heterogeneity in preferences for emissions, and the implied required pay-back period for lower fuel costs. The contribution of this paper is the estimation of the WTP for emission reductions in passenger car transport, expressed in euros per tonne of emissions (which is the conventional unit of measure in the climate policy debate). We follow a similar approach as Achtnicht (2012) but this paper uses a somewhat different method to translate the WTP for clean cars into WTP for emission reductions. Also, this paper makes an important different assumption about the distribution of the WTP for emissions, generally leading to more realistic WTP estimates. In addition, we have detailed socio-economic information about respondents that we relate to preferences for emission reductions, including income, age, gender and education. Lastly, we investigate the stated preferences for hybrids based on two real-life cars and compare the stated preferences with actual vehicle sales records. We analyse preferences by adopting a discrete-choice experiment. Participants make trade-offs between cars that differ in four attributes: the purchase price, emissions, fuel type and fuel costs. Our sample consists of 1471 participants that represent the Dutch adult population with the intention to buy a passenger car. Participants were confronted with 10 choice questions, resulting in 14,638 observed choices. Choices are modelled based on a mixed logit approach to take into account that preferences may vary between individuals (Train 1998). In addition, the paper uses the WTP estimates to analyse the driving costs of and WTP for two real-life hybrids that are also available in a nearly identical gasoline version. We find a strong preference for emission reductions in passenger car transport. Our main estimate of the WTP for emission reductions equals €199 per tonne. In addition, the majority of consumers appears to be willing to pay at least the prevailing market premium for two selected hybrid cars. This implies a large potential for emission reductions in passenger car transport. We also find considerable differences in preferences amongst socio-economic groups along the lines of age, gender and education but not income. Finally, the results suggest that the average consumer has a short implicitly required pay-back period for expenditure on a vehicle’s fuel cost attribute. For government policy, our findings suggest that policies that successfully reduce information asymmetry in passenger car transport can make a considerable contribution to achieving emission reductions. The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical framework. In Sect. 3, we describe the methods that we applied, particularly the set-up of the choice experiment, survey design and data. Section 4 provides the result. Finally, Sect. 5 provides the discussion and conclusion.",13

The field environmental and resource economics started to take off. That is to say, resource economics was already an old respectable field, with a revival in the early seventies, but now the societal concern for environmental problems was increasing. In the USA, the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists was founded earlier in 1979, and their flagship Journal of Environmental Economics and Management existed since 1974. The European scientists could have simply joined this association, but this was also the time of an increased interest in European academic cooperation. Up to that time, European scientists had contacts within their own country and with colleagues in the USA, but the contacts with colleagues in other European countries were not very strong. Language was an issue, but also the lack of institutions. When the EAERE was officially announced during the First Annual Conference at the University of Venice in April 1990, it was both a response to the need for developing environmental and resource economics and the need for stronger European cooperation. From the perspective of economics, two lines of history were important. First, economic science had developed a focus on markets and growth, with physical and human capital, but largely ignored the interaction with the natural environment. There have been exceptions, of course, and especially resource economics moved forward in the seventies (Dasgupta and Heal 1979). Second, societal concern in the first decennia after the Second World War focused on restructuring the economies and alleviating poverty, but it was interesting to see that many people already felt that an important issue was missing. For example, Jan Tinbergen, who received together with Ragnar Frisch the first Prize in Economics in honor of Alfred Nobel in 1969, made essential contributions to economic science, as well as to restructuring the Dutch economy and to establishing aid for the developing countries. However, in the course of his career, he switched his focus to the natural environment (Tinbergen 1987). To take another example, Sicco Mansholt, who was a European Commissioner from 1958 until 1972, founded the successful Common Agricultural Policy. However, after his career, he apologized that he forgot to think about the consequences for the natural environment (see Wikipedia). In the late sixties and early seventies of last century, the political arena also changed. Movements of citizens started to challenge the traditional political parties on a number of issues, such as the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, but also environmental issues in general. The movements very often resulted in green parties in Europe that criticized unlimited growth without environmental concern. They added the dimension of sustainability to the traditional dimensions of capital versus labor, and liberals versus socialists. These movements and new political parties were part of the new challenges to economics. In that time, the main challenge to economics was put forward by the Club of Rome (“The Limits to Growth”, Meadows et al. 1972). Although they formulated a broad environmental concern, the discussion focused on the limited availability of resources. Many economists were less concerned, because they relied on the mechanisms of scarcity, price, lower use and alternatives. That view got support from the outcome of the famous bet between the biologist Paul Ehrlich and the economist Julian Simon (Sabin 2013). Ehrlich could pick 5 resources and a period of time and Simon betted that the inflation-adjusted prices would not have increased, indicating that these resources had not become scarce. Simon won the bet. Of course, this is not capturing the real problem, but it slowed down the response of economics to the challenge. The real question is whether the scale of all the economic activities is compatible with the carrying capacity of the Earth. Furthermore, economics has to take account of the feedbacks of environmental deterioration on, for example, productivity and health, and the direct effects on welfare and life-support systems. Over the last 30 years, the EAERE provides a home for economists who want to work on these issues. However, mainstream economics still ignores the interaction with the natural environment. The same Paul Ehrlich was a plenary speaker at the 15th EAERE Annual Conference in Thessaloniki, Greece, in June 2007. He observed that a long list of typical environmental words had not appeared in any title of the top 146 articles (500 cites or more) in 41 of the most prominent refereed economics journals. There is still a long way to go. The response of economics to these new challenges is slow. Some people, such as the World Bank economist Herman Daly, were very disappointed and they started with ecological economics. In 1989, the International Society for Ecological Economics and their journal Ecological Economics were founded. Ecological economics breaks with mainstream economics and has strong ties with other disciplines and with societal organizations. I remember that a PhD student in political science once asked me if she should take a course in environmental economics or in ecological economics. I asked her what she thought the difference was and she answered: “environmental economics is neo-classical economics with an environmental twist and ecological economics is rooted in passion for the environment”. At the time, this was a widespread view but it is a caricature, of course, and it does not apply anymore. It is true that environmental economics builds on the strengths of the economics profession, but the passion is there as well. Moreover, economics is reaching out now to the other social sciences, and environmental economics also to the natural sciences. On the other hand, ecological economics has opened up to the new developments in economics. The two groups have the same mission, but environmental economics remains a branch of economics in order not to lose the insights and the tools that economics can provide. Karl-Göran Mäler, an environmental economist, and Buzz Holling, an ecologist, took an interesting initiative. They started to organize meetings with top economists and top ecologists in order to bridge the gap between economics and ecology. These meetings, organized by the Beijer Institute in Stockholm, had a profound effect on the research agenda of many of the participants.",

It quickly spread beyond Asia. The policy responses have mostly been lockdowns of varying intensities and durations. Though there have been many national and even international curfews in the past, perhaps most prominently during the Second World War, there are no examples of lockdowns on a global scale deployed to counter the spread of disease. It is wholly novel to force significant proportions of the populations of the major world economies to stay at home, and mostly indoors. This is a large-scale experiment which is and will be modelled by epidemiologists for decades to come. It is also a giant economic and environmental experiment. The world economies went from one state to another very quickly, so it is plausible to argue that everything else remained constant. There has been a very significant reduction in economic activity, very large falls in transport by air, road and railways, and with these have come large falls in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reduced pressure on nature. Since the main effects in the first five months of the pandemic have primarily fallen in the northern hemisphere, this coincides with the breeding season for birds and many mammals and reptiles, and for plants too. There is therefore an opportunity to observe what happens when such an abrupt change happens on a global and local scale, and major parts of the economy cease production. There are at least five sets of research questions. First, what are the short-term impacts and are any of them likely to be enduring? In particular, how great are reductions in global and local GDP and in air pollution? What is the largely anecdotal evidence on the impact of less travel on the wider natural environment, ranging from reduced tourism to less disturbance of wildlife? What do these short-term reductions tell us about the relationship between GDP and emissions? Second, what are the longer-term economic impacts and, in particular, the environmental consequences of the economic shocks and the policy responses to them and the risk of a longer-term recession or even depression? To what extent will monetary and fiscal policy stimuli be increased? Will these include further support for “green deals” and associated spending on greening transport, energy and agriculture? Will the legacy of the coronavirus be a strong or weaker COP26 agreement, higher or lower carbon prices, a carbon border adjustment, or a greater emphasis on a lower cost of energy? Third, what will be the impacts on globalisation, which has been a defining feature of the world economy for the last thirty years? Will concerns about extended supply chains lead to a deceleration of globalisation, or perhaps a decline? How will the effects on globalisation play out in the context of the overall declines in GDP and the policy responses? Would a further decline have positive benefits for the environment? Will the coronavirus encourage reshoring of specific industries, notably agriculture, and a greater emphasis on domestic production of food at the expense of a more environmentally benign use of land? Fourth, what will be the impacts on future generations and how we account for these on the assets they inherit relative to those the current generation is depleting? To what extent will the economic costs of the coronavirus pandemic fall on the next generation and how might these costs impact on the environment? Finally, will there be behavioural changes in attitudes towards the environment? Will the experience of the lockdowns encourage a shift towards a higher valuation of environmental goods and services relative to other components of household budgets, or a retreat towards narrower, short-term economic considerations as a result of the impacts of debt, unemployment and reduced economic prospects, reflecting an old idea that the environment is a luxury good? This paper takes each of these sets of questions in turn. Given how early on in the pandemic this is being written, the evidence continues to emerge and will not be comprehensive for some time to come, and especially for the impacts on nature and wildlife. At this stage, it cannot provide answers, but it can set out the issues behind each of the five sets of questions, and these comprise a comprehensive research agenda for environmental economics as it builds on this unprecedented and unwelcome experiment.",143
76.0,1.0,Environmental and Resource Economics,02 April 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-020-00414-3,Commitment Versus Discretion in Climate and Energy Policy,May 2020,Florian Habermacher,Paul Lehmann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is a long-standing paradigm that economic policy should commit to long-term credible rules for private economic activities to promote economic development. Kydland and Prescott (1977) already emphasized in their seminal paper that the discretion to adjust a policy over time would reduce welfare because it would distort the decisions of forward-looking rational agents at present. However, it has subsequently been emphasized that discretion may also generate economic benefits if policies can be adjusted over time to better reflect initially uncertain future policy costs and benefits, for example in the presence of unforeseen events and shocks (Fisher 1977; Lohmann 1992; Rogoff 1985). Hence, there is a fundamental trade-off between policy commitment and discretion. In this paper, we analyze this trade-off and its implications for optimal decision-making in climate policy. In particular, we shed light on implications for market-based instruments for decarbonization in the power sector. Market-based instruments to reduce CO2 emissions in the power sector may take different forms. First-best approaches price CO2 emissions directly through carbon taxes or carbon trading schemes. Second-best approaches include subsidies for low-carbon power generation technologies, most notably renewable energy sources (RES) (e.g., Kalkuhl et al. 2013; Palmer and Burtraw 2005). Both approaches are widely applied throughout the world, and often combined (REN21 2016; World Bank 2017). Strikingly, existing market-based approaches have followed quite diverse pathways of commitment and discretion. On the one hand, prominent examples like the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) have exhibited moderate degrees of commitment. The EU ETS foresees an explicit long-term trajectory for its carbon cap, with a pre-defined annual reduction of issued allowances by 1.74% until 2020, and 2.2% thereafter (European Commission 2014).Footnote 1 On the other hand, Australia exerted a maximum degree of discretion when it abolished its carbon tax in 2014, just two years after introduction (World Bank 2017). High degrees of discretion have been even more common for RES support schemes. For example, the German feed-in tariff has seen constant adjustments (e.g., Hoppmann et al. 2014; Strunz et al. 2016). Spain constituted an extreme example when it adopted a moratorium on RES support in 2012 (Del Rio and Mir-Artigues 2014). While changes in the best cases only affect new installations (including those already in the process of project preparation), retrospective changes of policy rules for existing RES plants have also been quite frequent in several EU Member States (Fouquet and Nysten 2015). It is unclear to what extent the observed levels of commitment and discretion are welfare-improving or -decreasing, as there may be important trade-offs between commitment and discretion for climate policy. Why is the choice between commitment and discretion ambiguous for climate policy? On the one hand, discretion may open up for opportunistic adjustments to climate policy if the policy announced ex ante is not time-consistent. Policy-makers introduce market-based policies to promote investments into research and development, manufacturing, and deployment of low-carbon technologies, and to generate the corresponding benefits of mitigating climate change. Many of these investments are large-scale, long-lived and largely irreversible—as for most energy-related investments (Neuhoff 2005). Once the investments have been locked in, policy-makers can have an incentive to reduce the ambition of climate policy. Reasons include societal costs (e.g., deadweight losses, administrative costs of market-based policies), distributional concerns (e.g., higher power prices due to market-based policies),Footnote 2 or simply politico-economic attempts to cater for vested interests. For example, unexpectedly high power price increases have been the major driver behind the discretion in RES policy, as observed in Germany and Spain (Del Rio and Mir-Artigues 2014; Strunz et al. 2016). The anticipation of possible future policy adjustments can lead to suboptimal investment decisions of private actors today: Firms foreseeing lower or uncertain levels of political ambition in the future will have an incentive to reduce investments into research, development, and deployment of low-carbon technologies. This is referred to as the hold-up problem (Garnier and Madlener 2016; Nemet et al. 2017; Schleich et al. 2017). In this respect, a high degree of discretion may be viewed critically. A lacking commitment to a long-term climate policy path disincentivizes investments. Thereby, it may impair the decarbonization of the power sector and the attainment of ambitious emission reduction targets. On the other hand, the future benefits and costs of climate policies are equally subject to large uncertainties. These uncertainties imply that the level of ambition chosen ex ante may turn out to be inefficiently low or high ex post, when compared to actual costs and benefits at a future time. Therefore, welfare may be increased if policy makers have the discretion to adjust climate policy as new knowledge becomes available—which has been pointed out for industry policy in general (Rodrik 2014) and climate and energy policy in particular (Aghion et al. 2009; Foxon and Pearson 2008; Nemet et al. 2017). First, important uncertainties are related to the social cost of carbon (Greenstone et al. 2013; Tol 2009). Second, the future development of costs of low-carbon technologies is similarly uncertain. This is, inter alia, due to large variations in observed learning rates (Rubin et al. 2015), and the impossibility to predict technological breakthroughs. Thus, the potential trade-off between commitment and discretion is a highly relevant issue for the optimal design of market-based instruments for climate policy.Footnote 3 Our study addresses the following question: under which conditions should climate policy commitment or discretion be preferred to efficiently promote the investments needed to reduce CO2 emissions? To analyze the trade-off between commitment and discretion, we develop a stylized dynamic partial equilibrium model for the power sector. Within this framework, we examine investments in low-carbon technologies for power generation, such as RES, under three climate policy scenarios. The scenarios vary in the assumptions regarding when and how the policy-maker decides on the future level of ambition for a market-based instrument: Rule-based commitment the policy-maker can commit to a set of state-contingent levels of ambition for the market-based instrument and explicitly relate it to possible future states of the world (e.g., high and low benefits or costs). Its perfect implementation requires contracting all contingencies relevant for the future design of climate policy. We will argue that this can be achieved only very imperfectly in practice, so this scenario mostly serves as a benchmark for the outcome of the other scenarios. Unconditional commitment the policy-maker defines the long-run level of ambition of the market-based instrument today and can commit to not adjusting it in the future, even if knowledge gained in the future suggests it is inefficient. This scenario represents one extreme case. It minimizes the hold-up problem and the cost of political opportunism. Yet, it foregoes potential benefits from adjusting policy to new information in the future. Discretion the level of ambition of the market-based instrument can be freely adapted in the future. It may differ from the level in the previous policy scenarios because of both opportunistic policy-making and new knowledge on costs or benefits. This scenario represents the second extreme case. It allows reaping welfare gains if new knowledge can be incorporated into policy design. However, is also opens up for hold-up problems and political opportunism. We find that rule-based commitment generally outperforms both unconditional commitment and discretion. Yet, perfect rule-based commitment itself seems in many cases impractical, given difficulties to contractually specify and monitor possible states of the world. Consequently, the comparison of unconditional commitment and discretion is more relevant in practice. The choice between the two approaches is analytically ambiguous. A numerical application for plausible ranges of the social cost of carbon avoided provides additional insight. In a basic version of the framework, discretion, in the sense of an optimal, forward-looking adaptation of policies to new information, seems superior to unconditional commitment for reasonable parameter values, even if only marginally so. The relative advantage of discretion vanishes once we account for (a) climate uncertainty resolving only partially over time, (b) uncertainty due to non-benevolent policy-makers deviating from inter-temporally optimal policy levels, and (c) risk-averse investors. We also reflect briefly on how the policy choice is affected by uncertainty of the future costs of low-carbon technologies (instead of external benefits). In this case, commitment is strictly superior (inferior) to discretion if the market-based instrument is meant to internalize an external damage (to attain a politically set technology deployment target). Overall, our results therefore suggest that, while pertinent economic reasons for discretionary climate policy-making exist, the second-best policy approach is still in many cases to commit to a longer-term climate policy path. The optimal choice between commitment and discretion in environmental policy has already received some attention. A prominent strand in the debate assumes that a single firm with market power foresees that its investment decision today will affect the stringency of future environmental policy. Consequently, it adapts investment strategically (the ratchet effect). In the simplest setting, commitment is then strictly superior to discretion (Biglaiser et al. 1995; Downing and White 1986; Yao 1988). Yet, the choice between commitment and discretion may become ambiguous if the ratchet effect combines with additional policy constraints, e.g., if the convexity of environmental damages is not considered in tax design (Amacher and Malik 2002), or if positive externalities related to research and development cannot be addressed by specific subsidies but only indirectly through the emissions policy (Laffont and Tirole 1996; Requate 2005). Laffont and Tirole as well as Requate also show that rule-based commitment—e.g., in the form of option allowances or a tax menu—strictly outperforms unconditional commitment and full discretion. Requate and Unold (2001, 2003) show that discretion can be advantageous in the presence of uncertainty of environmental benefits to enable policy learning (cf. also D’Amato and Dijkstra 2015; Karp and Zhang 2005; Krysiak 2011). Yet, these studies do not account for the ratchet effect. Malik (1991) and Tarui and Polasky (2005) combine benefit uncertainty and strategic firm behavior. They show that under these assumptions, the choice between policy discretion and commitment becomes ambiguous. Kennedy (1999) and Jakob and Brunner (2014) highlight that in this case, rule-based commitment is again superior to both unconditional commitment and discretion. Our paper is similar to these studies in the way we consider uncertainty, and thus the benefits of discretion. However, it is fundamentally different in the way we model the cost of discretion. We abstain from assuming a ratchet effect and strategic firm behavior. In a world where a market-based instrument is imposed on numerous firms, it may not be plausible to assume that decisions of a single firm can significantly affect the level of ambition of this policy in the future. Instead, we consider that discretion produces additional costs because it opens up for opportunistic policy-making. Several studies point out that this is a concern if policy-makers consider additional policy objectives besides pollution control, such as distributional or public finance concerns. They discuss how this problem can be reduced by different means of commitment, such as appropriately choosing between price and quantity approaches (Baldursson and von der Fehr 2008; May and Chiappinelli 2018), by earmarking tax revenues (Marsiliani and Renström 2000), by combining carbon pricing with complementary technology policies (Abrego and Perroni 2002; Ulph and Ulph 2013), by introducing supra-nationally set policy targets (May and Chiappinelli 2018), or by delegating climate policy-making to an independent carbon bank (Helm et al. 2003, 2004). However, these studies largely ignore the potential benefits of discretion if costs and benefits of environmental policy are uncertain. Consequently, they assume that full commitment to an intertemporal environmental policy path would always be the optimal solution. Our paper adds to this literature by considering how the choice between commitment and discretion becomes ambiguous if uncertainty is added. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the stylized dynamic partial equilibrium model for the power sector. Section 3 provides the basic analytical discussion and numerical illustration of the choice between climate policy commitment and discretion when benefits are uncertain. Section 4 relaxes some of the assumptions made for the basic model to capture additional aspects of reality. Section 5 briefly discusses the implications of uncertain technology costs. Section 6 provides a discussion of our analytical and numerical results, and Sect. 7 concludes.",7

Lopes,Shady S. Atallah,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A fourth of animal and plant species are threatened with extinction (IUCN 2011) by direct threats such as overharvesting and indirect threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation (Ando and Langpap 2018). A similar share of carnivores is critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable (Hilton-Taylor et al. 2009). Carnivores generate a variety of ecosystems services (ES): some of these are regulation ES whereby carnivores help stabilize ecosystems while others are provisioning (e.g., pelt) and cultural (e.g., recreation) ES. Some ES are derived through consumptive (e.g., trophy hunting) or non-consumptive use values (e.g., wildlife recreation). Others are derived through non-use values, such as existence values, and these are the least studied in part because they are the hardest to estimate. If non-use existence values are significant relative to use values, then public resource management decisions based on benefit–cost analyses that omit these values are not socially optimal and might lead to extinction (Alexander 2000). In addition, many of the ES that provide non-use values are public goods, and consequently, the conservation of the species providing them will be underprovided by private parties engaging in extractive use of the species, destruction of its habitat, or failing to maintain habitat health that is necessary for the survival of the species. Conservation policies aimed at correcting the market failure in species conservation include habitat conservation programs, policies to encourage habitat ecosystem health maintenance, and management of hunting (Ando and Langpap 2018). One of the most common habitat conservation policies consists of establishing protected areas. When the species of conservation interest coexists with indigenous communities, the enforcement of the protected status of the area often involves the expulsion and exclusion of these communities. The practice is controversial on human rights and ethical grounds, and its effectiveness has been mixed (Dowie 2009; Lele et al. 2010). Here, we use an ecological-economic model to show that this practice will fail to maximize the net social value derived from the resource and can be counterproductive: When communities derive existence value from the species, such as the value gained from worshiping tigers by local tribes in southwestern India, their expulsion and exclusion lead to species extinction. In contrast, securing their property rights leads to species survival. We use a case study of an indigenous tribe that worships tigers and estimate the existence values the tribe derives from worshipping the tiger. Conservationists have made claims that “tribal peoples are the best conservationists and guardians of the natural world” (Rust 2016). In some cases, such claims are supported by evidence. For example, the Soligas tribe in the Western Ghats of India reveres the wild Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. tigris) according to their customary spiritual beliefs. The NGO Survival International released data showing that the population of tigers in that region doubled between the years 2010 and 2014 and that the population growth rate was higher than the national average in India (Rust 2016). However, such claims and descriptive data might include confounding factors leading to this higher-than-average growth rate that might not be related to the co-existence of the species with the tribe. Moreover, there is no formal theoretical or empirical analysis in the conservation economics literature on the effect that existence values—which local populations derive from a species—have on the conservation status of that species. More generally, the literature on non-consumptive values in conservation tends to be limited to tourism use values (Skonhoft 1998). Although it is widely believed that non-consumptive public good values of endangered species may be considerable (Bulte and van Kooten 1999b) and may well be greater than consumptive values (Swanson and Barbier 1992), no estimates of such values exist. This is in part because non-market valuation may not be appropriate to estimate the resource values of indigenous peoples who have socio-political structures and decision-making processes that are inconsistent with the referendum format of valuation surveys used to generate welfare estimates (Adamowicz et al. 1998). It is not surprising then that very few studies estimate existence values for endangered species as would be appropriate to do in the case of the spiritual values of the Bengal tiger. One notable exception is Zabel et al. (2011), a study that accounts for the existence values of tiger conservation in the case of co-existence with livestock. However, the existence values the authors consider represent values society at large might put on the knowledge that the species exists, which typically capture moral satisfaction, “warm glow” and ethical dimensions (Alpizar et al. 2003) but not spiritual values derived by the local populations from worshipping the tiger. Moreover, given the lack of functions that can be used to model such values, they focus on deriving a wide range of marginal existence values that guarantee interior solutions, as opposed to backing out existence value estimates as a function of population levels. In this paper, we provide a case study of the Soligas tribe living in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve located in India’s Western Ghats. This tribe attaches significant spiritual value to the Bengal tiger. We estimate the existence valuesFootnote 1 that lead to a higher population of tigers when the tribe’s property rights are secured and show that exclusionary policies can lead to local species extinction. We develop a bioeconomic model that includes both extraction value and non-use existence value of the Bengal tiger. The model we propose includes a specification of an existence value function, which allows us to estimate the tribe’s existence values derived from worshipping the tiger, as opposed to identifying a wide range of society’s values as in Zabel et al. (2011). We compare conservation policies that consist of either keeping or taking away property rights from the tribe, with and without poaching fines. We find that, if taking away property rights from the tribe leads to myopic harvesting (e.g., Skonhoft and Solstad 1996), poaching increases as a result of insecure property rights, even in the presence of fines, which leads to localized tiger extinction. When the tribe’s property rights are safeguarded, on the other hand, existence values are realized, and the species population increases. The policy implications regarding property rights is a salient and current one because local courts can and have secured rights of indigenous communities to remain or return to their ancestral lands within a tiger reserve through enforcement of the 2006 Indian Forest Rights Act (Bhullar 2008). There has however been considerable uncertainty about the future implementation of land claims for forest-dwelling indigenous communities in India. In the past, several forest-dwelling tribespeople have seen their land claims rejected in the Supreme Court of India under the Forest Rights Act in circumstances where they lacked proof of possessing the land for the last three generations or more (Sengar 2019). Eviction from ancestral lands is an unpredictable threat that renders land title uncertain for many forest-dwelling tribes in India. In the Soligas case, Fanari (2019) describes how land rights to the BRT were taken away from them temporarily before reacquiring them in accordance with the Forest Rights Act. The poaching of endangered species—such as tigers—attracts a penalty as per the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (MOEF 2013). As is the case with any other tribe, the Soligas are subject to this poaching penalty in accordance with the law. In our model, we numerically estimate the existence values the Soligas tribe derives from worshipping the tiger. The numerical analysis begins with a revealed preference estimation of an existence value weight using a model calibration that represents the current situation of the Soligas wherein they currently have land rights in the BRT and are subject to a poaching penalty. We then examine alternative policy scenarios in which property rights are either secured or not, with and without poaching fines, to account for the possibility of a change in the enforcement of land claims in the future. We discuss the possible policy applications of using existence value estimates to guide species conservation policy and conservation investments. We note that the implications of our study are not limited to megafauna. The spiritual significance of flora—as in the case of sacred groves located within forests (Bhagwat et al. 2005; Reddy and Yosef 2016; Vipat and Bharucha 2014)—would also increase their conservation value to society. The model we use, its results, and policy implications are consistent with the bioeconomic literature on existence value but depart from it because of the institutional point of view in the analysis and the type of non-consumptive values considered. Clark et al. (2010) consider the case of a social portfolio manager who optimizes the net benefits of harvesting a resource for private gain with the added public benefit of its existence value for society at large. Conrad (2010) uses a similar model to consider the case of managing a whale population to optimize the net benefits from whale harvest and whale watching that provide non-consumptive direct use values. While the model setup we use here is consistent with those of Clark et al. (2010) and Conrad (2010), its formulation from the point of view of a local population, as opposed to a social planner representing society at large, the explicit modeling of existence values, and its application to terrestrial megafauna conservation, are novel. While the message is not new—conservationists have made claims that “tribal peoples are the best conservationists and guardians of the natural world” (Rust 2016)—the argument, within the context of a bioeconomic model, has not been widely applied to natural resources with spiritual value. The conservation economics literature investigates different policy approaches available to conserve species. According to Skonhoft (1998), providing locals with benefits from hunting and tourism can reduce incentives for illegal poaching. However, Fischer et al. (2011) find that whether benefit sharing provides conservation incentives depends on the design of the benefit shares, the size of the benefits relative to agricultural losses, and the management of hunting quotas. Bulte and Rondeau (2007) consider another policy tool, compensation payments, and find that these payments have ambiguous effects on wildlife stocks and local welfare. While they can reduce hunting effort, these payments can also provide incentives to convert wildlife habitat into agricultural land. Conservation performance payments are yet another policy tool, which consists of payments for environmental services—either monetary or in-kind payments—made by an agency to individuals or groups and are conditional on specific conservation outcomes (Albers and Ferraro 2006; Engel et al. 2008). Focusing on the case of co-existence of tiger and livestock, Zabel et al. (2011) find that conservation performance payments can generate enough incentives for livestock herders to refrain from hunting so that the carnivore population reaches its socially optimal level. We contribute to the conservation economics literature by estimating the non-use existence values that explain the patterns of non-extinction observed in the case of the Bengal tiger and show that the policy of expulsion and/or exclusion of local tribes in the name of conservation may well lead to extinction. Conversely, conservation policies which recognize that wildlife existence values lead to species survival and secure a tribe’s property rights outperform conservation policies that exclude tribes venerating a species or natural environment. The related literature lacks such existence value estimates of wildlife that provide spiritual services. More broadly, the conservation economics and non-market valuation literature lack marginal non-use benefit functions that can guide wildlife conservation policy (Eiswerth and Kooten 2009). Instead, the literature mostly includes analyses of traditional policies consisting of monetary or physical incentives and disincentives in the presence of wildlife-livestock or agriculture conflict. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the theoretical model of non-use existence values and provide the economic rationale for its steady-state equilibrium conditions. In Sect. 3, we apply the model to study the existence value of tigers for the Soligas tribe residing in and around the BRT Tiger Reserve. We generate an existence value weight of tigers under the current situation and proceed to estimate the existence values at the steady state tiger population that results under various hypothetical policy scenarios. Furthermore, we illustrate how the calibrated model can be used to generate a marginal existence value function for the tiger. In Sect. 4, we discuss the policy scenario simulations resulting from the application of the bioeconomic model and conclude with pertinent conservation policy observations.",7

We like to spend time together, to share opinions, laughter, experiences and knowledge, to work together, to take part in social and professional networks. Joint activities require coordination, however; and since there are usually numerous alternative ways to coordinate, everyday life is teeming with multiple equilibria. When choosing which conferences and seminars to attend, or whether to have lunch in the cafeteria or the department lunchroom, we consider who else will be there. When choosing which languages to learn, or which one to speak in a specific context, we consider what languages others are likely to understand. When choosing what type of car to purchase, or whether to purchase one at all, we consider what transportation infrastructure is likely to be present in the near future, such as gas stations, electrical charging facilities, bus and metro lines—where some options will presumably be better developed if others are demanding their availability. When organizing our daily lives—housing, work, family responsibilities—we adapt to others’ expected behaviors, trying to facilitate convenient and pleasant interaction. This need for social coordination implies external effects: the individual benefits of adopting a specific behavior are affected by the behaviors of others, often in ways not internalized by market prices. If these social externalities are sufficiently prominent, multiple equilibria can result—of which some may involve heavier burdens on the natural environment than others. If there is both a ‘green’ and a ‘brown’ Nash equilibrium, each can be stable and self-reinforcing, thus representing, from an environmental point of view, virtuous or vicious cycles. In such cases, if starting from a ‘brown’ equilibrium, policy can potentially play an important role in helping the economy coordinate on more environment-friendly solutions (Rege 2004; Nyborg and Rege 2003; Nyborg et al. 2006, 2016; Nyborg 2018). Below, I discuss why social coordination is an important concern for environmental economics and environmental policy, illustrating the main ideas by means of a simple formal model. I begin by suggesting one possible reason why standard welfare economics, while certainly useful in many ways, may have diverted economists’ attention away from social externalities and social coordination (Sect. 2). I then explain what I mean by social coordination, elaborating on some examples (Sect. 3), before presenting a highly stylized formal model (Sect. 4). This model is then used to discuss how environmental policy can play an important role in helping agents coordinate on socially preferred equilibria (Sect. 5). Finally, I sum up my conclusions (Sect. 6).",12

Before 1990, there was open hostility between groups of ecologists and groups of economists. As Director of the Beijer, Karl-Göran brought together top economists, like Kenneth Arrow, Robert Solow, Partha Dasgupta and William Brock, and top ecologists, like Paul Ehrlich, Buzz Holling, Simon Levin, Brian Walker and Stephen Carpenter. They interacted with younger ecologists and economists and, in that way, the attitudes changed, and fruitful and productive cooperation was developed. In the Director’s Column of the Beijer Annual Report during his last year as Director, Karl-Göran pointed out that: “We are now willing to listen to each other, to understand each other, and to work with each other. That, I believe, is the greatest achievement we have made during these 15 years.” Those of us who had the privilege of being part of this group learned and matured scientifically through this change in attitude. A vital part of this process was the famous Askö meetings which started in 1993 and continue to the present, in which economists and ecologists sitting at a round table in a research station on the small island of Askö vigorously exchange ideas. The resulting Askö papers, which were published in journals such as Science, PNAS, Nature Climate Change or the Journal of Economic Perspectives, provide an indication of the level of scientific quality attained through these collaborations. The dinners in the small dining room of the facility and jumping into the cold Baltic Sea after a sauna which had no shower—for those who survived it—provided a level of human interaction that cemented long-term friendships.",3

Meya,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Environmental policy making is increasingly informed by economic values assigned to non-market environmental goods (e.g. OECD 2018), which are often distributed highly unequal among households. For instance, Boyce et al. (2016) recently found that exposure to industrial air pollution in the United States is even more unequally distributed than income. In many cases such environmental inequalities reinforce prevailing economic inequalities: For centuries, wealthy citizens have tended to live in areas where environmental quality is high, while pollution has been burdened disproportionately on poor citizens.Footnote 1 As biodiversity change and the loss of many environmental goods is accelerating (IPBES 2019; Baumgärtner et al. 2015; Butchart et al. 2010; MEA 2005) and income is distributed increasingly unequal in most parts of the world (Alvaredo et al. 2017), it is timely to study the interplay of environmental and income inequalities. The monetary valuation of non-market goods has become a central challenge for environmental economics. So far, however, valuation studies have paid little attention to the implications of environmental inequalities and their (spatial) coupling with income inequalities (Drupp et al. 2018). Recently, Baumgärtner et al. (2017a) presented a model of how the distribution of income affects the societal value of a homogeneously distributed public good at the stage of aggregating individual values. For an equal preference model set-up in which all households are endowed with the same level of an environmental good but differ in exogenously given income, they find that societal willingness to pay (WTP) decreases (increases) with income inequality if and only if the environmental good is a substitute for (complement to) manufactured consumption goods. As the majority of environmental goods considered in non-market valuation are unevenly distributed across households, it is crucial to extend this model framework to heterogeneously distributed public goods and to analyze how environmental inequalities affect societal WTP. In this paper, I study how the joint distribution of exposure and income—and in particular, environmental and income inequality—affect the value of a public good. I present a model of societal WTP for an environmental public good where households differ in both environmental good endowment and income.Footnote 2 Taking the homogenous public good model of Baumgärtner et al. (2017a) as point of departure, I assume (a) households to have identical preferences regarding a manufactured private consumption good and an exogenously given environmental good represented by a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function, and (b) differ in log-normally distributed household income. I extend their model to the case of heterogeneously distributed public goods by assuming (c) that households are heterogeneous in their endowment with a rationed environmental good, represented by a log-normal distribution. While the later is certainly an approximation, the assumption of log-normality reflects that the access or exposure to environmental goods across households is in many cases strongly right-skewed and positive. This model setting allows to study the novel aspects of environmental inequality and the correlation of environmental good endowment with income as determinants of societal WTP. I find that the distribution of the environmental good—and how this is correlated with income—affects societal WTP. In particular, I show that (1) the effect of environmental and income inequality on societal WTP is determined by whether the environmental good is a substitute for or a complement to manufactured consumption goods and by how environmental good endowment is correlated with income; (2) a higher correlation between income and environmental good endowment, i.e. richer households enjoying more of the environmental good, increases (decreases) societal WTP if and only if the environmental good is a substitute for (complement to) manufactured consumption goods. Based on these theoretical insights, I derive theory-based adjustment factors for benefit transfer to account for differences in the distribution of environmental goods and income. Finally, an application to forest preservation in Poland illustrates economic effect sizes of the proposed adjustments in the range of several percentage points. My research adds in particular to two strands of literature: First, I contribute to the development of theory-based (‘structural’) methods for spatial benefit transfer. Practical policy analysis usually draws on monetary values from past studies to inform policy making in a different context (OECD 2018), which is commonly referred to as ‘benefit transfer’ or ‘value transfer’. As the associated errors are often large, several scholars have argued that benefit transfers should be based more firmly in micro-economic theory (Bateman et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2002). Indeed, benefit transfer functions specified purely based on statistical fit, might be theoretically inconsistent (Moeltner 2019; Newbold et al. 2018). Recently, there has been a growing interest in spatially explicit approaches to benefit transfer (e.g. Kuminoff 2018; Turner 2017; Perino et al. 2014; Brander et al. 2012). In the present paper, I add to this literature by developing a structural benefit transfer approach for the valuation of spatially distributed environmental public goods. Second, I contribute to the literature on spatial inequality and neighborhood sorting. My analysis is thus related to Brueckner et al. (1999), Lee and Lin (2018), Heblich et al. (2018), who show that environmental amenities induce neighborhood sorting, with higher-income households sorting into neighborhoods where environmental quality is high. In a seminal paper Epple and Platt (1998) firstly developed a more general neighborhood sorting model where households differ in both income and preferences,Footnote 3, resulting in two-dimensional household stratification. In this class of models, conditional on preferences, richer households sort into places with higher environmental good endowment. The correlation between environmental quality and socio-demographic variables such as income has been scrutinized under the headline of ‘environmental justice’ for decades (e.g. Ash and Fetter 2004; Banzhaf et al. 2019). Here, I link the societal valuation of environmental amenities to sorting by analyzing differences in the correlation between environmental goods and income. The remainder is structured as follows. I present the model in Sect. 2, and the results from the model analysis in Sect. 3. An empirical application for a forest protection policy in Poland is presented in Sect. 4. I discuss limitations of my analysis in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6. The appendix contains all formal proofs.",15

Storrøsten,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Committed emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure represent more than the entire remaining carbon budget if the 1.5 °C target is to be achieved, and perhaps two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean global warming is to be limited below 2 °C (Tong et al. 2019). Energy infrastructure has substantial (and partly sunk) investment costs and can remain operative for decades once in place. Hence, it is of crucial importance to direct investment away from emission intensive fossil fuels and towards low-emission alternatives if we are to curb global warming. In this paper, I examine emission regulation and transition dynamics in the presence of long-lived capital in a competitive partial equilibrium model with resource scarcity. The modeling framework includes capital accumulation and convex investment costs to capture the sluggish response to regulation caused by long-lived capital. I use regulation of the electric power industry as an example throughout the paper. The socially optimal time trajectory can be implemented in competitive equilibrium in a setting with convex investment cost and resource scarcity by a standard Pigouvian emission tax if the firms’ private discount rate equals the social discount rate. Otherwise, i.e., if the firms are more impatient than the social planner, production capacity adjusts too slowly to the emission tax.Footnote 1 Therefore, a tax or subsidy on investment is needed to implement the socially optimal time trajectory in this case. This provides a rationale for using emission taxes and investment subsidies simultaneously, which is relevant for public policy because many countries have or consider regulation featuring both instruments (see, e.g., IPCC 2012). Further, emission taxes above the Pigouvian level may be optimal if the private discount rate exceeds the social discount rate and an emission tax is the only policy instrument available. The explanation is that a higher emission tax helps speed up the transition, which increases welfare if the firms discount the future too strongly. A caveat is that such policies tend to be time inconsistent. Last, the time lags of environmental policy may be substantial, and I also examine current effects of increasing (or introducing) future emission taxes.Footnote 2 A key research question here is whether the green paradox (Sinclair 1992; Sinn 2008) holds when the model includes capital accumulation, convex investment costs and resource scarcity.Footnote 3 The analysis highlights that large investments towards a less emission intensive production capacity mix is needed early on. The reason is that current investment in relatively clean production technologies decreases the cost of future emission reductions. This corroborates a key result in Vogt-Schilb et al. (2018), who explicitly models investment in abatement equipment and finds that it is optimal to start a long-term emission–reduction strategy with significant and early abatement investment, even if the optimal carbon price starts low and grows progressively over time.Footnote 4 Regarding current effects of anticipated future emission taxes, future taxes have three key dynamic effects on current emissions from electricity generation in a model with exhaustible resources and long-lived capital. First, future taxes increase the future cost of combusting fossil fuels. This reduces the profitability of upkeep and investment in emission intensive power plants, which again reduces the demand for fossil fuels. Second, future emission taxes increase future residual demand for low-emission electricity. This increases the profitability of investment in low-emission power plants, which again increases the electricity supply from these plants to the market. This reduces the equilibrium consumption of fossil fuels. Because of convex investment costs, it is cost efficient for the firms to begin adaptation to anticipated future emission taxes immediately. Therefore, emissions may decrease even before the tax has been implemented. Third, owners of scarce fossil resources can pre-empt a future emission tax by accelerating production of fossil energy such that more extraction take place before the tax is enacted. This is the well-known green paradox (see, e.g., Sinclair 1992; Sinn 2008). Whereas the two first mechanisms reduce the demand for fossil fuels, the third mechanism increases the supply of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is theoretically ambiguous whether the market equilibrium will feature increased or decreased fossil fuel consumption (before the emission tax is implemented), as compared to the case without future taxes. I illustrate the analytical findings with a stylized numerical model of the US electricity market. The numerical model uses the Path solver in GAMS to solve the theoretical model as a mixed complementarity problem, given assumptions about quadratic functional forms for utility, environmental damage and production costs. The electricity demand function does not change over time in the numerical simulations, and technical change is either omitted or exogenous. The numerical simulations suggest that the green paradox does not hold in the presence of long-lived capital: Early emissions decrease in all cases following announcement of future emission taxes, except when investment costs are very low (the model then collapses towards the standard exhaustible resource model without long lived capital; see, e.g., Sinclair 1992, and Sinn 2008). The analysis predicts that forward-looking firms will reduce current use of inputs subject to stringent future regulation. In this respect, it is interesting to observe the current struggle of publicly traded US coal companies.Footnote 5 Clearly, there are several factors behind this, like slower economic growth, cheap natural gas and current environmental regulation. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable that also bleaker prospects caused by future environmental regulation and increased competition from renewable power partly explain the investors’ vanishing interest in coal.Footnote 6 The presence of adjustment costs is an important premise for the present paper. Adjustment costs was early recognized, both related to firms’ net capital investment decisions (Gould 1968; Lucas 1976) and related to changing the number of employees (Holt et al. 1960; Oi 1962). Capital adjustment costs arise, e.g., if the price of capital increases in the rate of investment. Labor adjustment costs include costs related to hiring, training and layoff. Bellofatto and Besfamille (2018) use the probability that a project is finished early and without the need of refinancing as a proxy for administrative capacity. Whereas capital adjustment cost is the type of adjustment cost explicitly modeled in the present paper, the results may be relevant also in the case of labor adjustment cost or administrative capacity constraints. In the macroeconomics literature, Kydland and Prescott (1982) assumes that it takes time to install new equipment, and Wickens (2008, p. 33) assume that the cost of a unit of investment depends on how large it is in relation to the size of the existing capital stock. The paper also relates to a body of literature which examines resource extraction under capacity constraints, but without pollution (Kemp and Van Long 1980; Amigues et al. 1998; Holland 2003). Particularly relevant to the present paper, Amigues et al. (2015) show that optimal investment in renewables starts before the end of fossil fuel usage in a setting with adjustment costs and endogenous capacity constraints. Further, Coulomb et al. (2019) examines the optimal transition from coal to gas and renewables in a model with capacity constraints and adjustment costs. Similarly to the present paper, they find that different energy sources should be used together in order to smooth out adjustment costs. Whereas the present paper’s modeling of the supply side shares many similarities with this body of literature, this paper adds to the literature by examining regulation and including environmental constraints (except for Coulomb et al. 2019, which also models pollution). Another relevant branch of literature examines optimal use of energy sources, given emission constraints and exhaustible fossil fuels. This literature models renewable energy as a clean backstop and pays limited attention to adjustment costs. A general result without adjustment costs is that the clean backstop is kept on hold until the use of fossil fuels ceases (Chakravorty et al. 2006, 2008; van der Ploeg and Withagen 2012).Footnote 7 The transition is different in the present paper, as renewables (and nuclear power) is phased in early on and exploited together with emission intensive fossil fuels along the socially optimal time trajectory. Section 2.1 characterizes the competitive partial equilibrium. The tax scheme that can implement the socially optimal time trajectory is presented in Sect. 2.2. Section 2.3 examines dynamic effects following announcement of future emission taxes. Section 2.4 investigates second-best taxation when an emission tax is the only policy instrument available and firms discount the future too strongly. The numerical illustration is in Sects. 3 and 4 concludes.",

Currently, most productive activities rely upon energy from fossil fuels, with unsustainable damage to the global environment. Climate scientists estimate that a large fraction of fossil fuel reserves—as much as 80% of coal deposits—should remain unexploited if we want to meet a \(2\hbox {C}^{\circ }\) climate target (McGlade and Ekins 2015). However, some of the largest coal and oil producers in the world are developing countries with prominent greenhouse gas emission profiles, as in the case of China and India for absolute emissions, or Qatar, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia in per capita terms (European Commission 2019; British Petroleum 2019). Naturally, the governments of these countries are not inclined to restrict fossil fuel extraction (Friedrichs and Inderwildi 2013; Tvinnereim and Ivarsflaten 2016). What policies could induce them to forego their resource wealth? In particular, can countries that do not own carbon deposits induce their resource-rich trade partners to shift to other energy sources to avoid a climate disaster? Unilateral climate policies have been topical since the 2015 Paris Agreement, which required voluntary pledges from individual governments in the form of ‘Intended Nationally Determined Contributions’, instead of coordinated global actions such as carbon pricing. Following the negotiations, countries focused on several possible unilateral measures, including R&D in clean energy technology and financing climate actions in developing countries, for instance through the Green Climate Fund (Dagnet et al. 2016). However, these unilateral policies can be successful only if they address the substantial productivity advantage that fossil fuels still have in the energy sector, either by adjusting energy prices, or directly tackling the abundance of cheap carbon deposits. In this article, we compare two unilateral policies that can promptly address fossil fuels’ use in an open economy. These policies consist of a “pigouvian” solution, acting on the world price of renewable energy, and a “Coasian” supply-side solution, creating a market for fossil fuel deposits to prevent their exploitation. Both policies rely on the interconnectedness of the global economy to redirect the path of production and innovation: since energy inputs are traded, the North can foster its competitiveness in renewables with a price subsidy, or stop the leading source of comparative advantage in the production of fossil fuels by purchasing extractive rights over carbon deposits in the South. Both interventions immediately reverse the process of environmental degradation, but the costs of the two policies can vary substantially depending on the characteristics of the countries involved. To compare these two strategies, we develop a dynamic trade model with endogenous innovation and asymmetric fossil fuel endowments, which allows us to examine the monetary costs and welfare implications of the policies. The design of our theoretical framework is close to the directed technical change models of Acemoglu et al. (2012) and Hémous (2016). Similar to Hémous, we model two regions connected by international trade, North and South, and assume that the South does not cooperate in the fight against climate change, so that a global carbon tax is not feasible. In this context, we argue that a key difficulty for tackling climate change with unilateral policies arises if the non-cooperative region controls most of the global reserves of fossil fuels. We model this issue by introducing a large asymmetric endowment of fossil fuel deposits, which are present only in the South. This region can extract fossil fuels, use them to satisfy domestic energy demand if no cheaper alternative is available, and export them to the North. Thus, the South might emit greenhouse gases for its own local economic activities, even if the North completely stops importing and consuming carbon-intensive goods. The connection between the two regions through international trade is then the only instrumentFootnote 1 available to the North to shift Southern production away from burning fossil fuels. We model two unilateral interventions that immediately shut down fossil fuel production: a price subsidy for energy-intensive inputs made with renewable energy (the Pigouvian policy), and the purchase of extractive rights over fossil fuel deposits in the South (the Coasian policy). This latter option is directly related to the work of Harstad (2012) and the long-standing literature on supply-side interventions (Bohm 1993). These models, however, do not consider the effect that carbon deposits have on the export profile of a country through sectoral innovation, which over time can amplify trade specialization.Footnote 2 Hence, unlike Harstad (2012), we evaluate this policy in a general equilibrium model with trade and directed technical change. Even if our model is related to the one of Hémous (2016), we depart from his policy analysis because of some key differences in initial assumptions. Hémous (2016) studies a combination of R&D subsidies for green innovation and trade taxes to achieve sustainability. However, the effectiveness of his policy package rests on three conditions: (1) the policies are not enacted too late, when environmental degradation is too advanced; (2) the South does not consume polluting goods domestically;Footnote 3 and (3) fossil fuels, if present, are exhaustible resources with rapidly rising prices as they become more scarce (similar to Acemoglu et al. 2012). In our model, instead, we consider policies that could work at any degree of environmental degradation, even if the South has home-consumption of polluting goods, and even in the presence of large endowments of fossil fuels that will not become scarce any time in the near future. This last point is based on current research on stranded carbon assets, which argues that fossil fuel resources are too abundant to rely on their exhaustibility to prevent a climate disaster under business as usual (Jakob and Hilaire 2015; van der Ploeg and Rezai 2017). Therefore, in our model we assume that scarcity does not limit the availability of fossil fuel deposits within the time horizon under consideration. With a simple calibration of the model, we find that the choice between the Pigouvian and the Coasian approach depends primarily on the cost of purchasing fossil fuel deposits in the South, and secondly on the relative technological development of renewable energy in the two regions. If the North can purchase deposits at their market price, the Coasian policy yields the highest welfare. Buying deposits at market prices is in fact substantially cheaper than paying them at full-income compensation and, unlike the price subsidy, does not distort the international production of energy, thus it is the least disruptive intervention in terms of welfare. However, if the South requires a full compensation for abandoning fossil fuel deposits, the policy choice depends on which region has the best technology for clean energy production. Whenever the North has a large advantage in green technologies over the resource-rich South, a price subsidy yields a higher welfare for the North than paying full income compensation for the deposits. Conversely, if the North does not have a substantial technological advantage, buying fossil fuel deposits is always preferable for Northern welfare. This result arises because, in the subsidy scenario, unsubsidized Southern energy firms cannot compete with Northern ones, which produce all energy inputs worldwide. Thus, if the North starts with relatively backward green technologies, it will take a long time before its firms catch up with fossil fuels’ productivity, and thus more substantial welfare costs. We also discuss the direct costs of the policies, which might be a more tangible measure for politicians of the feasibility of each intervention, even if they do not capture their general equilibrium welfare effects. We find that monetary costs can be substantial, in the range of 20–60% of Northern income in the baseline parametrization. Both policies can be removed once the market price of energy inputs from renewables falls below the one of fossil fuels, as countries change their specialization patterns and innovation fosters alternative energy production. Our results bridge different strands of the literature on international environmental policies. Previous studies propose a variety of instruments to tackle global environmental externalities, from trade, to innovation, to supply-side policies.Footnote 4 The trade literature was the first to highlight that environmental policies cannot ignore the role of competitiveness effects and the international reallocation of production (Barrett 1994; Copeland and Taylor 2004). These international effects may dampen the optimism of the directed technical change literature, which argues that temporary innovation policies can redirect countries permanently to green growth paths (Newell et al. 1999; Acemoglu et al. 2012; Gans 2012; Acemoglu et al. 2014; Aghion et al. 2014; Gupta 2015).Footnote 5 In an open economy context, a combination of innovation and trade policies can effectively shift economies to clean energy production (Di Maria and Smulders 2005; Di Maria and Werf 2008; Hémous 2016; van den Bijgaart 2017). These models of trade and directed technical change provide important insights concerning the dynamic problem of pollution havens and the location of dirty production. However, they leave a marginal role for large asymmetries in polluting endowments, such as fossil fuel ownership. Instead, we want to highlight how the abundance of fossil fuel reserves in non-participating countries creates path dependence and specialization that are hard to contrast, but that can still be reversed in an interconnected world economy. As noted by van den Bijgaart (2017), the size of the coalition implementing unilateral policies relative to the non-complying nations is a crucial determinant of the ability of few countries to redirect dirty production.Footnote 6 We focus on a situation in which the South is ‘large’, not only because its mass of scientists is as large as the Northern one, but also because it owns abundant fossil fuel deposits, giving the region a significant comparative advantage in dirty energy production. Moreover, the South has its own domestic consumption of energy inputs that is unaffected by Northern restrictions. This setting reflects the characteristics of many large resource-rich developing countries like China, India, Indonesia, or South Africa (OECD 2012; World Energy Council 2013). Therefore, in our framework, the trade and innovation policies examined by models with a ‘smaller’ South, like Hémous (2016) and van den Bijgaart (2017), are not sufficient to address environmental degradation. Lastly, our approach is related to Müller-Fürstenberger and Schumacher (2017) , who consider two regions producing a global externality, but with only one of them suffering the external damages. In our model, the non-cooperative South is indifferent to the pollution externality, but also the sole owner of fossil fuel deposits for the production of polluting energy. In their non-cooperative framework, they find that the region affected by the externality has to spend a large share of its income to offset it, even to the point of an environmental poverty trap. Our paper arrives at a similar conclusion: we find that implementing those policies that can always stop a climate disaster requires substantial income transfers from North to South. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we develop the theoretical model. Section 3 characterizes the laissez-faire equilibrium. In Sects. 4 and 5 we define and compare the two policy instruments with a simple calibration of the model. Section 6 discusses some modelling assumptions and concludes.",6

According to the EU, 60% of municipal waste should be separated in 2030. The Netherlands is adding a considerable amount to this by demanding that 75% should be recycled in 2020 and that every inhabitant should be allowed to have only 100 kg of unsorted waste per year in 2020 and limiting this to only 30 kg in 2025. To achieve this goal, separation and recycling of glass, paper/carton, plastic and metals are crucial. In recent decades, the use of plastic packaging has increased substantially and therefore also the efforts to recycle it (Hopewell et al. 2009). For plastic the EU-target for re-use of plastic packaging is 55% by 2030 (EC 2017). Moreover, for plastic (packaging) waste the Netherlands recycled 51% in 2016. The preferred solution in the Netherlands to fulfil this target is separate collection systems at the curbside as this is far more common than post-collection separation. Most municipalities have an advanced system of curbside collection of unsorted waste and recyclables and easily assessable bring locations for bottles, paper and plasticsFootnote 1 (Dijkgraaf and Gradus 2017). In addition, more and more Dutch municipalities introduce unit-based pricing (UBP) systems for waste, as these unit-based pricing systems are effective in reducing unsorted waste and stimulating recycling. By 2017, 45% of all Dutch municipalities had implemented a unit-based pricing system, this share has risen substantially from 16% in 1999 (Gradus and Dijkgraaf 2019). However, unit-based pricing systems can have some adverse effects as illegal dumping or waste tourism (Fullerton and Kinnaman 1996). The debate on the impact of waste fees on illegal disposal or waste tourism is still open as data are not readily available. Interestingly, for Switzerland there are two recent opposing indications. Erhardt (2019) investigates whether the introduction of a unit-based garbage fee induces waste dumping in nearby communities which do not implement such a policy and call it a “waste haven effect”. Interestingly, he found some evidence for waste havens in a cross-section of 1752 Swiss municipalities. By contrast, in the Swiss city of Lausanne, Carattini et al. (2018) show that 4 years after the introduction of a unit-based pricing system, illegal disposal remained a minor issue. Interestingly, some municipalities especially in the north of the Netherlands have invested in post-collection or mechanical separation of plastic waste (hereafter ‘post separation’). Instead of sorting plastic waste out at home, plastics are collected together with mixed waste streams and separated in a factory (see Feil et al. 2017).Footnote 2 Dutch recycling companies have innovated with infrared and filmgrabber techniques to separate plastics from mixed waste, and these methods seem to be effective. Owners of these factories claim that they can sort out more plastic than people do at home. In this paper, we use recent data from Dutch municipalities to test this claim of more effective post-collection separation of plastic waste, which has not been examined in the literature until now. Based on data for 2013 and 2014 for all Dutch municipalities, we investigate in this paper whether municipalities with post separation produce more separated household plastic waste in kilograms. With detailed data for frequency of curbside collection and type of container, we are able to test also whether these variables influence the quantity of collected plastic. It could be the case that on average post separation performs better, but not if curbside collection is optimized by collection method and frequency. Moreover, we include interaction effects if a municipality chooses to have both UBP and post separation. The possibilities for households to separate plastic waste from unsorted waste are non-existent in this case, but there can be an effect on total quantity of plastics due to buying products with less plastics. Earlier contributions claimed that unit-based pricing of unsorted waste is important to create an awareness effect which may lead consumers to purchase goods with less packaging (see for an overview Dijkgraaf and Gradus 2014). Our paper adds to the literature as it is the first to test if there are awareness effects for plastic packaging, although this test is only indirect. However, unit-based pricing can also have a negative effect on the motivation effect of people to sort waste, for people who are already normative motivated and who are annoyed by the introduction of unit-based pricing. In an empirical investigation for a town in Norway, Heller and Vatn (2017) show that half of the people behave in that direction. Moreover, illegal and illicit dumping increases if a fee is introduced. The relative performance of post separation is not only interesting from an environmental point of view, but also from a financial perspective. Home separation of plastic waste is quite expensive as it demands a separate collection infrastructure and storage and transport of low-density volumes (Gradus et al. 2017). For the Netherlands, the infrastructure costs for the collection and home separation of household plastic strongly outweigh the revenues that are generated from the sale of recycled plastic. Therefore, a municipality is compensated for this deficit by the packaging industry and in 2015 it received a contribution of € 677 per metric ton of collected household plastic waste. In Gradus et al. (2017) we calculate the implicit price of 1 metric ton of CO2 reduction by means of plastic home separation and recycling (compared with incineration) and show that it is equal to €178. In general, this implicit price is much higher than current (or historic) CO2 prices in the EU Emissions Trading System or the estimated external costs of CO2 emissions or alternatives to reduce CO2 emissions (e.g. renewable energy). A sensitivity analysis shows that this conclusion is robust. This calculation is based on the mass balance of home-separated plastic waste from households. The recycling rate for this collected mixed plastic is 75%, meaning that 25% of the collected household plastic is still used for energy recovery (as in the Netherlands unsorted waste is incinerated). The advantage of post-separation is that it is not needed to separate these ‘polluted’ and ultimately burned plastics, but a large investment to build a plant is needed. Therefore, in this paper we discuss not only the relative effectiveness of post separation in the quantity of plastic waste, but also in economic terms. As far as we know the cost effectiveness of post versus home separation has not been examined in the literature until now. Based on empirical evidence, there are indications that home-separated plastic waste is of lower quality than plastic waste from post separation (Brouwer et al. 2018). Therefore, in a sensitivity analysis we discuss whether our conclusions change if the quality of secondary plastics increases due to post separation and if the recycling rate goes up. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, data and method are discussed. Estimation results are given in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we discuss a break-even analysis for the cost effectiveness of post separation versus home separation. Finally, Sect. 5 contains some conclusions and suggestions for future research.",14

Developing countries account for 88% of worldwide aquaculture production (Klinger and Naylor 2012; Engle et al. 2017). However, there is an ongoing debate about the severity of the environmental impacts of aquaculture production on water quality, coastal habitats and ecosystems, and the salinization of groundwater (Páez-Osuna 2001; Senarath and Visvanathan 2001; Jackson et al. 2004; Trai et al. 2007; Anh et al. 2010; Bui et al. 2013; Ha et al. 2014; Pham et al. 2018). The cost of these negative externalities are borne by society and felt keenly by the aquaculture producers, given the negative impact of pollution on production possibilities (Neiland et al. 2001; Edwards 2015). A key challenge facing the industry is to reduce the externalities of production and move towards more sustainable production practices. A promising (and achievable) path to sustainability is the adoption of high-tech aquaculture production methods. These production methods use less land, less water by recirculating, and have fewer nutrients and chemicals in the run-off as a result of wastewater treatment (Klinger and Naylor 2012). High-tech methods allow farmers to increase production while at the same time reduce the environmental impacts (Klinger and Naylor 2012; Engle et al. 2017). Research suggests that producers are willing to adopt sustainable production practices (Georgakopoulos and Thomson 2005; Lasner and Hamm 2011; Perdikaris et al. 2016), and that there are potential economic benefits from doing so, e.g. sustainable products fetch a price premium in the market (Budak et al. 2006; Olesen et al. 2010; Hinkes and Schulze-Ehlers 2018), but the rate of adoption is still very low, especially in developing countries (Klinger and Naylor 2012; Engle et al. 2017). The main barrier to adopting sustainable aquaculture practices relates to the high investment and operating costs (Klinger and Naylor 2012; Ngoc et al. 2016a; Engle et al. 2017). For example, in Vietnam, which is our case study, suppliers of aqua-feeds, aquatic animal drugs and production facilities are the major sources of funding for aquaculture investment and they charge interest rates of up to 20% of the investment cost. To encourage sustainable production, farmers could be provided an economic incentive to change their production practices. One potential useful policy tool that has had some traction in promoting sustainability in fisheries and agriculture, especially in developing countries, is the use of credit subsidies (Pomeroy et al. 2009; Garrity et al. 2010; Pretty et al. 2011; Cisneros-montemayor et al. 2013, 2016; Pan et al. 2016). The source for capital to cover the cost of the subsidy scheme should come from the government or so-called payments for environmental services (PES) schemes. PES schemes call on the people who benefit from environmental services to bear the cost and generate the funds to pay those who provide the environmental services. Effectively incentivizing environmental protection, PES schemes are considered well suited to address the environment-related issues in developing countries with limited national resources (Barr and Mourato 2009). While the potential application of these payment schemes are mostly studied in the forestry, agriculture, watershed ecosystems and marine resources literatures, to the best of our knowledge, evidence of the feasibility of these payment schemes for sustainable aquaculture is non-existent (Espinosa-Goded et al. 2010; Kaczan et al. 2013; Yeboah et al. 2015; Xuan et al. 2017). Except for Barr and Mourato (2009), these studies focus on assessing the potential for PES schemes mostly through either looking at willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an environmental improvement or a willingness-to-accept (WTA) compensation for not implementing a policy. Rarely have both sides of a policy been considered in the same study. In this study, we investigate the potential for a PES market for sustainable shrimp aquaculture development in Vietnam. Specifically, we conducted two discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to analyze the supply and demand side of a policy aiming to increase investment in high-tech shrimp aquaculture, i.e. government offers a credit subsidy through government backed low-interest rate year-loans for investing in high-tech production. First, we identify the level of preferential interest rate that farmers are willing to pay for a year loan to invest in high-tech production. Then we work out the size of the subsidy, i.e. the cost of the program, by looking at the difference between the market rate and the estimated interest rate. The total cost of the program varies depending on the size of the subsidy and how many acres of land used for shrimp aquaculture is converted to high-tech production practices. Second, we identify how much the general public is willing to pay for a sustainable shrimp aquaculture program that seeks to reduce wastewater discharge and antibiotic use in production. It is assumed that the public’s financial support will be used to supplement the costs of the program. We then determine whether this required cost could be met by the public’s WTP for the program. We find that for most scenarios, people’s WTP exceeds the cost of the subsidy program. Information on farmer’s WTA and the public’s WTP for a sustainable aquaculture policy that could improve the environment is crucial for policy makers seeking to implement effective policy. The results imply that there are social welfare gains to be had by building environmental regulation. We believe that exploring both the supply and demand side of a policy is a novel contribution to the literature on using DCEs in developing countries. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we provide a brief review of shrimp aquaculture industry in Vietnam; in Sect. 3, we present the data and econometric approach; in Sect. 4, we present the results; and in Sect. 5 we provide some general discussion of our results and a few policy implications and avenues for future research.",7
77.0,2.0,Environmental and Resource Economics,14 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-020-00502-4,Tax Exemptions of Ethical Products Revisited,October 2020,Dina Kassab,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economists have long praised the invisible hand of the market which harnesses consumers’ and corporations’ pursuit of self-interest to the pursuit of efficiency along with the view that, whenever externalities stand in the way of efficiency, the state corrects market failures and redistributes income and wealth since the distribution generated by markets has no reason to fit society’s moral standards. From this perspective, it was only natural to think that the State is the sole provider of public goods as their provision is subject to free-riding problems and hence cannot be left in the hands of individuals. However, governments under influence may fail to optimally correct externalities, or bend to wealthy agents’ opposition to redistributive policies. Governments may also fail due to inefficiency, high transaction costs or poor information. So citizens and corporations empower themselves and substitute for elected government. Individual and corporate social responsibility have risen as an alternative response to market and redistributive failures and the movement has gained momentum. The question now is: how to correct social responsibility failures or capitalize on their benefits? Many public goods are privately provided either through direct contributions by individuals or by firms as part of their marketing or business strategy, what we call Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR hereafter) practices. Formally, CSR is “a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on voluntary basis” (European Commission 2001). Provision of public goods using direct contributions has been studied extensively. In contrast, there has been relatively little work on private provision by firms. The general assumption of theoretical research in this area is that individuals choose between consumption of a private good and contributions to a pure public good. Yet individuals increasingly face a third option: consumption of impure public goods that generate private and public goods as a joint product. For example, instead of purchasing regular coffee, consumers have the option to purchase fair trade coffee, with a price premium, and thereby contribute to raising the living standards of farmers and farm workers and help develop the community through scholarship programs, healthcare services and quality improvement training. Thus consumers of fair trade purchase a joint product—coffee consumption and community development. The growing market for premium-priced products which are linked to social causes exemplify this idea. This is the case of cause-related marketingFootnote 1 and lump-sum corporate donations to or expenditures on worthy causes or green activities, which implicitly link the contribution to sales of the company’s products. Thus consumers of such products also purchase a joint product—consumption of the private good and investment in the social cause embraced by the firm. In all these examples, the joint product forms an impure public good, with both private and public characteristics. CSR activities being viewed as the corporate provision of a public good, it is a common practice in many economies that they enable tax exemptions. For instance, The Chilean government offers a variety of tax credits to corporations for charitable donations, most of which are oriented to support educational activities, such as schools, universities, and vocational institutions. Italy has introduced an ecolabelling scheme that provides the purchaser with a sales tax reduction on the purchase price of green products (Bell 2002). In the U.S, tax exemptions are designed so as to promote the adoption of hybrid-electric vehicles (Diamond 2009). The World Bank identifies those tax incentives as an effective means by which governments can fullfill their role in promoting CSR (Fox et al. 2002). Most recently, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in India specified CSR activities that enable tax exemptions.Footnote 2 The list included contributions made to the state disaster management authority to fight against Covid-19 and spending related to preventive healthcare and sanitation, while wages paid to workers even during the lockdown period and contributions made to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund does not qualify as CSR. The present paper investigates whether these exemptions are justified, given the nature of interdependence between the public good provided by the company and that provided through the government. For instance, should the same tax exemptions apply to a firm constructing a school for children in a poor neighbourhood and one that incorporates a number of billable hours for its employees to volunteer in public schools? Should the tax policy distinguish between a company donating to build a hospital for cancer patients and one that donates to paint the walls or provide complementary equipment for a public hospital? The understanding of CSR has matured among both scholars and practicioners. It is about time the focus of the analysis and debates shifts from the desirability and feasibility of CSR to the regulation of CSR, to get the most out of it. Firms’ intervention on the market to correct government failures is sometimes necessary, but so is the government’s intervention to correct CSR failures and capitalize on its benefits. In doing so, the regulator ought to draw a clear distinction between the different practices, according to whether they complement or substitute for the government provision of the public good. A priori, companies investing in clean energy resources, reducing carbon footprint or providing access to clean water in deprived areas and those enhancing work conditions for their employees or providing some paid staff time to charitable causes should receive a differential treatment, given the public policy objectives of course. The objective of this study is then three-fold: (i) to model consumers’ utility when consumption externalities and reputational concerns are relevant, (ii) to compare the effects of an ad valorem tax vis-à-vis a specific one in a market with CSR, and (iii) to provide guidelines for policy makers to determine the optimal way to intervene on a market with CSR activities. Our model examines a market consisting of consumers with heterogenous preferences towards CSR in a monopoly market where consumers account for how they are perceived when they make their purchasing decision. All along, we assume that only those who buy a firm’s product experience a warm-glow and prestige utility and pay for it. CSR being a public good, non-buyers free ride on the warm glow of buyers to derive a social utility from CSR. A benevolent regulator intervenes on the market by imposing either an ad valorem or a specific tax, the collected tax revenues are then recycled in the form of the government provision of a public good, which can either complement or substitute for the CSR investments of the monopolist. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, when private and public investments are substitutes, tax exemptions of CSR activities are justified, and an ad valorem subsidy is welfare superior to a specific one, only when both consumers’ social consciousness and reputational concerns are sufficiently low. Second, taxing the product with a public add-on, when consumers are sufficiently altruistic, is welfare improving. Third, the more concerned consumers are about their social image the larger the gains from a specific tax, relative to an ad valorem one. The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a literature review. Section 2 introduces the basic model. Section 3 contrasts the effects of an ad valorem versus a specific commodity tax when the good in question has a public add-on. The welfare maximizing taxes are examined in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",

The role of these flows in valuation and decision making is exacerbated when assessing benefits related to conservation measures. Perceived and actual conservation benefits accrue relatively slowly after measure implementation compared to costs, which are typically borne immediately. Such tradeoffs require valuation survey respondents intertemporal choice making thus including time preferences in the valuations. Time preferences are manifested in cost–benefit analysis by the choice of a discount rate. The economic feasibility of a lengthy environmental restoration or conservation project with immediate (opportunity) costs and a slow flow of benefits over time is sensitive to the choice of discount rate (Vasquez-Lavin et al. 2019) and its form. While the appropriate social discount rate in cost–benefit analysis of intergenerational policy effects is a topic of discussion in itself (Freeman and Groom 2014; Groom et al. 2005), the discount rate and its form implicitly or explicitly expressed by the current generation remains an area with relatively few empirical examples. In valuation context the public’s discount rate has been studied by altering the time schedule for providing the good or the payments. The typical approach in analysing the effect of a payment schedule on willingness to pay, or the embedding effect in timing, has been to compare a lump-sum payment with some series of payments (Table 8, “Appendix”). The typical series include annual payments for ten years and an intermediate time period, while a group of studies (Brouwer et al. 2008; Kim and Haab 2009; Egan et al. 2015) have also tested perpetual payments. Previous stated preference valuation studies—contingent valuation and choice experiment studies have found implicit discount rates ranging between 20 and 270% (Table 8, “Appendix”). A direct comparison between the prior studies is challenging due to the difference in the valued environmental good and time schedules of the proposed change. However, it appears that willingness to pay (WTP) per payment occasion is rather insensitive to the number of payment occasions, i.e. the total WTP increases as a function of the presented number of payment occasions. Egan et al. (2015) recently called for investigation into how consumers consider payments in different settings and time horizons. Our study takes the challenge considering the effect of a varying payment schedule on a population level in connection with long-term environmental change in a mire conservation setting using choice experiments (CE). We focus on ecosystem services provided by mires in southern Finland up until the year 2050. Mire conservation produces a slowly increasing flow of benefits under natural processes, where conservation costs are borne up front via compensated voluntary and involuntary land acquisitions. This feature provides a possibility to analyse whether small delays in the payment schedule affect WTP while credibly maintaining the expected realization time of environmental outcomes. Delays in payment schedule may affect the stated preferences for mire protection attributes. Further, the setting allows analysing if taste heterogeneity changes by the payment schedule. Prior studies have commonly employed a constant discount rate over time, or exponential discounting. In the context of nature conservation this assumption suppresses values in the distant future (Vasquez-Lavin et al. 2019). Previous studies have demonstrated that consumers show signs of hyperbolic discounting, i.e. a ‘present bias’ where the discount rate decreases over time (Lew 2018). This behavior implies a lower discount rate for the far future than the near future. In other words, hyperbolic discounting behavior is more impatient (i.e. discount values heavily) for immediate benefit–cost tradeoffs but has more patience for benefit–cost tradeoffs that occur far in the future (Meyer, 2013a). In project evaluation, compared to exponential discounting, hyperbolic discounting behavior increases the importance of values accruing over a long run in decision making (Karp 2005; Karp and Tsur 2011). In this paper we explore both exponential and hyperbolic specifications of discounting. For measuring discount rates in stated preferences studies two approaches have been employed; an exogenous, or external approach (as in Viscusi et al. 2008 and Egan et al. 2015; Wange and He 2018), and an endogenous, or internal one (as in Bond et al. 2009; Andersson et al. 2013; Lew 2018). In the exogenous approach the discount rate is calculated outside the valuation model, while in the endogenous approach the discount rate is directly estimated within the valuation model by using sample-level variation in the benefits or the payment horizon. We use the endogenous approach to jointly estimate the implicit discount rates and preferences using choice experiment data. We explore the discount rate varying the payment schedule across the sample where payments are specified as either lump-sum payments of annual ten-year payments. To show the effect of delay of payments we propose respondents annual ten-year payments with three different time delays, i.e. 0, 3 and 6 years of delay. These treatments allow us to analyse the relative strength of the time-embedding effect in relation to understanding the role of payment timing in a more or less distant future period. Our findings will enhance the rather limited literature regarding the effect of payments using choice experiment data. Most of the relevant past studies refer to contingent valuation applications. By exploring whether a discount rate can be jointly estimated in choice modelling we aim to contribute to the discussion mainly raised in Egan et al. (2015) and Lew (2018) regarding the use of lump-sum vs annuals streams of payments. Also, by incorporating variation in the delay of payments we will explore whether the payment schedule follows a certain form of discounting. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in CE literature that investigates this. Unlike prior studies, we study the discount rates by time schedule treatments with a split sample design rather than looking at individual consumers’ time preferences. This makes our approach free of individual level survey anchoring effects in the time preference elicitation. Finally, we provide an addition to the literature on discount rates and welfare estimates for the conservation of northern European mire ecosystem services, filling an essential knowledge gap. We next describe the case study, data collection and choice experiment and the design of time-frame treatment in the data and methods section. The econometric models and discount rate calculation are explained in a respectively named section followed by the results and final discussion.",5

This relates our paper to other work in regulation theory showing the problem and complexity of regulating single decision variables when multiple margins are available (Smith 2012; Squires 2016). Good resource regulations can improve markets by recovering dissipated rents (Gordon 1954; Smith 1969), or by reducing incentives for socially wasteful investments (Homans and Wilen 1997). With decentralized production decisions, getting specific regulations right is difficult, getting them wrong is easy. Aquaculture has been one of the fastest growing food production sectors, but disease issues threaten future seafood supply growth (Stentiford et al. 2012). In Norwegian salmon aquaculture, the major current issue is the prevalence and spread of parasitic sea lice associated with salmon production (Smith et al. 2010; Asche et al. 2009; Abolofia et al. 2017). This has led to a stop in the issuance of new production licenses. Little research exists on aquaculture farmers responses to such a regulation, which is worrying as it is well known that private adaptations to regulations can lead to unintended consequences not consistent with the policy objective. It is the purpose of this paper is to investigate how farmers manage production licenses when regulators limit the number of licenses to address an environmental externality. The regulatory problem will be analyzed in the context of Norwegian salmon farming. We develop a simple economic model of salmon farming with externalities in production. Regulators set the number of production licenses, while private farmers decide on the use of their licenses, which for the salmon farming involves decisions on stocking of fish per license and harvest timing. We use a calibrated version of the model to show how restricting the number of available licenses raises the market price and shifts production efforts excessively towards higher stocking density. This will reduce the effectiveness of policy in addressing the externality. Specifically, the first-best welfare-maximizing allocation cannot be achieved by a regulation that only limits the number of licenses. Furthermore, limiting the number of licenses imposes a barrier to entry that can generate regulatory rents. This will further strengthen incentives to grow production along unregulated margins. The policy will privilege incumbent license owners and subsidize rather than tax the source of the externality. While specifying the exact social costs of the sea lice externality in Norwegian salmon farming is beyond the scope of this paper, we argue that the policy response of excessive stocking density is unlikely to be compatible with the objective of the policy. While a policy that reduces number of licenses will ultimately reduce the social cost of the externality through reducing aggregate production, the resulting more intensive use of the licenses makes it an inefficient means to reduce the social cost of the externality. The lesson from the first-best solution is that reducing number of licenses should be accompanied by regulations that addresses the incentives for excessive stocking, such as a per fish production fee. The results in this paper is applicable to licensed production where producers are free to decide the use of their licenses. This includes most of aquaculture production. In Norway, the major environmental concern is the growth and spread of sea lice parasites (Abolofia et al. 2017). Sea lice has a direct private cost for farmers (such as increased mortality and regulatory imposed treatment costs), but also a social cost by adversely affecting the health of wild fish stocks, as well as cross farm location contagion (Krkošek et al. 2005, 2007; Torrissen et al. 2013). Number of fish at farm locations raises the abundance of sea lice and the rate of spread of lice between farms (Kragesteen et al. 2019; Jansen et al. 2012). As such, private stocking decisions are related to both private and social costs of sea lice abundance. We provide empirical evidence that stopping the issuance of new licenses did not stop salmon production growth. Rather, production growth continued, although at a lower rate, through higher stocking of fish per license. Furthermore, because of the maximum standing biomass restriction on each license, the higher stocking induced by the policy has led to a shortening of the grow-out period and smaller harvested fish. Restrictive licensing that limits entry can create regulatory rents that will reward the incumbent license owners, risking potentially subsidizing negative externalities. This is consistent with what has been the development in the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry since around 2011. Strong demand for salmon with limited opportunities to grow production has supported high profitability in the industry. Norway currently has a resource tax on petroleum income and has been evaluating the basis for such a tax in salmon farming. Our findings suggest that the rent in salmon farming is not a resource rent, but a regulatory rent. The tax should be justified based on efficiently regulating negative externalities, not as a transfer of resource rent to the public as for the petroleum tax. For the sea lice issue, the proper Pigouvian tax requires an assessment of the social cost of any negative effects of production on the health of wild fish stocks, as well as any excess costs due to cross farm location contagion. Our main findings highlight the difficulty of efficiently limiting production growth by restricting number of licenses without also addressing other available production margins. This relates our paper to other work in regulation theory showing the problem and complexity of regulating single decision variables when multiple margins are available (Smith 2012; Squires 2016). Good resource regulations can improve markets by recovering dissipated rents (Gordon 1954; Smith 1969), or by reducing incentives for socially wasteful investments (Homans and Wilen 1997). With decentralized production decisions, getting specific regulations right is difficult, getting them wrong is easy. Previous research on environmental issues in aquaculture has focused on the sustainability of aquaculture growth and its wider environmental impact (Naylor et al. 2000; Ashley 2007; Naylor et al. 2009; Meijboom and Bovenkerk 2013; Olesen et al. 2011). Comparatively little research exists on the problem of regulating aquaculture production to deal with externalities. Some insights can be found in the literature on regulations in fisheries. For instance, research here has shown that restricting fishing vessel inputs leads vessels to substitute unregulated for regulated inputs to maintain catches (Squires 1987, 1994; Dupont 1991). Research suggests that regulating a single fishery can generate spillovers from regulated to unregulated sectors (Squires and Kirkley 1991; Asche et al. 2007; Chan and Pan 2016). Similarly, Cunningham et al. (2016) show that restrictions on efforts in one region can free up capital that is reallocated spatially to another region. Deacon et al. (2010) investigate substitution towards an unrestricted input when the fishery is subject to restricted entry and season length. Amongst other findings, they show that a higher price can reduce rents by raising efforts along the unregulated margin leading to a necessary shortening of the season length and a raise in total cost due to lower capacity utilization. We investigate the intensive use of aquaculture licenses when number of production license is regulated, allowing for explicit private cost as well as social cost escalations due to private responses. Policy spillover effects can occur when regulations are compartmentalized while private decisions are multifaceted. With stronger property rights, more complete regulations are possible, however when specific controls rather than objectives are targeted, unintended effects are likely to manifest.",11

In order to achieve this goal, market-based instruments, such as carbon taxes, cap-and-trade systems or fossil fuel subsidy reforms, are frequently recommended by leading economists such as Nicolas Stern and Joseph Stiglitz (High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices 2017). Economic theory highlights that these instruments are environmentally effective and economically efficient (Pigou 1920; Nordhaus 1991; Pearce 1991).Footnote 1 In 2018, 51 carbon pricing schemes, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems were implemented or planned, covering 20 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions (World Bank and Ecofys 2018), albeit at carbon prices well below those that are considered to be in line with the targets of the Paris Agreement. Numerous countries also apply taxes or levies on fossil fuel use, for instance for transportation or heating. Even though these are not directly proportional to the carbon content, they nevertheless provide an incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Commitment was made to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies by the G20 in 2009 at the Pittsburgh summit (G20 Leaders Statement 2009) and several reforms have been enacted in recent years.Footnote 2 (IEA and OECD 2017). The distributional impacts of carbon and energy taxes however strongly influence the political acceptability (Baumol and Oates 1988; Baranzini et al. 2000; Tiezzi 2005). Regressive distributional impacts harm vulnerable groups and decrease the likelihood of policies being implemented and sustained (Parry 2015). Social equity concerns can thus quickly dominate the public debate if energy prices increase (Shammin and Bullard 2009). For example, the incidence and the distributional impacts of the repealed Australian carbon tax were subject to public and academic debate (Rahman 2013; Sajeewani et al. 2015). The progressive Nigerian fuel and petrol subsidy reform in 2012 even resulted in mass protests and strikes which led to a partial reimplementation (Soile and Mu 2015; Lockwood 2015; Dorband et al. 2017).Footnote 3 The literature on the distributional impacts of climate policies provides ambiguous results. Many studies find an overall tendency for regressive impacts (Araar et al. 2011; Gonzalez 2012). Others detect mostly regressive findings for developed countries while developing countries show an inconsistent picture with a tendency towards proportional or progressive impacts (Verde and Tol 2009; Wang et al. 2016). Nevertheless, progressive impacts have also been shown for developed countries like Australia (Sajeewani et al. 2015), Canada (Dissou and Siddiqui 2014) and Spain (Labandeira et al. 2009). Previous literature reviews provide initial insights but do not systematically explain outcome heterogeneity, i.e. what drives the differences in results of studies. Wang et al.(2016) have conducted the most comprehensive literature review on distributional impacts of carbon prices so far. They consider distributional impacts across households differing by income, location and demographic characteristics. This broad scope provides valuable insights into various dimensions of distributional impacts. However, a common problem ailing most literature reviews is the lack of explicit or transparent selection and evaluation criteria for their study sets as well as rigorous methods for analysis of observed variation, which exposes them to the criticism of subjectivity and a lack of validity. The literature on meta-analysis is littered with examples that show how traditional literature reviews and vote-counting approaches can be misleading and inconsistent in their assessment of the state-of-art (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012; Ringquist 2013). We focus our analysis on distributional impacts across household income groups. This narrow scope allows the use of a meta-analysis to quantitatively determine the sources of variation in the study outcomes.Footnote 4 Thus far, meta-analyses have mainly been applied in the fields of education and medicine, but organizations like the Campbell Collaboration or the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence have tried to establish rigorous quality standards and mainstream such work in the social and environmental sciences. In fact, there is an increasing volume of meta-analyses in social science including environmental economics (Moeltner et al. 2007; Nelson and Kennedy 2009; Tunçel and Hammitt 2014). This study applies an ordered probit meta-analysis framework to 53 original studies covering economy-wide and transport sector climate mitigation policies, providing 183 effects in 39 countries. We analyze all market-based policies that affect the price of fossil fuels, regardless of whether these are put into place for climate change mitigation (e.g. a carbon tax, an explicit price on the carbon) or a different purpose, such as generating public revenues (e.g. excises taxes on fuels). We also include studies that address fossil fuel subsidy removals, as the absence of a Pigouvian tax can also be regarded to constitute a (so-called ’post-tax’) subsidy (Coady et al. 2017). We include moderator variables accounting for different policies, modeled economic effects, and countries, while controlling for a publication bias and a time trend. We find a significantly increased likelihood of progressive study outcomes for lower income countries and transport policies. The same applies to study designs considering indirect effects, demand-side adjustments of consumers, or lifetime income proxies. In contrast, we find that subsidy reforms are not inherently more progressive than carbon pricing instruments. We structure the remainder of this paper as follows: Section 2 elaborates our four key hypotheses with respect to theory and literature findings. Section 3 describes the data selection process, explains the variables and introduces the quantitative model. Section 4 presents the main results while Sect. 5 discusses and concludes the findings.",49

Empirical research shows that farmers engage in certain environmental activity without any payment which suggest that intrinsic and social goals play a role (see e.g., Mills et al. 2018). In parallel there is emerging evidence of “an environmentally compatible nature of good farming identity” (e.g., Riley 2016). Whereas the relevance of behavioural factorsFootnote 1 has been acknowledged in recent policy reports at national and international levels, their potential has so far been underused in agri-environmental policy design (Lourenço et al. 2016; OECD 2017). Voluntary green payment policies are increasingly used as an instrument to enhance the supply of environmental public goods from land that remains in agricultural production (OECD 2015; Arguedas and van Soest 2011; Anthon et al. 2010). In the European Union, for example, it has been mandatory for EU member states to offer farmers voluntary agri-environmental schemes since the early 1990s. It has been suggested that incentives leveraging the non-financial behavioural factors that have a bearing on farmers’ uptake of more sustainable practices would enable better results in delivering environmental and public goods and more cost-effective approaches.Footnote 2 Analysis of farmers’ underlying motives could help to propose policy directions to move farmers from ‘tick box compliance’ (with regulatory requirements of voluntary agri-environmental schemes) to a committed environmental stewardship with better and more sustained ecological outcomes (Lokhorst et al. 2011). Such an analysis is reported in what follows. We first report on empirical work that supports the assumptions underlying our proposed policy design. Results from an incentivized survey (Krupka and Weber 2013) provide confirmation of the existence of a social norm of environmental concern among farmers in Scotland. In addition, a choice experiment with the same sample shows that public recognition of their environmental activity is worth £3.85 per hectare to the farmers on average. In our theoretical model, we start by distinguishing ‘green’ farmers from ‘brown’ farmers based on their relative intrinsic preference for money. ‘Green’ farmers are less concerned about monetary compensation for taking biodiversity protection action on the private farmland than are ‘brown’ farmers. In the presence of asymmetric information about the true types, a standard mechanism would prescribe a menu of contracts and, following the Revelation Principle, each type of farmer would self-select their appropriate contracts. Such a menu of contracts is useful to resolve adverse selection problems: a regulator should not pay a green farmer to avoid motive crowding-out and should not pay a brown farmer who wants to ‘buy’ reputation (see e.g., Bénabou and Tirole 2006; Ariely et al. 2009; Bowles and Hwang 2008; Banerjee and Shogren 2012; Arce 2013). However, this standard mechanism may fail to engage the ‘green’ farmer as it provides no public recognition for this farmer’s conservation activities—relative reputation matters too (Ellingsen and Johannesson 2008; Vesterlund 2003; Bénabou and Tirole 2011). Second, it does not necessarily ensure an increase in ecological outcomes for ‘green’ farms. A ‘green’ farmer may not have the appropriate knowledge to enhance conservation further despite being truly green and motivated. To address these two issues, our mechanism incorporates a social reward with a facilitative service. Social rewards without any monetary element, are visible, provide social recognition, and help improve self-esteem (see Frey 2006). Moreover, social rewards work in the competitive environment of a tournament with winners or losers at the end. Everyone in the particular environment knows that the award exists and that winners are typically honoured in a public ceremony. This makes it a powerful motivation as is well-known from the literature on labour economics (see Lacetera and Macis 2010; Kosfeld and Neckermann 2011). We consider a social reward along the facilitation service as a status incentive in our model. The social award would be in the form of publicity at the national level combined with the invitation to a specialised, environmental leadership program to work closely with professional and highly motivated facilitators to further improve the conservation practices on the individual farm.Footnote 3 The environmental leadership program would be highly selective and available to the green farmers only giving them the opportunity for social esteem. At the same time such an initiative could also help to move greenways the descriptive norm (i.e., what most farmers do). Farmers are trained in agricultural production and have seldom experienced specific training or education in environmental management. Yet managing land for environmental outcomes requires a different set of skills and knowledge (Batáry et al. 2015). We design a menu of contracts that offers monetary incentives and non-monetary incentives (i.e., facilitation service with social reward) to induce both type of farmers to join the scheme and to take the optimal biodiversity protection action on the farmland (i.e., equivalent to the optimal action under symmetric information). In other words, our menu of contracts offers incentive compatible monetary and non-monetary incentives for different types of farmers keeping their action level at the symmetric information optimal action level in the contract. Results show that in the presence of asymmetric information, a regulator can implement the symmetric information optimal level of biodiversity protection action in both cases by offering a  menu of monetary contracts without and with facilitation service and social reward. In the first case, a green-farmer selects the optimal level (i.e., the same as in the complete information case) of monetary compensation and a brown-farmer extracts information rent. In the latter case, a green farmer receives a social reward only (i.e., no monetary payments) whereas the brown-farmer extracts information rents. In the latter case, more public good is created in the equilibrium and the regulator pays out less monetary compensation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the institutional background to our analysis. In Sect. 3, we present the empirical work to support the assumptions underlying our proposed policy design in Sect. 4. The concluding Sect. 5 discusses the main insights and the policy implications with reference to the debate on the post-2020 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU.",8

Lopes,Shady S. Atallah,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The article was published with several textual and typographical errors introduced during proofing. Under Section 1, Introduction, the following textual errors should be identified and noted: The text provide, should be noted as provides. Under Section 2, The Existence Value Model, the following textual errors should be identified and noted: The text tsource, should be noted as  to source. The text vue, should be noted as value. The text foowing, should be noted as following. In the same section the following should be noted: Equation (8) implies that in steady-state, the resource is neither growing nor diminishing over time or that harvest equals the growth in each t. Using the fact that ρ = 1/(1 + δ) and rearranging Eqs. (6), (7), and (8) we derive Eq. (9). The text, rource, should be noted as resource. The text th, should be noted as than. The capitalized text, Wean, should be noted as We can. In the same sentence, the text, mel should be noted as, model. In the same section, the following sentence should be noted as follows: In Section 3.1, we will assume functional forms for π(∙), V(∙), and F(∙), and calibrate the model for the tiger population in the BRT tiger reserve in southwestern India with the resident Soligas tribe. Under Section 3 Applying the Model to a Tiger Population and a Resident Tribe. The first two opening sentences should read as follows: In this section, we will apply the model to the Soligas tribe and the tiger population in the BRT. Our baseline scenario is taken to represent the current situation in the BRT wherein the Soligas have community rights in accordance with the Forest Rights Act and all poaching is subject to a penalty as per the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. The second paragraph in the same section should read as follows: We define \(p\) as the per unit price of the harvested resource and \(c\) as a harvest cost parameter. Harvesting the tiger resource attracts a poaching penalty, and with this penalty in place, there is a chance that the harvester would be caught poaching by conservation authorities. We presume that a greater amount of illegal activity increases the chance of being caught (Copeland and Taylor 2009). We consider an exponential probability density function (Pishro-Nik 2014) of the following form: \(\omega \left( {Y_{t} ,X_{t} } \right) = \left( {Y_{t} /X_{t} } \right)e^{{\left( {\theta \left( {1 - Y_{t} /X_{t} } \right)} \right)}}\). In this probability density function we have \(\theta \le 0\) and \(X_{t} \ge Y_{t} \ge 0\), and it indicates that as illegal harvest increases so does the chance of being caught by conservation authorities. If the harvester is caught then a penalty of \(\$ B\) is imposed on her, and this enters as an expected payment that is deducted from her private net benefit. The text Fxistence should be noted as For the existence. The fourth paragraph should read as follows: For the discrete-time infinite horizon optimization problem in (10), one can set up the Lagrangean \(\left( {L^{B} } \right)\), derive the first-order necessary conditions in steady-state, and substitute \(Y = F\left( X \right) = rX\left( {1 - X/K} \right)\) to get the fundamental equation of renewable resources, \(\left( {\phi \left( {X, F\left( X \right);\delta ,B} \right) \equiv 0} \right)\) in Eq. (11); this fundamental equation accounts for the existence value within the tribe manager’s decision framework. After Eq. (11.1), the first sentence should read as follows: In Eq. (12), we consider the modalities of an alternative policy scenario where the tribe possesses land rights but there is no poaching penalty imposition. We therefore assume that \(\pi \left( {X_{t} ,Y_{t} } \right) = \left( {pY_{t} - \left( {c/2} \right)Y_{t}^{2} /X_{t} } \right)\). After Eq. (12), the second sentence should read as follows: The tribe manager explicitly accounts for the existence value in (13), whereas (13.1) represents the fundamental equation of renewable resources without the addition of existence value and therefore solves for the outcome of a harvester. In Table 1, the text Tence should be noted as Existence. After Table 1, the last sentence of the first full paragraph should read: The BRT Tiger Reserve is 540 km2 (KFD 2017), which implies a carrying capacity of \(K = \frac{540}{{6.25}} =\) 86 tigers. The BRT Tiger Reserve had approximately 35 tigers around 2010 (Varma 2015); accordingly, we assume \(X_{0} =\) 35. After Table 1, the text Asiderable should read A considerable amount. The text Fstly should read Firstly. The last paragraph of this section’s introduction should read: The numerical exercise will reveal if the system is already in a steady-state or not by seeing if the observed \(X_{0} = X^{*}\). Secondly, we will use the iterative map \(\left[ {X_{t + 1} = X_{t} + F\left( {X_{t} } \right) - Y_{t} } \right]\) to simulate the evolution of \(X\left( {\text{t}} \right)\) and examine if its approach path converges to \(X^{*}\) if the initial stock is not yet at the steady-state, i.e. if \(X_{0} \ne X^{*}\). We will examine the approach paths that represent tiger population dynamics under the various policy scenarios. Section 3.1 The title of this section should read: Tiger Dynamics Under Different Policy Scenarios. The first paragraph of Sect. 3.1.1 should read: The first policy scenario that we consider is one where the resident Soligas tribe has secure property rights to the tiger resource, faces penalty imposition for poaching, the tribe collectively manages the resource in a way that is not myopic, and where the existence value is included in the optimization problem. This scenario is designed to represent the current situation in the BRT. Equation (11) can be numerically solved to derive steady-state values \(\left( {X^{*} ,Y^{*} } \right)\) for the parameters in Table 1. \(B = \$ 769\) and \(\theta = - 5\) are the penalty function parameters where \(B\) is the penalty amount and \(\theta < 0\) yields a positive probability, i.e. \(e^{{\left( {\theta \left( {1 - Y_{t} /X_{t} } \right)} \right)}} \ge 0\). We accordingly derive \(X^{*} = 56.557\) and \(Y^{*} = F\left( {X^{*} } \right) = 0.968\). We use Solver at the same time to back out an existence value weight of \(\beta = 167.50\), which yields a steady-state existence value of \(\beta \ln \left( {X^{*} } \right) = 675.92\).Footnote 1 This numerical estimate of \(\beta\), which is backed out using a calibration that represents the current situation in the BRT, is essentially a revealed preference parameter that can be used to estimate the tiger’s spiritual ecosystem service value from the perspective of the Soligas tribe manager. Using this perspective, the \(\beta\) value is unique to the Soligas, given the current situation in the BRT. Thus, \(\beta = 167.50\) would be applicable to any policy scenario, and as such would be considered a given value that represents the Soligas preferences, regardless of policy regime shifts. The text Aing should read After having. Eq. (14) should read: subject to \(X_{t + 1} = X_{t} + rX_{t} \left( {1 - X_{t} /K} \right) - Y_{t}\) and \(X_{0} > 0\) given. The paragraph after Eq. (15) should read: The final function can be thought of as the value of maintaining \(X_{T}\) for \(t = T, T + 1, \ldots ,\infty\) by harvesting \(Y_{t} = rX_{T} \left( {1 - X_{T} /K} \right)\) for the rest of time in steady-state. With \(Y_{t} = rX_{T} \left( {1 - X_{T} /K} \right)\) being a constant, it can be factored out of the infinite series with the present value converging to \(\psi \left( {X_{T} } \right)\). Using the parameters in Table 1, assuming an initial value of \(X_{0} = 35\), \(T = 60\) years, and assigning initial value guesses for \(\left\{ {Y_{t} } \right\}_{t = 0}^{t = 59} = 0.10\), we numerically estimate the approach paths of \(X\left( t \right)\) and \(Y\left( t \right)\) over the horizon of \(T = 60\) years. Using Solver, we find convergence to a maximum value for the objective function, \({\mathbb{E}}\left[ {W^{B} } \right] = 8691.1\). Moreover, we note that \(X_{t} = 56.5\) as \(t \to 60\), which implies that the approach path of the resource stock indeed approaches the steady-state value of \(X^{*}\) as derived from Eq. (11). This approach path of \(X_{t}\) is shown in Fig. 2. This policy result would correspond to the implicit equation \(\phi_{2} \left( {X, Y;\delta } \right)\) or \(\phi_{3} \left( {X, Y;\delta } \right)\) in Fig. 1 that yielded steady-state equilibriums over time. The dotted line in Fig. 2 depicts the approach path of \(X_{t}\) without the existence value; in this scenario the existence value, \(\beta \ln \left( {X_{t} } \right)\), drops out of the optimization framework according to Eq. (11.1). The dotted line approach path allows one to examine the effect of excluding existence value from the tribe manger’s decision framework. (Note: Following this paragraph, the incomplete sentence “proach paths of X(t). with and without existence value in the presence of secure property rights for Soligas and poaching penalties.” should be ignored as it is a repeat of the title of Fig. 2.) The paragraph after Eq. (17) should read: This first-order necessary condition can be solved numerically using Solver to equate it to zero by finding the harvest \(Y_{t}\), with \(X_{t}\) treated as a parameter. One would note that the existence value \(\beta \ln \left( {X_{t} } \right)\) does not feature in this myopic harvester’s decision as per Eq. (17). Once again, the initial resource stock is \(X_{0} = 35\) tigers. Once Solver yields the initial harvest, \(Y_{0}\), the iterative map \(\left[ {X_{t + 1} = X_{t} + F\left( {X_{t} } \right) - Y_{t} } \right]\) is called upon to derive \(X_{1}\), and the exercise is repeated for \(t = 1, 2, \ldots , T\). In the approach path shown in Fig. 3, we observe that the resource stock \(X_{t} \to 0\) and tiger extinction in the BRT occurs in 49 years. Extinction occurs in consonance with the implicit equation, \(\phi_{1} \left( {X, Y;\delta } \right) = 0\), that yielded localized tiger extinction in the phase diagram of Fig. 1. This implies that extinction is optimal when poaching is driven up by the harvester’s myopic behavior with a high discount rate \(\delta\) that results in \(X\) growing slower than the offtake. Section 3.1.3 The title of this section should read: Secured Property Rights with no Poaching Penalty. The first paragraph of this section should read: The third policy scenario that we consider is one where the resident Soligas tribe has secure property rights to the tiger resource and the tribe collectively manages the resource in a way that is not myopic as under Scenario 3.1.1, and that includes the existence value in the optimization problem. The departure from Scenario 3.1.1 is the absence of a poaching penalty. The parameter values in Table 1 are substituted into Eq. (13) to numerically solve for the steady-state values of resource stock \(\left( {X^{*} } \right)\) and harvest \(\left( {Y^{*} } \right)\) by using Solver. Under Scenario 3.1.1, we backed out the value of \(\beta\) as \(167.50\); this weight is the preference parameter of the Soligas tribe as to the tiger’s existence. Using Solver, the steady-state equilibrium values we derive are \(X^{*} = 56.003\) and \(Y^{*} = F\left( {X^{*} } \right) = 0.976\), with \(\beta\) set at \(167.50\). This situation would correspond to the implicit equation \(\phi_{2} \left( {X, Y;\delta } \right)\) or \(\phi_{3} \left( {X, Y;\delta } \right)\) in Fig. 1 that yielded steady-state equilibriums over time. The existence weight of \(\beta = 167.50\) yields a steady-state existence value of \(\beta \ln \left( {X^{*} } \right) = 674.27\); this value is not meaningfully different from the 675.92 derived under Scenario 3.1.1. Next, we examine the resource’s approach path when \(X_{0} \ne X^{*}\) by using the final function method described earlier. In order to do this, we revisit the tribe manager’s optimization problem listed in Eq. (12) and rewrite it as Eq. (18). The sentence before Eq. (19) should read: The objective function \(W^{f}\) is the sum of the present value of net benefits over time \(t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots ,T - 1\) and a final function, Eq. (19); i.e., the value of maintaining \(X_{T}\) for \(t = T, T + 1, \ldots ,\infty\) by harvesting \(Y_{t} = rX_{T} \left( {1 - X_{T} /K} \right)\) for the rest of time in steady-state. The paragraph after Eq. (20) should read: The first-order necessary condition yields the optimal harvest as \(Y_{t} = \left( {p/c} \right)X_{t}\) in each \(t\). Note the similarity with scenario 3.1.2 under which the existence value \(\beta \ln \left( {X_{t} } \right)\) does not feature in the myopic harvester’s decision. We use the parameters from Table 1 to derive the approach path of \(X\left( t \right)\) in this policy scenario, i.e., without secure property rights to the sacred tiger resource. This approach path is shown in Fig. 5 with a starting value of \(X_{0} = 35\) tigers. We observe that the resource stock \(X_{t} \to 0\) and localized tiger extinction in the BRT occurs as \(t \to 38\) years. The absence of a poaching penalty in this policy scenario hastens extinction by 11 years compared to what was observed in the approach path in Fig. 3. Likewise, extinction occurs in consonance with the implicit equation, \(\phi_{1} \left( {X, Y;\delta } \right) = 0\), in Fig. 1. In Table 2, the text oaching should read poaching. (Note: Please refer to the PDF document supplied for instances where periods that were added during the production process - after variable names and equations in the middle of sentences - should be removed throughout the article.)",
78.0,3.0,Environmental and Resource Economics,24 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-021-00536-2,Systematic Variation in Waste Site Effects on Residential Property Values: A Meta-Regression Analysis and Benefit Transfer,March 2021,Marvin Schütt,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The world’s annual generation of waste equalled two billion tonnes in 2016 and is expected to reach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050 (Kaza et al. 2018). This poses serious threats to the environment in general and may generate externalities for residents living in close proximity to a waste site. These externalities include health risks, offensive smells, noises or unpleasant views (Giusti 2009). However, well-administered waste sites may nullify these adverse effects, indeed they may even be perceived positively due to their employment potential. Accordingly, it is important to understand whether and under what circumstances waste sites significantly affect local residents. The hedonic pricing framework pioneered by Rosen (1974) is a prominent method used to evaluate the effect of waste sites on local residents.Footnote 1 Studies relying on this concept explain the price variation in residential properties as a combination of the value of their respective characteristics, e.g., distance from a waste site. Empirical evidence on this price-distance relationship, however, is ambiguous. The literature displays high variance in its assessment of the magnitude and significance of the effect as well as disagreement on its sign (see e.g. Reichert et al. 1992; Du Preez et al. 2016; Poor et al. 2007 and Ready 2010 for landfill effects). Accordingly, it remains unclear whether waste site externalities significantly affect local residents. In response to these open questions, I apply meta-analytic techniques (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012; Ringquist 2013) to investigate the existence of adverse price effects on proximate residential property values at the aggregate level. The heterogeneity of the empirical results is discussed and explained with reference to the differences in methodological approaches and waste-site characteristics across the literature. Relative to previous meta-analyses on this subject (e.g. Braden et al. 2011; Simons and Saginor 2006), estimates are corrected for publication bias and the ability of the meta-regression model to produce reliable benefit-transfer (BT) estimates is assessed. BT can be an especially valuable tool for policymakers in making predictions on effect sizes in areas where time, data, or money constraints do not permit primary studies (Johnston et al. 2015). The present meta-regression analysis (MRA) builds on a meta-sample of 727 observations from 83 studies, going beyond previous MRAs in this area by using 56 studies hitherto unconsidered. The large sample also enables me to add nine moderators to explore new factors explaining heterogeneity. In the framework of cost–benefit analyses, the MRA can support policymakers in making informed decisions on such things as the placement of new waste sites or clean-up activities for hazardous waste sites. The results confirm that proximity to severely contaminated waste sites has a supremely negative impact on residential property values, whereas on average the distance from non-hazardous waste sites has no effect. Correcting for publication bias has a sizeable impact, reducing the average effect size by up to 38%. The corrected average effect size translates into a 1.5% to 2.9% property value increase per mile of increased distance from a waste site for a house at the distance of one mile. Together with waste-site and study characteristics, the primary studies’ econometric specifications are identified as important dimensions influencing effect size and explaining observed heterogeneity. In particular, the effect size is reduced for cleaned-up waste sites and for residential properties at greater distances from hazardous waste sites, thus reconciling inconsistent previous findings. BT errors based on the meta-regression model are fairly large and, in line with the broader literature, outperform simple value transfer when the underlying data sample is heterogeneous. While the acceptable level of transfer error is context-dependent (Rosenberger 2015; Brander et al. 2006), the predicted levels of transfer error limit practical application accordingly. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: The next section presents an overview of results from previous MRAs on this subject, in addition illustrating the requirements for valid and reliable MRA and BT. Section 3 introduces the meta-dataset used in this paper. Section 4 demonstrates the selection of the appropriate model and publication bias control. The results are presented and discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",5

Globally they are among the most destructive natural hazards. From 1980 to 2018 tropical cyclones were responsible for nearly half of all natural disaster losses worldwide, with damage amounting to an aggregate of USD 2111 billion (Munich Re 2018). Driven by climate change, at least in some ocean basins (Elsner et al. 2008; Mendelsohn et al. 2012), and the higher exposure of people in large urban agglomerations near oceans (World Bank 2010), the overall damage and the number of people affected by tropical cyclones have been increasing since the 1970s (Guha-Sapir and CRED 2020). Thus, tropical cyclones are and will continue to be a serious threat to the life and assets of a large number of people worldwide. In order to design effective mitigation and adaptation disaster policies to this threat, it is important to understand the economic impact of natural disasters. Economic sectors most vulnerable to direct capital destruction of tropical cyclones must be identified. However, time-delayed effects must also be taken into account since some damage, such as supply-chain interruptions or demand-sided impacts, will only be visible after a certain time lag (Kousky 2014; Botzen et al. 2019). Perhaps the most challenging task is to identify critical sectors that may be responsible for widespread spillover effects leading to substantial modifications in other sectors’ production input schemes. This study aims to better understand the sectoral impacts of tropical cyclones by looking at the direct and indirect effects in a large data set covering 205 countries from 1970 to 2015. Additionally, a new damage measure is developed that considers the varying levels of exposure of different sectors. From a theoretical perspective, a natural disaster can have both positive and negative effects. Direct negative impacts can result from the destruction of productive capital, infrastructure, or buildings, and thereby can generate a negative income shock for the whole economy (Kousky 2014). Positive effects include, for instance, as a consequence of the destruction of capital, that the marginal productivity of capital increases, making it more attractive to invest in capital in the affected area (Klomp and Valckx 2014). Furthermore, a shortage in the labor force can lead to a wage increase, which can serve as an incentive for workers from other regions to migrate to the affected region, also leading to a positive effect (Hallegatte and Przyluski 2010). Given the different theoretical possibilities, it is not surprising that the empirically identified effects are rather ambiguous. They can best be summarized by three possible hypotheses: recovery to trend, build-back-better, and no recovery (Chhibber and Laajaj 2008). The recovery to trend hypothesis characterizes a pattern where after a negative effect in the short run, the economy recovers to the previous growth path after some time. For example, Miranda et al. (2020) provide evidence that after hurricane strikes in Central America, a short-term negative growth period (12 months) is compensated by a positive recovery in the second year. Possible mechanisms for this situation are, for example, additional capital flows—such as remittances from relatives living abroad (Yang 2008)—international aid (de Mel et al. 2012), insurance payments (Nguyen and Noy 2019), or government spending (Ouattara and Strobl 2013), which help the economy reach its pre-disaster income level. Other studies identify negative effects that are only significant in the short run but are insignificant in the long run (Strobl 2012; Bertinelli and Strobl 2013; Elliott et al. 2015). The build-back-better hypothesis describes a situation where natural disasters first trigger a downturn of the economy, which is then followed by a positive stimulus, leading to a higher growth path than in the pre-disaster period. This hypothesis is supported by empirical findings for a positive GDP growth effect for Latin American countries (Albala-Bertrand 1993), for high-income countries (Cuaresma et al. 2008), and for a cross-section of 153 countries (Toya & Skidmore 2007). Additionally, Cole et al. (2019) find a build-back-better effect for plants that survived the 1995 Kobe earthquake and Mohan et al. (2019) demonstrate that there exist a short-term productivity efficiency increase after damaging hurricanes in the Caribbean. In contrast to this, the no recovery hypothesis states that natural disasters can lead to a permanent decrease of the income level without the prospect of reaching the pre-disaster growth path again.Footnote 1 This could result from a situation where recovery measures are not effectively implemented or where various negative income effects accumulate over time (Hsiang and Jina 2014; Onuma et al. 2020). Additionally, it has been shown, that low- and middle-income countries seem to be more vulnerable to the negative impacts of natural disasters than high-income countries (Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014; Berlemann and Wenzel 2018). This paper contributes to two strands of the literature. First, I add to the research area on the macroeconomic effects of disasters. Older empirical studies suffer to a large extent from endogeneity problems in their econometric analysis because their damage data are based on reports and insurance data, such as the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). Such data are positively correlated with GDP (Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014) and prone to measurement errors (Kousky 2014). More recent studies have started to use physical data, such as observed wind speeds, to generate a more objective damage function for the impacts of tropical cyclones (e.g., Hsiang 2010; Strobl 2011; Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014; Bakkensen et al. 2018; Elliott et al. 2019). To address the varying economic exposure of affected areas, studies have used population (Strobl 2012), nightlight intensity (Heinen et al. 2018) or exposed area (Hsiang and Jina 2014) to weight the respective physical intensities of tropical cyclones. However, an area weight has the disadvantage of including largely unpopulated areas, such as deserts, which are economically meaningless. In contrast, for the agricultural sector, it would be misleading to take a nighttime light or a population weight, since these areas have a rather low population density. Therefore, I propose a new damage measure that explicitly considers these different exposures. For the agricultural sector, I use the fraction of exposed agricultural land, while for the remaining sectors, I use the gridded population. Furthermore, only a minority of studies explicitly investigate the disasters’ influences on sectoral economic development. For example, Loayza et al. (2012) investigate the effect of natural disasters on three sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, service) in a global sample for the period 1961–2005. Based on damage estimates from EM-DAT, the authors find a negative effect for the agricultural and a positive effect for the industrial sector. Based on physical intensity data, Hsiang (2010) analyzes the effect of hurricanes on seven sectoral aggregates in a regional study for 26 Caribbean countries. He finds a negative effect for the ISIC sectors agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing (A&B), mining, and utilities (C&E), wholesale, retail trade, restaurants, and hotels (G–H), but a positive effect for the construction sector (F). Other studies analyze the disasters’ impact on single sectors, such as the agricultural (Blanc and Strobl 2016; Mohan 2017) or the manufacturing sector (Bulte et al. 2018). In total, I extend this research area in three ways: First, I introduce a new objective damage measure that allows for sector specific exposure of tropical cyclones. It is based on a physical wind model and thereby overcomes criticism of report-based damage data. Second, I use this new damage data to analyze all (exposed) countries (84) to tropical cyclones worldwide, which allows me to obtain more generalizable results.Footnote 2 Third, I conduct a thorough assessment of the long-term sectoral influences of tropical cyclones, as there is evidence, that long-term effects on total GDP exist (Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014; Hsiang and Jina 2014; Onuma et al. 2020). For sectoral GDP effects, however, no such evidence exists so far. Second and most importantly, I contribute to the literature on Input–Output analysis of natural disasters. While there exists a lot of theoretical work on the importance of cross-sectional linkages in consequence of a shock (see e.g., Dupor 1999; Horvath 2000; Acemoglu et al. 2012), recent empirical studies focus on the shock propagation in production networks within the United States of America (Barrot & Sauvagnat 2016) or after single natural disasters, such as the 2011 earthquake in Japan (Boehm et al. 2019; Cole et al. 2019). These empirical studies all share that they use firm-level data to draw conclusions on upstream and downstream production disruptions. However, little is known about the empirical Input–Output effects across broader sectors after a natural disaster shock. In a single country study on floods in Germany, Sieg et al. (2019) show that indirect impacts are nearly as high as direct impacts. For tropical cyclones, no empirical cross-country study on indirect effects exists so far. With this paper, I close this research gap by using an Input–Output panel data set to analyze potential sectoral interactions after the occurrence of a tropical cyclone. This allows me to analyze whether any key sectors exist that, if damaged, result in direct damage of other sectors. The main causal identification stems from the exogenous nature of tropical cyclones, whose intensity and position are difficult to predict even 24 h before they strike (NHC 2016). Based on a fine-gridded wind field model, I generate a new sector-specific damage measure weighted by either agricultural land use or population data. This exogenous measure allows me to identify an immediate negative growth effect of tropical cyclones for two out of seven sectoral aggregates including agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing and wholesale, retail trade, restaurants, and hotels. The largest negative impacts can be attributed to the annual growth in the agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing sector aggregate, where a standard deviation increase in tropical cyclone damage is associated with a decrease of 262 percentage points of the annual sectoral growth rate. This corresponds to a mean annual global loss of USD 16.7 billion (measured in constant 2005 USD) for the sample average. In the years following a tropical cyclone, the majority of sectors experience negative growth effects. Within the agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing sectors, the negative effects become less pronounced with a zero effect being present after four years, while the wholesale, retail trade, restaurants, and hotels sectoral aggregate experiences a persistent negative growth even after 20 years. Based on the Input–Output analysis, there are only a small number of significant sectoral shifts. This suggests that the production chains of the economy are only slightly disrupted by tropical storms, and indirect impacts are thus negligible. Nevertheless, we can learn from this analysis the important role of those manufacturing sectors that are not directly affected. They are responsible for a demand shock in the mining and quarrying sectoral aggregate, leading to delayed negative growth effects being persistent over 10 years. At the same time, other sectors demand more from the manufacturing sectors, resulting in a zero aggregate negative effect for them. Additionally, within the agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing sectors, only the fishing sector experiences indirect negative effects. Moreover, for the vast majority of sectors, the indirect effects do not last longer than one year. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 contains a description of the data source, introduces the construction of the tropical cyclone damage measure, and presents descriptive statistics. In Sect. 3, the empirical approach is described. Section 4 presents the main results as well as robustness checks. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of the results and highlights policy implications.",11

Across the African continent, hundreds of (pilot) initiatives have been rolled out—for either research purposes or commercial reasons—and in policy circles there is widespread support for efforts to promote the diffusion of insurance. The expectation is that the consumption-smoothing properties of insurance do not only enable smallholders to cope with adverse weather shocks without resorting to drastic measures such as selling key assets or taking children out of school, insurance can also be a catalyst for innovation and modernization of agriculture in Africa. An emerging literature suggests that the elimination of downside risk may “crowd in” modern technologies, which is widely perceived as a necessary condition for the modernization of African agriculture in rain-fed production areas. The majority of Africa’s poor reside in rural areas, and their economic fate depends on the performance of the agricultural sector (World Bank 2007; Dercon et al. 2014). Economic growth originating in the agricultural sector is the most effective way to lift people out of poverty. It has large multiplier effects in early stages of development (Haggblade et al. 2007), and raises income of the poor more than growth originating elsewhere in the economy—especially for the poorest, and especially in early stages of development (Christiaensen et al. 2010), Moreover, various forward and backward linkages imply that agriculture may stimulate economic modernization elsewhere in society. However, while pockets of adoption and diffusion certainly exist, the adoption of modern technologies—including the uptake of improved varieties and fertilizer—has remained low (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). As argued below, this situation may be remedied by the diffusion of insurance. However, as also argued below, such a process will involve extensive subsidization by the public sector as market-based diffusion of insurance remains very incomplete. The main objective of this paper is to critically evaluate the expectation that the promotion of insurance will raise welfare in rural communities. While this conventional wisdom is intuitive, as expansion of the market for insurance implies relaxing a binding constraint for rural households and farms, we demonstrate it is flawed. Our theoretical model suggests the reverse may be true, or at least that the welfare effects of the uptake of insurance are typically ambiguous. We derive conditions under which adoption of insurance will reduce (expected) income and result in environmental degradation—attenuating any utility gains from consumption smoothing, and perhaps even reversing them. The reason for these adverse effects is the second-best nature of the institutional context within which insurance is traded. We develop a theoretical model, based on standard economic assumptions, to demonstrate how (index-based) drought insurance accentuates pre-existing inefficiencies, and may lower welfare. The case we consider is index-based livestock insurance, and the second-best nature of the context is provided by the assumption that property rights to grazing land are imperfectly defined (or enforced). Individual herders gain from expanding their herd while sharing the cost of overgrazing with others. In this context, the adoption of insurance implies an incentive to over-stock beyond socially optimal levels. A new Nash equilibrium eventuates where all herders may be worse off than before, and where the common grazing ground has been depleted. Qualitatively similar processes may occur in the context of index based crop insurance as long as the following conditions are satisfied: (i) property rights to the natural environment are imperfect, (ii) insurance promotes intensification of farm management and increases pressure on the environment, and (iii) environmental quality enters the production or utility function of farmers (or both). We believe these conditions are general, and include cases such as the over-use of chemical inputs. The focus on index-based livestock insurance is relevant as such schemes have recently been initiated in, for example, Mongolia, Kenya and Ethiopia. Similar initiatives may start up in other African countries, including Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe (Castell 2017). Pastoralists who are affected by these initiatives are among the world’s poorest; they live under quite adverse conditions and are vulnerable to weather shocks. For information about the design and impact of index-based livestock insurance, refer to Chantarat et al. (2007), Chantarat et al. (2013), and for a simulation analysis of the welfare effects, refer to Chantarat et al. (2017). Importantly, the latter study does not include the mechanism that is our focus—the incentive for pastoralists to increase herd size, causing degradation of the pasture. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the recent literature on the insurance revolution that sweeps the African landscape. In Sect. 3 we sketch the components of our theoretical model. We set up the pastoralists’ optimal stocking problem with and without insurance, and compare outcomes to the socially optimal stocking rate. In Sect. 4 we add vegetation dynamics, and evaluate the overall welfare effects. We also provide a simple numerical illustration. The discussion and conclusions ensue.",2

First, despite the Paris Agreement in December 2015 to limit global warming to less than 2 \(^{\circ }\)C above pre-industrial levels, there is still no global climate treaty which prescribes legally binding emission caps for individual countries. Many countries communicated their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Footnote 1 However—as opposed to the previous Kyoto Protocol—there is no legal enforcement mechanism if a set target is not achieved, and it remains to be seen how the NDCs will eventually lead to global emission pricing at stringent levels. Given the bleak prospects for globally coordinated stringent emission pricing, tariffs on the embodied carbon of goods imported from regions with lax or no emission regulations are considered as an important policy measure to foster the efficacy of unilateral emission pricing.Footnote 2 Second, the global economy has undergone a substantial structural change regarding patterns of production, consumption, and trade. In particular, trade in carbon embodied in goods increased markedly until the 2007–2008 financial crisis due to the increased off-shoring of emission-intensive production from developed countries to developing countries and has plateaued afterward. The CO2 intensity of traded goods, on the other hand, has decreased substantially. At the same time, (emission-intensive) electricity as a major input in production has gained importance, especially in developing regions. Against these developments, we evaluate the performance of embodied carbon tariffs as a complementary instrument to unilateral carbon pricing. To date, the most comprehensive approach for transnational emission pricing is the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which entered into force in 2005, setting a cap on carbon emissions from energy-intensive sectors within the EU. In parallel, the number of jurisdictions—national and sub-national—where emission pricing instruments have been implemented has markedly increased over the past decade but still covers only 20–25% of global GHG emissions (Métivier et al. 2018; World Bank 2018).Footnote 3 The world community is thus still far off from comprehensive and harmonized GHG emission pricing. It is rather likely that a situation with stringent emission regulation in industrialized countries and no or weaker emission regulation in the developing world will prevail for quite some time. However, a critical drawback of such disparate emission regulation is carbon leakage, i.e., the relocation of emissions from regulating countries to parts of the world economy subject to no or weaker regulation (Hoel 1991; Felder and Rutherford 1993). Leakage can occur through two main interrelated channels: the competitiveness channel and the fossil-fuel price channel.Footnote 4 As to the competitiveness channel, carbon pricing increases the production cost of emission-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) sectors that lose in competitiveness against foreign un- or less regulated industries both on the domestic market as well as on foreign markets. This leads to production shifts in EITE sectors from regulated to unregulated regions, i.e., (positive) carbon leakage. The fossil-fuel price channel occurs when unilateral carbon pricing and reduced fossil fuel demand in emission-abating countries depress international fossil fuel prices, thereby incentivizing consumption in unregulated regions. Given the global nature of the GHG emission externality, there are two major concerns associated with carbon leakage. First, leakage reduces the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral policies. Second, leakage could be a manifestation of undue excessive competitiveness losses for EITE industries in countries with stringent emission regulation. These concerns have fostered carbon tariffs’ policy appeal in industrialized countries that pursue stringent domestic carbon pricing in the battle against climate change.Footnote 5 As a prominent example, the then-candidate for President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen stated in the plenary of the European Parliament:Footnote 6 Emissions must have a price that changes our behavior. To complement this work and to ensure our companies can compete on a level-playing field, I will introduce a Carbon Border Tax to avoid carbon leakage. In order to extend the reach of domestic carbon regulation, carbon tariffs apply the domestic CO2 price as a tax on emissions embodied in imports from countries without (or with very lenient) emission regulation. In theory, supplemental carbon tariffs bear the potential to increase global cost-effectiveness compared to domestic emission pricing only and to level the playing field on markets for EITE goods. The policy appeal of carbon tariffs in terms of its impact on leakage, global cost-effectiveness, and competitiveness effects for EITE industries has been examined in a number of empirical studies. Fischer and Fox (2012), for example, investigate anti-leakage measures that could complement unilateral emission pricing and conclude that full border carbon adjustment is likely the most effective anti-leakage policy.Footnote 7  Peterson and Schleich (2007) evaluate embodied carbon tariff options for the sectors covered by the EU ETS and find only marginal overall effects in terms of their capability to reduce carbon leakage. Monjon and Quirion (2011) compare the effectiveness of various designs for border carbon adjustment and output-based allocation in reducing carbon leakage from EU ETS sectors. They conclude that border carbon adjustment is the most effective anti-leakage policy. Böhringer et al. (2014) investigate anti-leakage measures as a function of abatement coalition size and identify full border carbon adjustment as the superior measure to improve the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral emission pricing. They furthermore show that border carbon adjustments can moderate output declines for EITE industries. A large number of empirical studies also emphasize the potential of carbon tariffs to shift the burden of unilateral climate policy from abating to non-abating regions through policy-induced changes in terms of trade (see e.g. Böhringer et al. 2018, 2012; Ghosh et al. 2012; Weitzel et al. 2012). Carbon tariffs can be used by industrialized abating countries—that are net importers of embodied emissions from developing countries—to exert market power and change the terms of trade in their favor. As a prime example, countries that are net exporters of fossil fuels are negatively affected since carbon tariffs depress international fuel prices by reducing global fossil fuel consumption. To summarize: The bulk of empirical analysis on the implications of carbon tariffs comes up with two central findings (for summaries see e.g. Böhringer et al. 2012; Branger and Quirion 2014; Carbone and Rivers 2017). First, carbon tariffs are potent in reducing emission leakage and attenuating output losses for EITE industries. However, gains in global cost-effectiveness remain relatively modest. Second, carbon tariffs shift the economic burden of emission reductions from regulating developed regions to unregulated developing regions. Empirical analyses so far have been based on pointwise assessments for specific base-years without accounting for the fact that trade in embodied carbon has changed significantly over time. Primarily, in the period before the 2007–2008 financial crisis, industrialized OECD countries were large net importers, while developing Non-OECD countries were mostly large net exporters of embodied carbon (Wood et al. 2019; Peters and Hertwich 2008; Caldeira and Davis 2011; Peters et al. 2011). This raises the policy-relevant question how changing trade patterns in embodied carbon affects the case for (or against) carbon tariffs regarding (1) their potential to reduce carbon leakage, (2) their effect on the global cost-effectiveness of climate policy, and (3) the burden they impose on countries which face carbon tariffs. Clearly, if there is no carbon embodied in trade at all, the implementation of carbon tariffs would have no effect. Thus, it seems plausible, on the one hand, that the potential of carbon tariffs to reduce leakage and increase the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral emission pricing augments in periods when trade in carbon increases. On the other hand, the burden-shifting effect might be at odds with industrialized countries’ commitment to avoiding adverse economic spillover effects of their emission regulation to the developing world.Footnote 8 We evaluate the performance of carbon tariffs along these lines by combining multi-region input–output (MRIO) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) analyses based on annual data from 2000 to 2014, provided by the World Input–Output Database (WIOD). Our empirical investigation shows that it is insufficient to only consider the growing amount of emissions embodied in trade, but that a more differentiated review of underlying drivers is required to explain the performance of carbon tariffs. The results from our MRIO analysis confirm that imports of embodied emissions in developed countries from developing countries have sharply increased between 2000 and 2007–2008 (the financial crisis) and have plateaued after 2010. A decomposition of CO2 intensity of OECD EITE goods production shows that the share of emissions stemming from imported (non-OECD) intermediate inputs almost doubled from about 11 in 2000 to 19% in 2014. At first glance, this development contributes to the appeal of carbon tariffs, as more emissions can be taxed at the border. However, we add two important observations that refine the picture and reduce the efficacy of carbon tariffs regarding leakage reduction and global cost-effectiveness improvement. First, we find that the CO2 intensity of EITE production has declined. Notably, the CO2 intensity of EITE imports from Non-OECD to OECD has decreased from 2.75 kg/US$ in 2000 to 1.33 kg/US$ in 2014. At the same time, emissions embodied in Non-OECD exports to OECD—as a share of production-based emissions in Non-OECD—have decreased from 51 in 2000 to 36% in 2014. That is, the relative importance of emission trade from Non-OECD to OECD has declined, in particular, compared to trade within Non-OECD. Second, we observe that a growing share of Non-OECD emissions stems from electricity production. Electricity is (almost) not traded internationally and can not be targeted directly by carbon tariffs. As a further refinement, it is useful to distinguish the emission-related observations based on our MRIO analysis in three different phases—pre-crisis (2000–2007), crisis (2008–2009), and post-crisis (2010–2014).Footnote 9 Our CGE results covering the global economy for different observation years between 2000 and 2014 show a 64–80% leakage reduction due to carbon tariffs. The impacts of carbon tariffs simulated in the CGE analysis can be traced back to different opposing developments in the underlying economic structure observed in the MRIO analysis. The increasing share of intra-Non-OECD trade allows Non-OECD countries to redirect trade flows more easily when targeted with carbon tariffs. Also, while carbon tariffs can narrow or even shut down the competitiveness channel for leakage, the expansion of the electricity sector increases the relative importance of the fossil-fuel price channel and therefore hampers the overall effectiveness of carbon tariffs against leakage.Footnote 10 Our analysis of the efficacy of carbon tariffs provides policy-relevant insights. In particular, we caution against the simplistic proposition that an overall increase in global trade necessarily strengthens the case for carbon tariffs. The pattern of trade and structural changes in the economies over time drive the impacts of carbon tariffs.Footnote 11 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the data and the numerical models (MRIO and CGE) underlying our empirical analysis on the implications of carbon tariffs; we also present here the results of the MRIO analysis. In Sect. 3 we specify our counterfactual policy scenarios and interpret the CGE results. In Sect. 4 we conclude.",21

It provides the policy prescriptions that economists ought to be making to reverse the impending, some would say current, disaster that the unfettered global economy is having on the biosphere (Bradshaw et al. 2021). The statistics are eyewatering. Over the past 11000 years, the start of agriculture, terrestrial vegetation biomass has halved. Moreover, in the last 500 years alone more than 20% of biodiversity has been lost, including over 700 plants and around 600 vertebrate species becoming extinct (Bradshaw et al. 2021). The current rate of extinction is 15 times the background rate, meaning that we are on course for a mass extinction event (75% loss of species in a ‘geologically short period’: < 3m years, (Ceballos et al. 2015)). Populations are down too, by nearly 70%. Furthermore, although known for some time that biodiversity loss, habitat destruction and the trade in wild animals is linked to zoonoses (e.g. Daily and Ehrlich, 1996; Pepin, 2013), we now find ourselves in the middle of a global pandemic that appears to be linked to the sale of exotic species and the destruction of their habitats (Wu et al., 2020). The costs of environmental degradation are now very tangible. The Review, housed at the UK Treasury, is “high-level” in that its fundamental aim was not to preach to the choir of environmental economists, but to ministries at the core of governments worldwide, that make decisions on economic policy, the measurement of long-term well-being and the economic incentives that affect biodiversity and nature. It is aimed at finance ministries, central banks and, particularly, the mainstream economists that work in and advise these institutions, which in turn determine the allocation of public and private capital.Footnote 1 In the Q&A of the Review’s launch event, the first question that Sir Professor Dasgupta was asked, was “what is the first thing that you would change?”. His response was telling: “my colleagues in the economics profession”. This response encapsulates the view that mainstream economic theory of growth has been hegemonic, influential and stubbornly persistent as the theoretical platform for defining economic goals worldwide. If one discards the decades of work in environmental economics at least since Dasgupta and Heal (1974) and Dasgupta and Heal (1980) from the category of ‘mainstream’ growth economics, mainstream theories of economic growth have essentially ignored the demands economic activity places on the biosphere and the constraints that the biosphere places on economic activity.Footnote 2 The Dasgupta Review is comprehensive, detailed and thorough on the role of biodiversity in determining well-being from the micro to the macro level. Nevertheless, it is this high level macroeconomic point that is the essential message. The economy is embedded in the environment, and the biosphere and the biodiversity contained within it is not something that can be easily substituted. Neither can technological change solve the essential imbalance between the demands of economic activities, and the renewable output of the environment. There are, the Review argues, limits to growth due to embeddedness in the biosphere and binding planetary boundaries. Realising this aim and communicating this message requires the right language, one that can be understood at a high level and by the mainstream. The idea that biodiversity is valuable at the macroeconomic level requires the language of natural capital, assets and asset returns, stocks and flows and national accounts, when its audience is the mainstream economists in ministries and in finance. This language, while probably anathema to many who are concerned about biodiversity loss and who see economics as the problem, is also necessary within the theoretical framework that Dasgupta uses: a hybrid of mainstream economic growth theories which presents biodiversity as a macro aggregate stock and flow. From the perspective of environmental and resource economics (ERE), this framing is familiar ground. Less so within the mainstream. Yet, as we discuss, the idea of limits to growth and the embeddedness of economy in biosphere is an important departure both from the mainstream and typical discussions of sustainable economic development in ERE (e.g. Hamilton and Hepburn 2017). Embeddedness is more in the realm of ecological economics (e.g. Boulding 1968). Irrespective of these discussions, limits to growth is one thing, imposing limits on growth to rebalance economic demands with the environment is quite another. With these high level aims and the audience in mind, in what follows the way in which the Dasgupta Review’s message is conveyed is explored, and some of the key ideas are discussed. Of course, the Review is more than these aims and the language of ERE. The attention to detail is impressive given the broad coverage of topics. Among the numerous things that we learn from the Review are the manifold values that biodiversity can provide. The abridged version tells us that 60% of cancer drugs in the 90s came from soil funghi and bacteria (See Box 2). We also learn that subsidies to activities that harm biodiversity run to about US$4-6 trillion annually (Box 8.1 of the Review), and that in a stress test of the Dutch Financial Sector, €1.4 trillion of investments were highly dependent on ecosystem services, and that the footprint of Dutch Financial institutions’ investments is the equivalent of 58000 \(\mathrm{km}^{2}\) of pristine natural habitat (25% more than the area of the Netherlands itself. See Box 17.8 of the Review). Furthermore, were everyone to consume the diets seen in rich countries today, it would require an area of land greater than the entire surface of the globe. Such is the evidence of overshooting sustainable use of the biosphere. The Review will be a key resource for economists and policy makers from here on. The aggregated approach to biodiversity, which ostensibly glosses over the complexities of biodiversity and the role it plays in the embedded economy (see Pascual et al. (2021) for a perspective), can be understood in terms of the audience and the high level aims of the Review. While light on specific policies and only hinting at practical steps, the Review provides a much needed foundation upon which debates on limits to growth can be centred, and policy responses subsequently built. The following sections hope to contribute to both.",5

Specifically, cultured meat is produced from animal cells cultured in a growth medium in a bioreactor rather than being directly sourced from slaughtered animals. Cultured meat is therefore produced in a radically different way compared to conventional livestock methods. The idea of producing meat in vitro has long been advocated by scientists, politicians and artists. This idea is now becoming a technical reality, as cultured meat has just started to be commercialized.Footnote 2 Dozens of companies are currently working to develop and bring their product to the market in the coming years (Rubio et al. 2020). Cultured meat is a technical revolution, but it is also a possible economic and societal revolution, with the potential to disrupt the traditional meat sector. Given that animal agriculture uses more than three-quarters of the world’s agricultural land (Foley et al. 2011; Poore and Nemecek 2018), cultured meat can readily reshape the world as we know it. It can address several environmental issues, such as air, soil and water pollution posed by traditional agriculture (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos 2011; Poore and Nemecek 2018). It can also drastically reduce the risks of emerging infectious diseases, which are principally associated with the storage, production and consumption of animal food (Espinosa et al. 2020). Since cultured meat can be produced indoors during unfavorable external conditions, such as natural disasters, it may lower global food insecurity. And since it is produced under sterile conditions, it can virtually eliminate contamination with disease-causing pathogens (Rubio et al. 2020). Further, cultured meat does not rely on the exploitation and slaughter of animals, and thus has strong moral implications. Although the potential benefits of cultured meat are considerable, there remain wide uncertainties. Consider, for instance, the argument that this innovation can significantly reduce the cost of producing meat, along with its associated environmental externalities. This argument seems sensible at first: the production of cultured meat does not require all the resources to raise and maintain a farm animal alive. However, there is an opposing argument: muscle development has evolved over millions of years within the body of animals, and producing muscle differently may be costly and inefficient in terms of resource use. Indeed, a large amount of energy is required to produce the ingredients for the growth medium and for running the bioreactor (e.g., for temperature control, aeration and the mixing processes). The main objective of this paper is modest; to initiate a consideration of the economics of cultured meat. The current economic literature on this topic is essentially nonexistent. Therefore, we gather our knowledge from different sources—mostly outside of economics—and try to present it in such a way that could be useful to economists who may be interested in further study. Given the uncertainty inherent in the novelty of this technology, the paper is explorative rather than predictive. Given, also, the rate of progress of knowledge on this issue, it may likely become rapidly out-of-date.Footnote 3 However, we believe that it is useful to start a reflection on several basic economic questions, such as the following: Can cultured meat become globally beneficial? What are its possible major economic, environmental, health, and moral impacts? How will cultured meat be produced, and by whom? How will consumers and the conventional meat sector react? What action should regulators take? Where are the main uncertainties? We will briefly discuss each of these questions, in the hope that this paper may—at the very least—encourage an emerging body of economic research. We believe in particular that this topic is very relevant for environmental economists, as the novel food generates high promises for the environment. Moreover, the complexity of the topic mixing agriculture, food, land use, climate as well as energy issues calls for more integrated research involving economists. The outline of the paper is as follows. We first present issues regarding the externalities of conventional meat and the need to find solutions, in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we present a brief history and summary of cultured meat research and development. Thus, Sects. 2 and 3 provide some context before addressing the economic issues, and can easily be skipped by readers familiar with the topic. We discuss some demand side issues in Sect. 4, and some supply side issues in Sect. 5. We then discuss environmental issues in Sect. 6 and moral issues in Sect. 7. We finally discuss some regulatory issues in Sect. 8, before concluding.",59

Many scientists tend to attribute the trend of rising natural disaster losses to increases in wealth and population levels in disaster-prone regions, and possibly climate change (Bouwer 2019; Estrada et al. 2015). Both developed and developing countries are vulnerable to the economic impacts of climate change, but it is expected that these impacts will be more severe in developing countries which have a limited capacity to adapt to climate change (Tol 2018). Therefore, adapting to changes in climate and limiting the effects of changes in the intensity and/or frequency of natural hazards on economic development are important. For climate change adaptation and enhancing the preparedness and resilience of a society, it is essential to understand the relationship between natural disasters and economic activities. Disaster impacts can be divided into direct impacts, like property losses, and indirect economic impacts, such as effects on economic growth (Cavallo and Noy 2011). The former impacts are relatively well understood, while insights into economic growth impacts of natural disasters are more uncertain (Lazzaroni and van Bergeijk 2014; Botzen et al. 2019). Hallegatte and Przyluski (2010) has emphasized the importance of estimating the indirect losses to assess the consequences of natural disasters on welfare. However, the evidence for disaster impacts on economic growth is inconclusive and is mostly obtained from highly aggregated macroeconomic data at the country or regional levels (Klomp and Valckx 2014; Lazzaroni and van Bergeijk 2014). This inconsistency in results is in part related to the failure to fully account for the differences in disaster types, locations, economic and financial development, institutional quality, time periods used for the analysis, disaster cost definitions, and assessment methodologies (Loayza et al. 2012; Cavallo et al. 2013; Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014). This paper contributes to understanding the impact of disasters on economic growth by examining at the firm level the relationship between natural disasters and business activities in the short run. Understanding firm responses to natural disasters helps design efficient responses to natural disasters. The impacts of natural disasters on the macro-economy largely materialize through their effects on firms through the generation of jobs and income. Natural disasters are exogenous shocks that directly affect firms’ production and demand for production inputs, and induce resource reallocation in the process of firm exit, entry, and the expansion and contraction of existing firms (Leiter et al. 2009; Tanaka 2015; Cole et al. 2015). Through their direct effects on firms, natural disasters have ripple effects on society at large, for example through the loss of jobs, reduction of income, and disruptions in the supply of goods and services (Tierney 2007). Indirect effects of disasters on firms may also be positive, for example when firms that are not directly hit take over production from firms with damaged production facilities, or when demand for products and services increases in the recovery phase after a disaster. Therefore, firms should play an important role in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (Musso and Schiavo 2008). But there is limited evidence on how disasters impact firms so far (Leiter et al. 2009; Tanaka 2015; Cole et al. 2015). In this paper, we investigate the impacts of storms and floods on firm growth in Vietnam, a developing country particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards.Footnote 1 With a coastline of 3440 km and an estimated 70% of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas (GFDRR 2015), Vietnam is highly exposed to a wide range of natural hazards such as floods, storms (or typhoons), landslides, and droughts. Floods and tropical storms are the most frequent and destructive natural hazard events in Vietnam with the highest number of fatalities and economic damages between 1990 and 2014 (EM-DAT 2020).Footnote 2 Furthermore, climate change is expected to increase sea levels and the frequency and intensity of floods, globally and in Southeast Asia (World Bank 2014; IPCC 2014). Vietnam has lost 1–1.5% of GDP annually between 1989 and 2008 due to natural disasters, which hinders the social and economic development of the country (World Bank 2010). To name a few, typhoon Xangsane struck 15 provinces in the central region in 2006 and caused USD 649 million in damage; floods in 2008 affected north and central Vietnam and caused USD 479 million in damage; and typhoon Ketsana swept through central Vietnam in 2009 killing 163 people and causing a total economic loss of USD 785 million (EM-DAT 2020). This paper contributes to the limited micreconomic evidence for disaster impacts on firm growth in labor, capital, and sales using the Enterprise Census data (2000–2014). Specifically, we extend the literature on the determinants of firm growth to incorporate natural disasters as exogenous shocks. We then estimate linear dynamic firm growth models by the Blundell and Bond (1998) system generalized method of moments (system GMM) to identify the growth impacts of storms and floods. System GMM has the advantage that it deals with potential measurement error and endogeneity for variables in the model as well as the weak instrument problem. For floods, we find significant positive impacts on labor growth and capital growth and significant negative impacts on sales growth. We observe some evidence of significant positive lag impacts on labor growth and significant negative lag impacts on sales growth. Moreover, we find significant positive impacts of storms on capital growth and sales growth in the same year as storms strike only with the economic damage measure. Furthermore, we confirm that firm growth depends on firm size and financial constraints and decreases with firm age. Moreover, this paper makes the first attempt to directly verify the performance of three different disaster measures in the context of micro-level disaster impacts on firms. The three disaster measures are defined based on physical intensities of natural disasters (e.g., wind speed and geographical size affected) and (ad-hoc) damage records (deaths and economic losses). Most studies on disaster impacts have relied on the damage measures which may be endogenous, particularly for cross-country growth studies, because income may be positively related with natural disaster damages (Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014). This is why Felbermayr and Gröschl (2014) built a comprehensive natural disaster database with physical intensities from primary geophysical and meteorological information. They find a substantial negative and robust average impact of disasters on economic growth with the physical disaster indicators, but not with the economic impact indicators. In contrast to the different signs of disaster impacts found at the macro level in Felbermayr and Gröschl (2014), we find mostly consistent signs and magnitudes for disaster impacts on firm growth across the three disaster measures. There are two possible explanations for this difference. First, the endogeneity concern of the economic damage disaster measure is much smaller in our within country study than in a cross-country study with substantial heterogeneity in GDP and reporting of damages. Second, we focus on disaster impacts in the manufacturing sector only while Felbermayr and Gröschl (2014) studied the impacts of disasters on the whole economy. Disaster impacts are likely to differ across economic sectors. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the impacts of natural disasters with a focus on indirect costs. Section 3 introduces the Enterprise Census data and the disaster databases used for the analysis. Section 4 reviews the literature on the determinants of firm growth, specifies the growth models for estimation, and presents the estimation results for firm growth and some robustness checks. And Sect. 5 concludes.",5
79.0,2.0,Environmental and Resource Economics,13 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-021-00563-z,"Cooperative Management of Ecosystem Services: Coalition Formation, Landscape Structure and Policies",June 2021,Francois Bareille,Matteo Zavalloni,Davide Viaggi,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The conservation of biodiversity and related ecosystem services (ES) depends on the structure of landscapes (e.g., density and spatial autocorrelation of natural habitats), which are the results of landowners’ land-use decisions (Haines-Young and Potschin 2010). While biodiversity conservation benefits society as a whole (Hanley et al. 2015), some of the related ES, such as biological control or pollination, are central for agricultural production (Albrecht et al. 2020). The economic importance of these productive ES is increasingly acknowledged: for example, the French ecosystem assessment estimates that pollinators contribute between 5.2% and 12% of the total crop value (Therond et al. 2017). The literature suggests that farmers can integrate the impacts of their land-use choices on productive ES to manage them efficiently, i.e. to benefit from additional yields or input-savings (Zhang et al. 2007). Some microeconometric studies have suggested that farmers do integrate these effects at the farm scale (Bareille and Letort 2018; Orazem and Miranowski 1994; Thomas 2003). Since the provision of many productive ES depends on mobile “ES providers”, such as pollinators or pest-predatory insects, farmers’ land-use choices may, however, create positive externalities for neighbouring farmers (Bareille et al. 2020; Costello et al. 2017). In this context, cooperation among farmers to manage productive ES is likely to be an efficient strategy for farmers. Some real-world examples of such cooperative management exist,Footnote 1 in particular with regard to the management of pollination service. Since pollination service is a local public good, farmers also face well-known free-riding issues: even if the coordinated management of productive ES among farmers should lead to Pareto improvements, its emergence is unikely to occur. Simulations based on bioeconomic models show that, indeed, the cooperation of all farmers in a landscape (i.e. the Grand Coalition – GC) yields Pareto improvements with respect to the uncoordinated ES management (the Nash Equilibrium – NE), but that at least some farmers have incentives to defect (Cong et al. 2014; Epanchin-Niell and Wilen 2015). These incentives are even more pronounced when farmers are heterogeneous (Atallah et al. 2017; Bareille et al. 2020). However, these papers only compare the outcomes of the NE with those of the GC, neglecting the possible subgroups of, for example 2 or 3 farmers, which can be formed within a population of N farmers (N > 3). In his seminal paper, Olson (1965) though postulated that small groups would be more likely to cooperate as the free-riding problem they face is less signficant. The literature on coalition formation offers a structure to endogenize the individual decision of a farmer to cooperate (Barrett 1994; d’Aspremont et al. 1983). The idea behind this literature is that any coalition is feasible in principle (not only the GC or the singletons constituting the NE), but that only the stable ones can emerge. A coalition is stable when no members have incentives to exit (or deviate from the coalition’s optimum) and non-members have no incentives to enter. This type of game has been used intensively for the analysis of international environmental agreements targetting the provision of global public goods (Barrett 1994; Bayramoglu et al. 2018; Carraro and Siniscalco 1993) but also of the cooperation amongst firms on R&D investments (Bloch 1995) or on voluntary agreements among firms (Brau and Carraro 2011). More recently, it has been used to assess the performance of collective incentives for biodiversity conservation (Ansink and Bouma 2013; Zavalloni et al. 2019). The aim of the paper is threefold. First, we seek to determine the size and the composition of the stable coalitions (SCs) within which farmers are willing to cooperate for the provision of pollination service, and to what extent these coalitions yield economic gains with respect to the NE. The second objective is to investigate the role of the landscape structure on the cooperation and conservation outcomes. The third objective is to assess how different public policies targeting habitat conservation affect coalition stability, and whether a policy design fostering cooperation among farmers would lead to budget-effectiveness improvements. We examine three different instruments that are often implemented in the USA and Europe: (i) individual homogeneous per-hectare payments; (ii) minimum participation rules (MPR), where a bonus is paid to each coalition member if the total habitat area exceeds a given threshold; and (iii) price premiums for fruits when pollinators are managed in common. We do not aim to find the optimal conservation policy but rather, more modestly, the budget-effectiviness of THE different instruments, highlighting some possible perverse results of existing policies when coalition formation is addressed. Our analysis is valuable for policymakers, in particular in Europe, where a large share of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is allocated to agri-environmental schemes, and where efforts have been made to implement collective incentives (Franks 2019). For these purposes, we formulate a spatially-explicit bioeconomic model of nine farmers growing annual crops and fruits that can dedicate a share of their arable lands to (semi-)natural habitats (e.g., set-aside areas, flower strips, hedgerows). Pollinator abundance increases the fruit yields but decreases with the distance to the habitats. We first analytically determine the conservation choices within the alternative coalitions and the impact of the considered policy instruments on these choices. However, the spatially-explicit nature of the problem prevents us from determining analytically the SCs; we thus numerically determine in a second step the SCs over randomly generated landscapes characterised by different degrees of spatial autocorrelation of fruit tree covers. We calibrate the model on fruit farms from Emilia-Romagna (Italy). We contribute to the literature on cooperative management of ES in agricultural landscapes in several ways. First, we expand the knowledge on the benefits of cooperative management for productive ES by accounting for the stability of partial coalitions. For example, we find that the GC is never stable without policy intervention, but that some small coalitions of two or three farmers can be stable. Albeit small, the emergence of these coalitions entails average increases in total profits of 2.5% compared to the NE. Second, most of the existing literature has focused on the efficiency or budget-effectiveness of collective measures for the provision of unproductive public goods (Bouma et al. 2020; Dupraz et al. 2009). We here explore the effect of collective measures, and policy instruments in general, in the case of a public good that jointly provides non-use values (biodiversity conservation) and productive benefits (pollination), i.e. in case of within-group externalities (Kotchen and Segerson 2019). This issue has been so far investigated for fishery (Zhou and Segerson 2016) and pollution control (Willinger et al. 2014). On biodiversity conservation, few papers analyse these collective measures in this context other than in rather abstract ways (Ansink and Bouma 2013; Zavalloni et al. 2019). Here, we find that per-hectare payments or MPR schemes do not necessarily increase the habitat area when the targeted public good also generates within-group externalities. Indeed, these instruments can reduce the stability of coalitions that initially conserved more habitats: despite the new incentives, this effect can lead to fewer habitats at the margin. Moreover, the price premium may be a budget-effective instrument to conserve habitats, but only when the spatial autocorrelation of fruit tree covers is low. Finally, very few papers from the coalition formation literature address a spatially-explicit distribution of benefits (Alvarado-Quesada and Weikard 2017; Costello et al. 2017; Gengenbach et al. 2010) or a high degree of heterogeneity (Bakalova and Eyckmans 2019). Contrary to the aforementioned papers, we move closer to reality by making endogenous to the model the individual decision on where to implement conservation efforts (Busby et al. 2012). We also generalize their approach to the case of the voluntary contribution to a public good with (i) heterogeneous agents, (ii) spatial interactions among agents and (iii) calibrated data. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes a general modelling framework to analyse (i) the coalition formation and corresponding land-use decisions and (ii) the impacts of the alternative policies on them. Section 3 presents the spatially-explicit bioeconomic model. The results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the results and provides concluding remarks.",7

On the European level, EBM has been adopted by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) as the approach through which marine waters can achieve “good environmental status” (European Union 2008). Both EBFM and EBM are holistic approaches that involve the interactions among physical, biogeochemical, ecological and social-economic systems (Long et al. 2015; Marasco et al. 2007; Patrick and Link 2015). Ecological-economic models or bio-economic models can provide insights for EBFM and EBM. Such models are useful for understanding the feedback, interactions, and trade-offs between the ecological and social-economic systems; therefore, they can support management decisions that jointly consider different systems (Doyen et al. 2013; Francis et al. 2007; Nguyen 2012; Nielsen et al. 2018). Furthermore, within the ecological system, food webs are considered in EBFM or EBM (Link 2002; Marasco et al. 2007; Pikitch et al. 2004), as ecosystem resilience and fishery productivities depend on food web process and structures that can be changed by fisheries and other human activities (Andersen et al. 2015; Francis et al. 2007; Marasco et al. 2007). Therefore, food web interactions should be considered in the modeling for EBFM and EBM (Francis et al. 2007; Marasco et al. 2007). The models that incorporate the food web process (predator–prey relations or interspecific competition) and economic components, called the multispecies bio-economic model in the later part of this paper, can be traced back to Clark (1976, 2010), Hannesson (1983), Conrad and Adu-Asamoah (1986) in which the biological part of the models used lumped biomass for each species. Since then, numerous numerical applications of multispecies bio-economic models with age-structured have been developed and applied for different marine ecosystems worldwide (see the review in Nielsen et al. (2018)). For the Baltic Sea regions, the age-structured multispecies bio-economic models were mainly developed for the food web relations among cod (Gadus morhua), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and herring (Clupea harengus) (Bastardie et al. 2012; Hutniczak 2015; Nieminen et al. 2012; Voss et al. 2014a, b; Yun et al. 2017). ICES (2013a) has also begun to give advice based on the multispecies assessment of cod, sprat, and herring for the Baltic Sea. Mammal predators (e.g., grey seals (Halichoerus grypus)) were included in some multispecies bio-economic models but solely in the biological part of the models (Blenckner et al. 2011; Bossier et al. 2018). In addition, the important migratory fish, salmon (Salmo salar), in the Baltic Sea have not been involved in those multispecies bio-economic models or multispecies management advice. Salmon is an important commercial fish in the Baltic Sea, and its recreational catch has continued to rise in recent years (ICES 2013a, 2016). From the ecological perspective, salmon occupies an irreplaceable niche in the river ecosystem, providing supporting services such as maintaining the food web balance in rivers, transporting nutrients, reducing sedimentation, and so on (Kulmala et al. 2013). Although the importance of Baltic salmon seems more obvious in the river ecosystems, the population dynamics of salmon are strongly affected by predators, prey, and diet during the migration at sea (e.g., Ikonen (2006); Mäntyniemi et al. (2012); Mikkonen et al. (2011); Rudstam et al. (1994); Suuronen and Lehtonen (2012)). The food web relations between salmon and other species and types of salmon fisheries are closely associated with the migration routes and life stages of salmon. The post-smolt stage of salmon covers the period from spring, when young salmon (smolts) arrive the sea, to the end of their first winter at sea. For the salmon populations born in the rivers that flow into the Gulf of Bothnia, the northernmost Baltic Sea, post-smolts migrate southward through the Gulf to reach the Baltic main basin by the end of the post-smolt stage (Ikonen 2006). During this stage, salmon mortality is affected by the abundance of grey seal (predators) and young herring (prey) in the Gulf of Bothnia (Kallio-Nyberg et al. 2011; Mäntyniemi et al. 2012; Salminen 2001). These salmon populations remain at sea for 1–4 years for feeding and then migrate northward, mostly along the east side of the Northern Baltic Sea, to their home rivers for spawning when they are mature (Ikonen 2006). The grey seal is also a threat to salmon during this spawning migration (Suuronen and Lehtonen 2012). Herring in the Gulf of Bothnia are also a food source for grey seals (Gardmark et al. 2012; Lindegren et al. 2011; Lundström et al. 2010). The grey seal-herring and salmon-herring relations are only explored in ecological studies (Gardmark et al. 2012; Lindegren et al. 2011; Lundström et al. 2010; Mäntyniemi et al. 2012; Salminen 2001) but are not yet developed in the bio-economic model. The well-developed bio-economic models for Baltic salmon are mainly single species approaches (e.g., Kulmala et al. (2008); Laukkanen (2001)). Moreover, the effects of grey seal on salmon are only included as impacts on salmon fishery harvests (Holma et al. 2014; ICES 2016) or are embedded within all sources of natural mortality in the salmon stock assessment (ICES 2014; Michielsens et al. 2006); they are not included as a direct prey-predation interaction between grey seal and salmon populations. Therefore, this study develops a multispecies bio-economic model with three trophic levels involving the food web interactions of grey seals, salmon and herring in the Northern Baltic Sea. The study has two aims. The first aim is to explore how the economically optimal harvest of the Northern Baltic salmon fisheries and the development of the corresponding salmon stock are influenced by the prey and predators of salmon. For this purpose, we apply this multispecies model in a single species management context and maximize the profit of the salmon fisheries in different levels of seal populations and herring fishing mortality. This allows us not only to evaluate the consequences of the multispecies interactions but also to compare the results between our multispecies model and single species salmon model. The second aim is to explore the trade-off between salmon and herring fisheries under a multispecies management context with different management policies. This reveals answers to the question on which management policy is economically preferred. For this purpose, we designed different scenarios, including that herring and salmon fisheries manage the harvest at the levels that can maximize the total profits from both fisheries and that the two fisheries apply different management approaches (e.g., maximizing the long-term profits or harvest of the individual fishery) simultaneously. As mentioned, the ecological part of the study scope covers grey seals, salmon and herring in the Northern Baltic Sea. In addition, the economic part includes salmon fisheries along the Finnish coast and herring fisheries in the Gulf of Bothnia. We focus on the salmon population from Tornionjoki (River Torne), the northernmost spawning areas for Baltic salmon. Tornionjoki is the most productive river for the salmon smolts, accounting for almost half of the total wild smolt production in the Baltic region (ICES 2015b). Due to the closures of drift netting throughout the Baltic Sea and fishing challenges for offshore salmon fisheries in the Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic salmon are mainly harvested by (1) offshore longline fishing on feeding salmon at the Baltic main basin; (2) coastal trap net fishing of salmon during their spawning migration; and (3) recreational fishing for salmon entering rivers for spawning (ICES 2015b). During their spawning migration, Finnish coastal trap nets are the largest contributor to the commercial catch of the Tornionjoki population (ICES 2015b). Herring from the Gulf of Bothnia are only caught by Finland and Sweden. The herring stock is currently higher than the sustainable level under the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) policy. However, the catch is in an increasing trend and fishing pressure was above the MSY level in 2016 (ICES 2017a). Herring fisheries at the Gulf of Bothnia are especially important for Finland. In 2016, the Finnish herring harvest from the Gulf of Bothnia accounted for 68% of the total fish harvest in Finland, measured by weight (LUKE 2016). Due to the salmon migration route and the target herring population, we only considered the grey seal population in the Northern Baltic Sea, which includes data for the Gulf of Bothnia, Central Sweden, and the Southwestern Finnish Archipelago, based on counting information from HELCOM SEAL Expert Group (2015). The mobility of grey seals is high (Harding et al. 2007). Therefore, although the population of grey seal in the Baltic Sea continues to grow, their abundance fluctuates within each subarea (HELCOM SEAL Expert Group 2015). In the next section, which addresses our methodology, we introduce our model in the order of model scheme and then the detail of the biological and economic components of the model. Section 3 describes the scenario design of this study. Section 4 shows the results. The final section presents the discussion and concludes the key insights of this study.",

Cristobal Ruiz-Tagle,Alejandra Schueftan,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Household air pollution from wood fuel burning is a serious problem for many low-income and middle-income countries (Chávez et al. 2011a, b). The incomplete combustion of wood fuel can generate high levels of air pollution, releasing pollutants such as fine particulates, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and organic compounds. A recent report finds that exposure to household air pollution is linked to 2.6 million annual deaths worldwide (Health Effects Institute 2018). Exposure to air pollution from wood fuel burning, in particular, can also cause various diseases, including respiratory infections (such as acute upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cardiovascular diseases, and cancers (American Lung Association 2011; Smith et al. 2013). Households in Chile’s south-central region—the geography where we conducted the field experiment presented in this paper—experience very high levels of ambient (outdoor) air pollution. Unlike households in many developing countries that experience high levels of indoor air pollution from the burning of wood fuels on open fires or traditional stoves, most Chilean households have significantly reduced the problem of indoor air pollution (Chávez et al. 2011a, b). This is due to the widespread adoption of wood stoves equipped with a closed combustion chamber and chimney that carries pollutants from firewood burning outside the dwellings. Consequently, what had largely been a problem of indoor air pollution has turned into a more serious problem of outdoor air pollution in Chile (Chávez et al. 2011a, b).Footnote 1 This phenomenon of increasing outdoor air pollution as a consequence of increased adoption of improved wood burning technologies (i.e., closed combustion chambers, chimneys, etc.) is increasingly being experienced by more countries in the developing world, creating a combined problem of indoor and outdoor air pollution (Balakrishnan et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2020). This is also a challenge in some developed countries, especially in rural areas and in the outskirts of cities where households use firewood as a primary or secondary fuel for heating (Hine et al. 2011; US EPA 2013). Household air pollutants emitted from wood stoves remain suspend in the immediate surrounding areas of their dwellings. When aggregated at the neighbourhood and city level, emissions from individual households create large systemic effects on overall ambient air pollution concentrations. This is reflected in the hazardous levels of ambient air pollution experienced by cities of the south-central region of Chile—where 80 to 95% of households use wood fuel for heating, especially during the cold winter months (Schueftan and González 2013). Air pollution concentrations in all cities in this region far exceed safe levels, particularly during the wintertime.Footnote 2 According to a 2018 ranking of the world’s most polluted cities by fine particulate matter (PM2.5), the top five most polluted cities in South America are found in south-central Chile. Valdivia, the city where we conducted the field experiment, is ranked fourth.Footnote 3 To address this problem, Chile’s environmental authority (the Ministry of Environment) has introduced multiple public policy measures to lower ambient air pollution. A key measure has been the implementation of a policy regulation that only allows for the selling of newer models of wood stoves that are equipped with a “double combustion” technology. This technology allows for a secondary burning of air pollutants in the combustion chamber that, when operated ‘optimally’, can significantly reduce emissions. However, despite policy measures and high market penetration of these cleaner stoves, ambient air pollution concentrations have continued to rise in all major cities of this region (Schueftan and González 2015). A major reason for this is that users’ behaviours in how they operate their wood stoves in real life settings has a significant effect on pollution emissions. Outdoor pollution emission from these cleaner wood stoves vary largely according to the setting of the stove’s damper, which regulates airflow inside the combustion chamber (Jordan and Seen 2005). When users “choke the damper” to close the airflow in the combustion chamber and keep the wood burning longer—as they often do for fuel cost savings—they create smouldering. This is a combustion process that is significantly more polluting as compared to when users set the stove’s damper open (or partially open) to allow for more air flow that generates combustion with a vivid flame, which re-burns the pollutants in the secondary combustion described above. As brought to attention by Hanna et al. (2016), it is very important to assess how users’ behaviours in operating their stoves in real-life settings impact the effectiveness of improved stove technology in reducing pollution and improving health. To-date, there has not been an assessment of how users’ behaviours of the cleaner stoves in Chile impacts pollution emissions (Chávez and Gómez 2017;Gómez et al. 2017; Schueftan et al. 2016). This paper contributes to the literature by providing experimental evidence on the links between behavioural change in the usage of improved wood stove technology and reduction in outdoor household air pollution. In this paper we examine whether households can be nudged through a behavioural intervention to change how they use their wood stoves so that they emit less outdoor pollutants. We do this by providing an information sign that informs users, in real-time, about their wood stove’s emissions according to how they chose to set their stove’s damper setting. Our hypothesis is that users will respond to this visual aid by decreasing the frequency of the choking of their wood stoves towards using a more open, less emitting damper settings. We assessed the effectiveness of this information sign by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 80 households in the city of Valdivia, Chile. We provided households in the treatment group with an information sign that attached to the levers of their wood stove’s dampers. Households in the treatment group also received a visit from a field assistant to install and explain the information sign and to provide an informational flyer (fridge magnet). Users in the control group were not provided with this information sign (and neither the installation visit nor the fridge magnet). Users in both the treatment and control groups were free to set their wood stove’s damper in any way they wanted: choking the airflow in the combustion chamber to save on wood fuel expenditure, opening the airflow to decrease outdoor pollution emissions, or any setting in between. We monitored and recorded the actual setting of wood stoves’ dampers for both treatment and control groups. Our results show that households can be nudged to use their stoves in a less polluting way. Households in the treatment group showed a reduction in the frequency with which they used the most polluting settings of their stoves (the choked settings on their stove dampers), leading to a significant drop in household emissions of PM2.5 pollution. As a result, deploying information signs on existing (and future) wood stoves and educating users on low-polluting usage have the potential to be cost-effective measures to address the problem of air pollution in the near term. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the related literature. Section 3 describes the problem of household air pollution in cities in south-central Chile, the design of improved woodstove technology, and targeted public policies to address this problem. Section 4 presents our testable hypothesis through a simple analytical model. Section 5 describes the experimental design, and Sect. 6 presents the main results. Section 7 discusses our findings in reference to the related literature. Finally, Sect. 8 provides policy recommendations and concluding remarks.",5

Asymmetric Responses to Vehicle Registration Taxes in Norway,September 2021,Alice Ciccone,Emilia Soldani,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the past decade, many European countries have reformed their taxes on vehicle purchases in order to reduce \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions rates. Typically, the reforms consisted of positive and/or negative tax incentives, aimed at discouraging the purchase of high \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emitting vehicles in favor of greener ones. Ex-post evaluations of these reforms generally show a quite successful shift toward lower \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emitting vehicles and an increase in diesel shares, but little is known beyond average effects. We ask whether vehicle sales are affected symmetrically, meaning equally strongly, by positive and negative vehicle tax variations. While these asymmetries have been empirically documented for everyday goods, no clear evidence is available for durables.  As we discuss below, it is not obvious whether the results for non-durables may apply to costly goods like vehicles. In general, providing evidence on durables is complicated because of high product differentiation and data scarcity for actual transaction prices. To gain empirical evidence for passenger cars, we leverage the 2007 and 2009 reforms of the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system in Norway. In the relevant time period, registration taxes in Norway for different car models in our sample ranged between 12% and 75% of new vehicles prices. This places the country among those with the highest vehicle taxation in Europe [see Gerlagh et al. (2018) and Runkel et al. (2018) for an overview of similar policies in Europe]. Every car model is available in multiple versions, which differ in their \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emission intensity (i.e. grams of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) produced per kilometer driven) or other characteristics. Within car models, the Norwegian reforms de facto decreased vehicle registration taxes on car versions with low \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions and increased them for those with higher emissions. We leverage such within-car-model heterogeneity in tax changes induced by the reforms to estimate the (within car model) elasticity of sales to taxes, in the spirit of Klier and Linn (2015). As our estimates only capture substitutions within the car models, they constitute a lower bound on the total effects. The results highlight a strong asymmetry: while the estimated (within-car-model) elasticity for tax decreases is − 1.99, the elasticity for tax increases is only 0.77. The reform of 2009 additionally introduced a partial rebate for cars emitting less than 120 g\(\hbox {CO}_{2}\)/km.Footnote 1 Our estimates point again to a strong asymmetry: sales reactions to tax changes are stronger when the change involves a partial rebate. As we detail below, these results are particularly relevant for policy design: ignoring the higher elasticity of sales to tax reduction may lead to underestimating the impact of similar tax reforms on sales, especially for low emitting vehicles. In the case of Norway, the stronger reaction of sales to tax decreases might help explain the heterogeneous effects of the 2007 reform across different emissions ranges. In an ancillary exercise, we provide evidence of such heterogeneity by isolating within-car-model substitutions around the three \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emission thresholds introduced with the 2007 reform. The patterns we observe are consistent with the reform inducing significant substitutions around the lower thresholds, where the tax on average decreased, and negligible around the highest threshold, where the tax on average increased. Our work is most closely related to the growing literature on the effects of carbon taxation on passenger vehicles sales and usage in various EU countries and the US. While these can be estimated through structural and semi-structural models of consumers’ demand (Berry et al. 1995; Stitzing 2016; Johansen, n.d.), a complementary strand of literature exploits quasi-experimental methods. Our study joins the latter strand, which has the advantage of relying on rather parsimonious assumptions and data requirements (Durrmeyer and Samano 2018; D’Haultfœuille et al. 2014; Gerlagh et al. 2018; Rogan et al. 2011; Alberini and Bareit 2019; Cerruti et al. 2019; Klier and Linn 2015). The ex-post effects of the Norwegian VRT reforms are also investigated in Ciccone (2018) and Yan and Eskeland (2018). Using a pre-post design Ciccone (2018) shows that, by linking the VRT directly to \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions, the 2007 reform contributed to the increase in the market share of new diesel vehicles and a decrease in those of high emitting vehicles. The author argues that this shift may be due to the fact that diesel engines, on average, have lower \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) emissions than petrol ones with similar power. Yan and Eskeland (2018) estimate a negative average elasticity of \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) intensity to \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) taxes in the fleet and find that this is higher in smaller car segments. We complement their findings by studying the potential asymmetry in how sales respond to tax increases and decreases, providing empirical evidence that the elasticity of registrations is higher for tax decreases than increases. This asymmetry is not equivalent to simple heterogeneity across car segments because the reform did not affect the VRT in the same way for all vehicles belonging to the same segment. As a matter of fact, in each segment, the VRT increased for some vehicles and decreased for others. This difference is non-trivial, as the asymmetry goes against classical economics theory and speaks to the risks of overly generous incentives. Indeed, for any given targeted shift in the distribution of registrations by emissions, a VRT reform that ignores the asymmetric response of registrations to tax cuts and increases may result in overly generous tax cuts for low emitting vehicles. For example, in France, the bonus/malus reform of 2008 caused a higher than expected increase in total sales, emissions, and governmental expenses (D’Haultfœuille et al. 2014). Switzerland also introduced a bonus/malus system. However, leveraging tax variation over time and across administrative cantons, Alberini and Bareit (2019) find only limited evidence of any asymmetric reactions of sales to such changes. An essential difference between this study and ours is the type of taxes considered. While Alberini and Bareit (2019) focus on annual circulation taxes, we consider vehicle registration taxes, which in Norway are paid upfront and account for around 50% of the price of passenger vehicles. Hence, we expect a more substantial impact on sales and emissions in Norway from potential asymmetric reactions. Our findings also add to the empirical literature on asymmetric reactions to price and tax changes, which highlights important asymmetries for everyday goods (Bidwell et al. 1995; Dargay 1991; Gately 1992; Dargay and Gately 1997; Gurumurthy and Little 1989; Kalwani et al. 1990; Bonnet and Villas-Boas 2016; Hymel and Small 2015).Footnote 2 It is possible that the (a)symmetry of elasticity depends on the price levels. For example, in the soda drinks market, Vespignani (2012) finds asymmetric elasticity for cheaper goods and symmetric for the more expensive ones (respectively, Pepsi and Coca-cola products). In summary, the fact that asymmetries exist for everyday goods does not necessarily imply that we should expect the same for more expensive goods such as vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to generalize such results to durable goods. Building on this literature, we additionally discuss several mechanisms which might explain the documented asymmetry. Based on (limited) available data, we do not find any evidence that the asymmetry is driven by salience or asymmetric pass-through of tax changes from car dealers to consumers. However, competition among car dealers might have induced them to provide  consumers with non-price benefits to compensate them for tax increases. This paper is structured as follows. We first describe the reforms (Sect. 2) and our data (Sect. 3) and methodology used (Sect. 4). We then present our main results on asymmetric reactions to tax changes with additional empirical evidence in their support (Sect. 5) and discuss possible mechanisms which might explain such asymmetries (Sect. 6). Before concluding, we discuss two critical caveats (Sect. 6.1). First, we document large anticipatory responses to the announcement of the reform, leading to a \(+\,\) 27% increase in emissions with respect to our counterfactual simulation. Second, in light of the gaps between lab-based and consumers-reported emissions, the overall reduction in emission attributable to the reform might be overestimated by up to 30%.Footnote 3",1

The price decline occurred simultaneously with an economic downturn and the low price persisted until early 2018. As a result of economic recovery and policy changes the price has steadily increased during 2018 and later in 2020–2021. It has been unclear whether such large scale price fluctuations exist in the first best climate policy. The question of business cycle fluctuations of emission prices is clearly connected to a general discussion on optimal adjustment of environmental policy, when economic activity varies (e.g. van den Bijgaart and Smulders 2018). Given the Pigouvian principles (Pigou 1932), the carbon price should equal the marginal damage of the carbon externality,Footnote 1 which is called the social cost of carbon (SCC).Footnote 2 We examine how the SCC and the resulting emissions vary over the business cycles. Previous studies (Heutel 2012; Angelopoulos et al. 2013; Annicchiarico and Di Dio 2015; Grodecka and Kuralbayeva 2015) have suggested that carbon price fluctuations should be procyclical, but the underlying mechanism has not been studied thoroughly. We show that the procyclicality follows from the procyclical consumption fluctuations that drive the SCC fluctuations. This implies relatively modest carbon price fluctuations. As a result, the SCC seems to have a relatively weak effect on the fluctuation of emissions, which are mostly dictated by the technology in polluting sector. To fix ideas, we call the polluting sector as energy sector, which is the main source of anthropogenic \(\hbox {CO}_2\) emissions (e.g. Climate Watch 2020). We build an environment-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of real business cycles (RBC). Our modeling provides four important deviations from previous carbon tax business cycle studies (Heutel 2012; Angelopoulos et al. 2013; Annicchiarico and Di Dio 2015; Grodecka and Kuralbayeva 2015).Footnote 3 First, we apply a detailed climate model with separate atmospheric carbon stocks and global temperature (e.g. Nordhaus 2014), which provides up-to-date description of the climate science (IPCC 2013). Second, our analytical results are based on a lag-structure approach depicting a general emission-environment dynamical system (cf. Gerlagh and Liski 2018b) that allows for extending the analysis beyond the atmospheric carbon externality. Third, we follow the approach by Golosov et al. (2014) and directly connect the emissions to the polluting input use. Thus, we do not rely on the production level driven emissions nor an explicit abatement variable. Instead, our technology description focuses on substitution of capital intensive green energy technologies for fossil fuels, i.e., the technology portfolio is summarized by the elasticity of substitution between energy sector capital and polluting input. With such an approach, we can examine the role of production technology of the energy sector in determining the dynamic properties of the SCC and carbon emissions. Fourth, we derive an analytical formulation for the general Pigouvian emission price and decompose its fluctuations around a growth path. Several formulas have been presented for the SCC but these have focused only on the level of the SCC (Golosov et al. 2014; Gerlagh and Liski 2018b; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016; van den Bremer and van der Ploeg 2019). To study the cyclical properties of the SCC, we extend their analysis by adding business cycle features such as time dependent savings rate. To our knowledge, the fluctuation decomposition is new to the literature. In addition to above mentioned business cycle literature, our paper is also connected to the recent studies about the impact of stochasticity on the SCC. For example, Cai and Lontzek (2019) and van den Bremer and van der Ploeg (2019) show that the economic and climate uncertainty affects the level of the SCC through various mechanisms. However, they do not report business cycle implications of the SCC. Dietz and Stern (2015) examine effects of parameter uncertainty, including growth, in DICE model (Nordhaus and Sztorc 2013), but they do not focus on the SCC but on climate beta, i.e., the ability of climate change mitigation to hedge aggregate consumption risk of future generations. We contribute to this literature by examining how growth shocks, i.e., total factor productivity (TFP) fluctuation, translates into the first-best emissions pricing. Our key findings are as follows. First, we show that the business cycle properties of the SCC are mostly dictated by those of marginal utility of consumption. This is explained by the vast atmospheric carbon stock and sluggish global mean temperature, which react only weakly to the business cycle variations of emissions. Since the climate damages, measured in utility terms, change only a little, the SCC measured in consumption terms (unit USD/\(\hbox {t}_{\text{ CO}_2}\)) is shifted by the current valuation of the utility losses, i.e., the inverse of the marginal utility of consumption. This implies strong covariation between the SCC and the final good consumption. Thus, whenever the consumption is procyclical, the SCC is likely to be procyclical. The procylicality of the carbon tax has been found already by (Heutel 2012) and has been obtained in different but related DSGE setups.Footnote 4 Heutel explains the procyclicality of taxes through a need for preventing emissions from overshooting as the abatement is costlier during economic expansion, but he also states that the variance of consumption causes the variance of tax. Our results show that the procyclicality of the SCC is mostly driven by the fluctuations in marginal utility of consumption, indicating a relatively minor magnitude for the SCC fluctuations. Thus, the observed large changes in EU ETS prices do not seem optimal from the first best point of view. Second, the optimal emissions are not automatically procyclical but the cyclical properties of emissions depend on the production technology of the energy sector. In the model, the technological possibilities are summarized by the elasticity of substitution (EOS) between polluting input and clean capital in the energy generation.Footnote 5 Our numerical results suggest that the emissions are procyclical when the substitutability is low and countercyclical when it is high. Current energy technologies rely largely on fossil fuels which implies low EOS. Instead, the high EOS case describes a possible future energy sector which would rely on renewable energy sources and the fossil fuels would have only a secondary role. The previous DSGE studies have provided strong evidence for the procyclicality of emissions.Footnote 6 This suggests that a procyclical carbon tax cannot change the strong observed link between GDP and emissions (Doda 2016, and references therein). These results are based on the model that is calibrated to the current economic and technological conditions. This parallels with our low EOS case. Our results suggest that the high EOS production structure is needed in the energy sector to avoid a climate catastrophe. If such technology would be adopted in the future, emissions might become countercyclical.Footnote 7 Third, we contrast the social optimum with regulations where either the tax or the emission level do not vary over business cycles, but are fixed to their optimal growth path levels. The fixed tax and the optimal carbon price policies result to very similar responses to total factor productivity (TFP) shocks for all the variables irrespective of the production technology of the energy sector. The results with fixed emissions are different in two aspects. First, fixing the emissions results in stronger carbon price responses. Second, the sign of the price response depends on the value of EOS in energy generation. Namely, with the low value of the EOS in fixed emission case the emission price is procyclical whereas with the high value it is countercyclical. Overall, our results suggest that under the business cycle fluctuations of normal magnitude the differences in economic impacts of optimally fluctuating carbon prices and optimally set fixed policies are small. The differences remain relatively small even when the economy faces financial crises that typically cause persistent output losses (Cerra and Saxena 2008). Hence, the first best regulation can be reasonably approximated with a policy that implements an optimal growth path level of carbon price and ignores price fluctuations. Fourth, since fixed regulation cannot adapt to revealed economic shocks, these results have implications on the prices versus quantities literature (Weitzman 1974): Given the calibration and precisely known gradual climate damages, the fixed tax seems to implement behavior that is close to optimal (e.g. Hoel and Karp 2001, 2002; Newell and Pizer 2003). Instead, the fixed quantity policy seems to distort the economic fluctuations more. However, with the low EOS in energy generation both the SCC and the optimal emissions are procyclical, which implies that, in prices versus quantities setup, the marginal environmental benefit and marginal abatement cost shocks are positively correlated. This improves the welfare properties of a fixed quantity regulation (Stavins 1996). Our results indicate that in the case of low EOS and very persistent shocks the fixed quantity regulation could actually be preferred to a fixed price regulation. Again, the differences in macroeconomic outcomes are small. Fifth, Newell and Pizer (2008) propose that the tax and emission regulations could be indexed to macroeconomic indicators such as the GDP. Our results suggest that the best indicator for indexing would be the aggregate consumption. The indexing of emission level would be more difficult due to the emissions’ strong link with the production technologies. While our analysis focuses on the cyclical properties of the SCC, our framework is generic, encompassing a variety of environmental pollutants. We find that the time lag between emissions and environmental harm, i.e., the speed of the environmental process, influences the cyclical properties of optimal emission prices. Climate change is a prime example of a slow environmental process, leading to the procyclicality of the Pigouvian tax. The cyclicality of Pigouvian tax of pollutants with fast processes is not as apparent as with carbon. However, our results suggest that also with fast emission-environment processes there is a tendency for procyclical Pigouvian taxes. The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model framework. Section 3 presents a general formula for the Pigouvian emission price and Sect. 4 analyzes its cyclical properties. In Sect. 5 we calibrate the model to the case of \(\hbox {CO}_2\) emissions and present the optimal reaction of the SCC and emissions to a TFP shock. Section 6 discusses the results and 7 concludes.",1

Although the priority today is to support overwhelming health systems and workers who are becoming unemployed due to Covid-19 crisis, thinking ahead, the response of the economy will continue offering tools to promote a green transition and build a more sustainable future.Footnote 1 Since the first issuance in 2007 green bonds have emerged as a key financial tool to address the new challenges. Their distinguishing feature is that the proceeds are directed to projects with environmental benefits, primarily climate change mitigation and adaptation. The development of process guidelines (e.g. Green Bond Principles) promoting transparency and integrity in the green bond market has further encouraged the investment into green deals and increased their appeal to socially responsible investors. Green bonds are the same as conventional bonds in every way except that the use of the proceeds is defined as green, and they are driven by the same financial risk factors that affect conventional bonds, therefore, in principle the reward to investors should be the same as from other bonds of the same issuer and with equal seniority. Sometimes green bonds exhibit a common new issuance premium in line with the standard bond market. At the same time, green bonds are usually oversubscribed. On one hand, additional costs related to ‘green’ certification and third-party review that are incurred by issuers should be reflected in bond prices. On the other hand, a higher degree of transparency—related to periodic monitoring and reporting in the post-issuance phase of the certification process—might result in a lower bond spread, as recognized for general corporate bonds (e.g. Yu 2005, where the transparency-related component of the bond spread has been identified; Clarkson et al. 2013; Plumlee et al. 2015, where it is shown that a higher quality environmental disclosure and externally produced environmental information are valued positively by investors). For green bonds, additional assessment is meant to protect investors from green-washing—that is, activities ‘disseminating a misleading picture of environmental friendliness’ (Bènabou and Tirole 2010)—and is often outsourced to an external auditing entity. In this paper we provide an analytical framework for understanding the dynamics and the relevant risk factors of corporate green bonds. In particular, we study the complicated interactions among the various determinants of green bond prices, which are crucial to explain the so-called ‘greenium’, that is, the possible premium paid by bondholders for green bonds when compared with conventional bonds. Although there is no unanimity on the subject, empirical analyses have often found evidence of a ‘greenium’, that is, a negative premium that makes green bonds more expensive to investors than other bonds from the same issuer. A negative premium is regarded favorably by issuers because it can lower their funding costs, while investors will receive a slightly lower yield compared to existing similar bonds. This negative premium to bond holders is not a straightforward outcome of the green labeling as the green certification is not a financial standard and does not imply any direct impact on the credit rating of a bond. On the other hand, an indirect credit quality enhancement might result from the transparent information flow related to the process of verifying the green credentials of a bond, which include alignment with the Green Bond Principles, mandatory requirements for use of proceeds, tracking, and reporting, and an assurance framework with independent verifiers and clear procedures.Footnote 2 A common explanation for the greenium is that these instruments are appealing to investors with a green mandate, and socially responsible investors are an increasingly relevant liquidity source (Zerbib 2019). On the whole, the literature on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not unanimous in relating responsible investing and reduction of financial risk (e.g., McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Amel-Zadeh 2018), and this applies also to most analyses of green investments.Footnote 3 Most empirical studies investigate the different financial performance between ‘green’ and ‘brown’ companies mainly considering equity portfolios (see Alessi et al. 2021 and reference therein). Investors tastes and preferences can affect equity (Gollier and Pouget 2012; Gollier 2017), so that in addition to screening out undesirable stocks, investors might influence environmental policies of firms through shareholders proposals and lobbying the management. Some studies have tried to characterize the green mandate of those who are buying green bonds, but the takeaway of most analyses is that green bonds are being supported by those declaring themselves as green investorsFootnote 4 and those that do not (CBI 2018; Connaker and Madsbjerg 2019). Thus, green bonds apparently appeal to a wide range of investors which will be critical in scaling up the market. A theoretical model explaining why green assets exhibit lower expected returns has been developed in Pastor et al. (2020) in a CAPM framework where an environmental, social and governance (ESG) factor is introduced to capture customers’ tastes for green products and investors’ biases for green holdings. Their model can produce several predictions regarding green asset prices and portfolio holdings, the size of ESG investments and their impact at the social level. However, the assumption of normal returns and the restriction to market risk limits its application to corporate bonds, where credit risk is an important consideration. Our focus is on corporate green bonds. Since the first corporate green bond issuance in 2013, the corporate green bond market has been expanding at an impressive rate. In 2019 non-financial corporates almost doubled issuance from 2018 representing 23% of the total volume (CBI 2020). The non-financial corporates almost reached the volume issuance of financial corporates, totalizing 205 bn $ in 2020. There are very few studies focusing specifically on corporate green debt. Most studies have developed empirical analyses on a broader set of bond issuers, including sovereign and municipal bonds. In Sect. 2 we discuss some empirical evidence on green bond prices and conclude that even though results are mixed, a negative premium to investors prevails, albeit low on average. To our knowledge, a theoretical explanation of the relationship between green and conventional bond prices is still an open question. In this paper a structural model is developed to explain the formation of green bond prices and to address the issue of the so called ‘greenium’. We model the basic mechanism behind green bond issuance by a corporation in a stylized way, but, at the same time, we try to address some complexities embedded in green projects. In particular, the issue of uncertainty related to green investments is modelled explicitly.Footnote 5 While green bonds are characterized by a special type of communication with investors regarding the financed projects and their environmental impact, a precise assessment of their beneficial effects is difficult to elaborate especially because green projects often require new technologies, and reliable data on their effectiveness may be unavailable. This holds especially for those projects having long construction and operation periods such as those engaging in climate-change solutions. An additional source of uncertainty surrounding green projects may arise from the possibility of misuse of green funds and green-washing, i.e. when projects of ambiguous environmental value are financed, which shakes market confidence in these financial instruments.Footnote 6 Our model, albeit stylized, is the first introducing both uncertainty about firm earnings and uncertainty about the effectiveness of the financed environmental projects, and their interplay. The contribution of our paper is as follows. First, our model is rich enough to generate both a negative and a positive premium, as both have been detected in the empirical literature, and provides an explanation for both occurrences. Second, we investigate how a green bond issuance affects an issuer’s creditworthiness, depending on whether the funded green project is correlated with the core business of the firm or is mainly undertaken to signal a philanthropic commitment. In particular, we find that although uncertainty reduces the firm’s advantage in committing itself to environmentally responsible projects in many cases, it may even become an opportunity if the green projects are correlated with the core business of the firm. Third, we model the demand side of the green bond market to provide an explanation for the attractiveness of such securities despite their relatively expensive price. Thus, we complement the empirical investigation with a theoretical model that allows us to answer questions such as: How does the issuance of green bonds affect a firm’s ability to raise debt and its cost of financing? Does it make any difference across diverse issuers, i.e. ‘pure players’ whose revenues derive almost entirely from ‘green’ business activity vs firms with a large portion of revenue coming from another business line? What drives the corporate issuers’ supply and the investors’ demand for green bonds? In Sect. 3 a structural model is introduced to explain the role of several determinants of the green bond price dynamics. An explicit solution is obtained and calibrated in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the relevant parameters. Section 6 develops a model of optimal asset allocation for a portfolio of green vs conventional bonds and provides an explanation for the counterintuitive oversubscription of green bonds even in the presence of a negative premium to bondholders, and relate it to the investors’ environmental awareness. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",18

Reviewing the emerging weather-economy literature, Carleton and Hsiang (2016) and Dell et al. (2014) conclude that weather fluctuations are responsible for variations in agricultural and industrial output, labor productivity, health, conflict and political instability. Park et al. (2020) also find a negative correlation between heat and learning in a study using 10 million American students. This paper extends the existing literature, by investigating the effect of temperature on monthly exports in U.S. states. The detailed sectoral disaggregation of U.S. export statistics enables a macroeconomic perspective on the net effect of temperature on the U.S. economy, which at the same time provides suggestions for plausible channels of the temperature effect. The temporal resolution of the outcome variable facilitates the identification of possibly nonlinear effects of short-term weather changes that are less likely to appear when aggregated to annual measures, and ensures that the studied population does not change substantially during treatment, which reduces the likelihood of biases from time-varying confounding factors (Hsiang and Burke 2013). Previous literature has demonstrated microeconomic impacts from temperature fluctuations in a broad range of economies (Cachon et al. 2012; Cai et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018; Somanathan et al. 2015; Adhvaryu et al. 2019). Studies showing significant effects on aggregated economic outcomes in developed countries are seemingly scarcer. Dell et al. (2012) find significant, negative effects of higher average annual temperature on growth in GDP, but only for poor countries. Likewise, Jones and Olken (2010) estimate similar impacts on growth in poor countries’ annual exports. More novel research does, however, indicate substantial impacts of higher temperatures on the U.S. economy as well. At subnational level, Colacito et al. (2018) find that annual growth rates in U.S. states are negatively affected by increases in average summer temperature. Deryugina and Hsiang (2017) also estimate a significantly negative relationship between increases in temperature and income in U.S. counties, using an estimation approach which accounts for the nonlinearity established in earlier research (Burke et al. 2015). Burke and Tanutama (2019) too observe adverse effects of rising temperatures on a global sample of subnational economies, where e.g. the United States is estimated to have lost US$5 trillion in output during 2000–2015 due to warming. Consistent with this novel strand of the literature, I estimate a nonlinear temperature-economy relationship, where both hot and cold days have significantly adverse effects. I find that one additional day with average temperature above 25 \(^{\circ }\)C is associated with a decrease in exports by 0.22%, compared to days in the 5–10 \(^{\circ }\)C interval. As for cold temperatures, an extra day below \(-5\,^{\circ }\)C reduces monthly exports by 0.21%, compared to baseline temperature. Isolating the effect for each industry separately, I estimate hot days to have a significantly negative impact on livestock and capital-intensive industries mainly related to the transformation of raw materials into final products. Cold days are, in addition to agriculture and nonmetallic mineral products, instead found to reduce exports in the labor-intensive industries of apparel and textiles. In the Oil and Gas industry, I find that an extra day above 25 \(^{\circ }\)C leads to a reduction in exports by as much as 5.5% compared to baseline temperature. However, by estimating the same temperature effect on electricity consumption and production, I find suggestive evidence attributing this negative impact to a rise in domestic demand for natural gas. The results of this paper have two main implications. The industry estimates of the temperature effect indicate which economic sectors that are in need of defensive investments in order to effectively mitigate the negative effects of outdoor weather. Further, the results contribute to a more detailed understanding of the economic damages caused by future warming in the United States. The estimated impacts highlight the importance of incorporating the heterogeneity in weather vulnerability across sectors, and in climates across states, into the design of future U.S. climate policies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical framework of the results. Section 3 describes the data and discusses potential limitations. Section 4 describes the empirical framework of the estimations. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 explores the robustness of the results. Section 7 provides a discussion and concluding remarks.",1

Coal deposits, in particular, need to be left in the ground, because these are the most emissions-intensive fossil energy resources. This view is supported by the IPCC (2018, p. 16) in their special report on ""Global Warming of \(1.5^\circ \) C"", where they discuss four illustrative pathways of emissions reductions with different projected changes in primary energy from fossil energy resources in 2030 relative to 2010. Averaged across these pathways, the change required in primary energy from coal, gas, and oil is about minus 71%, plus 6%, and plus 8%, respectively. To date, many countries have been producing a large share of their electricity from coal. In the EU, about 15% of the fossil energy resources used for generating electricity are still coal resources (Agora Energiewende and Sandbag 2020, p. 10), and many EU citizens and environmental groups are concerned about their governments’ reluctance regarding, or exessively slow pace of phasing out coal. Recently, the European Union adopted the so-called ‘European Green Deal’ (European Commission 2019) which contains a call for the rapid phase-out of coal. However, the impression we get from the intensive public discussion about phasing out coal-based electricity generation is that there are policymakers, media and even economists who lack a clear understanding of the impact of the phase-out policy when performed in an international ETS, such as the EU ETS, which is characterized by the interaction of climate policies at national levels and that of the EU. As is well-known, reducing emissions cost-effectively requires a uniform carbon price, and a well-designed ETS accomplishes that for the emissions covered by the ETS. However, if the ETS contains coal- and gas-fired power plants and coal is phased out by command and control, the (shadow) emissions price is no longer uniform. Our paper aims to identify the distortions that such second-best phase-out policies generate in the markets for electricity and permits, and to assess the resulting impact on the countries’ welfare. In a simple static two-country model, we analyze phase-out policies when electricity from coal and natural gas is generated under the umbrella of an ETS. Our crucial and indeed realistic assumption is that the costs of electricity from gas exceed those from coal and, that the emissions intensity of electricity from coal exceeds that from gas. Both countries are price takers on the markets for electricity and permits, and these markets clear both endogenously and simultaneously. Our emphasis is on unilateral phase-out-of-coal policies that involve effects on both efficiency and distribution. In the basic policy scenario (Scenario 1) with national electricity markets, the emissions cap remains unchanged such that the ban of coal obviously has no effect on the level of climate change, because aggregate emissions are fixed. If emissions decrease in one country, they necessarily increase in the other country by the same amount. This so-called waterbed effect has been studied before in various settings and also occurs when coal is unilaterally phased out, but this is not at the center of our analysis. We focus on the policies’ distortionary effects on prices, on demands and supplies and especially on the countries’ welfare. To the best of our knowledge, these effects have not yet been rigorously analyzed. We determine their signs analytically and illustrate the equilibria of the markets for permits and electricity before and after the phase-out. The sum of consumer and producer rents is our indicator of consumption welfare that we use to determine the welfare changes induced by the policy. It should not come as a surprise that the unilateral phase-out of coal in Scenario 1 reduces the consumption welfare of the group of ETS countries, as all phase-out policies do, because such policies imply non-uniform (shadow) emissions prices and therefore violate cost-effectiveness. Scenario 1 is shown to exhibit strong asymmetric distributional effects. The country that bans coal unilaterally suffers a welfare loss and the other country is better off. Furthermore, the electricity price rises in the unilaterally acting country and declines in the other country, and the permit price decreases, which is definitively the wrong price signal when high emissions cause excessive climate damage. We seek to deepen insight into the effects of a unilateral ban of coal in Scenario 1 by modifying the analytical framework in two different ways. First we replace the strong assumption of a constant emissions cap by considering a policy that consists of a combination of unilateral coal phase-out and moderate tightening of the emissions cap (Scenario 2). Such a policy mix is suggested in a recent revision of the EU ETS Directive (Directive EU 2018/410) which provides coal banning countries with the option to cancel permits from their auction volume to prevent the decline in their permit demand from increasing the use of these permits in the other ETS countries. If a coal banning country makes use of the option provided in the directive, it essentially tightens the emissions cap of the EU ETS and thus implements a mixed policy that combines the phase-out of coal with some tightening of the cap. This policy mix (Scenario 2) turns out to reduce both climate damage and consumption welfare in both countries. When the emissions cap is fixed (Scenario 1), the signs of the other comparative-static effects are all different in the unilaterally acting country from those in the other countries. When the emissions cap is tightened (Scenario 2), the permit price increases and all other effects exhibit the same sign for all countries. These differences suggest that the distributional effects of a unilateral coal ban are much stronger in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2. Our second modification of the analytical framework is to replace the national electricity markets in Scenarios 1 and 2 with an international market for electricity. In Europe, there is some transboundary trade in electricity, but the cross-border infrastructure is inappropriate and price convergence is partial (European Commission 2017). Therefore, we replace the polar assumption of no trade with the opposite polar assumption of free trade and thus delineate the range of outcomes expected in semi-international electricity markets. In line with the familiar proposition that opening borders creates ‘gains from trade’, our results indicate that the trade in electricity has a smoothening effect and shifts to the other country a share of the welfare loss that accrues to the coal-banning country in Scenario 1. Our paper is related to the literature that studies the impact of climate policies in the presence of different carbon sources, and to the environmental federalism literature. In closed economies, Chakravorty et al. (2008) and van der Ploeg and Withagen (2012) study the optimal extraction of different non-renewable resources in dynamic models with a ceiling and a carbon tax, respectively. Coulomb and Henriet (2018) elaborate the distributional impacts of optimal carbon taxation in a dynamic model with coal and gas. Turning to environmental federalism, Oates and Schwab (1988) and Ogawa and Wildasin (2009) show, in one-resource models with local and global pollution,Footnote 1 respectively, that decentralized policymaking is efficient when countries are small and take market prices as given. Santore et al. (2001) introduce a federal ETS that overlaps with state-level emissions taxes, and point out that strategic permit-price manipulation of state-level regulators leads to an inefficient allocation. Finally, Verbon and Withagen (2010) elaborate that efficiency can be restored by an appropriate initial distribution of permits that exactly neutralizes the harmful permit-price manipulation. In open economies, Fischer and Salant (2017) study different unilateral and global climate policies in a model with multiple resource pools with different extraction costs to keep the temperature increase below \(2^\circ \) C. Daubanes et al. (2021) examine the strategy of an open economy aimed at reducing its carbon emissions by replacing the consumption of coal with gas, and show that the country’s unilateral emission reduction may ultimately increase global carbon emissions. Our paper also focusses on the unilateral substitution of coal with gas, but to the best of our knowledge, is the first to analyze the phase-out of coal by one country in an EU-type international ETS. When one country phases out coal, coal-based electricity may increase in other countries, and permits and emissions shift to the other countries. The former phenomenon is known as leakage and the latter as the waterbed effect. Leakage is well known in the context of carbon regulation (see e.g. Daubanes et al. 2017, Garella and Trentinaglia 2019 and Klaushal and Rosendahl 2020). Waterbed effects have recently received attention in studying the EU ETS (Perino 2018, Eichner and Pethig (2019a) and Pahle et al. 2019, Hamaguchi 2020). It is worth mentioning that the present paper focusses mainly on the substitution between coal and gas, whereas substitution between fossil fuels and a renewable resource in an EU ETS has been tackled by Jarke and Perino (2017) and Eichner and Pethig (2019a). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up a stylized two-country model of electricity generation by means of natural gas and coal and \(\text{ CO}_2\) regulation. Section 3 analyzes the allocative displacement effects in the basic unilateral phase-out-of-coal policy (Scenario 1) and compares it with all countries phasing out coal. Section 4 extends Scenario 1 in two directions: It first analyzes a policy that combines the unilateral phase-out of coal with a specific cut of the emissions cap (Scenario 2) and then reconsiders Scenarios 1 and 2 with the national electricity markets being replaced by a common international electricity market. Section 5 concludes.",2

Out of all analyses, 29 (about 11 per cent) contain a cost analysis, and 52 (about 19 per cent) a full BCA. The case for doing a BCA ahead of governmental regulation is strong, however. For instance, Rose-Ackerman (2007, p. 23) notes that a BCA constitutes “a reasonably clear standard that can make special interest deals harder to accomplish, without tying the hands of the state.” Moreover, she notes that BCA is superior to, e.g., the precautionary principle, as this principle is not defined clearly enough to provide realistic policy guidance. Cass Sunstein has long argued for the use of BCA, e.g., in terms of “thinking slow”, i.e., that a BCA reduces at least two common fallacies of thinking, namely the framing effect and loss aversion (Sunstein 2000, 2019). Hahn and Tetlock (2008) give examples where a BCA has played an important role in American environmental regulation, e.g., in the phasing out of lead in gasoline. They also give examples of regulations where the costs probably exceeded the benefits. Bondemark et al. (2020) study the impact of alternative analyses, namely the distributional and goal fulfilment analyses on the choice of transport infrastructure projects in Sweden. They note that interviewed planners have concerns about the way these analyses are designed, that the analyses lack nuance, and that there is no consensus on how to perform the analyses. A BCA performs better on all these aspects and is consequently one of the three main factors that influences investment decisions.Footnote 3 While a BCA does not guarantee that a chosen policy is either efficient or cost efficient, it reduces the risk of imposing a proposal that is inefficient or leads to sub-optimisation (Nerhagen & Forsstedt 2019). The literature contains a number of explanations to why BCA does not influence policy-making more. These include political economics including ideology,Footnote 4 equity concerns, the cost of conducting a BCA (Vigren & Ljungberg 2018),Footnote 5 the organization of government agencies (Shapiro 2017), and possibly more seldom, geographical considerations (Halse & Fridstrøm 2019). The present paper offers a micro-level explanation instead. Thus, cognitive dissonance and bureaucrats’ career concerns lead them to self-select to implement an agenda setting policy instead of socially optimal policy.Footnote 6 An important premise for this hypothesis is that bureaucrats have real authority (Aghion & Tirole 1997) and can influence policy design (Faber et al. 2002; Uba 2010; Berkowitz & Krause 2020). Moreover, while e.g., Dewatripont et al. (1999) point out that a distinguishing feature between government agencies and private companies is that the former are instructed to pursue social welfare objectives and the latter are asked solely to maximize shareholder value, Gregg et al. (2011) show that individuals self-select themselves so that the more pro-social individuals will, to a greater degree, work for the non-profit sector (for an overview of the prosocial behavior among bureaucrats, see Polidori and Teobaldelli (2013)). Lindvall and Rothstein (2006, p. 52) argue that “since the 1980’s [in Sweden], a large number of national administrative agencies have been set up with ideology production as their main aim”—a view that combined with Gregg’s et al. (2011) indicates that public policy may be more “pro-social” than would be socially optimal. Brady et al. (1995) integrate the theory of cognitive dissonance with public choice theory in a context where the public sector acts as a market surrogate for the exchange of dissonance. They argue that cognitive dissonance can be used as a framework for examining certain public sector decisions, which will provide insight into unseen elements of rent-seeking. Cognitive dissonance is the “uncomfortable feeling caused by simultaneously holding two contradictory cognitions” (Alfnes et al. 2010, p. 147). An important feature of cognitive dissonance is that the dissonance arousing behaviour must be perceived as having been freely chosen, having little external justification, and entailing a commitment (Akerlof & Dickens 1982; Nail et al. 2004; Wichardt 2012). Cognitive dissonance can then be seen as a price for norm violations. Moreover, different people have different “reservation prices” for norm-disobedient behaviour in the same or similar situations (Wichardt 2012). A bureaucrat may then experience cognitive dissonance if they have to promote a level of public good provision that differs from their preferred one, regardless of whether this preference is based on a professional norm, a private belief, a mission (Besley & Ghatak 2005) or the bureaucrat’s belief of what is socially optimal (Eggert et al. 2018). As stated originally by Festinger (1957), cognitive dissonance theory proposes that the bureaucrat is motivated to reduce this tension and may, in the context of the present paper, achieve this either by adapting their own preferences towards the agency’s goal policy, or by changing jobs (quitting). We show that because of the cognitive adjustment that an individual experience over time, the rent obtained from being employed by a given agency increases over time. However, the longer the individual remains employed by the agency, the lower is their propensity to do a BCA that might challenge the agency’s preferred policy choice. Only in agencies whose supply of the public good is restricted by a binding governmental budget constraint may the bureaucrats have an incentive to do a BCA, given that it may influence the budget constraint. While cognitive dissonance is widely studied, the literature on the impact of cognitive dissonance on bureaucrats’ behaviour is not large. Brady et al. (1995) explain how public sector agents can use the manipulation of dissonance for their own ends to achieve their own goals by changing the perceptions of the public. Unlike the present paper they do not consider how the cognitive dissonance experienced by the bureaucrats themselves influences their behaviour. Konow (2000) examines the cognitive trade-off arising from a public agent either forwarding their own material utility or “fairness”. Using variations of the so-called “dictator game” his experiments corroborate both the fairness and cognitive dissonance components and show that “unfair” behaviour may be attributed rather to self-deception than to unadulterated self-interest. The present paper is organized as follows: In the next section we construct a theoretical model of the economy and the bureaucrats. Policy outcomes from the model with cognitive dissonance are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 extends the model to explain the incentives for some agencies to conduct a BCA by including a governmental budget constraint in the model. The last section discusses the results and concludes.",2

Even though electric vehicles have a long tradition, they never diffused on larger scale until recently. IEA (2019) counts more than five million registered electric cars globally in 2018. China is the leading country in terms of absolute number of electric cars, with a share of about 45% of global electric cars. China also has the largest electric bus fleet in operation, with 99% of electric buses worldwide (Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2018).Footnote 1 However, compared to the overall stock of vehicles and their potential to address local and global environmental problems, the number of electric vehicles needs to increase substantially and substitute vehicles with internal combustion engine in the next years (Sims et al. 2014). The increasing use of electric vehicles is one of the requirements to achieve the 1.5 °C goal to reduce the impact of climate change (IPCC 2018). Diffusion of electric vehicles is impeded by several shortcomings compared to conventional vehicles with internal combustion engine. Foremost, electric vehicles face disadvantages due to higher initial purchasing costs (Weiss et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2015) and total cost of ownership (Falcão et al. 2017; Palmer et al. 2018). Furthermore, their technological development is not as advanced as the one for internal combustion engine vehicles. In particular, the batteries powering the vehicles require substantial technological improvements. This technological disadvantage leads to lower utility, since range is reduced and charging is time-consuming. Also, charging opportunities are not as frequently available as gas stations for conventional vehicles. Customers perceive the reduced range and possible lack of charging infrastructure as a major disadvantage and “range anxiety” reduces their willingness to purchase electric vehicles (Egbue and Long 2012; Coffman et al. 2016). Lastly, the automotive industry is locked-in into the production of conventional vehicles and efforts to innovate in electric vehicles are reduced (Cowan and Hulten 1996; Unruh 2000). To overcome these monetary and technological disadvantages of electric vehicles, policy makers implemented various instruments to foster their diffusion. Policy makers’ intention to support the diffusion of electric vehicles not only aims to improve local and global environmental conditions, but it is also motivated by industrial policy considerations (Lane et al. 2013). The tremendous increase in electric vehicle diffusion in China can be attributed to such governmental interventions. Since the 1990s, the Chinese government has placed the development and diffusion of electric vehicles high on its political agenda (Gong et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2015; Zhang and Bai 2017). First, China wants to establish an industry base to leapfrog conventional technologies and claim global leadership in the electric vehicle market (Wang and Kimble 2011; Howell et al. 2014). Second, China sees electric vehicles as means to address local pollution and improve local air quality (Zheng et al. 2012). Third, China wants to mitigate climate change and electric vehicles are a potential approach. To foster the diffusion of electric vehicles, several policy instruments were implemented on the national as well as on the regional level (Zhang and Bai 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). This paper analyzes different determinants for the diffusion of electric vehicles in China. The heterogeneous policy instruments implemented at the central and regional government level make China an interesting case to understand which policy instruments and conditions influence electric vehicle diffusion. Based on a theoretical discussion of the factors influencing the diffusion of environmental innovations and the emerging literature on the diffusion of electric vehicles, we derive four hypotheses: we hypothesize that monetary as well as non-monetary incentives, availability of public charging infrastructure and the local environmental conditions have an effect on the diffusion of electric vehicles. We test the influence of these four possible determinants on four different electric vehicle types. We separate electric vehicles into two categories based on their engines – Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). BEV run solely on an electric engine, while PHEV have both an electric engine and an internal combustion engine, which can power the vehicle if the battery is empty. We further differentiate between vehicle types, namely cars and buses. Since China is also the world leader in electric buses (IEA 2019), new insights can be derived from a comparative analysis of different vehicle types. We use a System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approach to account for the dynamic nature of the diffusion process and to tackle endogeneity issues, especially with respect to subsidies and charging infrastructure. Our analysis covers the period 2010–2016 for 31 Chinese regions (cities and provinces) mainly in the eastern part of the country. Our results provide a detailed and heterogeneous picture of the determinants of electric vehicle diffusion in China. The distinction among four different vehicle types reveals that policy instruments do not affect vehicle types equally. The total subsidy amount is especially relevant for BEV cars. However, differentiating between regional and central government subsidies reveals that the regional subsidy level has a positive effect for all vehicle types, while the central government subsidy, which decreases over time, has in some cases an adverse effect. Public charging infrastructure is relevant for the diffusion of all vehicle types and charging stations are especially relevant for electric buses. Non-monetary incentives such as license-plate lotteries or auctions show an effect only for BEV cars. Local air pollution only has an effect on the diffusion of buses, but not on cars. With the latter result we provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical assessment of environmental conditions on diffusion. We show that in specific cases, here the diffusion of buses, bad environmental conditions can increase diffusion of environmentally friendly innovations. However, one needs to keep in mind that these buses are usually purchased by regional governments and are most likely part of a larger effort to address local pollution via green public procurement (Aldenius and Khan 2017). In terms of research on the diffusion of electric vehicles, we provide the first empirical assessment of the diffusion of buses, a highly relevant case neglected so far in empirical analysis. We furthermore provide policy recommendations on the diffusion of electric vehicles in particular and for environmentally friendly innovations in general. In the following Sect. 2 we provide a theoretical discussion about the diffusion of environmentally friendly innovations and derive four hypotheses for determinants of electric vehicle diffusion. Section 3 provides insights on electric vehicle diffusion in China as well as Chinese environmental conditions. In Sect. 4, we discuss our data and estimation strategy and we provide regression results. In Sect. 5 we discuss the results and conclude.",8

Many empirical studies examine its effectiveness, efficiency and equity performance compared to other instruments. A recent study by Lilliestam et al. (2021) reviews the empirical evidence for an impact of carbon pricing on technological change. While this type of assessment is timely and policy-relevant, it should be stressed that innovation impact is just one among multiple reasons to promote carbon pricing (Cramton et al. 2017). In their abstract the authors state that “Critically, all articles examining the effects on zero-carbon investment found that existing carbon pricing scheme have had no effect at all. We conclude that the effectiveness of carbon pricing in stimulating innovation and zero-carbon investment remains a theoretical argument. So far, there is no empirical evidence of its effectiveness in promoting the technological change necessary for full decarbonization.” We believe that a critical reader would judge these negative conclusions as being unwarranted, for several reasons—as discussed in the next section. We also provide suggestions for how to improve reviews of such a complicated issue.",13

A Spatial Panel Analysis of Regional Air Pollution in South Korea,December 2021,Erik Hille,Bernhard Lambernd,Aviral K. Tiwari,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Korea’s miraculous development into a high-income economy was driven by a rapid industrialization and strong export orientation. The country’s leading industries, which include electronics, automobiles, chemicals, steel, and shipbuilding, are capital-intensive and mostly organized in so-called industrial complex clusters. In these clusters the majority of the country’s manufacturing output and roughly 80% of its exports are produced (NGII 2017). However, the importance of capital-intensive industries, paired with the dependence on imported fossil fuels, have resulted in energy, emission, and some material intensities that are among the highest in the OECD (OECD 2020). Recent problems regard in particular air pollution, which is the focus of this paper, in the form of fine dust emissions as well as air quality issues in the capital region (Jones and Yoo 2012; OECD 2020). In order to lessen the issues related to the historic brown growth paradigm, the far-reaching National Strategy for Green Growth has been implemented from 2009 onwards.Footnote 1 This national strategy sets the long-term policy framework until 2050, focusing on three main objectives: (1) to mitigate climate change and increase energy self-sufficiency, (2) to create new green growth engines, and (3) to become a forerunner in improving the quality of life, e.g. by reducing air pollution with strong local effects, such as sulfur oxides (SOX), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and total suspended particles (TSP) (GGGI 2015; Jones and Yoo 2012). The long-term plan has been specified in several medium- and short-term plans, including the First and Second Five-Year Plans for Green Growth (2009–2013 and 2014–2018). Besides nationwide initiatives, the greening of industrial clusters and numerous regional initiatives are crucial to achieve the green growth objectives. Concerning the former, the national government provided a list of priority industries most suitable for each region and has fostered the establishment of green clusters, by e.g. granting matching funds to more than 1000 entities (GGGI 2015). For instance, a green car industrial cluster has been set up in the Ulsan-Gyeongsangnam region, where the leading Korean car manufacturers are based. Local governments have also been encouraged to define their own regional green cluster plans and construct testbed facilities. Concerning the latter, several initiatives, often in urban areas, have strived to improve the quality of life. These initiatives include public investments in infrastructure, such as the deployment of natural gas and electric buses in Seoul (GGGI 2015) or seed funding for a smart grid project in Jeju province (Mathews 2012), as well as regulation incentives, such as the implementation of a cap-and-trade program for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and TSP emissions in the capital region (Jones and Yoo 2012). Overall, first evaluations have regarded the Korean green growth strategy as highly ambitious, but it remains unclear if its implementation will be a success story, particularly in the light of the recent air pollution problems, the capital-intensive goods production, and high fossil fuel consumption intensities (Kim et al. 2014; Mathews 2012). Given the comparatively high air pollution and the relevance of regional elements in the green growth strategy, this paper uses province-level data to analyze the effect of economic growth on regional air emissions in Korea. In this context, we contribute to research in two main ways. First, we test for changes since the launch of the National Strategy for Green Growth. Specifically, we specify general changes in air emissions with strong local effects, focusing on per capita SOX and TSP emissions, and look for changed growth effects by adapting the classic Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework. In other words, our analysis concentrates on the 3rd main objective of the green growth strategy, i.e. to improve the quality of life by reducing air pollution, and provides regional evidence. Already before the green growth strategy, both SOX and TSP have been subject to governmental regulation, because of their strong impacts on health and the environment paired with the availability of abatement technologies.Footnote 2 SOX is a main acid rain precursor and can cause illnesses, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and emphysema. Similarly, besides adversely affecting plant growth, particle pollution can cause cancer, asthma, allergies, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (NIER 2020). As we consider data from 1999 to 2016, this is the first ex-post study of growth effects on emissions to analyze the First Five-Year Plan for Green Growth. Hence, we provide first evidence whether the postulated stronger commitment entailed an improvement in Korean air quality and a greening of economic growth. Moreover, the period allows considering the development of high fine dust emissions during recent years and detecting its main drivers. Our results suggest that, in order to become a forerunner in improving the quality of life, policy makers need to intensify the initiatives of the green growth strategy. Second, we control for spatial interactions between provinces and contribute to spatial econometric research on the growth-environment nexus. On the one hand, given the importance of industrial clusters in Korea in general as well as of regional initiatives in the green growth strategy, this paper provides new spatial econometric evidence of the growth effects on air emissions for a country that has rarely been explored at the regional level. For this reason, we analyze data on 16 province-level divisions.Footnote 3 While relatively few studies have applied spatial econometric approaches in general, focusing mostly on growth effects in China and few highly developed economies (Auffhammer and Steinhauser 2007; Cole et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2014), a very limited number of studies on Korea has considered regional environmental data at all (Choi et al. 2015; Park and Lee 2011). Controlling for spatial interactions is important, because air emissions are inherently spatial. In other words, they are distributed by the wind, and therefore economic activity within regions that are close to each other, tends to affect one another’s emissions (Burnett et al. 2013). Similarly, regions typically also interact through other channels, such capital and trade flows, technological spillover, and common environmental policies (Meng and Huang 2018). That is, these factors and air pollution across regions are in parts not independent, and thus neglecting spatial interactions may bias the estimated relationships or lower the efficiency of the estimator (Cole et al. 2013). On the other hand, we contribute to spatial econometric analyses in general by estimating a spatial lag of X (SLX) model using the Han–Phillips estimator for dynamic spatial panel data. This is an estimator developed more recently to control for potential endogeneity, while avoiding weak moment condition problems and biases in small samples. Prior spatial studies on the growth-environment nexus considered mostly three classic spatial models, i.e. spatial Durbin, spatial lag, and spatial error models, through maximum likelihood estimation (Burnett et al. 2013; Cole et al. 2013), and frequently do not control for simultaneity of explanatory variables other than for a spatially lagged dependent variable (Balado-Naves et al. 2018; Kang et al. 2016). The paper continues as follows. While in Sect. 2 a theoretical background is given on models used to assess the growth-environment nexus, Sect. 3 summarizes the relevant empirical literature, focusing on spatial studies and research on Korea. Section 4 provides the descriptive statistics on the regional development of economic growth and the two air emissions with strong local effects. In Sect. 5, the fixed effects model, the spatial econometric model, and the data sources are introduced. Section 6 discusses the regression results. Last, Sect. 7 provides a summary of the findings as well as policy recommendations.",4

Fredriksson,Aatishya Mohanty,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. Government responses resulted in lockdowns and mobility restrictions, which led to short-term reductions in air pollution. In this paper, we study the role of democracy and electoral rules for the short-term improvements in air quality resulting from COVID-19 policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel contribution to the literature. The literature provides estimates of the changes in air quality resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Brodeur et al. (2021) find that particulate matter concentration levels declined by approximately 25% in the US and Europe. Sharma et al. (2020) report decreases of PM2.5, PM10, CO2, and NO2 of between 10 to 43% in Indian cities, and Li et al. (2020) and Liu (2020) report similar declines in China. In contrast, Dang and Trinh (2021) report that across 164 countries, NO2 and PM2.5 levels fell by only 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, and that mobility restrictions explain these findings. Meanwhile, the political science, psychology and medical literatures argue that a population’s response to a crisis such as the pandemic depends on citizens’ trust in government, political institutions, and science (Woelfert and Kunst 2020; Schraff 2021; Esaiasson et al. 2021; Groeniger et al. 2021). Consistent with this view, trust in institutions and government affected adherence to social distancing policies during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, e.g. (Blair et al. 2017). We test the hypothesis that changes in air pollution resulting from government COVID-19 restrictions depended on the level of democracy and democracies’ electoral system. In particular, we focus on proportional and majoritarian electoral systems. We thus help fine-tune our understanding of the short-term impacts on air pollution, a research focus emphasized by, e.g., Helm (2020) and Lee (2021). If citizens’ political trust is higher in democratic governments, compliance with regulations, changes in mobility patterns, and associated pollution reductions should be higher (Marien and Hooghe 2011; Eichengreen et al. 2021). However, the system for selection of government may matter in democracies. In proportional electoral systems, government leadership tends to be more fractionalized than in majoritarian electoral systems. The political and scientific views are likely to differ, resulting in more inconsistent messaging provided by coalition governments (Sagarzazu and Kluver 2017). Differentiated communication and political infighting among government parties are likely to reduce political trust in government in proportional systems. In majoritarian systems, messaging and management during a crisis may be expected to be more in unison and clear, resulting in greater political trust and compliance.Footnote 1 These differences may be particularly acute during a crisis such as a pandemic. A crisis may also give rise to “rally-around-the-flag” effects where the government is trusted to a greater degree (Dinesen and Jaeger 2013; Esaiasson et al. 2020; Schraff 2021; Groeniger et al. 2021). Flückiger et al. (2019) show that during the West African Ebola epidemic, trust in government increased with exposure to the epidemic. Using survey data from seven Western European countries, Bol et al. (2021) estimate that lockdowns increased satisfaction with democracy and trust in government by around 2.4–3.2%, and intentions to vote for the party of the head of government rose by 4.1–4.3% (with a total increase of 6% for all governing political parties). However, the 2008 global financial crisis reduced trust in governments according to Earle (2009). Similarly, Skali et al. (2021) find that when Switzerland (with a proportional electoral system) faced crisis during war time, trust in the government declined. Our empirical work helps shed light on whether rally-around-the-flag effects differ across proportional and majoritarian systems, with consequent differential effects on environmental quality. We provide random effects estimates using panel data from a total of 119 countries. As a measure of air quality, we utilize daily values of satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) from NASA (Platnick et al. 2015) for the period January 3-June 30, 2020. To estimate the change in AOD, the median value of AOD on the same day of the week (e.g., Monday) from January 3-February 6, 2020, is used as the baseline. The regulatory measure is the COVID-19 Stringency Policy Index by Hale et al. (2020) and Polity V is our main democracy measure (Marshall and Jaggers 2018). The estimations suggest that a given increase in the stringency of COVID-19 policies on average reduced daily AOD levels, but the decline was greater in more democratic countries. Within the group of democracies, the marginal AOD reductions were smaller in countries with proportional electoral rules compared to those with majoritarian systems. To help explain these findings, we show differential responses in community mobility. Mobility changes were measured at transit stations, groceries and pharmacies, and workplaces (data provided by Google 2020). Next, we control for pre-COVID-19 (baseline) levels of confidence in government, trust in politicians, and social capital. Our results for democracies, proportional and majoritarian systems remain robust overall. COVID-19 policies reduced both AOD and mobility by more in countries with greater confidence in government and trust in politicians. Thus, there were rally-around-the-flag effects in countries with these characteristics. However, although social capital reinforced a decline in air pollution, this was not due to the mobility changes included in the analysis. The estimations suggest that the decline in mobility was slightly lower in countries with high social capital. One potential explanation may be that populations in countries with high social capital believed that others within their community would stay socially distant and wear masks, and they therefore would not need to comply and reduce their own mobility to the same degree. Moreover, Woelfert and Kunst (2020) report that social trust was related to a higher growth rate of infections in a study of 65 countries. It appears that in countries with high social capital the decline in air quality occurred to a higher degree via other channels such as declines in industrial production, construction, and long-range transportation (Li et al. 2020). However, the mobility changes help explain the overall impacts of COVID-19 regulations on air quality in democracies, and in proportional and majoritarian systems. Our results are robust to controlling for risk exposure, the capacity of the health care sector, legal origins, colonial history, and institutional quality. While the literature has previously discussed the relationship between democracy, political institutions, and environmental quality and policy (e.g., Folke 2014; Kammerlander and Schulze 2020; Ang and Fredriksson 2021; Hu and Chen 2021), to our knowledge the questions addressed in the present paper are novel. We believe our findings broaden our understanding of the environmental (and health) effects of government policymaking, in particular during a crisis situation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the empirical specification and data, and Sect. 3 reports the baseline results. Section 4 introduces measures of government confidence, trust and social capital into the baseline models. Section 5 shows how changes in mobility, conditional on democratic institutions, help explain the changes in pollution. Section 6 reports robustness analysis based on potential vulnerabilities, institutions, demography, instrumental variables, and excluding regions, respectively. Section 7 concludes.",5

This poor state of affairs has been with us for some time and the costs are substantial (Clark 2005). The estimated global cost of forgone rents for the year 2012 alone was for instance estimated to be US$ 83 billion for that year alone (World Bank 2017). The problem of overfishing is likely to be exacerbated by technology. Brander and Taylor (1997) demonstrated that improved productivity could lead to more aggressive harvesting of open access resources. This also applies to open access fisheries and fisheries subject to the tragedy of the commons (Whitmarsh 1990; Squires and Vestergaard 2013; Squires and Vestergaard 2018). There are several well documented examples where improved technology has led to the collapse of a fish stock (Hannesson et al. 2010; Gordon and Hannesson 2015). Kvamsdal et al. (2016) point out that even in managed fisheries, “…increased technical efficiency and progress, usually lead to overcapacity in national fishing fleets. Overcapacity creates national pressure for higher quotas…”. In a recent paper, Skonhoft and Quaas (2019) find that in a restricted open access or shared resource fishery if the long run steady state in a shared, but unmanaged, resource fishery is lower than the harvest rate associated with maximum sustainable yield, then improved technology may increase rents. However in larger, more accessible fisheries this condition is unlikely to hold. The caveat in Skonhoft and Quaas (2019) not notwithstanding, it seems clear that improved technology worsens the market failure of a poorly managed fishery. This is unfortunate as improved technology has the potential to make the fishery more valuable and therefore makes it even more important that fish stocks are managed as well as possible and that the role of technology is understood. Remarkably little has been written on the role of technology in an optimally managed fishery. As stated in Squires and Vestergaard (2013): ""… the normative literature has yet to formally analyze the impact of changes in disembodied and embodied technical progress and technical efficiency on optimum exploitation of common renewable resources."" The analysis in the literature on the effects of improved productivity is mostly concerned with steady state analysis and/or singular solutions resulting from bang-bang controls (Clark and Munro 1975; Caputo 1989; Squires and Vestergaard 2013, 2018). However steady state analysis is only locally relevant and policy advice for management of recovering stocks should not be based on steady state analysis. As we shall see, in fisheries such a strategy would be particularly ill advised as the effects of technology in the case of stock dependent costs go in completely different directions in steady state and in stock levels sufficiently below the optimal steady state. Squires and Vestergaard (2013, 2018) go some way in performing a formal analysis. Their contribution is contrasted with the results in the present paper in conjunction with the discussion of stock dependent cost functions. The results are derived in general versions of the original canonical fisheries model (Clark and Munro 1975). The modelling of improved productivity is very basic and obtained by examining how an exogenous and unanticipated one-shot change in a productivity parameter affects optimal policy. This may seem restrictive. However, making the productivity change unanticipated allows us to study the pure effect of technology disentangled from the effect of preparing for an expected productivity increase. Also, even if a productivity increase is anticipated by the fishing industry it may still catch regulating authorities off guard. The present paper may thus inform regulators how to respond to such an event. It should also be noted that even if the interpretation of the change in the parameter in the present paper is as a productivity increase, other interpretations are also possible. E.g. an unanticipated permanent decrease in the price of an important normal input has the same effect on output as a productivity shock. See Bertoletti and Rampa (2013) for an analysis of what constitutes normal and inferior goods.",3

To meet the need for ex-ante information on the economic impact of fisheries management, policy-oriented bio-economic fisheries models have been developed. Such models integrate both biological and economic features in order to evaluate the impact of fisheries policies. Prellezo et al. (2012) and Nielsen et al. (2018) provide overviews of integrated ecological-economic fisheries models (IEEFM) used for policy analyses. The overviews show a need for multiple models with different modeling features, such as multiple or single species, optimization or simulation models, static or dynamic models, etc. We develop a new model of the Swedish commercial fisheries based on concepts from agricultural models using Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) and apply it to analyze the interaction between seals and fisheries. The agricultural economic literature frequently discusses issues of model calibration, i.e. how constrained optimization models can be brought to replicate empirical observations. The dominating methodological framework is Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), which aims to calibrate constrained mathematical programming models to observed behavior. The seminal paper by Howitt (1995) presented a calibration method that was technically easy to implement in existing models and therefore was quickly adopted by many modellers. That method was followed by variations that overcome certain limitations of the initial methodFootnote 1 (e.g. Röhm and Dabbert 2003), theoretical work on the properties of such calibrations such as the range of supply elasticities that can be reproduced (Mérel and Bucaram 2010) and attempts to apply econometric techniques such as Maximum Entropy (Heckelei and Wolff 2003) or Bayesian methods (Jansson and Heckelei 2011) to further strengthen the empirical content of such models. Models based on PMP are regularly used in applied analyses (c.f. the review by Heckelei et al. 2012) where they provide insights on how agricultural policies affect the sector. Fisheries models are almost absent from the literature on PMP and the review of fisheries models by Nielsen et al. (2018) does not mention calibration nor other methods to align model balselines with empirical data. An exception is the paper by Sweeney et al. (2017), who apply a PMP model for Hawaii’s longline fishery. The calibration problem in PMP models becomes more complex the more inequality constraints there are in the model because the economic value of the constraint, which is a dual variable of the model, is typically not observed and must be set in concordance with variables such as catch and effort (days at sea). Fisheries policies are often rife with inequalities in the form of catch quotas and effort restrictions. Methodologically, our study contributes (i) to the literature on PMP by extending an econometrically based calibration method to the case with many potentially non-binding restrictions, and (ii) to the fisheries literature by showing how techniques adapted from agricultural economics can be used to align model baselines with empirical data. The seal-fisheries interaction in Sweden used for the empirical application is a special case of a more general issue of interactions between fisheries and marine mammals. Due to successful conservation measures, many marine mammal populations are currently recovering at a global level (Magera et al. 2013) which will increase future interactions between mammals and fisheries.Footnote 2 This includes e.g. bycatch of marine mammals (Read, Drinker, and Northridge 2006; Read 2008; Lent and Squires 2017), fish stock recovery (Cook and Trijoulet 2016; Costalago et al. 2019), and competition for resources (Hansson, et al. 2017; Reidy 2019; Goldsworthy et al. 2019).Footnote 3 The economic consequences of interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals have previously been studied by e.g. Flaaten and Stollery (1996) who estimated that a 10% increase in the northeast Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera Acutorostrata) population reduce the gross profit of the Norwegian cod and herring fisheries by between 2.8 and 6.7%. Holma et al. (2014) found the net present value of profits in the Finnish salmon fishery to be approximately double in scenarios without seals, while Finnoff and Tschirhart (2003) estimate that the commercial harvest of prey species (pollock) had a significant role to play in the decline of the endangered Stellar sea lion in the northern Pacific. The model developed in this paper is a short-term PMP model with detailed information on the fishery, but without dynamic components for investments/disinvestments in the fleet and the development of fish stocks or seal populations over time. It contains a high degree of details (24 fleet segments taking part in 247 fisheries and landing 44 different species) and provides result indicators (e.g. days at sea, economic indicators, landings, etc.) for each of these. This is important since many stakeholders will base their responses on how their specific fleet is affected in the short run and not the long-run effects when the ecosystem and fleets have had time to adjust to an equilibrium. The paper is outlined as follows. In Sect. 3 we provide the specific setting of Swedish fisheries and seal management, which is necessary before turning to the empirical model. Section 4.2 contains the model and Sect. 5.3 the calibration approach. In Sect. 6 the data and calibration results are presented. Section 7.4 contains the seal management scenarios analyzed in the empirical application, and Sect. 7 the empirical results. The results are discussed in Sect. 8 and the empirical findings are summarized in Sect. 8.1.",1

The discussion also highly affects agriculture as it is a driving force behind global warming, accounting for approximately 14% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide (European Environment Agency 2019). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2017), climate change is among the biggest challenges agriculture is currently facing in terms of both mitigation and adaptation. The European Union (EU) has acknowledged the impact of farming on climate change and vice versa. Therefore, the European Commission (2019a) has declared climate change mitigation as a specific objective of the future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). While farmers in the EU are expected to reduce their GHG emissions, the global need for food, fiber and bioenergy from agriculture is steadily rising (FAO 2017), i.e. agricultural productivity must further increase. This raises the question as to what extent farmers can boost their production while at the same time limiting their release of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. In this study, we analyze the performance of farms,giving equal weighting to economic success and to the emission of greenhouse gases. More specifically, our research objective is two-fold. First, we develop a parametric eco-efficiency concept capable of jointly evaluating the ecological and economic performance of businesses over time. Usually, eco-efficiency is analyzed in a nonparametric data envelopment setting. The idea behind the parametrization is to overcome some of the conceptual limitations faced by the model in a nonparametric setting. Second, we seek to approximate GHG emissions for a large sample of German farms by using a novel approach based on the guidelines for national GHG inventories of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2006). Over recent decades, the concept of ecological-economic efficiency, or ""eco-efficiency"" has gained recognition as a way of evaluating the balance between economic performance and the environmental damage induced by economic activity. Starting with the article by Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005), who operationalized the eco-efficiency concept to be calculated by means of data envelopment analysis (DEA), numerous studies in several fields followed, both at the micro- and at the macro-level. Literature focusing on the trade-off between greenhouse gas emissions and economic performance is sparse. Camarero et al. (2014) and Gómez-Calvet et al. (2016) analyze this relationship for European countries. Multiple authors have utilized the above-mentioned eco-efficiency concept in the farming context, ranging from livestock and arable farming to olive growing and horticulture (Picazo-Tadeo, Gómez-Limón, and Reig-Martínez 2011; Picazo-Tadeo, Beltrán-Esteve, and Gómez-Limón 2012; Gadanakis et al. 2015; Pérez Urdiales, Lansink, and Wall 2016; Bonfiglio, Arzeni, and Bodini 2017; Godoy-Durán et al. 2017). Several methodological advancements have been suggested in the literature. For instance, Picazo-Tadeo, Beltrán-Esteve, and Gómez-Limón (2012) use a directional distance function to asses the eco-efficiency of Spanish olive-growers. Beltrán-Esteve et al. (2014) extend this approach and make use of the metafrontier approach proposed by O’Donnell, Rao, and Battese (2008). Furthermore, Kortelainen (2008) embedded the concept of eco-efficiency into a dynamic setting allowing for comparisons over time. In an attempt to transfer the eco-efficiency concept to a parametric setting, Orea and Wall (2017) study the eco-efficiency of Spanish dairy farms in a stochastic frontier setting. Many of the aforementioned studies—and micro-level studies particularly—are rather limited in terms of their scope. For instance, none of the mentioned micro-studies on agriculture have implemented a dynamic approach yet. Also, although having acknowledged the possibility of variable returns to the scale of environmental pressures, very few studies account for it (Bonfiglio, Arzeni, and Bodini 2017). What is more, none of the studies have implemented the possibility of a non-linear structure when building composite indicators of environmental pressures. According to Beltrán-Esteve et al. (2014), one reason for the limited scope of many works on eco-efficiency is the lack of appropriate environmental data at the micro-level. This is also true for GHG emissions. Farms can vary substantially regarding their climatic impact. So far, most policies aiming at reducing GHG emissions from farming have largely been based on findings at the aggregate level, without taking farm heterogeneity properly into account. Recent attempts have been made to obtain GHG data at farm level. Coderoni and Esposti (2014) and Baldoni, Coderoni, and Esposti (2017) present a methodology to gather GHG emissions primarily based on farm accountancy data. Further applications of this method can be found in Baldoni, Coderoni, and Esposti (2018) and Coderoni and Esposti (2018). This study contributes to the literature by first conceptually extending the eco-efficiency approach based on Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005) and Orea and Wall (2017) to a more general stochastic frontier setting. By parameterizing the concept, we allow for variable returns to environmental pressure scale, a nonlinear structure of composite ecological damage, and for inter-temporal comparisons. Furthermore, we decompose eco-performance dynamics into ecological-technical change, eco-efficiency change and scale change, based on a generalized Malmquist productivity index (Orea 2002). We are able to show that our theoretical approach is equally valid for micro- and the macro-level analyses. In our empirical case study, we construct a unique panel dataset and demonstrate how to appropriately approximate GHG emissions at the micro-level, based on multiple data sources for farms in the German federal state of Bavaria. Finally, by applying a state-of-the-art stochastic frontier model, we are able to further distinguish between permanent and time-varying eco-efficiency (Kumbhakar, Lien, and Hardaker 2014). We show how to assess farms’ emission performance, i.e. their capability to produce goods and services while causing minimal climatic stress. By relating eco-performance to greenhouse gas emissions, it is possible to detect the relative GHG mitigation potential of individual farms. Such robust evidence is essential for managers and policy-makers that aiming at further optimizing their economic-ecological performance by reducing the release of atmospheric GHGs. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we develop the conceptual framework for the empirical analysis. In Sect. 3 we outline the data-construction process and provide relevant summary statistics. In Sect. 4, we present our empirical model and estimation strategy. Section 5 gives a description and discussion of the empirical findings, along with the policy implications thereof. The final Sect. 6 summarizes and concludes the limitations of the study, and potential directions for further research.",9

During 2005–2015, Japan experienced two such events: the 2011 earthquake and the Great Recession. The Great East Japan earthquake occurred on 11th March 2011, with a main shock of magnitude M9.0, making it one of the largest earthquakes in recorded history. The earthquake thrust tectonic plates 450 to 500 km in length off the coast of the Tohoku region in northeast Japan. A subsequent massive tsunami hit the coastal areas parallel to the plates, inundating 56,100 ha of land with water columns up to 40 m in height (Suzuki and Nakazato 2012). This massive disaster resulted in the deaths of more than 15,000 people, and more than 4000 were reported missing. The tsunami also inundated the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, leading to a failure in cooling of the nuclear fuel a few days after the earthquake (IAEA 2015). This disaster hit the Japanese economy hard. Immediately after the earthquake, supply chains were disrupted because many factories in the region were severely damaged, as was key infrastructure. The economic outputs of 4 prefectures in the region, namely Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, and Ibaraki, fell by 30–50% immediately after the earthquake (Tokunaga et al. 2017). Effects of the disaster were particularly felt in the electricity sector. Damages from the disaster resulted in the suspension of most nuclear and fossil-fuel power plants along the coast, thereby forcing much of the Tokyo Metropolitan area to implement a rotational blackout scheme for 10 days in March 2011 (ANRE 2012). During the following summer season, the power supply capacity remained insufficient, so industries and households in the Kanto (including Tokyo) and Tohoku regions were asked to reduce electricity consumption by 15% (ANRE 2012). These constraints broadly influenced economic activities in Japan (Ishikura and Ishikawa 2011). Stricter safety regulations concerning nuclear plants introduced after the disaster eventually brought all activities at nuclear plants across the country to a halt by September 2013, and subsequent resumptions of operations have been gradual (Fig. 1) (ANRE 2020; 2021). The resultant power shortage motivated the Japanese government to promote the development of renewable energy by introducing a feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme in July 2012, which has since encouraged rapid solar photovoltaic (PV) installations (Ueda et al. 2019). Consequently, power generation by solar PV has grown from 4 TWh in 2010 to 69 TWh (6.7% of the total generation) in 2019 (Fig. 1). However, the increased generation capacity from renewable energy sources has not been sufficient to cover the full capacity of nuclear plants that were in operation before the disaster. Therefore, the gap has been filled by fossil-fuel power plants (Fig. 1), whose share increased from 65 to 76% between 2010 and 2019. Source ANRE (2021). The preceding years are omitted because of statistical discontinuity Energy mix of the electricity sector in Japan since 2010. Another event that significantly disrupted the national economy in the same period was the Great Recession triggered by a financial crisis in the United States in 2008. Ball (2014) found from empirical studies of 23 OECD countries that the recession brought about long-term damages that lasted until 2015 to the countries’ economies, including Japan. Possible damages involved a loss of potential outputs due to the reduction in capital accumulation, the loss of workers’ skills during unemployment, and the disruption in economic activities for producing technological progress (Ball 2014). These economy-wide impacts may have led to an eventual change in energy consumption levels and mixes. The impacts of the Great Recession on energy uses inexorably overlapped those of the Great East Japan earthquake during this period. Significant transitions of energy sources in Japan amid those two events call for not only a simple overview of trends in energy statistics such as the ones presented in Fig. 1, but also a thorough investigation into the structural changes in energy supply and demand. One of the most useful tools for this purpose is structural decomposition analysis, which incorporates an input-output (IO) technique (simply called SDA hereafter) (e.g., Wang et al. 2017). Previously, Okuyama (2014) investigated structural change in the regional economy after the 1995 Kobe earthquake using SDA. Nevertheless, the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake was distinct from previous earthquake events in Japan because it disrupted the energy sector so extensively. Therefore, a new study is required regarding the 2011 earthquake, with a particular focus on energy sectors. An SDA of energy is a technique in which overall changes in energy consumption between two periods are decomposed into various effects. There are two major approaches to an energy SDA: a monetary IO model and a hybrid IO model. The monetary IO model employs a standard IO table expressed entirely in monetary units. It first evaluates output effects from final demand in monetary terms. They are then multiplied by energy consumption coefficients (intensity factors), which define direct energy use per unit output in each sector, to estimate total energy consumption (e.g., Su et al. 2010; Akpan et al. 2015). The model is typically formulated as:  Where \(\varvec{f}\) is a vector of final demands; \(\varvec{L}\) is a standard Leontief inverse matrix in monetary units; \(\widehat{\varvec{c}}\) is a diagonal matrix of direct-energy-consumption coefficients (intensity factors); \(\varvec{q}\) is a vector of sector-wise total (direct and indirect) energy consumptions in producing commodities satisfying \(\varvec{f}\); \(\it \bf i^{{\prime }}\) is the row vector of 1’s (i.e., a summation vector); and \({q}^{t}\) is the economy-wide total energy consumption satisfying \(\varvec{f}\). The hybrid IO model, by contrast, employs a “hybrid unit” IO table in which energy transactions and outputs are expressed in physical energy units while the rest is in normal monetary units. A mathematical formulation of this model is provided in Sect. 2. This type of model was first proposed by Bullard and Herendeen (1975), and later expanded, among other uses, to the analysis of pollution due to fuel combustion by Casler and Blair (1997). Hoekstra and van den Bergh (2002) reported in their literature review that about a third of environmental SDA studies had employed the hybrid unit method since 1972. Advantages and disadvantages of using the hybrid IO model are summarized below. The first advantage is that expressing energy in physical units allows explicit descriptions of energy flows occurring outside of economic transactions. Hence, the hybrid IO model can explicitly and independently account for the different types of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, which are directly harvested from nature. This advantage is shared by other sorts of physical IO tables describing waste streams or environmental pollutants (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2002). In the monetary IO model, by contrast, any energy consumption must first be associated with an increase in monetary outputs of a certain sector (Eq. (1)). When a majority of primary energy comes from fossil fuels, which are economic commodities themselves, this does not cause much problem. However, as shares of renewable energy are likely to increase into the future, this advantage of the hybrid model will become ever more important. Second, the hybrid IO model can evaluate energy flows in a stable physical unit, and hence estimation results are robust against changes in energy prices (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2002). This advantage is increasingly relevant as a longer period of time is studied. Likewise, physical-unit accounting enables consistent estimations when energy prices are not uniform across energy-consuming sectors (Miller and Blair 2009). Moreover, rows of energy sectors in a hybrid IO table can be compiled in accordance with the energy conservation condition. This ensures that analytical results also conform to this condition (Miller and Blair 2009). Third, the hybrid IO model expresses energy flows in cascades, from primary energy (e.g., crude oil and hydropower) to secondary energy (e.g., electricity and heat) and finally to non-energy (energy-consuming) sectors. This feature makes it straightforward to attribute energy consumption to each primary or secondary source of energy. This is in contrast to the monetary IO model, in which energy consumptions attributable to various sources are often lumped together, as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). On the other hand, the hybrid IO model also has disadvantages. First, compiling a hybrid IO table is data intensive (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2002) – information ought to be drawn from many energy statistics, which can be tedious and require a great deal of specialized knowledge. Fortunately, the Japanese government has made available detailed energy balance tables comprising several hundred sectors (ANRE 2021). They can be incorporated into a hybrid IO table with appropriate care. Second, whereas the hybrid IO model is robust in evaluating energy consumption or energy-related CO2 emissions, it is not straightforward in estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are unrelated to energy consumption (e.g., methene emissions from farmlands). Because the hybrid model simultaneously evaluates output effects of non-energy sectors in monetary units, it is still possible to multiply these by non-energy-related GHG emission coefficients (in emission/money output) to evaluate non-energy-related emissions separately from energy-related ones. But doing so is awkward and the hybrid model cannot claim any advantage over the monetary model in this respect. Third, the hybrid IO model is not suitable for undertaking an elaborate SDA on final demand effects. The model is still capable of estimating the overall final-demand effect or final-demand distribution effects (Miller and Blair 2009), that is, contributions from segregated final-demand sectors such as domestic final demands and exports. By contrast, the hybrid model is considered inadequate for estimating the effects of changes in consumption mixes (baskets) or levels (Dietzenbacher and Stage 2006). Thus, the hybrid model is relatively unsuitable for examining the impacts of large economic disruptions on household behaviors. Nansai et al. (2002; 2003), among others, provided some of the most detailed and representative energy-consumption and GHG-emission coefficients for Japan. This work has since contributed to the expansion of energy and environmental SDA research targeting Japan with a monetary IO model. Such studies decomposed energy consumption and/or CO2 emissions into various effects under different names. Here, I broadly categorize them into three effects: the energy/carbon intensity effect (a change in \(\widehat{\varvec{c}}\) in Eq. (1)), the structural effect (a change in \(\varvec{L}\)), and the final-demand effect (a change in \(\varvec{f}\)). Yabe (2004) decomposed changes in CO2 emissions in Japan between 1985 and 1995 and found that both the carbon-intensity and structural effects contributed to an emission reduction during the late 1980 s but not during the recession in the early 1990 s. Gerilla et al. (2005) similarly decomposed a change in carbon emissions in the Japanese housing sector during 1980–1995 and revealed the contributions from each effect. Okamoto (2013) further segregated each effect into four segments of the economy and concluded that contributions of the transitions to a service economy were not negligible during 1990–2005. Akpan et al. (2015) investigated CO2 emission changes in Japan in 1995–2005 and found that the final-demand and structural effects, respectively, drove changes in 1995–2000 and 2000–2005. They also performed a second-stage decomposition of the structural effect into industrial sectors. Hasegawa (2006) investigated CO2 emissions at the prefectural level in Japan and found that the effects influencing changes in emissions differed among regions. Furthermore, some studies looked deeper into linkages along supply chains among non-energy sectors. Oshita (2012) applied the structural path decomposition method to Japan’s CO2 emissions in 1990–2000 and revealed significant linkages from, for example, electricity to amusement/recreation and to household demand. Morioka et al. (2018) decomposed changes in Japan’s CO2 emissions in 1990–2005 into the effects of backward-linkage, forward-linkage, and kernel structure, and found some stable linkages, with respect to kernel structure, within the supply chains. Looking over these studies, the monetary IO model has provided useful and elaborate insights from the viewpoint of energy consumers (i.e., both the intermediate and final demand sectors). In contrast, none of them was able to attribute energy consumption or CO2 emissions to each energy source. One way to mitigate this problem is by using an SDA together with the hybrid IO model. Nonetheless, few studies have adopted this approach for Japan. Han and Lakshmanan (1995) compiled a hybrid IO table in 1975–1985 for Japan and conducted an SDA to decompose energy-use changes into the effects of direct energy efficiency, fuel substitutions, and changes in non-energy inputs. However, they failed to evaluate the contributions from each energy source independently. Kagawa and Inamura (2001) compiled a hybrid rectangular IO table in 1985–1990 for Japan and applied it to an energy SDA in which the causes of energy consumption changes were decomposed into the effects of energy and non-energy sectors. They also delineated the contributions from energy sources categorized into 6 broad sectors. However, their discussions failed to classify these sectors into primary and secondary energy and to explicitly treat the energy conservation condition. To overcome the flaws of the previous studies, this study newly attempts to integrate Japanese energy-balance and linked IO tables to compile hybrid IO tables with target years of 2005, 2011, and 2015, which cover the transition period before and after the 2011 earthquake and the Great Recession. Employing the Japanese energy balance table is advantageous because it is composed in strict accordance with the energy conservation conditions. This approach represents an advancement over that of Kagawa and Inamura (2001), who relied on Nansai’s energy coefficients and other statistics to compile their hybrid IO. My hybrid IO table is then employed to perform an SDA of energy consumption and related CO2 emissions. Specifically, I largely follow the methodology of Miller and Blair (2009), which in turn was built around that of Bullard and Herendeen (1975). I opted for the Miller and Blair method because it enables easier observations of physical energy flows across the economy (i.e., from primary to secondary energy sectors and non-energy sectors) conforming with the energy conservation condition. With this method, I put an emphasis on delineating the contributions from each energy source at both primary and secondary energy levels. Furthermore, I expanded the Miller and Blair method to decompose the technological effect into intensity and structural effects. As an extension to energy analysis, I also examined CO2 emissions by fossil fuel combustionFootnote 1, because it is important to reveal how the two massive events affected Japan’s long-term goal of building a carbon-free society.",1

Krüger,Moritz Tarach,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a global level is the key measure to counteract the detrimental effects of climate change and global warming. Other approaches to limit global warming, like carbon removal or geoengineering approaches are either infeasible or extremely risky (see Nordhaus (2019, p. 1998) for a clear statement). This is largely undisputed in the economic literature (see the survey articles by Myhre et al. (2001), Aldy et al. (2010), Hsiang and Kopp (2018) and Tol (2018), among others) and is the basis for several international agreements. The most prominent agreements are the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement on climate change of 2015 to reduce GHG emissions to reach the 2\(^{\circ }\)C target, meaning the stabilization of the increase in temperature at “well below 2\(^{\circ }\)C above pre-industrial levels”.Footnote 1 The European Union (EU) as a key actor in this area has achieved an agreement among its member countries to reduce GHG emissions by 40% until 2030, 60% until 2040 and 80% until 2050, compared to the levels of 1990 (EU 2011, p. 3). Recently these targets have been tightened to reduce GHG emissions by 55% until 2030, 80% percent until 2040 and to reach climate neutrality by 2050, also accounting for the effects of carbon removal technologies, land use change and forestation (see EU (2020) and especially figure 1 therein). Efforts to improve the productive efficiency of sectors could be a potentially important building block of an emission reduction strategy. Therefore, it is important to know to which extent GHG emissions could be reduced by achieving productive efficiency while holding the economic inputs and outputs constant. In our companion paper (Krüger and Tarach 2020) we applied nonparametric methods of efficiency analysis in the presence of undesirable outputs derived from a variant of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to give an account of the potential reductions of GHG by country and sector for the period 2008–2016. The main finding there is that efficiency improvements can contribute considerably to emission reduction, albeit the extent to which the measured potentials could be realized in practice remains open. However, the measurement approach used in the companion paper is purely deterministic and prone to biases. Furthermore, no account of the estimation uncertainty is provided there. In this paper we pick up these issues by combining the nonparametric efficiency measurement approach with a specifically designed bootstrapping procedure to achieve a bias correction and to compute confidence intervals for assessing estimation uncertainty. To our knowledge this is the first time that a nonparametric approach combined with stochastic elements is applied in an environmental efficiency measurement context. We report estimates of aggregate emission reduction potentials for 16 major EU countries and 7 main sectors of the private economy. As emissions we consider a broad GHG aggregate as well as splits to single GHGs (\({{\mathrm {CO}}_{2}}\), \({{\mathrm {CH}}_{4}}\) and \({{\mathrm {N}}_{2}{\mathrm {O}}}\)). The results show that the bias correction leads to larger emission reductions compared to the “raw” measures from our companion paper which are based on the purely deterministic approach. We can show that the potentials for emission reduction are concentrated in certain countries and sectors. In addition, we find that the estimation uncertainty is substantial in these cases. In contrast to much of the literature on eco-efficiency which is also concerned with emission reduction on a macroeconomic level or the level of major sectors we assess the contribution of potential efficiency improvements to the EU reduction targets by expressing them as potential reductions measured in physical units, i.e. \({{\mathrm {CO}}_{2}}\) equivalents (\({{\mathrm {CO}}_{2}{\mathrm {e}}}\)). The usual practice in the literature (see Camarero et al. (2014), Färe et al. (2004), Korhonen and Luptacik (2004), Kortelainen (2008), Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005), Rashidi and Farzipoor Saen (2015), Zaim and Taskin (2000), Zhou and Ang (2008) and Zofío and Prieto (2001), among others) is to focus on relative measures instead. More closely related to our analysis are studies such as Domazlicky and Weber (2004) and Krautzberger and Wetzel (2012) which are also based on a methodological setting employing directional distance functions and are also confined to specific industries. The exposition in this paper starts with a description of the data and the country-sector coverage in Sect. 2. This is followed by the description of the nonparametric methodology we use to obtain our estimates of emission reduction potentials in Sect. 3. In this section, the implementation of the bootstrapping approach as well as the computation of the bias-corrected measures and the confidence intervals are also outlined. Section 4 contains the discussion of the results from several specifications of the undesirable outputs. The specifications comprise a single total GHG aggregate as well as splits to \(\mathrm {CO}_{2}\), \(\mathrm {CH}_{4}\) and \({{\mathrm {N}}_{2}{\mathrm {O}}}\). We also discuss the results of a variant where possible enhancements of the economic output are permitted in addition to the emission reductions. Policy recommendations are provided at the end of the section. The final Sect. 5 concludes with an evaluation of the contribution of the emission reduction by efficiency improvements to the EU emission reduction targets and discusses the feasibility of the potential reductions measured.",3

Abatement of nitrogen emissions to marine and freshwater systems downstream has been at the core of water policy in intensive agricultural regions for decades (Greenhalgh and Selman 2012; Corrales et al. 2013; Duhon et al. 2015; Ribaudo and Shortle 2019). These policies have come at a substantial cost to regulated entities and society generally (Keiser and Shapiro 2018). Implementing nitrogen abatement policies that provide flexibility to farmers with respect to the choice of abatement options could significantly reduce the societal costs of meeting water quality targets (Greenhalgh and Selman 2012; Corrales et al. 2013, 2017; Shortle 2013). One way of achieving this is via a nitrogen trading scheme. A nitrogen trading scheme can be designed to specifically address the challenge of cost-effective management of excessive nitrogen loadings to receiving waters (Crutchfield and Letson 1994; Kerr et al. 2007; Fisher-Vanden and Olmstead 2013), provided that the scheme operates with a fixed cap on the total nitrogen load reaching the receptor. Under such a scheme, emission sources are each provided with an initial allocation of nitrogen leaching rights at-source, such that the sum of those leaching rights across all sources does not exceed the required nitrogen load cap at the receptor, when accounting appropriately for the proportions of at-source leaching that will be removed (primarily) via denitrification, biological uptake or sedimentation when passing through soil, water, rivers, lakes and wetlands on its way to the receptor (Højberg et al. 2015). Here, following Van Breemen et al. (2002), Windolf et al. (2011) and Højberg et al. (2015), we use the term ‘nitrogen retention’ to describe the proportion of at-source leached nitrogen that is removed by natural processes before it reaches the receptor. Each source can, if it wishes, trade away from its initial allocation of nitrogen leaching rights. If a leaching right holder has access to low-cost abatement options, they may find it more profitable to abate some of their emissions and sell their excess leaching rights to sources with higher abatement costs who are looking to buy additional leaching rights to avoid the need to undertake on-farm abatement. By allowing leaching rights to be traded between emission sources, the total cost of meeting the required nitrogen load cap at the receptor can be minimised. Upon receiving its initial leaching rights, and knowing its existing farming activities and soil type(s), an emission right holder would consider their suite of possible land management and land use options to determine the quantity of leaching rights they require. The link between land management practices, land uses and at-farm nitrogen leaching is informed by biophysical models (e.g. Andersen et al. (2012)). Farmers undertake nitrogen abatement by changing the combination of land management practices on their farm to reduce at-farm leaching. Purchases and sales of leaching rights in the market are managed to ensure that the nitrogen load cap at the receptor is not exceeded. Potential gains from trade arise because of the inherent heterogeneity between farms in the cost-effectiveness with which changes in land management practices deliver nitrogen abatement at-farm. Heterogeneity may arise, for example, because of differences between farming businesses in the types of crops grown, soil productivity, climate, and scale of operation. Heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness of abatement is further increased when there is inter-farm variability in the biophysical processes that link management practices and land uses to at-farm leaching, and in N-retention from farm to the receptor (Claassen et al. 2008). Designing policies that recognise and incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness of abatement can further reduce the societal costs of attaining water pollution targets (Hasler et al. 2014, 2019; Konrad et al. 2014; Smart et al. 2016; Refsgaard et al. 2019; Czajkowski et al. 2021). A cap-and-trade ‘smart market’ multilateral trading framework has been proposed that can account for spatial variation in the cost-effectiveness of abatement actions and provide easy (‘low transaction cost’) market access to facilitate trading (Prabodanie et al. 2010, 2014; Raffensperger et al. 2017). Smart markets can handle biophysical and hydrological heterogeneity across a catchment, and set appropriate spatially-specific prices for supply and purchase of pollutant emission rights that reflect the spatially-specific impact of emissions from different locations on receiving water quality (Prabodanie et al. 2014). A smart market is an auction mechanism based on an optimisation model that was first demonstrated by McCabe et al. (1991). In the context of nitrogen regulation, a smart market is a centrally managed, online marketplace where a periodic auction is cleared using an optimisation process that maximises the gains from trade on receipt of bid-to-buy and offer-to-sell schedules in nitrogen loading rights at the receptor from market participants (Prabodanie et al. 2010; Raffensperger et al. 2017). Optimisation is implemented via a linear programming model that incorporates relevant spatial heterogeneity in nitrogen retention by ensuring that, in aggregate, trades do not exceed the desired nitrogen load cap at a single or multiple receptors (Prabodanie et al. 2010; The Wetlands Initiative 2014; Raffensperger et al. 2017). Theoretical expositions of a smart market as a viable trading approach have been presented for efficient allocation of instream river flows (Murphy et al. 2009), ground water (Raffensperger et al. 2009; Raffensperger 2011), impervious cover (Raffensperger and Cochrane 2010), nitrate emission rights (Prabodanie et al. 2009, 2010, 2014;), sediment discharge rights (Pinto et al. 2013) and air pollution emissions rights (Willett et al. 2014, 2015). However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, with the exception of Raffensperger et al's (2017) case study in Big Bureau Creek, Illinois, U.S.A that simulates hydrologically-grounded smart market trading in nitrogen load between point sources (sewage treatment plants) as buyers and non-point sources (farmers installing nitrogen treatment wetlands) as sellers, all prior expositions of smart markets to manage nitrogen runoff in agricultural settings have been essentially theoretical, typically comprising less than 10 notional trading entities. Given the potential advantages of the smart market, escalating concern globally regarding nitrate pollutant loads (e.g. Rockström et al. 2009), and the absence of a prior case study at real-world scale and complexity of a smart market that features non-point nitrogen sources (i.e. farms) as both buyers and sellers of nitrogen loading rights, here we explore whether a smart market can offer meaningful, and policy amenable, advantages over conventional ‘command and control’ regulation for nitrogen management in a real setting. We simulate the operation of a smart market between farms as non-point source buyers and sellers of nitrogen loading rights at the receptor in a real, whole-of-catchment biophysical setting: 6504 actual farms comprising 56,556 individual land parcels of mixed farmland that drain to Limfjorden, a coastal fjord cutting through northern Jutland in Denmark. The research questions we address with this simulation are: What level of efficiency gain could a smart market offer over traditional uniform ‘command and control’ regulation in the Limfjorden catchment – and to what extent do these gains persist as the nitrogen load cap for Limfjorden is tightened? How robust are smart market efficiency gains in Limfjorden likely to be in the face of non-participation in market trading (as might be induced by different levels of transaction cost)? Are there particular features of Limfjorden’s agricultural landscape which support delivery of efficient and robust outcomes from a smart market trading in nitrogen loading? In addressing these questions, the paper contributes to the evolving literature on smart market applications for water quality management by providing the first simulation of smart market nitrogen trading among non-point sources at whole-of-catchment scale using empirical data, including quantification of the potential efficiency gains from trading. It also contributes to literature that seeks to quantify the potential impact of non-participation and contributes to the ongoing debate regarding how farmers might respond to introduction of different policy mechanisms for practical management of water quality in agricultural settings.",3

However, MNEs may play a more crucial role during crisis times, especially in natural disasters. Thailand’s experience of large-scale floods in 2011 is a notable example of the destructive effects of a natural disaster on multinationals. The estimated economic damage is 46.5 billion USD across all sectors, and manufacturing alone suffered 32 billion USD of damage (Abe and Ye 2013; Haraguchi and Lall 2015). Seven industrial parks and 904 factories were inundated, more than half of which were Japanese MNEs. Thus, the business operation of many factories completely ceased for one to two months. Even non-inundated multinational plants were forced to reduce production due to the lack of parts from damaged suppliers. The disaster-hit economy hopes multinationals to show resilience so that they continue to source local intermediates and help local industry recover. The Bank of Thailand cautioned against this optimistic idea by stating that, unless the government took appropriate measures, the flood would relocate more multinationals to other Asian countries in the long run (BOT 2012). The exit of footloose multinationals would weaken their input-output linkages with local suppliers, damaging the host economy further. Indeed, using country-level data, Escaleras and Register (2011) and Doytch (2020) find that natural disasters have negative effects on aggregate foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.Footnote 1 Only a limited attention in the literature has been paid to how MNEs respond to natural disasters and little is known about underlying mechanisms, despite its importance in the real world. This paper theoretically investigates under what conditions multinationals leave their host country once it is hit by negative supply shocks and which factor helps them stay there. To address these, our model takes into account two noticeable characteristics of multinationals: (i) input-output (or vertical) industrial linkages and (ii) footloose-ness. Vertical linkages imply that multinationals have complementarities with local industry (Markusen and Venables 1999). Sourcing by multinationals helps the local supplying industry grow, leading to a lower price of inputs and thus benefiting themselves. The footloose-ness arises because the location choice of foreign capital is based on the comparison of profits made in different countries. Multinationals are sensitive to negative shocks in their location; compared with local firms, they are likely to enter and exit a host country frequently (Görg and Strobl 2003; Bernard and Jensen 2007). We model a natural disaster as an increase in the fixed cost for local suppliers, which can be interpreted as a damage to their plants. This modeling captures an indirect damage to multinationals through their linkages with damaged local suppliers, as highlighted in the 2011 Thailand floods. Our main findings are threefold. First, multiple equilibria, one in which multinationals enter and the other in which they do not, may exist. Second, a substantial damage to the local suppliers’ fixed cost results in a switch from one equilibrium with multinationals to the other without them. The increased fixed cost reduces the entry of local suppliers and hence raises the prices of local intermediate goods. Multinationals, even if they are not directly damaged, may find local sourcing unprofitable and leave the disaster-hit country, shrinking the local industry further.Footnote 2 This mechanism helps understand the (sometimes long-lasting) negative disaster impact on FDI found in empirical studies (Escaleras and Register 2011; Doytch 2020; Toner-Rodgers and Friedt 2020; Batala et al. 2021). Natural disasters may also raise the cost of local sourcing through the destruction of transportation infrastructure or directly damage multinational plants. In our model, the effects of these shocks are similar to those of the shock to the fixed cost for local suppliers because both reduce the profitability of multinationals staying in the host country. Finally, conditions for multinationals showing resilience are identified. Specifically, they are more likely to stay in the disaster-hit country, if local intermediate goods are more important in multinational production or trade costs of importing foreign inputs are lower. Given that multinationals seeking low-cost inputs choose to enter the host country, a higher dependency on local suppliers and lower trade costs would lead to greater profits and thus prevent them from relocating. Contrary to the warning by the Bank of Thailand, the 2011 Thailand floods did not cause long-lasting relocation and restructuring by manufacturing MNEs, perhaps because of their strong industrial linkages with local firms and progressive trade liberalization (Milner et al. 2006; Feliciano and Doytch 2020).Footnote 3 We further examine a number of extensions of the basic model including multinationals with heterogeneous productivity, gradual recovery from disasters, the role of the host country’s market, endogenous sourcing patterns, and disaster risk. They give similar results and additional implications. Among others, we find that the least efficient multinationals are the first to leave the host country once a disaster hits. Put differently, multinationals staying in the damaged country are likely to be the most efficient ones. The heterogeneous-multinational setting avoids the extreme case where all multinationals completely exit. The result may help understand the observation that in the aftermath of the 2011 floods, larger Japanese MNEs in Thailand did not change their local procurement share as much as smaller ones (Hayakawa et al. 2015). We aim to contribute to the literature investigating the impact of multinationals on industrial development (Alfaro 2015 for a survey). For example, using Irish micro-level data, Görg and Strobl (2002) find that the presence of multinationals promotes the entry of local manufacturing firms.Footnote 4 Among many channels through which multinationals benefit host economies, an important one is vertical industrial linkages (e.g., Javorcik 2004; Alfaro-Ureña et al. 2022). Alfaro-Ureña et al. (2022) use firm-to-firm transaction data in Costa Rica and find that local firms increase their size and productivity after becoming a supplier to multinationals. Although many theoretical attempts seek to understand the role of multinationals in vertically linked industries, only a limited number of studies have modeled (de)industrialization as switches between multiple equilibria (Rodríguez-Clare 1996; Markusen and Venables 1999; Carluccio and Fally 2013).Footnote 5 For example, Markusen and Venables (1999) model the upstream and downstream industries and numerically illustrate the situation where the entry of downstream MNEs fosters local upstream industry. Using a similar model, Rodríguez-Clare (1996) find that downstream MNEs benefits the host country if the intensity of their local sourcing is sufficiently high. Carluccio and Fally (2013) extend these two models further to consider a “technological incompatibility” of local intermediates with multinational production. These studies, however, analyze each equilibrium only separately and not explore which shocks trigger a shift from one equilibrium to another. We rely on their framework and take one step further to analytically characterize the conditions under which an exogenous supply shock leads to an equilibrium switch and relate them to disaster impacts on multinationals. Specifically, we simplify the model structure of Markusen and Venables (1999) in a way such that the upstream and downstream industries are treated as one exhibiting roundabout production (Krugman and Venables 1995) and explicitly introduce trade by MNEs.Footnote 6 In doing so, we can go beyond the numerical results of Markusen and Venables (1999) and identify the conditions of MNEs showing resilience in terms of meaningful parameters such as the cost share of local intermediate goods and trade costs of foreign inputs. Our simple model allows further extensions such as heterogeneous MNEs in productivity and gradual recovery from negative shocks, none of which is examined in the three studies. Some studies examine the impact of various types of risk on multinational behavior (Aizenman 2003; Aizenman and Marion 2004; Russ 2007; Fillat and Garetto 2015). Aizenman and Marion (2004) investigate how the volatility of demand and supply shocks affect differently market-seeking FDI and efficiency-seeking FDI. Fillat and Garetto (2015) model multinational entry as a real-option problem, where multinationals show resilience against negative shocks because of the sunk cost they have paid to enter. Unlike these studies focusing on risk under uncertainty, our model highlights actual physical damages, given the context of developing countries vulnerable to severe disasters (ADB 2013; Sivapuram and Shaw 2020). In an extended model with uncertainty, we show that the risk of disasters alone may lead multinationals to leave the host country before a disaster actually occurs (see Section 5.3.3 and Appendix 7). Simulation studies investigating disaster impact in an economy with industrial linkages are complementary to ours (Okuyama and Chang 2004; Henriet et al. 2012; Inoue and Todo 2019; Galbusera and Giannopoulos 2018 for a survey).Footnote 7 In an economy where buyer-supplier relationship constitutes a complex network, Henriet et al. (2012) show how network features such as concentration, clustering and connectedness between subregions either dampen or magnify the effects of a natural disaster. We differ from these studies in terms of both in focus and modeling strategies. They describe regional economies by fixing the location of production, whereas we emphasize the footloose-ness of internationally mobile MNEs in developing countries. Although input-output linkages in our model are admittedly far simpler than theirs, we hope it serves as the first step toward a more comprehensive analysis on disasters and multinationals. This paper is also related to the vast body of empirical literature assessing the disaster impact on firm performance.Footnote 8 According to recent studies using micro-level data, the destruction of physical capital due to natural disasters may be a good chance of upgrading it (Leiter et al. 2009; Vu and Noy 2018; Okazaki et al. 2019) or a bad one of decreasing productivity and the survival rates of firms (Tanaka 2015; Cainelli et al. 2018; Cole et al. 2019; Meltzer et al. 2021).Footnote 9 Only a limited number of empirical studies examine the nexus between natural disasters and multinationals. They find mixed results on whether the disaster effect is positive or negative and short- or long term (Escaleras and Register 2011; Oh and Oetzel 2011; Anuchitworawong and Thampanishvong 2015; Doytch 2020; Toner-Rodgers and Friedt 2020; Batala et al. 2021; Neise et al. 2021). Doytch (2020) examines sectoral FDI inflows in 69 countries from 1980 to 2011. Her dynamic panel regression results show negative effects in general, but also suggest that the effects vary depending on the type of disasters, industries, and regions. Using data from foreign affiliates of 71 European MNEs, Oh and Oetzel (2011) find that major natural disasters have no significant impact on the number of affiliates, whereas terrorist attacks and technological disasters have negative impacts. Closely examining disaster events in India in 2006–2019, Toner-Rodgers and Friedt (2020) report persistent intra-national shifts in multinationals’ investment patterns from disaster-affected regions to non-affected regions. Considering the discontinuous change in equilibrium due to a huge shock suggested by our theory, one may more likely find a negative effect of disasters with severe damages in sample countries less equipped with disaster prevention. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section presents a motivating empirical example on the disaster impact on FDI. Section 3 describes the model and characterizes conditions under which different industrial configurations emerge. Section 4 examines the impact of natural disasters and characterizes the conditions under which multinationals show resilience. Section 5 provides two extensions of the basic model in detail and sketch three extensions briefly. The final section concludes the paper.",1

MacKenzie,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Cap-and-trade markets have been promoted as a cost-effective form of pollution control. The varied scope of these markets can be observed within the European Union and United States, among others.Footnote 1 Although permit markets have performed relatively well, the implementation of these schemes has raised a number of concerns. First, concern exists over the potential market power of participating firms that may result in allocative inefficiency (e.g., Hintermann 2017). Participating firms are normally sourced from a small number of concentrated industries (such as the energy sector), which may increase the likelihood of market-power effects. Second, it has been well documented that investments in rent-seeking efforts have been used to alter the distribution of initial permit allocations, with clear evidence from the US Acid Rain Program (Joskow and Schmalensee 1998) as well as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (Zapfel 2007; Rode 2021). Thus, within contemporary cap-and-trade markets, there exists the potential for both political and market distortions. Yet it is a priori unclear how these distortions interact and the consequences for the cost effectiveness of pollution control. In this article we investigate the interactions between political and market distortions within a cap-and-trade market. To achieve this, we create a model of a cap-and-trade market with large dominant players and a competitive fringe of individually insignificant players. The dominant players have the ability to: (1) rent seek for their initial allocation of permits and the aggregate supply of permits; as well as (2) choose their level of permit exchange. We allow the contestability of the initial allocation of pollution permits and the determination of the aggregate emissions cap to vary from being non-contestable to fully contestable, where we capture contestability using a rent-seeking process. This allows us to consider how alternative initial allocation mechanisms operate when there is a difference in sensitivity towards rent seeking or, indeed, to consider alternative regulatory systems where the degree of rent seeking varies. We focus on the direct comparison between two environments: when permits are either contestable or non-contestable. In order to highlight the relevant channels of influence we start with the simplest case of a single dominant firm and then extend the model to allow for competition in rent seeking and permit exchange. We define the idea of marginal inefficiency to capture the change in inefficiency in the permit market as a result of rent seeking, after which the total abatement required may be different to that in the absence of rent seeking. This is given by the maximum cost saving that can be achieved by re-allocating a single permit between firms, i.e., from a firm with the lowest marginal abatement cost to a firm with the highest marginal abatement cost. We show that the resulting marginal inefficiency in a contestable environment depends on the composition of the permit market: in the presence of active rent seeking, if the dominant firm is a permit buyer then marginal inefficiency improves compared to what is observed in a non-contestable environment. Whereas when the firm is a seller, marginal inefficiency worsens relative to the non-contestable environment. We find that the introduction of competition in rent seeking and permit exchange results in similar findings with the addition that the regulator’s responsiveness towards rent seeking has a pivotal impact: if the regulator is very responsive then the impact on marginal inefficiency is similar to the single dominant firm case; but if the regulator is not very responsive to rent seeking then marginal inefficiency improves regardless of the composition of the market. Our model focuses on a market structure that includes dominant firms and a competitive fringe of small firms. The competitive-fringe framework detailed herein is consistent with existing permit markets that include rent seeking. For example, relating to the EU-ETS Phase I allocation process, Zapfel (2007, p. 29) states that “rent-seeking behaviour played a major role, in particular with regard to larger companies that could afford to allocate sufficient human resources to influence allocation processes. Smaller companies were largely ‘price-takers’ in the allocation process.” Another key aspect of our analysis is that the dominant firms have the ability to rent seek for their own initial allocation . This was observed, for example, in the initial phases of the EU-ETS (specifically Phase I), where dominant players successfully lobbied to obtain additional initial permit allocations that subsequently increased the aggregate supply (National Allocation Plan) (see Zapfel (2007) for specific details of this occurring within individual Member States). As we present in the model, each firm has a non-contestable component of initial allocation as well as a contestable part. One possible interpretation, for example, is that the initial endowment allocation is in draft legislation (which is the fixed baseline for all firms). As the dominant firms are the only entities with any rent-seeking power, it is intuitive to consider that additional permits are created and distributed to those dominant firms, which we capture as the contestable component. The examination of dominant firms within cap-and-trade markets is well developed. The main branch of literature extends the work of Hahn (1984) that focuses on a dominant firm with a competitive fringe of price-taking firms (e.g., Misiolek and Elder 1989; von der Fehr 1993; Westskog 1996; Sartzetakis 1997; Liski and Montero 2011; Hintermann 2011, 2016, 2017; D’Amato et al. 2017; Dickson and MacKenzie 2018). Hahn (1984) shows the dominant firm will select their permit holdings to decrease (increase) the permit price if it is a permit buyer (seller). Consequently, the existence of market power results in increased costs of pollution control. Although the literature on market power is well established, it does not extend the analysis to incorporate rent-seeking activities. Yet, in a market with a concentrated set of dominant firms, it is plausible that rent seeking would be more prevalent than in a perfectly competitive market. In this article, we advance the literature on market power within cap-and-trade markets by allowing the dominant firm(s) to additionally rent seek for their initial permit allocation as well as the aggregate supply of permits to the market. Our analysis shows that the inefficiency normally associated with market power is significantly altered by the presence of political distortions. That is, whether the regulator is open and responsive to rent seeking has significant consequences for the cost effectiveness of the permit market. The rent-seeking literature focusing on cap-and-trade markets is also well established (Dijkstra 1998; Lai 2007, 2008; Hanley and MacKenzie 2010; MacKenzie and Ohndorf 2012; MacKenzie 2017; Rode 2021).Footnote 2 The majority of this literature focuses on rent-seeking for initial permit endowments, but assumes that firms are price-takers in a competitive permit market. In particular, Hanley and MacKenzie (2010) provide a model where firms first rent seek for permits, where rent seeking influences both the distribution of permits and the aggregate number of permits (in a linear fashion), and then go on to trade permits in a perfectly competitive market where they are assumed to be price takers. Their main conclusion is that the regulator’s responsiveness may have ambiguous effects on social welfare. If a regulator becomes more responsive to rent seeking, emissions will increase (thus increasing pollution damages and potentially lowering social welfare) but the price per permit will fall (reducing rent seeking costs and potentially improving social welfare). This approach allows a thorough investigation of how the regulator’s responsiveness to rent seeking (i.e., how the number of permits is influenced by lobbying) influences social welfare, but it misses the important feature of how rent seeking can influence and distort trade, and consequently efficiency, quite simply because under the assumption of perfect competition the permit market is always allocatively efficient. While they do include a discussion of a dominant firm, they don’t formally investigate the equilibrium to establish the link between rent seeking, market power, and efficiency. Studying this intersection of rent seeking and market power within permit markets—which has so far been largely ignored in this literature—is precisely our focus here. The main aim of this article is to provide the first comprehensive analysis of a cap-and-trade market with dual distortionary effects (rent seeking and market power), and to identify the conditions where efficiency is either improved or reduced by investment in rent-seeking activity. We therefore provide a model that bridges the gap between the rent-seeking and market-power literatures. We follow the market-power literature by developing a competitive-fringe framework with one dominant firm, but later extend the model to allow for competition between firms with market power. Our model has two stages. In the first stage, the dominant firms invest in rent-seeking effort in order to obtain a share of the initial allocation of permits. Rent-seeking efforts are sunk costs, such as lobbying and persuasive activities, that alter both the distribution of the initial permit allocation and the aggregate number of permits supplied to the market by the regulator. We develop this process as a strategic contest (e.g., Tullock 1980; Hillman and Riley 1989; Konrad 2009; Dickson et al. 2018), where the equilibrium share of permits is determined by a firm’s rent-seeking efforts relative to total outlays and the regulator’s permit supply response is dependent on the level of aggregate rent seeking. We allow firms’ initial permit allocations to be determined by a contestable component and a non-contestable component thus allowing a continuum between these two extremes, which can capture realistic institutional setups of initial allocation processes. While it is clear that firms can rent seek for their permits, there can also be restrictions on the initial allocation of permits. We introduce a parameter \(\alpha\) that captures this degree of contestability. This could represent the varying degrees of rent-seeking culture, such as how responsive bureaucrats are to the rent-seeking process. Further, it could represent specific rules from legislation that allow for the earmarking of permits or specific allocation mechanisms like auctioning or grandfathering.Footnote 3 Our major innovation is thus the investigation of permit markets in the presence of both market and political distortions. This may provide insight to policymakers regarding the contestability of allocated permits and the likely consequences for the operation—and cost effectiveness—of the permit market. If rent seeking was shown to be counterproductive towards the marginal inefficiency in the permit market, it may be desirable for the regulator to adjust the initial allocation process so that the permits become less contestable. Possible options would be to allow for more auctioning of permits, or to change laws to either prohibit or limit rent-seeking activity (such as changes to ministerial codes of conduct or lobbying acts (such as the US Lobbying Disclosure Act 1995 and the Honest leadership and Open Government Act 2007)). Equally, if it was found that rent seeking improved the marginal inefficiency of the market, then implementing these above-mentioned actions would actually worsen the cost effectiveness of the market. It may also be the case that regulatory interventions and laws that attempt to influence rent-seeking behaviors are simply neither practical nor enforceable. In such a case, our analysis then provides a comparative analysis between different regulatory systems and rent-seeking cultures that highlights how different intensities of rent seeking can impact on the aggregate cost of pollution reduction. The article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 the model is outlined with one dominant firm and we detail the results that link rent-seeking activity and market power to changes in marginal inefficiency. Section 3 introduces competition to both rent seeking and permit exchange and Sect. 4 provides the equilibrium analysis. Section 5 provides the results with competition. Section 6 discusses the inclusion of auctioned permits and Sect. 7 concludes. Proofs of the theoretical results are contained in the “Appendix”.",2

Plant-Level Evidence from Manufacturing,June 2022,Younes Ahmadi,Akio Yamazaki,Philippe Kabore,Male,Male,Male,Male,"At the 21st Conference of PartiesFootnote 1 in Paris (December 2015), countries, by consensus, adopted the first universal climate agreement to tackle global warming. Several countries have already implemented carbon pricing policies to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Footnote 2 After the Paris agreement, there is a general expectation in the international community that these policies would be expanded. Many countries are now proposing to achieve the net-zero emissions by 2050 through more ambitious climate action plans, including carbon pricing. Theoretical models show that a uniform carbon tax is an effective tool to achieve emission reduction targets at the lowest economic costs.Footnote 3 However, the political feasibility of the policy is still heavily debated among policymakers and the public because of its potential adverse effects on the economy. Some even argue that the current carbon prices around the world are set too low to reach emission reduction targets.Footnote 4 For many countries to achieve the net-zero emission goal, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of carbon-pricing policies in reducing emissions. Thus this paper takes advantage of a unique plant-level dataset to investigate the effect of the carbon tax, implemented by British Columbia (BC) in 2008, on GHG emissions from manufacturing plants. The carbon tax in BC was unexpectedly announced in February 2008 and has been in effect since July 2008. The tax rate initially began at $10 per tonne of CO\(_2\) equivalent (CO\(_2\)eq) and increased by $5 annually, reaching $30 in 2012. The tax applies to all fossil fuels purchased within BC and covers 77% of provincial emissions (Harrison 2012). There are three reasons why this policy is ideal for estimating the causal effect of a carbon tax on GHG emissions. First, the tax is comprehensive, applying to all fossil fuels purchased by all plants within BC. Second, its tax rate is high compared to other existing carbon policies, so companies are more likely to change their behavior in response to the policy.Footnote 5 Third, the fact that the tax was introduced shortly after its unexpected announcement eliminates any anticipatory effects (i.e., actions prior to the implementation of the policy) as plants presumably did not have enough time to adjust their behavior. Our empirical strategy is motivated by a simple model of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous plants exposed to a carbon tax, which is borrowed from Yamazaki (2022). We start by decomposing the plant-level emission responses into scale effect and technique effect.Footnote 6 By allowing plants to invest in energy-saving technologies, we theoretically show that carbon taxes can reduce emissions while producing more. This is possible through recycling tax revenues from the carbon tax to lower the corporate income tax (CIT) rates. The carbon tax alone would reduce emissions at the cost of output (i.e., negative scale effect), while the CIT reduction would ameliorate the distortion in the capital market and encourage plants to be more efficient in both energy consumption and production (i.e., positive technique effect). We further show that the magnitude of emission responses increases monotonically with plants’ emission intensity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that high emission-intensive plants are more affected by the carbon tax than low emission-intensive plants. Using the theoretical insights, we design a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator allowing for differential treatment intensity. We use plant-level emission intensity as a measure of exposure to the carbon tax. As the magnitude of plants’ exposure to the carbon tax monotonically increases with their emission intensity. We contend that plants with high emission intensity are more likely to respond to the policy by adjusting their operation or production technologies than the low emission-intensive plants. Our augmented DID estimator compares changes in emission differences between high emission-intensive and low emission-intensive plants in BC with changes in the same emission differences in the rest of Canada before and after the unilateral implementation of the carbon tax.Footnote 7 Our estimator identifies the relative emission responses between the high and low emission-intensive plants. Furthermore, we exploit the panel structure of the data by including various fixed effects to control for possible unobserved confounding factors, such as commodity price shocks, provincial geographic characteristics, and industry factor intensities. We estimate the emission effect of the policy using the confidential plant-level manufacturing dataset, the Annual Survey of Manufacturing (ASM). This dataset consists of detailed information on plant-level manufacturing activities, such as fuel expenditures, total sales, and employment. What is unique about this dataset is that having access to plant-level fuel expenditures allows us to construct the most comprehensive plant-level GHG emission dataset for Canada.Footnote 8 Manufacturing sector accounts for a relatively small portion of BC’s total emissions; however, there are three reasons why focusing on this sector provides valuable insights about the effectiveness of carbon taxes. First, while limited to manufacturing plants, the ASM dataset allows us to calculate plant-level emissions and emission intensity while other publicly available datasets cannot. Second, manufacturing plants in BC are relatively emission-intensive, making this sector more likely to respond to the policy than other sectors. Third, a large variation in the emission intensity of manufacturing plants allows us to capture an extra source of variation across plants and design a more credible estimation strategy. We find that the BC carbon tax lowered GHG emissions. The point estimate shows a statistically significant reduction in emissions by 4 percent.Footnote 9 Furthermore, we show that the policy increased outputs, suggesting that the carbon tax provided enough incentives for plants to take actions to produce more with less (fossil-fuel) energy. Our findings are quite appealing, especially to policymakers, because implementing a carbon tax could both reduce emissions and strengthen the economy. There are potentially two factors that may contribute to the increased outputs. First, the amount of money the BC government returned to the economy was about 15% more than what the carbon tax collected in all years between 2008 and 2016 (e.g., the BC carbon tax raised $1.2 billion in 2012-13 and returned $1.4 billion). This is mainly because the BC government announced the reduction of personal and CIT rates based on the projected carbon revenue, and the actual revenue was less than the projected revenue. This means that the BC economy received a net reduction in taxes. Second, the revenue recycling feature of the policy may have played an important role in generating the positive output effect. The revenues collected from the carbon tax were used to lower the rates of corporate and personal income taxes. Theoretically, a reduction of the CIT rate increases investments and capital formation, resulting in lower emission intensity and higher output. As emission-intensive plants in BC are more capital intensive, these plants receive larger benefits from the CIT cut relative to the low-emission-intensive plants. Therefore, the output of high emission-intensive plants could increase, and their emission intensity could decrease relative to the low emission-intensive plants. This argument is consistent with the results found in our paper. Yamazaki (2017, 2022) has a similar argument regarding the importance of the revenue recycling feature of the BC carbon tax, and our results are consistent with their findings.Footnote 10 In addition to the plant-level emission responses, we adapt an approach developed by Najjar and Cherniwchan (2021) to decompose the aggregate emission response into the scale, technique, and selection effects.Footnote 11 This allows us to discuss the aggregate implications by using the point estimates for the scale, technique, and selection effects in this paper. We find that the aggregate manufacturing emission decline in response to the policy. This decomposition exercise illustrates that a reduction in aggregate emissions would be mainly a result of the scale and technique effects. The size of the selection effect is limited, suggesting that the emission responses to the policy are dominated by the intensive margin adjustments of the surviving plants. A large number of studies examine the effect of carbon taxes on GHG emissions using simulation methods, such as Manne et al. (1990), Goto (1995), Floros and Vlachou (2005), and Wissema and Dellink (2007). Although they find that a uniform carbon tax would lead to a significant reduction in GHG emissions, it is difficult to solely rely on these findings for designing future policies. What we need is more of evidence-based policy suggestions. The empirical findings, thus far, from ex-post analyses are limited and concentrated on the aggregate emission responses to carbon taxes.Footnote 12 For instance, Bohlin (1998) and Andersson (2019) both investigate the effect of the Swedish carbon tax, implemented in 1991. Bohlin finds that the transportation sector was not affected, and emissions from industrial sectors increased due to exemptions that decreased the effectiveness of the policy. It, however, finds that GHG emissions declined in the heating sector as a result of substitution from coal to biofuel. On the other hand, Andersson uses a synthetic control method and finds that transportation emissions declined by 11 percent. Lin and Li (2011) use a DID method to estimate the emission effect of carbon taxes in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands. They find that there was no significant effect in Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and that the carbon tax in Norway led to a substantial increase in GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector due to tax exemptions. This paper provides new evidence to this literature by examining the micro-level responses to a carbon tax. This paper is closely related to Metcalf (2019) and Pretis (2020) as they both investigated the aggregate emission response to the BC carbon tax. Metcalf finds that the BC carbon tax reduced aggregate emissions between 5 and 8 percent, although the estimates are sensitive to the specifications. Pretis shows that the results of Metcalf (2019) are not robust and finds that the BC carbon tax did not have a (statistically) significant effect on aggregate emissions. It further investigates the emission effects for six sectors and finds that emissions from the transportation sector declined.Footnote 13 The paper concludes that the carbon tax rate was too low for the policy to have any impacts. Pretis (2020)’s inability to detect a (statistically) significant emission reduction for the industrial sector may be that the industrial sector consists of a mix of many subsectors with different emission intensity, possibly suffering from the aggregation bias. We address this issue by utilizing the micro-level data to directly observe the plant-level emission intensity in the manufacturing sector and employ the augmented DID estimation. Lastly, this paper provides theoretical predictions of emission responses from carbon taxes. We do so by adapting the model of Yamazaki (2022). Yamazaki theoretically shows that carbon taxes can increase manufacturing productivity by recycling tax revenues to reduce CIT rates. It allows plants to invest in energy-saving technologies and explicitly models the plant-level responses from both the carbon tax and the revenue recycling through the CIT reduction. The paper finds that the BC carbon tax negatively affects productivity while the CIT reduction increases it, offsetting the negative carbon tax effect. We extend the model of Yamazaki (2022) to show how the carbon tax affects plant-level emissions through output and emission intensity responses. Although not tested, we further emphasize the importance of the revenue recycling feature of the policy on plant-level emission responses. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the BC carbon tax and its features. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework. The description of the data and empirical methodology are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the estimation results and robustness checks. Section 6 discusses the aggregate implications of our plant-level estimates. Section 7 concludes. The results of additional empirical analyses, and additional tables and figures regarding the data are reported in Appendix.",10

Ahsan,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 2015, more than 735 million people globally lived in extreme poverty, with 79 percent of them in rural areas (World Bank 2018).Footnote 1 Many of these rural households rely on rain-fed agriculture, making them especially vulnerable to production and price risk due to changes in rainfall patterns. In this paper, we examine whether spatial correlation in rainfall can result in these households also being vulnerable to an adverse spatial-spillover effect. To understand why spatial correlation in rainfall matters, consider a farmer residing in region d. Greater rainfall in d will increase this farmer’s crop output and, for a given crop price, increase her income. But the crop price received by farmers in d will likely depend on rainfall in its neighboring districts. With greater neighboring rainfall, production of the same crop will increase, which will lower crop prices, and with inelastic demand, also lower farm incomes. On the other hand, for a given income, the lower crop price will increase a farmer’s purchasing power. Thus, the overall impact of this spatial-spillover effect is an empirical question. To examine this spatial-spillover effect empirically, we use household-level panel data from India along with high-resolution meteorological data. Our choice of India as a setting for this analysis provides us with two important benefits. As a geographically large country, India experiences significant spatial and temporal variation in weather patterns. As we document below, this ensures that we have sufficient variation in rainfall to identify our key results. Second, agricultural production in India is mainly rain-fed and the sector plays a dominant role in the overall economy. For instance, agriculture accounts for 49 percent of India’s total employment and 52 percent of agricultural land is rain-fed (Economic Survey 2018). Thus, any adverse spatial spillover effect of rainfall is likely to be of first-order importance here. To capture rainfall in district d’s neighboring regions, we calculate the cumulative weighted rainfall in all districts \(j \ne d\), where the weights are the inverse straight-line distance between d and j. This flexible approach places greater weight on rainfall in nearby districts without requiring us to define which neighbors matter. We then examine whether a household’s consumption depends on rainfall in neighboring districts as well as rainfall in its own district. Our identification strategy incorporates household fixed effects, which means that our results are identified from within-district deviations in own and neighboring district’s rainfall from its long-term average. These deviations are likely to be orthogonal to unobserved determinants of rural household consumption. We find that a one standard deviation increase in own-district rainfall increases household consumption by 8.46 percent. However, we also find that rainfall shocks in neighboring districts attenuate this positive effect. Indeed, when we account for this adverse spatial spillover effect, we find that the same increase in own-district rainfall increases household consumption by only 5.23 percent. This is approximately 38 percent lower than the benchmark case with no spatial spillovers. These results, therefore, suggest that spatial correlation in rainfall creates economically meaningful general equilibrium effects that attenuate the overall consumption gains from rainfall. Our results are robust to controlling for a district’s average temperature and to adjusting standard errors for spatial correlation following (Conley 1999). To further guard against spurious spatial correlation, we show that our results are robust to including a spatial lag of average household consumption and to a falsification test where we regress crop yields in a district d on neighboring rainfall. Our hypothesis is that rainfall in neighboring districts can have adverse effects on rural households in d via a reduction in crop prices. Rainfall in neighboring districts should not directly affect crop yields in d. Our results indicate that this is indeed the case and suggest that our core result is not being driven by spurious spatial correlation. To empirically examine the key mechanisms that explain the spatial-spillover effect, we first use district-level crop-price data to confirm that a rainfall shock in neighboring districts lowers crop prices received by farmers. Next, we show that households that experience a higher neighbor’s rainfall shock earn lower income from selling crops at the market and are also less likely to participate in markets. We find no such effect on non-agricultural income as well as remittances, which suggests that our results are not being driven by other shocks that are correlated with rainfall. Our paper is related to a small but growing literature that documents the spatial-spillover effect of weather shocks. For instance, Harari and La Ferrara (2018) examine the spillover effect of weather shocks on conflict in Africa. Elliott et al. (2019) examine the spillover effect of typhoons on manufacturing firms in China while Boustan et al. (2020) construct a measure of natural disasters for U.S. counties that account for both own-county disasters as well as disasters that occur in nearby counties. Ours is the first paper to examine the spatial spillover effect of weather shocks on rural agricultural households. Individuals in such households constitute the majority of people living in extreme poverty globally and are especially vulnerable to weather shocks due to climate change. Our approach is also related to past efforts at estimating spatial spillovers of other shocks and interventions (see e.g. Miguel and Kremer 2004). Our paper is also related to a literature that examines the effect of climate change induced variation in temperature and rainfall on agricultural outcomes using both simulation methods (Adams 1989) and regression analysis (Mendelsohn et al. 1994; Schlenker et al. 2006; Deschênes and Greenstone 2007; Dell et al. 2012, 2014). Our paper is also related to a literature that documents the welfare consequences of weather shocks in developing countries. These studies find that weather shocks affect agricultural production, employment, and wages (Jayachandran 2006; Emerick 2018; Kaur 2019; Colmer 2021) as well as human capital (Maccini and Yang 2009; Shah and Steinberg 2017). We contribute to these literatures by showing that rainfall can have economically significant adverse spatial spillover effects.Footnote 2 Indeed, our results also have an important methodological implication for the literature, where the typical approach is to regress an outcome of interest on rainfall in its own region. Thus, rainfall in neighboring districts is implicitly included in the error term. Our results suggest that in the presence of spatial correlation, such an econometric model is misspecified. This point is also relevant when estimating the effects of other weather and environmental shocks with substantial spatial correlation. We structure the rest of the paper as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the mechanisms that can lead to rainfall in neighboring districts lower rural household welfare. In Sect. 3, we describe our household-level panel data as well as our rainfall data. In this section, we also describe how we construct our own-rainfall and neighbor’s rainfall shock variables. In Sect. 4, we describe the empirical strategy we use to identify the impact of rainfall shocks on household consumption. In Sect. 5, we present our baseline results and address key econometric issues while in Sect. 6 we provide supporting evidence for the mechanisms that are driving the spatial spillover effect. In Sect. 7, we explore additional results and robustness checks while in Sect. 8 we provide a conclusion.",

A cost-effective use of these resources—understood as maximising conservation goals for given financial resources or minimising financial resources to achieve given goals—is thus of the utmost importance (Ando et al. 1998; Ferraro and Pattanayak 2006). A growing field of research hence focuses on the cost-effectiveness analysis of biodiversity conservation policies (Ansell et al. 2016; Drechsler 2017; Wätzold et al. 2016). Examples include studies on the cost-effective selection of habitat types (Petersen et al. 2016), conservation in an uncertain environment (Armsworth 2018), the cost-effective design of conservation payments (Drechsler et al. 2016, 2017), the empirical assessment of conservation contracts (Hily et al. 2015; Schöttker and Santos 2019), and the spatial differentiation of conservation payments (Armsworth et al. 2012; Lewis et al. 2011; Wätzold and Drechsler 2014). A novel perspective regarding the cost-effective design of conservation measures is related to the application of Williamson’s analysis of the firm and the related “make-or-buy” decision (Williamson 1998, 1989) to biodiversity conservation (Schöttker et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016). In this context it is of interest how the conservation agency chooses among several alternative governance modes representing different levels of vertical integration of conservation measure provision into the agency’s organizational structure. Following Schöttker et al. (2016), we assume that, in principle, conservation agencies have the choice of two governance modes: (1) to buy land and implement biodiversity conservation measures on this land themselves or through a contractor, e.g. a farmer (buy alternative), or (2) to compensate landowners for voluntarily implementing conservation measures on their own land by offsetting implementation costs with a compensation payment (compensation alternative). Examples for both governance modes can be found around the world. Considering the buy alternative, an illustrative example is the nature conservation foundation “Stiftung Naturschutz Schleswig Holstein”, which owns approximately 2.4% of the total land area of the federal state of Schleswig Holstein (www.stiftungsland.de) in Germany, substantial parts of which are extensively managed by farmers to generate specific conservation outcomes (Schöttker and Wätzold 2018). In the UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds owns and (partly actively manages) more than 1150 km2 of land (www.rspb.org.uk), and in the US, The Nature Conservancy owns and manages 8000 km2 of land (www.nature.org; Pinnschmidt et al. 2021). For other examples of conservation agencies purchasing and actively managing land see Mattijssen et al. (2018) for The Netherlands, Zoomers (2011) for Argentina, and Xie et al. (2020) for case studies across the globe. Regarding the compensation alternative, an example is the “Natur plus Standard” in Germany. Here, landowners who voluntarily implement conservation measures receive a certificate that can be sold to private actors, creating a contract relationship, which secures the provision of biodiversity enhancement (www.naturplus-standard.de). Other examples of privately financed compensation payments can be found in the US (Ferraro and Simpson 2002; Sorice et al. 2013), Cambodia (Clements et al. 2010) and Costa Rica (Redondo-Brenes and Welsh 2010) among others. There is a small but increasing body of literature that analyses the question of governance mode in the context of biodiversity conservation. This literature addresses aspects such as the conceptual analysis of optimal governance mode choice (Muradian and Rival 2012), the development of ecological-economic models to assess the cost-effectiveness of different governance modes (Schöttker et al. 2016), specific conservation settings like forestry and corresponding governance mode options in developed (Juutinen et al. 2008) and developing countries (Curran et al. 2016), and cost assessments of specific governance modes related to conservation projects (Schöttker and Santos 2019; Schöttker and Wätzold 2018). These studies suggest a substantial impact of governance mode choice on the cost-effective implementation of conservation policies. A key threat to global biodiversity, which has not been discussed in the context of cost-effective governance modes, is climate change. According to Thomas et al. (2004) between 15 and 37% of species face a high risk of extinction due to climate change in sampled regions worldwide. Araújo et al. (2011) state that by 2080, 58% of currently protected species in Europe will lose their habitat due to climate-driven range shifts. In order to conserve biodiversity in a changing climate, the development of climate change compatible conservation strategies and policies is important (Heller and Zavaleta, 2009; Jones et al. 2016; Reside et al. 2018). Suggestions generally stress the need to make conservation policies more adaptive (Cinner et al. 2018) and focus on the design of conservation policies that enable species to migrate towards the species’ new ranges (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). However, most research in this field comes from ecologists and conservation biologists and focuses on the impact of conservation policies on species survival in a changing climate (e.g. Zomer et al. 2015; Ribeiro et al. 2018; Jacobs et al. 2019; Ainsworth and Drake 2020). From an economic perspective, only a few studies analyse biodiversity conservation policies and strategies in a changing climate (Ando and Langpap 2018). Examples include the application of modern portfolio analysis for conservation site selection under climate change uncertainty (Mallory and Ando 2014), the investigation of the cost-effectiveness performance of different types of conservation payments (Hily et al. 2017) and the development of an economic evaluation framework for land-use-based conservation policy instruments in a changing climate (Gerling and Wätzold 2021). The purpose of our work is to combine the two novel areas of the economic analysis of governance modes for biodiversity conservation and the economic analysis of biodiversity conservation under climate change. Specifically, we analyse the effects of governance mode choices on the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity conservation against the background of variations in climatic conditions. Our background is species conservation in cultural landscapes such as large parts of Europe in which (1) conservation depends on the availability of land and (2) where species are present due to a specific, often traditional, type of land use (Küster 2004). This implies that a conservation agency has to not only provide land with appropriate climate characteristics for a species but also ensure that specific conservation measures, often mimicking this traditional type of land use, are carried out on that land (for example specific mowing or grazing regimes for endangered grassland birds, Wätzold et al. 2016). We develop a conceptual, spatially explicit ecological-economic model in a dynamic landscape, and estimate the cost-effectiveness of four different patch selection strategies for the two governance modes considered under climate change. These strategies include price prioritisation, species abundance prioritisation, climate suitability prioritisation and climate change direction prioritisation. Our analysis focuses on the impact of climate parameters (climate change speed and different spatial climate characteristics) on the cost-effectiveness of different governance mode and patch selection strategy options. For this purpose, we analyse how changes in these climate parameters impact the cost-effectiveness of different governance mode and patch selection strategy options in a sensitivity analysis. As Schöttker et al. (2016) has already investigated the impact of ecological and economic parameters on the cost-effectiveness of different governance mode options in detail, we only briefly present results related to changes in ecological and economic parameters in Appendix D.",4

Market-based instruments play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity on private lands (de Vries and Hanley 2016). An increasingly popular instrument are conservation offsets (Bull et al. 2018) which apply the concept of tradable permits (Panayotou 1994) to biodiversity conservation. The charm of tradable permits is that they allow for land-use change and economic development while—at least in theory—guaranteeing that the cap (in the case of an environmental harm) or the target (in the case of an environmental benefit) is reached with certainty and at least costs. In the field of biodiversity conservation, this means that if the biodiversity target is set at the current level of biodiversity, there will be “no net loss” (NNL). In practical applications, however, conservation offsets have been observed to fail on the achievement of NNL (Maron et al. 2012; Quétier et al. 2014). On theoretical grounds, the ability of conservation offsets to deliver NNL has been heavily questioned by a number of leading conservation biologists, including, e.g., Moilanen et al. (2009), Bekessy et al. (2010) and Maron et al. (2012). A central line of criticism in these articles is that if credits are already awarded at the initiation of a habitat restoration process and can immediately be sold to developers then habitat is lost temporarily until the restoration process is complete. But even the assumption that at some time the habitat loss will be offset is overly optimistic given that restoration projects have frequently failed altogether in the past (Maron et al. 2012). Although the raised concerns are valid, they only look on the ecological side of the issue, ignoring the economic side. While awarding credits with the completion of restoration has ecological advantages, it may have several economic disadvantages. One is that credits that may be needed by a developer today will be available only at a later time, so the development cannot take place – incurring economic costs. Another one is that landowners investing in costly restoration earn the return only later, and moreover, this return is uncertain due to the above-mentioned risk that a restoration process fails. Given the requirement of NNL on the one hand and the potential economic problems associated with a late award of credits on the other, so-called trading ratios have been proposed so that credits are awarded at the initiation of restoration, but more credits are required to develop a certain amount of ecologically valuable land than are earned by the restoration of the same amount of degraded land. By this the loss of 1 ha of habitat is compensated by the gain of q > 1 hectares of land later. This surplus compensates for the time delay between loss and gain as well as the uncertainty in the gain (caused by the uncertainty in the success of the restoration process), so that on average the amount of habitat does not decline. Trading ratios are increasingly applied in practice (Bull et al. 2017); a theoretical analysis of trading ratios, which however considers only their ecological effects, is provided by Moilanen et al. (2009). The present paper takes up this concept and explores, in a systematic manner, under which circumstances NNL can be achieved more cost-effectively by awarding credits with the initiation of restoration (award-initiation), considering appropriate trading ratios, or by awarding credits with successful completion (award-completion). As an alternative to the trading ratios I also consider that the (nominal) conservation target may be increased appropriately beyond the initial amount of habitat, which also may prevent the net loss of habitat on the temporal average (not necessarily at any point in time) in the award-initiation scheme. So altogether, both schemes are designed that the long-term average of habitat equals the initial amount. This is necessary for a meaningful comparison because the indicators, in particular the cost per habitat, introduced below for the scheme performance systematically depend on the amount of habitat. For the analysis I develop a generic agent-based ecological-economic model in which landowners can use their land parcels for conservation or for “economic” purposes like agriculture or housing, and strive for the maximisation of their net present value expected profit. Here they consider time discounting and profit uncertainty which arises in the award-completion scheme, because at the initiation of a restoration process the landowner does not know if and when the process will be complete and credits awarded. The driver of the land-use and credits-trading activities are spatially heterogeneous and temporally changing profits associated with the economic land use. These changes imply that land parcels with comparatively low economic profits (which would typically be in conservational use) may turn into high-profit land parcels (which would preferably be developed into economic use and require credits), while land parcels with comparatively high economic profits (which would typically be in economic use) may turn into low-profit land parcels (which would preferably be restored to habitat to supply credits). The different scheme designs are compared with respect to a number of performance criteria: (i) the average cost of the scheme, represented by the forgone economic profits of the landowners per habitat parcel and measuring the cost-effectiveness of the scheme, (ii) the temporal variation in the forgone economic profits, (iii) the temporal variation in the number of habitat parcels (considering that NNL is defined as a temporal average which does not exclude the temporary shortfall of habitat), and (iv) the amount of habitat turnover incurred by the continuous economic development and restoration of habitats which usually has a significant – often adverse – impact on the survival of species (Hanski 1999; Drechsler and Johst 2010). As outlined, the two types of conservation offset schemes differ by the time at which credits are awarded. This question loosely relates to the inter-temporal trading (banking and borrowing) of credits in emissions trading discussed in the environmental-economic literature. Two main advantages are associated with inter-temporal trading. One is that it allows hedging against trends in emission abatement costs (Innes 2003). If abatement costs are currently low and expected to increase it is sensible to abate more emissions than necessary, bank the earned credits and sell them in the future at a higher price; while if abatement costs are currently high and expected to fall, it is sensible to borrow credits from future time periods to avoid current high abatement costs. The second advantage of inter-temporal trading is that it allows for hedging against price shocks, or more generally, against risks (Fell et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2016), because—similar to the expected price changes addressed above –, unexpected future increases or drops in credit prices can be buffered by banking or utilised by borrowing, respectively. Although there is some similarity between these studies and the present one, one should, note an important difference: that the present study does not consider inter-temporal trading; instead, awarded credits are sold on the spot. In contrast to this, the present study addresses a peculiarity in conservation offsets: that the restoration of ecological habitat causes time lags—of uncertain length—between the economic investment and the generated environmental benefit and/or even uncertainty in the level of the generated environmental benefit. Therefore, when ecologists (e.g., Bekessy et al. 2010) speak of “lending” and “savings banks” this should be understood as a “lending from” and “saving for” nature, respectively, rather than an inter-temporal trade between (human) market participants. Furthermore, the present analysis does not focus on risk in the credits prices (cf. Landowner decision making in Sect. 2.2) but on the success and duration of the restoration process. This, however, opens up a common question between the above-discussed inter-temporal emissions trading and the two present types of conservation offset schemes: how do the two schemes manage and distribute the ecological and economic risks associated with the restoration of habitats – which is addressed in the above questions (ii) and (iii). While there are a few environmental-economic papers that address the spatial aspect of conservation offsets, such as Drechsler and Wätzold (2009), Parkhurst et al. (2016) and Needham et al. (2021), I am aware of only two that address the temporal dimension and in particular the issue of habitat restoration. One is Kangas and Ollikainen (2019) who present an analytical model (numerically applied to forestry in Finland) of a conservation credits market. Although the authors address the concept of trading ratios, they do not provide a systematic comparison of the different offset scheme designs. The other paper is by Drechsler and Hartig (2011) who developed a model of a similar (though slightly simpler) structure than the present one to explore effects of uncertainty in the cost (forgone profits) of conservation. Assuming a deterministic habitat restoration process, it is somewhat complementary to the present analysis.",2
82.0,2.0,Environmental and Resource Economics,09 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-022-00686-x,On Simple Rules for the Social Cost of Carbon,June 2022,Cees Withagen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is defined as the total value of damages over the entire time horizon from emitting a marginal unit of CO2 into the atmosphere. The policy relevance of the SCC lies in the fact that it can be interpreted as the Pigouvian tax to be imposed on \(CO_{2}\) emissions in a competitive economy in order to restore a social optimum, at least in the absence of other externalities. Recently, there appears to be a tendency in the economics literature to design and propose so-called simple rules for the SCC. These rules advocate a simple, e.g., linear, relationship between the SCC and national income, GDP, based on an analytical Integrated Assessment Model (IAM). Climate change is a complex problem and a simple rule, derived from such a theoretical economic model, may help the policy maker, or scholars from other disciplines, to better understand the essential economic and climate-related features that stand out in finding an optimal carbon tax. Indeed, this is the strategy followed in the simple rules literature: To study a simple model and make assumptions that lead to analytical expressions for the carbon tax rate, followed by numerical exercises showing that the tax rule performs reasonably well, in some sense. The principal objective of the present paper is to evaluate this approach from an economic theory perspective. Hence, the emphasis will not be on the performance of the rules, although some attention will of course be given to this issue. To illustrate the problems I consider 5 representative articles written by prominent researchers who offer a simple rule: Golosov et al. (2014), Van den Bijgaart et al. (2016), Rezai and Van der Ploeg (2016), Li (2019), and Dietz and Venmans (2019). They all start from a basic IAM that yields optimal paths over time of relevant variables such as GDP and emissions. To derive their rules they make specific assumptions, which are taken in various combinations and modifications from a set including: The absence of direct climate damages in the social welfare functions, a constant elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, constant growth rates of optimal GDP, consumption and man-made capital, and, finally, a specific relationship in the optimum between marginal damages from accumulated atmospheric greenhouse gases and GDP. The present paper identifies potential inconsistencies regarding these assumptions and the consequences thereof for the applicability and the performance of the simple rules. Although the first two assumptions mentioned, no direct damages and constant elasticity, are instrumental I will not go into them too deeply. The main problem lies in the assumptions of constant growth rates and the relationship between GDP and marginal damages. First, in some models the chosen production structure is incompatible with marginal damages being proportional to GDP, as postulated by several authors. Second, after establishing the SCC as a relatively simple function of GDP in an optimal growth model, some authors relate the SCC to actual rather than optimal GDP. An additional, and more general, issue is that if the economy is on a balanced growth path, inverted-U shaped patterns of e.g., GDP and hence the SCC are ruled out by definition, whereas inverted U-shaped patterns may and do actually occur in many IAMs, generating non-monotonic optimal GDP patterns. Moreover, with the emphasis on long run growth, short term problems, that are presently faced by governments to fight climate change, get less attention then. Finally, the authors make little effort to justify their postulated growth rates as an endogenous outcome of their modelling, in contrast with e.g., Tsur and Zemel (2009) and Nordhaus and Sztorc (2013). Although I focus on theoretical issues, I will argue in favor of an alternative approach. Economists’ capacity to solve large dynamic optimization problems is strong enough to present to policy makers solution paths over time, rather than just simple rules. This is precisely what the authors do themselves in the process of assessing their rule: They compare the rule to first-best, which necessitates to calculate the first-best. Moreover, sensitivity analyses can be provided and presented to policy makers, who can then make their choices between scenarios. This approach is certainly not novel and has been implemented in practice. (See e.g., U.S. Interagency Working Group, 2010, as well as Newell and Pizer, 2003). I agree that IAMs can look like black boxes and may be difficult to understand. So, models, like those used to yield simple rules, might be very useful for explanatory purposes, but not primarily for policy purposes. I will address the merits of each of the individual models in due course. An important feature of climate change is uncertainty. Therefore the sensitivity of the social cost of carbon with respect to uncertainty clearly deserves attention. The literature on this topic is abundant. See e.g., Cai and Lontzek (2019), Gollier (2002, 2004, 2012), Gollier and Weitzman (2010), Lemoine and Rudik (2017): Nordhaus (1994), Newell and Pizer (2003), Weitzman (1998, 2001 and 2014). See also Bremer and Ploeg (2021) and Olijslagers et al. (2021) for a recent contribution. Special attention has been given to the issue of catastrophic climate change. See e.g. Lemoine and Traeger (2014) and Tsur and Zemel (2021), the latter for a recent survey with due attention to their own contributions. Taking uncertainty into account typically leads to more complicated expressions for the social cost of carbon, in spite of the fact that sometimes analytical results are obtained (see e.g. Van der Bremer and Van der Ploeg, (2021)). For the purpose of the present paper, namely to scrutinize simple rules, abstracting from uncertainty suffices. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes an IAM that basically comprises the theoretical models underlying the simple rules that I discuss. It also indicates under what conditions a simple rule can be derived. Section 3 describes the specific models as well as the simple rules proposed by the five groups of scholars mentioned above. Moreover, it is shown that the assumptions made to obtain the simple rule are incompatible with each other in some instances. This is what will be called internal inconsistency. Subsequently, Sect. 4 critically assesses these simple rules further. Assumptions underlying the rules that will be discussed are constant growth rates, and particular assumptions regarding marginal damages. Section 5 discusses the performance of the simple rules. It describes the approaches the authors use to show that their rule is performing well. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",1

Amundsen,Lars Gårn Hansen,Hans Jørgen Whitta-Jacobsen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The environmental and health impacts of pollution are substantial and polluters are subject to extensive regulation in most high- and medium-income countries. An important class of regulation problems concerns the regulation of many small-scale polluters where the damage resulting from emissions varies with the polluters’ locations.Footnote 1 Examples include nutrient and pesticide emissions from farms, particulate emissions from vehicles and home heating units, emissions of particulates and hazardous chemical compounds from smaller firms. In practice, emissions from small-scale polluters are often regulated indirectly by a combination of technological standards and restrictions on the use of the ‘dirty’ inputs that contribute to the pollution. In the following, we establish general principles for how such regulations should be designed and combined. Specifically, we consider externality problems where the marginal external cost from emission, the ʻdamage levelʼ, differs across polluters’ locations. We assume that the  instruments the regulatory authorities can use are technology standards or other technology regulations that can be differentiated across locations and restrictions on dirty input use that cannot be differentiated.Footnote 2 Examples of the first type of instruments are emission or engine standards for vehicles and home heating units, technical standards and BAT (best available technology) requirements for production equipment, standards for and subsidies to fertilizer conserving farming technologies and crops etc. Such technology standards can be, and often are, differentiated according to polluters’ locations with tougher standards in populated areas or close to vulnerable eco-systems. Examples of the latter are taxes on, bans of or quantitative restrictions on the harmful substance content in inputs such as additives in fuel, active compounds in pesticides and chemicals, nitrogen in fertilizer etc. Such regulations are difficult to differentiate between individual polluters and are typically applied uniformly. We develop a theoretical model for this type of regulatory situation in order to answer the following research questions: how should these regulatory instruments be combined in order to maximize welfare, and how does the optimal combination depend on the type of cleaner technologies available to the polluters? Cleaner technologies can reduce emissions through two fundamentally different mechanisms. One is ʻinput displacementʼ, where use of technology helps producers to economize on the use of dirty inputs (as when use of some technological measure makes it possible to replace a dirty input by a cleaner input). The other is ‘emission capture’, where use of technology gives reduction of emission for given input use (as when an end-of-pipe filter is installed). Generally, cleaner technologies involve both types of effects, but their relative importance can vary substantially. It turns out that optimal regulation depends critically on which type of mechanism that dominates among the available cleaner technologies. Our contribution is thus (1) to develop a parsimonious model that encompasses a wide range of pollution problems with many small-scale polluters, where environmental damages vary geographically (from agricultural nutrient emissions to emissions from household heating units), and (2) in this model to derive general principles for optimal regulation and how this depends on whether the available cleaner technologies are predominantly input displacing or emission capturing. We do not know of any prior contributions that have done this. A number of contributions in the literature have investigated indirect regulation of emissions through input and output taxes, e.g., Ayres and Kneese (1969), Holterman (1976), Bohm (1981), Larsson et al. (1996), Claassen and Horan (2001), Hansen and Hansen (2014), Knittel and Sandler (2018), but these do not consider technology regulation. Other papers have considered various aspects of technology regulation, e.g., Georg et al. (1992), Wayne and Shadbegian (2003), Sengubta (2012), Klier and Linn (2016), but these do not consider input (or emission) regulation in combination with technology regulation. A few papers have considered the interaction of different instruments in the regulation of emissions, e.g., Goulder et al. (1999) and Christiansen and Smith (2015). The paper closest to ours is Christiansen and Smith (2015), who investigate optimal combinations of technology regulation and taxes on emissions (not on input as we consider), but neither this contribution nor the other ones mentioned make the crucial distinction between input displacing and emission capturing technologies that is essential to our results. Finally, in the specific context of regulation of the externalities associated with emissions from automobiles a number of papers study how one can combine regulation of fuel inputs and of automobile characteristics that influence emissions to indirectly regulate the emissions from automobiles. Innes (1996) shows that the optimal tax on a vehicle equals the expected cost of the vehicle’s emissions less the expected fuel tax payment. Later papers, Fullerton and West (2002 and 2010) and Bjertnæs (2019) have extended this analysis in a number of ways and found that a vehicle should be subsidized (taxed) if the tax rate on fuel is greater (smaller) than the marginal damage per unit of fuel for the vehicle in question. We find similar results in the simpler and more general model of pollution from small-scale polluters that we consider, but, importantly, in our setting technology regulation may be differentiated geographically between high and low damage areas, which is not the case for the mentioned contributions. Hence, in our setting, technology regulation could be a requirement of catalyzers or a ban on diesel engines for cars driven in specific areas, e.g., in populated inner cities, but not in less populated areas as indeed seen in automobile regulation. In our model of location-specific externalities, many polluting firms emit at different locations characterized by different damage levels. The profit as well as the emission of each polluter is assumed to depend on the amount of ‘dirty’ input used and on the intensity by which pollution reducing (input displacing or emission capturing) technologies are used. Authorities can implement uniform disincentives for dirty input use and location-differentiated incentives for installation of cleaner technology. We derive principles for how intensive the regulation of dirty input use and technology should be, and in particular for how technology regulation should be differentiated across polluters. As mentioned, we find that the optimal regulation design crucially depends on the relative importance of the emission capturing and the input displacing effects of the cleaner technologies available to the polluting industry. First, even though we assume, that technology regulation can be finely differentiated to reflect local damage levels and input regulation cannot, optimal regulation generally implies that uniform dirty input regulation should be applied and possibly by substantial intensity, particularly if the available cleaner technologies are mainly of the input displacing type. Second, when the available cleaner technologies are mainly of the emission capturing type, the optimal technology regulation unambiguously encourages the use of cleaner technologies (although with different intensities depending on the polluters’ damage levels), while if the available technologies are mainly of the input displacing type, optimal technology regulation encourages cleaner technologies in high damage areas, but discourages their use in low damage areas. Our results apply to a case where authorities are limited to using the two indirect regulation instruments mentioned. Clearly, if the emissions we study could be measured and regulated directly, it would be possible to implement the standard Pigouvian tax recommendation, which would ensure the first best solution to the regulation problem. The reason why authorities choose to regulate emissions indirectly through technology standards and dirty input regulation may be that it is simply not feasible in practice to measure and regulate emissions directly. This is certainly the case for, e.g., nutrient and pesticide emissions from farms and particulate emissions from vehicles. In other cases, regulators may be reluctant to impose differentiated emission taxes not because of infeasibility, but for reasons of income distribution or other political considerations. At any rate, since these indirect instruments often are those actually used in practice, we believe that providing guidance on how to design and combine them to maximize welfare can provide useful insight for regulators and other interested parties regardless of why regulators chose to limit themselves to these instruments. In Sect. 2, we provide motivation for considering the particular regulation problem we study, in particular for the limited set of regulatory instruments allowed. Section 3 sets up the model formally, while in Sect. 4, we characterize optimal regulation under the allowed instrument set. Section 5 discusses the intuition behind the derived regulation principle and its implications for regulation in practice and Sect. 6 offers some overall conclusions.",1

International environmental agreements (IEA), such as the Kyoto-Protocol or the Paris Agreement, are a widely discussed option to coordinate the countries’ climate policies and, therefore, reduce carbon emissions. However, there is no supranational authority that can force sovereign countries to join an IEA, so that IEAs must be self-enforcing. Another important aspect of fossil fuel use is its high capital intensity.Footnote 2 The extraction and utilization of fossil fuels requires a specialized capital stock, such as mines, oil platforms, or fossil fuel fired power plants, which constitutes a limited capacity to use fossil fuels. Limited extraction capacities are discussed, among others, by Campbell (1980), Cairns and Lasserre (1991), Holland (2003), and Kollenbach (2017). This paper aims at analyzing the role of a limited fossil fuel utilization (black) capacity for the formation of IEAs. Both climate change and the accumulation of a black capacity are dynamic problems. Therefore, this paper rests on the seminal work of Battaglini and Harstad (2016), who consider a dynamic game where countries choose whether to join a climate coalition, the contract length of the IEA, emissions, and investments in green technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric facilities or nuclear power plants.Footnote 3 Thus, Battaglini and Harstad (2016) consider a green capacity necessary to produce renewable energy, but they neglect a black capacity by assuming that a practically unlimited amount of fossil fuels can be used. By introducing a black capacity, fossil fuel use becomes limited. If the black capacity is completely used, that is if the black capacity constraint binds, every country uses less fossil fuel and more renewables than with a non-binding constraint. However, the promising result of Battaglini and Harstad (2016), that large climate coalition can be stable if countries only negotiate on emissions but determine green technology investments non-cooperatively (incomplete contract), disappears. Without a black capacity, every signatory realizes that its green technology investments will not affect the emissions of the other countries in the next period, but only weaken its bargaining position in the negotiations of a new climate agreement. Due to this hold-up problem, the signatories reduce their investments, which increases their emissions and, therefore, the climate damage of the following period. Thus, the signatories can credibly threaten every deflecting country to sign a short term contract and, therefore, antedating the higher climate damages. With a black capacity, this credible threat no longer exists. Because the black capacity determines emissions, the signatories know that their green capacity investments of the last contract period will payoff. Consequently, they do not reduce their investments eliminating the hold-up problem, so that only small climate coalitions are stable. This result also holds if the black capacity constraint does not bind initially but will bind in the future. In this case, the hold-up problem appears but it is only possible to postpone it as long as the capacity constraint is non-binding. Consequently, only a small climate coalition is stable in the period directly before the constraint becomes binding. Because the countries anticipate that a large coalition is not stable in this period, the hold-problem cannot be postponed beyond it. Therefore, also only a small coalition is stable in the prior period, and so forth. In other words, the standard backward induction argument implies that a large coalition is never stable. IEAs are studied in economic literature since the early 1990s. Pioneering works are Hoel (1992), Carraro and Siniscalco (1993) and Barrett (1994). Using the stability concept of d’Aspremont et al. (1983), this literature analyses the stable size of an environmental agreement or climate coalition, respectively. That is, it is analyzed at which size no country has an incentive to join or to leave the coalition. The core result is that stable IEAs are either small and deep or large and shallow.Footnote 4 There are several reasons that can explain the disparity to the key result of the literature. Using a static model, Breton and Sbragia (2019) show that larger coalitions can be stable if signatories not only coordinate their carbon emission abatement but also their adaption measures. The stabilizing effect of research investments is discussed by Barrett (2006), Hoel and de Zeeuw (2010), Rubio (2017) and Masoudi and Zaccour (2018). Another channel that can stabilize an IEA is foresightedness. According to Diamantoudi and Sartzetakis (2018), a large coalition can be stable if potential deviants take the policy changes of the remaining signatories into account. Carbon border adjustments may also stabilize an IEA by reducing free-riding incentives as shown by Al Khourdajie and Finus (2020). Due to the countries’ asymmetry, the cooperation benefits vary among countries. Therefore, transfer mechanisms, which reallocate the benefits either among signatories, or between fringe countries and signatories may stabilize large coalitions.Footnote 5 Carraro et al. (2006) discuss both options and also differentiate between several transfer schemes. Kornek and Edenhofer (2020) consider international transfer funds and analyze which fund design performs best with respect to a reduction of free-riding. The role of the countries’ asymmetry is highlighted by Fuentes-Albero and Rubio (2010). Although I consider asymmetric countries, I show that transfers among signatories are not able to stabilize large coalitions. Because climate change is a dynamic problem, a growing number of studies make use of multi-period models.Footnote 6 The dismal key result that IEAs are either small or ineffective is confirmed by Barrett (1999). In contrast, Asheim et al. (2006) and Asheim and Holtsmark (2009) show that larger coalitions can be stable if the signatories have the option to punish deviators. A common feature of these studies is that they focus on a repeated game but assume carbon emissions to be a flow pollutant. A carbon emission stock is considered by Breton et al. (2010), Mason et al. (2017), Rubio and Casino (2005), and Rubio and Ulph (2007). While the results of the latter two are in line with Barrett (1999), Breton et al. (2010) and Mason et al. (2017) show that a punishment option stabilizes larger IEAs. Kováč and Schmidt (2021) show that large coalitions are stable if countries have the opportunity do delay negotiations. Closest to my study is the dynamic game considered by Battaglini and Harstad (2016). They differentiate between a complete contract and an incomplete contract. In the former case, countries coordinate both emissions and green capacity investments, and the stable climate coalition is small. In contrast, a large climate coalition can be stable if the signatories only coordinate emissions but leave the decision with respect to green investments to the national authorities. In this case, a hold-up problem emerges that stabilizes coalitions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The model and preliminary results are presented in Sect. 2. Sect. 3 analyzes the stability of climate coalition under both a complete and an incomplete contract given that the black capacity constraint binds. The case of an initially non-binding capacity constraint is discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 analyzes whether transfers can stabilize large coalitions. 6 concludes.",

In principle, tradeable quotas enable managers to regulate total harvest efficiently, to the extent that markets allocate quota to the most efficient users. Quota markets (including both lease and asset marketsFootnote 1) usually develop informally, although institutions may be created centrally in order to improve transparency and reduce friction in trading. Willingness to pay for quota in either market should then reflect the additional profits earned from their use, and quota prices can be taken to approximate resource rents in the fishery (see Arnason 1990; Grafton 1995; Squires et al. 1998). While the basic economics of ITQs is well established in the literature, theoretical analysis is mostly focused on the simplest case of the single species fishery, despite the fact that many, if not most, quota managed fisheries are multispecies. Multispecies fisheries are characterised by jointness in production, so that the range of feasible output compositions is restricted (Squires and Kirkley 1996; Vestergaard 1996; Turner 1997; Singh and Weninger 2009). In other words, different species are caught together, and the ability of fishermen to alter the species mix in the harvest is limited. As a result, in multispecies fisheries market equilibrium quota prices are jointly determined (Campbell 1995; Vestergaard 1999). This interdependence of prices for different species quotas complicates the analysis of quota market equilibria, so that it is difficult to derive generalisable results about the relationship between quota prices and fishery performance, for example, or about the effectiveness with which quota prices capture resource rents in the fishery. The relatively small number of empirical models of quota prices in multispecies fisheries do not find close agreement between observed and predicted prices (Campbell 1995; Squires and Kirkley 1996; Bose et al. 2001) and while econometric analysis of empirical data on quota markets reveals broadly expected relationships overall between quota prices and industry profitability, there is significant noise and price dispersion, at least partly reflecting thin markets and informational issues (e.g., Batstone and Sharp 2003; Dupont et al. 2005; Newell et al. 2005; Holland 2013, 2016; Ropicki and Larkin 2014; Jin et al. 2019). All else equal, we would clearly expect quota prices in a multispecies fishery to be sensitive to short run quota availability. In many cases this will depend upon fishermens’ behaviour in response to regulations concerning the retention or discarding of “over-quota” fish in the catch. The effects of in-season quota supply shortages for relatively abundant species (often referred to as “chokes”), for example, will then depend upon how fishermen respond in terms of discarding as they seek to continue harvesting fish for which quota remains available.Footnote 2 If quota prices are jointly determined, any quota price changes will likely affect all quota prices, so that quota price data for individual species need to be interpreted with caution. Changes in quota prices may also mean changes in the proportion of total fishery rents captured by the value of quota, so that in the short run quota prices may be an unreliable guide to either industry profitability or resource rents. The aim in this paper is to explore these quota price interrelationships using a simple numerical simulation model in order to focus on the effects of quota supply shortages. To ensure a relatively tractable model, in common with much of the literature simplifying assumptions are made about the vessel harvest function. Firstly, total harvest is assumed to be a  deterministic function of (short run) fishing effort, here defined as a bundle of variable inputs linked to the number of fishing days. Secondly, for a representative vessel the mix of species in the harvest is assumed to be fixed. Ignoring stochasticity in harvest is a convenient (and common) simplification, and we can think of the harvest as an average for a representative vessel. The assumption of fixed proportions in harvesting may arguably be more restrictive, but is used in order to model as simply as possible the real-world problem of chokes and discarding as a result of quotas supplied in different proportions to typical catches.Footnote 3 Again, we can think of the proportions in which different species are caught as averages for a vessel of a particular type within a given season, but we can also think of them as modelling the harvest proportions which pertain after vessels have attempted to match their harvests more closely with quota availability. The important thing is that there are differences in proportions at quota price equilibrium: the harvesting cost implications can then be assumed implicit in the chosen parameter values. In reality vessels can always alter the species mix at the margins, through choice of fishing area and time, adjustments to gear, and so on, but in multispecies fisheries the impacts of a divergence between relative species abundance on the grounds and the relative size of quotas are common and well-documented, and evidence the limited extent to which, in practice, these impacts can be avoided (e.g., Mortensen et al. 2018). The implications of catch/quota imbalances for discarding in multispecies quota fisheries have been examined by Turner (1997) and Singh and Weninger (2009), assuming deterministic harvest but allowing for costly targeting (weak output disposability). Singh and Weninger (2009) go on to consider the impact of costly targeting and discarding on individual quota prices, but do not explore the joint determination of quota prices for different species nor the impact of short run quota supply shortages (chokes). To summarise the modelling results, in the simulations we find joint determination of quota prices with quota price equilibria sensitive to the relative numbers of quota species and vessel types in the fishery. The exhaustion of a choke species quota results in a general decrease in the quota prices for all other species, as the choke species quota price is bid up to its price ceiling (the ex-vessel price in the case of costless discarding). With relatively few “free” quota prices, either where there are few quota species or where there are quota prices constrained at their ceilings, we observe the emergence of inframarginal rents as equilibrium quota prices fail to capture all marginal rents as resource rent. In the next section we develop a simple model of short run vessel behaviour in an ITQ fishery. The following two sections outline the methodology for calculating market equilibrium quota (lease) prices and the optimisation model used to run the numerical simulations. The results of the simulations are discussed in Sect. 5 for a fishery with up to three species and three fishing firms. A baseline scenario has equal numbers of quota species and fishing firms (representing different fishing technologies) with either costless or costly discarding. We then examine scenarios in which there are more species than firms (technologies) as well as fewer species.Footnote 4 We go on to examine the impact of a “deemed value” system where firms can pay an in lieu charge to land fish for which they cannot obtain quota. The results are discussed in a concluding section.",2

This means, catch quantities are not directly regulated. Harvesting efficiency in those fisheries is limited, however, by the current state of technology, and often by regulations that further constrain the efficieny of harvesting technologies, e.g. by restricting fishing gear and practices, or limiting the length of fishing seasons (Homans and Wilen 1997). Whereas improving technical efficiency would unambiguously enhance welfare in a first-best setting (see, e.g., Clark 1990, Ch. 2), this is far from obvious in the actual second-best world of most fisheries, with the imperfect regulation and enforcement of resource use and thus common-pool externalities in place. The reason is that improving technical efficiency tends to increase harvesting and reduce the stock, which may undermine long-run productivity of the resource and thus ultimately reduce welfare. This paper aims to characterize conditions under which a costless improvement of technical harvesting efficiency will increase or decrease welfare in an imperfectly regulated fishery. To this end, we formulate a bioeconomic model of a regulated open-access fishery. In this setting, individual fishermen ignore the effect of their harvest on the dynamics of the fish population; that is, exploitation takes place in a myopic manner. The supply of fish is thus determined by current marginal fishing costs, ignoring the dynamic stock externality of the resource use, and dissipating resource rent, similar as in Reimer and Wilen (2013). Welfare includes producer surplus and consumer surplus (Copes 1972; Quaas et al. 2018; Jensen et al. 2019), which is certainly relevant for small-scale fisheries in developing countries that serve as an important local source of livelihoods and food supply. We find that in biological equilibrium where the harvest equalizes natural growth of the fish stock, the components of welfare—consumer and producer surplus—in the regulated open access fishery, change with technical efficiency in a non-monotonic fashion. This shows how more efficient fishing methods, or more lenient gear regulations, may be a mixed blessing not only for the catch and fish abundance, but also for the profitability and the welfare of the local fishing community. Importantly, we characterize under which conditions technical efficiency will improve, or reduce welfare. We find that if technical efficiency increases from a low level, this will improve both consumer and producer surplus, while beyond some point a further increase in technical efficiency will reduce both components of welfare. We further find that the turning point is the same for both welfare components. It is the level of efficiency for which the fish population size would give rise to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) harvesting. MSY as welfare-maximizing harvesting is indeed a surprising result, given that the model includes the feature that fishing costs decrease wth fish abundance. This result holds for a large range of specifications for benefits and costs derived from harvesting, allowing for stock-dependency of both benefits and costs. It is demonstrated that the result stems from the stock-agumenting property of harvesting efficiency, i.e. that a change in harvesting efficiency is equivalent to a change in resource stock size. We show that under this condition, welfare in biological and market equilibrium can be expressed as an increasing function of harvest alone and thus long run welfare effects of harvesting efficiency depend on the steady-state harvest level only. The main contribution of this paper is to show how an improvement of technical efficiency in a common-pool resource affects the different components of welfare. That a more efficient fishing technology can be a mixed blessing has been discovered before (Whitmarsh 1990; Murray 2007). In particular, Squires and Vestergaard (2013a, b) show that the rapid technological progress in the past contributed to the decline of most, if not all, global fisheries. Gordon and Hannesson (2015) gives an in depth analysis of technological progress and the stock collapse in the Norwegian winter herring fishery, and provide evidence that the introduction of the power block technology was the principal factor in the demise of the stock. Hannesson et al. (2010) and Eide et al. (2003) find similar results for other fisheries. Here, we show that this mixed blessing of improving fishing technology is a systematic property of fisheries operating under regulated open access, and that in the long-term welfare effects are negative if the stock is below the one that generates the maximum sustainable yield, i.e. if the stock is overfished according to the definition of the FAO (2020). The result that improving technical efficiency can reduce harvest—and hence welfare—in the long run can be interpreted as a form of bio-economic rebound effect, in a sense related to the rebound effect known in energy economics (Gillingham et al. 2016). This bio-economic rebound effect works over two links: In the short run, increased technical efficiency increases harvest in market equilibrium. In the long run, increased technical efficiency thus reduces the (steady state) resource stock, which feeds back on the biological resource productivity. The next section presents our bioeconomic model and Sect. 3 presents the main results. In Sect. 4 the results are illustrated for a case study; the Sengalese small scale fishery on Sardinella Aurita. The final Sect. 5 discusses our findings and concludes. The appendix considers extensions of the model to show that our main results generalize to a wider class of fishing technologies and utility functions, and how results are qualified if dynamics and discounting are considered.",1

By contributing 17% of animal protein, and 7% of all proteins consumed globally, seafood is in particular crucial for over 3 billion people in developing countries. Due to the large variety of different species, seafood can also be a source of diversity on consumers‘ plates, which depends on consumer preferences. Globally, seafood is a highly traded commodity (FAO 2018), and also many developing countries benefit from seafood trade (Asche et al. 2015; Bronnmann et al. 2020). Likely, one reason for this are consumer variety preferences ,as different types of fish are imperfect substitutes. All else equal, consumers’ utility increases in the variety of goods (here fish) they consume. We thus interpret a lower willingness to substitute as a “preference for variety”, a term that has been coined in particular in response to the Dixit-Stiglitz constant elasticity of demand function (Dixit and Stiglitz 1977).Footnote 1 However, one third of the fish stocks monitored by the FAO is classified as over-exploited or depleted. This may hamper the oceans’ role for food provision both in terms of quantity and variety. Theory has shown that consumer preferences induce species interactions on market level, with consequences for ecosystem resilience. If consumers readily substitute between resources, stock restoration after an adverse shock is less costly to consumers (Quaas et al. 2013). Quaas and Requate (2013) show that limited substitutability is an important determinant of stock (local) extinction under open access. In this study, we aim to add to the literature by investigating consumer preferences for different seafood species in a developing country setting with a high degree of species variety.Footnote 2 Empirical analyses of fish consumer preferences mostly rely on demand system estimation, in particular in developed countries like North America, Europe and Japan (Asche et al. 1997; Bronnmann et al. 2016b; Bronnmann 2016; Wessells and Wilen 1993; Xie and Myrland 2011). But also the number of studies for developing countries is increasing (Akuffo et al. 2020; Dey 2000; Dey et al. 2011, 2005, 2008; Garcia et al. 2005). All of these are examples for direct demand systems, although there are also indirect demand systems estimated such as Barten and Bettendorf (1989) or ?. The literature covers specific demand for the most prominent species and products. Overall, the studies conclude that the demand for fish in developed countries is inelastic. When dis-aggregated demand of specific fish species is analyzed, the demand seems to be elastic, as consumers can substitute more effectively within a highly aggregated commodity. In other words, demand is less elastic when there are limited available substitutes (Asche et al. 2007). This is also commonly observed using a multistage budgeting framework. At the second stage, the elasticities are more elastic than at the first stage (Molina 1997). Thus, elasticity estimates depend on aggregation. For developing countries, especially for Asia, studies find high negative own price elasticities. Cross-price relationships between species groups are typically inelastic, except for high valued fish. While the majority of cross-price elasticities are positive indicating substitution relationships, they also find a number of negative relationships particularly for low income groups and between processed and fresh fish types (Dey et al. 2011; Garcia et al. 2005).Footnote 3 The literature covers specific demand for the most prominent species and products. Overall, the studies conclude that the demand for fish in developed countries is inelastic. When dis-aggregated demand of specific fish species is analyzed, the demand seems to be elastic, as consumers can substitute more effectively within a highly aggregated commodity. In other words, demand is less elastic when there are limited available substitutes (Asche et al. 2007). This is also commonly observed using a multistage budgeting framework. At the second stage, the elasticities are more elastic than at the first stage (Molina 1997). Thus, elasticity estimates depend on aggregation.

While the majority of cross-price elasticities are positive indicating substitution relationships, they also find a number of negative relationships particularly for low income groups and between processed and fresh fish types (Dey et al. 2011; Garcia et al. 2005).Footnote 4 As demand systems can only deal with a limited number of parameters, demand studies make generally use of different aggregation approaches, that follow from respective research questions. In many studies aggregation approaches are used which based on species’ traits. For example, species of the same taxon are grouped. However, if consumer preferences are not based on species traits, such an aggregation approach may overlook some consumer-perceived variety. To fully understand consumer willingness to substitute, we make use of a non-trait-based approach to species aggregation that only considers market information. Furthermore, by studying a very large number of species, we prevent that potential variety is lost to the study. In this article, we seek to answer i.) how can we study consumer preferences in a multi-species environment with a non-trait-based aggregation approach? ii.) Do consumers regard species as closer substitutes when species are biologically/ functionally similar? In other words, does it make sense to aggregate according to biological criteria? iii.) Is fish consumers’ willingness to substitute limited? To answer these questions, we use a unique species-specific catch and price panel from Senegal. The relevance of local fish supply for Senegalese food security is underlined in Lancker et al. (2019a, 2019b). Senegal is of particular interest, as trade is very limited, and variety on consumers’ plates is determined by the local bio-diversity. While variety preferences are crucial in trade contexts, a case study with limited trade facilitates the analysis of variety preferences. The paper empirically evaluates revealed preferences from willingness to pay for direct use values expressed through market prices in the face of short run exogenous supply. In a first step, we use cointegration analysis and aggregation theorems by Hicks (1936) and Lewbel (1996) to aggregate 28 species into eight groups of species, where consumers find species within groups highly substitutable. Subsequently, we use a direct quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS), developed by Banks et al. (1997), to estimate substitution elasticities between these groups for the representative consumer. This approach allows us to assess to what extent consumers are willing to substitute, and to bring additional and valuable evidence for Africa to the table. We discuss policy implications and show how our results can be used to understand resilience and the cost of stock restoration. The article is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the relevant theoretical and empirical literature background. Section 3 provides an overview of the case study and the data used in this article. Section 4 presents our empirical approach. The results are presented in Sect.  5, followed by a discussion in Sect. 6 and a conclusion.",1

Evidence from British Columbia,September 2022,Felix Pretis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Mitigation of future climate change requires stringent curtailment of CO2 emissions and carbon taxes have emerged as a tool-of-choice in numerous policy proposals (including the EU Green Deal) to implement these reductions (Carattini et al. 2019). Despite emission-reductions being their primary aim, few of the existing carbon taxes have been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing emissions at observed tax rates. Existing studies that do look at the tax impact of emissions predominantly focus on single sector emissions (such as transportation) rather than assessing the aggregate impact. However, the impact on aggregate emissions is an important metric since anthropogenic climate change is driven by cumulative CO2 emissions, mitigation of which requires aggregate reductions. Here I assess the effectiveness of a carbon tax in reducing emissions by studying the impacts of the introduction of the first major carbon tax in North America: the carbon tax in British Columbia (BC), Canada introduced in 2008. The tax has been widely hailed as a success—both in popular perception as well as in its impact on consumer demand for fossil fuels, natural gas, and lack of impact on economic output (Murray and Rivers 2015). Nevertheless, no formal empirical impact estimates assess whether the tax has been measurably effective in reducing aggregate CO2 emissions since its introduction. Existing studies that find large effects of carbon taxes in other countries tend to be overly optimistic in their assessment by focusing on individual sectors alone. Unlike other carbon taxes, such as the Swedish tax which predominantly affects transportation (and appears to have led to significant transport emission reductions—see Andersson 2019), the BC carbon tax lends itself to an assessment of the impact of the introduction of a carbon tax on aggregate emissions due to its broad coverage including roughly 70% of greenhouse gas emissions (Murray and Rivers 2015) with comparatively few exemptions.Footnote 1 I study the emission response to the introduction of a carbon tax using two established approaches based on econometric policy analysis and then introduce a new econometric method to detect unknown interventions based on the detection of structural breaks. First, I assess the impact of the tax by imposing the tax as a known policy intervention in a panel difference-in-differences specification using province-level aggregated data accounting for the small number of treated units using randomisation inference, as well by using spatially-gridded emissions at a 1-degree spatial resolution. Second, I study the impacts of the introduction of the tax using synthetic control methods. Third, due to the myriad of potential interventions affecting CO2 emissions, I propose a new econometric approach that agnostically detects treatment interventions (such as the introduction of the carbon tax) based on the detection of breaks using machine learning in panel fixed effects difference-in differences models. Following the maximFootnote 2 that when the title is a question, the answer is `no’, I find that the introduction of a carbon tax is imprecisely estimated and has not ‘yet’ had a large and statistically significant impact on aggregate CO2 emissions. The qualifier ‘yet’ is justified because the tax has led to some significant sector-specific emission reductions. In particular, the tax is associated with an estimated long-run 19% decrease in transportation-related emissions including personal vehicle traffic (when using difference-in-differences), and an average reduction of 5% when using synthetic control. I estimate the (short-run) semi-elasticity of transportation emissions with respect to the carbon tax rate as roughly a 0.2% reduction in emissions per dollar increase in the carbon tax rate, with a long-run estimate of 0.9% per dollar (albeit not accounting for introduction effects). The semi-elasticity of aggregate emissions, however, cannot be accurately estimated due to the large uncertainty around the point estimate. The absence of a statistically-significant effect on aggregate emissions can be reconciled with sector-specific reductions by the fact that some sectors (such as stationary combustion including manufacturing and heat production) in the taxed regions saw a (statistically insignificant) rise in emissions relative to control regions. The identifying assumption needed in the present analysis is that there was no concurrent shock to the carbon tax that affected BC emissions relative to the control provinces conditional on the control variables—naturally it will never be possible to obtain perfect identification of the impact of carbon taxes on a large (country or province level) scale. Though I would argue that the absence of perfect identification should not prohibitFootnote 3 the study of carbon pricing given its importance and prevalence as a policy tool to mitigate climate change. While perhaps a political surprise at the time, the carbon tax was not randomly assigned to the province of BC. However, if the introduction of a tax already reflects a higher willingness to reduce carbon emissions in the province, then policy-evaluation estimates yield an upward-biased estimate of the magnitude of the tax impact on emissions. Further, the results are robust to varying specifications of the control group. Notably, the absence of a statistically significant effect of the introduction of the carbon tax on aggregate emissions does not imply there has been no effect. This particularly applies to the BC carbon tax for which only few years of data post-tax introduction exist, raising concerns about statistical power to detect an effect (though comparable studies such as Andersson 2019 rely on similarly short samples). However, given the praise carbon taxes have received in both literature and policy, the absence of a statistically detectable effect in aggregate emissions is sobering. Any tax-induced aggregate emission reductions do not appear to be detectable in the data and thus are far from climate policy targeting net-zero emissions by mid-century. Regardless of whether the absence of a statistically-significant reduction stems from a short sample, low tax rate, or incomplete coverage, the resulting implication for climate change is the same—there has not been a substantial detectable change in aggregate emissions in response to the introduction of this tax. Conventional difference-in-differences and synthetic control approaches test whether the tax (or comparable policy) was effective in reducing emissions, but do not tell us whether other (previously unknown) interventions had significant effects. I therefore introduce a break-detection approach using machine learning in fixed effects panel estimation that allows for the detection of treated units and treatment dates without prior knowledge of their occurrence. Break detection is commonly applied in time series econometrics to detect policy interventions (and recently also in regression discontinuity designs—see Porter and Yu 2015), however, time series applications generally do not consider control groups making it difficult to identify causal effects. The proposed approach here presents an agnostic way of identifying shocks that affected individual units in the panel while using untreated units as control. Intuitively, a standard difference-in-difference or synthetic control estimator will tell us whether a particular intervention mattered, while the proposed approach here tells us which—previously unknown—interventions were statistically significant and when they occurred. Specifically, I propose to use indicator saturation methods (Castle et al. 2015) to detect breaks in individual fixed effects in panel, which correspond to treatment interaction dummy variables. When applied to CO2 emissions, the introduction of the BC carbon tax is detected without prior knowledge as a structural break in transportation emissions, however, neither the tax nor carbon pricing in other provinces is detected in aggregate emissions. Instead, break detection identifies sudden changes in aggregate emissions in untaxed provinces which can be attributed to the closure of emission-intense industries as well as efficiency improvements in electricity-generation. Overall, the absence of a tax effect on aggregate emissions and the lack of breaks coinciding with carbon-pricing policy interventions suggests that existing carbon prices are set too low to achieve significant aggregate emission reductions in the (albeit short) time frame since their introduction, consistent with evidence from cross-country carbon pricing and policy studies (see e.g. Metcalf and Stock 2020; Rafaty et al. 2020; Eskander and Fankhauser 2020) At current rates, a carbon tax alone is likely insufficient in inducing substantial aggregate emission reductions and must be supplemented with complementary technology-pushing policies, ideally targeting sensitive interventions points (Farmer et al. 2019). British Columbia introduced a carbon tax on CO2 emissions in 2008 at $10 CAD per tonne emitted. While not randomly assigned, the introduction was unexpected as the government had not campaigned on the introduction of a carbon tax. Additionally, the tax was introduced rapidly, first proposed in February 2008 and implemented by July. The tax rate was initially set to rise $5 CAD per year, this increase occurred until 2012, from when onwards it remained at 30$ until 2018 when it was raised again to $35 CAD per tonne of CO2 emitted. The tax is designed to be revenue-neutral, making it a popular scheme with the public (Harrison and Peet 2012), with tax revenue returned to the public through tax credits and a dividend. BC was the only province in Canada operating under its own carbon tax scheme, though the Canadian government introduced a federal carbon tax in 2019 (which falls outside of the sample under analysis here), and two other provinces have implemented major formal measures to curb emissions that fall within the sample available hereFootnote 4: Alberta uses a carbon price for industrial emitters above an emissions threshold (introduced in 2007), and Quebec operates under a cap and trade system (introduced in 2013 which appears to have resulted in some emission reductions when measured at the plant level, see Hanoteau and Talbot 2019). These alternative schemes raise some questions on the optimal choice of control groups. Since the carbon pricing policies in Alberta and Quebec are not of the form of a carbon tax, the main results presented here therefore include Alberta and Quebec in the control sample. Robustness checks omitting these provinces from the control group show that the results are unaffected by the inclusion of these two regions. Analyses of the effectiveness of carbon taxes and prices have predominantly concentrated on metrics other than CO2 emissions themselves. Where studies have assessed the impact on emissions, they primarily concentrate on specific sub-sectors. Green (2021) provides a comprehensive meta analysis of carbon pricing on emissions, finding mixed evidence of their effectiveness. Metcalf and Stock (2020) study the effects of carbon pricing in the European Union finding marginal reductions in emissions. Rafaty et al. (2020) assess the effect of carbon prices (rather than the introduction of a tax) on emissions in a sample of OECD countries, finding that while carbon pricing reduced emissions growth, current carbon prices are too low to show substantial emission reductions. This matches the results obtained by Lin and Li (2011) who study the introduction of a carbon tax in countries in Northern Europe finding significant impacts on per capita growth in emission reductions in only a small subset of countries, and the findings by Best et al. (2020) who find some emission reduction in response to carbon pricing. Assessing a single sector on a local level, Davis and Kilian (2011) study the effects of US gasoline taxes on carbon emissions finding a significant tax effect on vehicle emissions. This effect of a significant reduction in transportation emissions is also identified by Andersson (2019) who studies the introduction of a carbon tax in Sweden using synthetic controls but does not consider aggregate emissions due to the many exemptions in emission-intense sectors. Murray and Rivers (2015) provide an early review of the literature on the general impacts of the BC carbon tax, though the empirical papers surveyed therein do not formally test the effect of the tax on emissions. There exist, however, a range of papers studying the impacts on employment and fuel demand. Xiang and Lawley (2018) and Gulati and Gholami (2015) find significant reductions in residential and commercial natural gas demand following the introduction of the tax. Rivers and Schaufele (2015) as well as Lawley and Thivierge (2016) and Antweiler and Gulati (2016) show that the carbon tax lead to a reduction in gasoline demand. Gittens (2018) provides evidence of the channel of this effect through incomplete pass-through of the tax. Saberian (2018) studies unintended consequences of the carbon tax, finding that the introduction of the tax led consumers to substitute to diesel cars thus increasing local pollution. Yip (2018) investigates the impact on labour markets and finds a small increase in unemployment of less-educated workers. Yamazaki (2017) assesses the employment impacts, finding a positive effect, though Azevedo et al. (2018) also assess the employment impact of the tax finding heterogeneous responses across industries, but no effect on aggregate employment. These opposite effects can be reconciled by concerns about the parallel trend assumptions in Yamazaki (2017) raised by Azevedo et al. (2018). Comparing econometric estimates to those of a general equilibrium model Carbone et al. (2019) find that employment shifted from more carbon-intense to less carbon-intense sectors.Footnote 5 An early report around the time of the introduction of the tax predicted a 5% reduction in aggregate emissions using numerical simulations (BC 2008) though the accuracy of this prediction has not been assessed. Elgie and McCLay (2013) use data up until 2011 to compute means and construct the non-parametric difference-in-differences without reporting standard errors. Their comparison finds a 9% reduction in per capita emissions following the introduction of the tax, however, due to the lack of standard errors these results do not provide a formal test. Ahmadi and Yamazaki (2020) study the emission impacts of the BC carbon tax in the manufacturing sector at a plant level, finding marginal emission reductions in response to the tax. The authors also raise concerns about analysing the BC carbon tax using differences-in differences since the introduction of the carbon tax coincides with the Great Recession. The concern is valid when not accounting for underlying economic conditions, however, when controlling for changes in GDP—as implemented here and in the wider literature (see Metcalf 2019; Lin and Li, 2011; Rafaty et al. 2020), this is less of a concern, Shortly after the first release of the present paper, Metcalf (2019) also reported results of the tax impacts on the BC carbon tax using difference-in-differences, finding (marginally) significant aggregate emission reductions. However, these apparent reductions are not robust to the inclusion of dynamics in the model, choosing a subset of the available years, or controlling for the small number of individuals in the panel. A further discussion contrasting the results is provided in Sect. 3.1.2. The present paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, using difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods I show that there is little evidence of aggregate reductions in CO2 emissions in response to the introduction of a carbon tax. These results are robust to the choice of the control group, the specification of the standard errors, randomisation inference, using spatially-gridded or province level data, accounting for biases in dynamic panel estimates, or the use of synthetic control methods to address concerns on non-parallel trends. Second, I show that despite the lack of an aggregate effect, there are heterogeneous effects across sectors with some (such as transportation) exhibiting significant large reduction in emissions consistent with existing evidence on carbon taxes. In addition, I also provide sector-level estimates of the emission elasticities with respect to tax rate. Third, I introduce an econometric break-detection method to assess the presence of treatment interventions, allowing for an agnostic approach to discover when interventions took place, and who was affected by these interventions. This identifies the closure of emission-intense mills combined with efficiency-improvements in electricity generation as likely effective measures in reducing emissions in three provinces.",12

Over the last decades, the number of weather- and climate-related events (i.e., drought, extreme temperature, floods, landslides and wildfires) has increased significantly. For instance, as a consequence of global warming, over the period 1990–2019, the world has recorded an average annual increase of 26% and 36% in the number of extreme temperatures and wildfires, respectively. Due to increasing annual precipitation levels, also the number of floods and landslides has strongly increased over the same period (i.e., 6% and 20%, respectively).Footnote 1 On the one hand, climate-related events had a devastating impact in terms of human life losses. On the other hand, they have also been responsible for a severe destruction of physical capital with non-negligible economic costs. For instance, over the period 1990–2017, global disaster losses from weather- and climate-related events accounted for 0.22% of global GDP (Pielke 2019). But even more interestingly, over this period weather-related losses (measured in constant 2017 U$) increased by 74%. As of today, there are thus no doubts that climate change has affected the weather dynamics and climate systems of many regions around the world. However, the effects of climate change are not homogeneous across countries/regions (see, among others, Dell et al. 2012; Brenner and Lee 2014; Colacito et al. 2019). For instance, in continental regions, climate change has led to an increase in heat extremes, a decrease in summer precipitation and an increasing risk of river floods and forest fires. In coastal zones and regional seas, climate change has been responsible for the rise in sea levels, the increase in sea surface temperatures, the increase in ocean acidity, the northward migration of marine species and the decrease in opportunities for fisheries. As a consequence of climate change, in the Atlantic region instead, more frequent heavy precipitations, rises in river flow, increasing risk of river and coastal flooding, increasing damage risk from winter storms and a decrease in energy demand for heating have been observed. Overall, in terms of economic costs, existing empirical findings have shown that low-income countries tend to be more vulnerable than high-income countries to climate change (see, among others, Dell et al. 2012). Numbers at the global level indicate the presence of severe adverse economic effects induced by climate change. Nevertheless, climate change may come with both bad and good news depending on the region/country. The net effect of climate change in each region/country depends of course on many factors. Due to its global coverage, a large part of the literature on the economic effects of climate change has focused on the potential impact of global warming on world GDP. Estimates on potential losses on GDP due to higher global temperature levels have been obtained by means of the so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). However, IAMs have been largely criticized, in particular for being distant from empirically observed temperature and macroeconomic dynamics (see, among others, Pindyck 2013; Revesz et al. 2014; Donadelli et al. 2017). A first attempt to estimate the true economic effects of climate change is provided by Dell et al. (2012) who use countries’ historical temperature fluctuations to identify their effects on aggregate economic outcomes (i.e., output level and output growth). Dell et al. (2012) find that rising temperature levels have significant adverse effects on economic growth only in poor countries.Footnote 2 In the spirit of Dell et al. (2012), using a panel of 105 countries, Brenner and Lee (2014) examine whether temperature and precipitation level shifts are associated with decreases in economic growth. They find negative effects of rising temperatures on economic growth in warm and developed countries whereas increases in precipitation generate positive effects on growth, especially in developed countries with low average precipitation. Focusing on the US, Colacito et al. (2019) document a decrease in output and productivity growth following an increase in average summer temperature, pointing out the importance of seasonal effects. Moreover, they show that the negative effect of rising summer temperatures on output growth is stronger for the southern region.Footnote 3 Zhao et al. (2018) argue that the effects of annual temperature on productivity can also vary greatly across space within countries. They revisit the temperature-economic growth relationship using global sub-national short panel data and show that climate adverse effects can vary at the regional level. Lanzafame (2014) re-examine the effects of temperature and rainfall on economic growth in Africa. A significant evidence of short- and long-run relations between temperature and economic growth is found. Rainfall, however, is found to have only marginal effects on economic growth. While many studies have reported associations between short-term (or long-term) temperature changes and economic growth, evidence on the relationship between within-year temperature variability (i.e., temperature volatility) and macroeconomic aggregates is scarce.Footnote 4 Some studies, however, indicate that variability in climate change phenomena (e.g., temperature and precipitation levels) may also have significant adverse effects on economic development. Wheeler et al. (2000) provide evidence of the importance of variability in temperature, independent of any substantial changes in mean seasonal temperature, for the yield of annual crops. For instance, Dee et al. (2016) find that within-year temperature variability has a negative impact on regional fisheries yields. In this paper, we account for this important feature of climate change and examine the macroeconomic impact of variability in temperature levels. In particular, we capture variability in temperature levels around the world by building a measure of intra-annual temperature volatility for a panel of 114 countries. We then investigate the impact of unexpected changes in temperature variability on productivity growth in five different “macro-regions”, i.e., (1) Africa, (2) Asia, (3) Europe, (4) North America and (v) South America. Using standard Panel VAR models, we provide novel evidence on the impact of intra-annual variability in temperature levels on the macroeconomy. Surprisingly, we find that an intra-annual temperature volatility shock produces adverse effects on aggregate productivity in more developed regions (i.e., Europe and North America). In contrast, there are no significant evidence of temperature variability affecting productivity growth in South America and Africa. Unexpected changes in intra-annual temperature volatility come instead with good news in Asia. We perform additional empirical tests and find the following: (1) tropical and not-tropical regions are both adversely affected by intra-annual temperature volatility shocks, (2) inter-annual temperature volatility (captured by the standard deviation computed using a rolling window of 10 years of average annual temperature level data for each country) affects regions around the world differently leading to a drop (rise) in aggregated productivity in North America and South America (Africa, Asia and Europe), (3) stronger inter-annual temperature variability in the winter and summer seasons is detrimental for productivity both in Europe and North America whereas spring and fall inter-annual temperature variability boosts European productivity and (4) a standard fixed effects panel regression confirm productivity in Europe and North America to be negatively affected by intra-annual temperature volatility shocks.Footnote 5 To gain more quantitative insights on the short- and long-term implications of climate change variability on growth and welfare, we provide a general equilibrium model that accounts for the adverse effects of temperature volatility on aggregate productivity and output growth, as observed in Europe and North America. In the model, which accounts for the dynamics of both macroeconomic aggregates and asset prices, the implied drop in aggregate productivity observed in Europe (North America) generates losses in lifetime utility of 2.9% (1.0%). In sum, the contribution of this study is threefold. First, we build a novel proxy of climate change variability (i.e., intra-annual temperature volatility) for 114 countries. Second, we provide novel insights on the interplay between climate change variability and economic growth. Importantly, we show that intra-annual temperature volatility shocks reduce productivity growth in rich economies while having only mild effects in developing/poor economies. Broadly, our evidence seem to be at odd with existing empirical findings on the implications of global warming indicating that rising temperature levels tend to reduce economic growth in poor countries (Mendelsohn et al. 2006; Dell et al. 2012). Third, we provide a suitable theoretical framework to quantify the welfare costs induced by the drops in aggregate productivity generated by a stronger temperature variability in Europe and North America. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Sect. 2, we present a brief overview of the literature, in Sect. 3, we empirically investigate the importance of rising temperature variability, in Sect. 4 we set up a model and quantify the welfare costs of increasing temperature variability. Finally, Sect. 5 offers some concluding remarks.",9

Globally, about 40% of CO\(_2\) emissions from fuel combustion can be attributed to electricity and heat production (International 2018). The demand for electricity is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades due to population and economic growth and the increasing electrification (Williams et al. 2012) in emissions-intensive sectors such as transportation. In addition, developing environmentally-friendly hydrogen-based substitutes for fossil fuels based on power-to-X technologies, which could also help to decarbonize industry and offer alternative low-carbon pathways for the transport sector, require green electricity. Renewable energy (RE) from wind and solar is at the core of a transformation towards green electricity (Rogelj et al. 2018). Due to the importance of RE for the decarbonization of the economy, extensive renewable support schemes have been implemented all over the world. In its Renewable Energy Directive (European 2009) the European Union implemented a target of 20% of total energy demand to be covered by RE sources. Subsequently, the target was increased to 32% for the year 2030 (European 2018) with the possible further increase after a review in 2023. RE support is, however, not addressed with a uniform regulation at the European level. Each member state is responsible for implementing the target, which leads to various, country-specific RE support schemes mostly in form of RE premiums providing a fixed income for energy produced by RE. Carbon-free energy from such sources is highly intermittent and the quality and distribution of wind and solar resources differ largely across time and space. This underlying resource heterogeneity has been found to create heterogeneous market and environmental values of 1 MWh produced from wind compared to 1 MWh from solar (Fell and Linn 2013; Wibulpolprasert 2016; Abrell et al. 2019; Abrell et al. 2019). A cost-effective integration of large amounts of intermittent RE thus has to create sufficient flexibility in the market system to exploit these heterogeneous valuations. Hourly profiles of electricity demand and electricity generation from wind and solar over an average day in Europe. Averages for each hour of the day in 2017. Shaded areas indicate 95 percent CI. Sources: (ENTSO-E 2017) and (ENTSO-E 2017) This paper examines how enhancing the flexibility along key dimensions of future electricity markets affects the economic costs and CO\(_2\) emissions of integrating large shares of highly volatile renewable energy. We develop a model of interconnected electricity markets which captures the heterogeneity in time, technology, natural resource availability, within-market (supply and investment) decisions, and cross-market electricity trade. We take the model to the data, using the case of Europe’s system of interconnected electricity markets, and incorporate important model and empirical detail for studying the large-scale integration of RE in (future) electricity markets.Footnote 1 Our empirical-quantitative framework resolves wholesale electricity markets at the hourly level to account for seasonal and intra-day variation of RE sources and demand, country-specific potentials for RE resources, non-renewable production capacities, and capacities for electricity trade across time (energy storage) and across space (as bound by available cross-border transmission infrastructure). The temporal and spatial resolution of our empirical-quantitative framework enables us to analyze the economic value of increased temporal flexibility through energy storage and increased spatial flexibility through cross-market trade. Another important flexibility mechanism pertains to the type of RE support policy: we investigate how the economic cost of RE integration depends on whether the EU-wide renewable targets for electricity are implemented by uncoordinated policy measures at the national level (national RE quotas) or through a system of tradable RE quotas at the European level which involves implicit coordination and more flexibility through a market-based regulatory approach.

Country codes are defined in Table 6 Figure 1 illustrates the potential of enhancing ”temporal flexibility”: neither production from wind, nor solar generation follows demand closely over the course of a typical day; even though a combined use of both technologies will fare better, there remains the need to shift solar production from daytime to nighttime and wind energy from off-peak to peak hours. Trade between countries enables a pooling of natural resources and different availability profiles for RE, conventional generation capacities, and also demand over larger distances (von der Fehr and Sandsbraten , 1997; Antweiler , 2016). We refer to this as ”spatial flexibility”. Figure 2 visualizes the time-correlations and thus geographical variations in demand and availability of RE generation in Europe. We see high correlations between demand patterns and solar generation patterns in Fig. 2a and d, already indicating that the potential of solar energy to supply flexibility to a European system with largely similar demand structures in all countries is limited. The correlations between wind and solar and wind and wind in Fig. 2f and e are much lower. A combination of both technologies and increased capacities for trade between distant regions with differing wind patterns may hence have the potential to significantly mitigate the supply-demand mismatch due to high shares of RE. At the same time, however, reaping benefits from spatial flexibility also critically depends on the natural resource quality of the various regions and their investment cost. Figure 3 takes a look at the heterogeneous RE resource quality among European countries, providing a scatter plot of the marginal investment costs of expanding RE generation against the maximum RE generation potential. The large variation in resource quality points to potential gains from trade through enhancing spatial flexibility. Importantly, the market and system perspective of our model allows us to study the interaction between different channels of flexibility. Our analysis can thus shed light on which combination of flexibility is most effective in lowering economic costs and CO\(_2\) emissions through a large-scale integration of RE. RE resource quality by European country: marginal investment costs of expanding RE generation and maximum RE generation potential. Maximum generation potential refers to maximum attainable quantity of generation if all available and suitable locations are used (Tröndle et al. 2019, 2019). Marginal investment cost for an incremental MWh of generation added beyond the level of installed capacity in 2017 (see Sect. 3 for detail). Country codes are defined in Table 6 We measure the economic value of flexibility by the induced net economic benefits related to changes in the market surplus.Footnote 2 To measure the net benefits in each region, we account for the gains from cross-market trade and energy storage, congestion rents on scarce cross-border transmission capacity, income from trade in RE permits, and generation and investment cost at the regional level. Importantly, this enables us to not only examine the value or economic benefits of added flexibility at the aggregate (system or EU level) but also to explore the distribution of gains and losses at the country level.Footnote 3 Our main findings are as follows. First, the potential economic benefits from adding flexibility across space and time are considerable. Relative to a case which reflects existing storage and transmission capacities, allowing for “unlimited” flexibility along these two dimensions (i.e., relaxing the constraints for energy storage and cross-border electricity transmission) yields cost savings of 8.6% for integrating wind and solar when they account for very high shares of electricity generation in Europe.Footnote 4 We find that regulatory flexibility is key to further reduce the costs of renewable energy integration. Switching from national RE quotas to a system of EU-wide tradable quota increases the cost savings to 13.8%. At the same time, regulatory flexibility on its own has a limited value (cost savings of 2.5%) as physical obstacles in the form of restricted energy storage and transmission capacities prevent substantial savings through reduced curtailment of RE generation. The value of flexibility through a regulatory channel is particularly important in view of the fact that adding energy storage and transmission capacity involves significant costs that are likely to far exceed the administrative costs associated with regulation. Second, the combination of several flexibility channels is always better than one but the benefits are not simply additive. We find that combining flexibility across space and the regulatory dimension reaps most of the maximum potential gains. The value of flexibility across time (through energy storage) alone is quite limited, in particular when storage losses are not negligible. Given a large and geographically diverse European electricity market, our analysis suggests that geographical flexibility is probably better suited to equalize marginal investment and generation costs across the region. Third, the new renewable technologies, wind and solar, interact differently with the flexibility channels. Regardless of geographical position, solar energy is highly concentrated around noon and null during the night. Hence, high shares of solar energy are only favorable when storage capacity is high. Wind generation patterns are more diverse in different parts of Europe and thus wind has an advantage over solar when cross-border transmission capacity is relaxed, and especially when a flexible regulatory framework enables an efficient use of geographical advantages for RE resource-rich countries and for resource-poor countries through the purchase of RE permits. Fourth, the climate value (i.e., CO\(_2\) emissions effect) of integrating a given share of intermittent renewables varies considerably, depending on how flexible the market system is. For our central case of 70% of electricity generation from wind and solar, the CO\(_2\) emissions impact ranges from -51.2% to +6.2% when compared to the case which reflects existing storage and transmission capacities.Footnote 5 Emissions actually increase when only regulatory flexibility is added. The intuition is that countries with high marginal investment cost for RE will buy tradable green permits from other countries and increase production from cheap but dirty fossil capacity compared to the case when RE targets in each country have to be met separately. Increased storage capacity favors base load producers in each country and disadvantages peak load producers. As a consequence, there is a shift in production to each country’s low-cost technologies. Since many European countries have coal or nuclear energy as cheap base load technologies, the impact on emissions from storage may either be positive or negative in a given country. The effect of unconstrained trade capacity is different in that it creates a single supply curve for the whole model region and in such a scenario the absolutely cheapest technologies are dispatched first rather than the relatively cheapest production capacity in each country. This favors nuclear and hydro installations over coal and causes larger emissions reductions compared to the scenarios with unconstrained storage. Overall, our analysis clearly suggests that the decarbonization of the energy sector should not only be based on pushing wind and solar energy into the domestic market by increasing their cost competitiveness compared to fossil-based technologies, but that an effective integration of intermittent RE sources through additional market flexibility is also crucial. Finally, we find that the gains from increased flexibility are unevenly distributed, with some countries being even worse off. This is mainly due to the diverse RE potentials and existing conventional capacity mixes which translate into different potentials for cost savings. This suggests that the large-scale integration of intermittent renewables in a highly integrated transnational electricity system may require compensating measures at the European level to overcome political hurdles. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to offer an analysis of this question, it is nevertheless important to be aware that designing a more efficient system on an aggregated level does not necessarily guarantee that there are only (country) winners. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to combine the three flexibility channels available for the market integration of RE generation in a single framework. It is connected to several strands of the literature which are mostly focusing on one flexibility channel. First, there is an ongoing debate on the necessary investments into storage to accommodate new RE generation. Sinn (2017) argues that very high shares of RE generation require prohibitively high investments into storage capacity because otherwise large percentages of possible RE generation would have to be curtailed. In contrast to that, Zerrahn et al. (2018) show that already allowing for a small amount of curtailment leads to a large saving in investment cost for storage facilities. A second strand of the literature concentrates on the interaction of storage capacity with existing conventional and new renewable technologies. Crampes and Moreaux (2010) analyze the interaction of pumped hydro storage with conventional fossil generation technologies and derive how to optimally use the technologies together without considering investment into new RE capacity. Linn and Shih (2016) employ a numerical model of the Texas ERCOT region to analyze how new storage capacities interact with current electricity systems featuring emissions intensive generation from coal, cleaner electricity production from gas, and zero emissions electricity from wind and solar energy. They lay a focus on the resulting total carbon emissions. Similarly, Carson and Novan (2013) investigate emissions effects with data from the ERCOT region using a theoretical model and empirical methods and in addition they study the effects of new storage capacity on peak and off-peak producers. The papers in these two strands of the literature analyze temporal flexibility through storage and we contribute by adding the interaction with regulatory and spatial flexibility. Third, there is an emerging literature on regulatory design in electricity markets with storage. Helm and Mier (2018) focus on the emissions impacts of subsidies for storage. Abrell et al. (2019) show that costly curtailment of RE generation can be reduced by tailoring the design of the regulatory regime to achieve a better matching between renewable supply and demand patterns. Whereas these papers analyze increasing temporal and also regulatory flexibility, we contribute by extending the range of the analysis by adding spatial flexibility by means of electricity trade. Fourth, spatial flexibility of electricity generation is discussed in the literature about international electricity trade. von der Fehr and Sandsbraten (1997) analyze the impact of increasing electricity trade in Nordic countries. Antweiler (2016) develops a theory of international trade in a homogeneous commodity, electricity, and shows how two-way trade can emerge because of temporal differences in load patterns. Abrell and Rausch (2016) investigate a multi-sector general equilibrium model with a detailed representation of the European electricity sector to assess the impact of higher shares of renewables on gains from trade and CO\(_2\) emissions. This strand of the literature analyzes spatial flexibility of electricity generation but does not assess the effect of temporal flexibility by means of storage. Fifth, we also make a connection to a growing literature investigating the consequences of the fundamental heterogeneity of RE technologies with respect to availability patterns. Abrell et al. (2019) point out that the environmental value and market value of different renewables may vary and suggest that differentiating subsidies by technology might improve the environmental impact of RE policies, while Fell and Linn (2013) and Wibulpolprasert (2016) analyze how heterogeneity in renewable resource availability affects the cost-effectiveness of various abatement policies. Abrell et al. (2019) use an empirical approach to conduct an ex-post evaluation of market values and environmental values of RE sources. These studies focus on lessons for regulatory design emerging from the heterogeneity of renewable production profiles. In this way, they introduce regulatory flexibility. However, these papers do not assess the flexibility of the regulatory regime across regions and its relation to international trade and storage facilities. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the conceptual model. Section 3 describes the data and our empirical strategy to bring the model to the data. Section 4 presents and discusses the main results from our computational analyses of the economic and environmental value of temporal, spatial, and regulatory flexibility in the European electricity market. Section 5 concludes.",

Because of the resulting contribution to global warming, the increase in CO\(_2\) shall be mitigated. Structural change, i.e., the shift in an economy’s composition across all sectors,Footnote 1 can increase or decrease CO\(_2\) emissions. Whereas the effects of international trade on productivity gains, economic growth and international technology spillovers (including energy- and CO\(_2\)-saving technologies) have been extensively researched,Footnote 2 the connection of intersectoral structural change among trading partners, i.e., structural convergence or divergence, and the resulting impact on CO\(_2\) emissions remain unknown. Better knowledge of this mechanism and its effects would, however, be helpful for anticipating the international implications of national policies, such as border carbon adjustments: can policy-induced sectoral shifts be expected to spill over to trading partners within a sufficiently large time horizon? Empirically, intersectoral structural change has significantly contributed to changes in energy use and CO\(_2\) emissions.Footnote 3 Econometric evidence of the effects of international trade on structural change, in general, seems to be scarce, and with respect to CO\(_2\) emissions, in particular, seems to be missing. Some studies have examined the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and European market integration in the convergence of European countries: in a working paper, Barrios et al. (2002) find convergence of per capita income and industry sector structure in the European Union supported by inward FDI; based on sectoral indices and descriptive statistics of exports, structural similarity and structural change, Crespo and Fontoura (2007) find similar results. Teignier (2018)’s model simulations indicate that trade in agricultural goods reduced agricultural employment of the 19th century Great Britain by 40% and the 20th century South Korea by 10%. Against this background, our article tries to fill this research gap by exploring the nexus between trade in intermediate goods and structural convergence from an econometric point of view. It contributes to the extant literature by conceptually describing the economic mechanisms of structural change driven by trade, by introducing a new econometric model with a new measure of structural change with (North-South) con-/divergence, by studying sectoral CO\(_2\) emissions (in addition to sectoral outputs) and by exploiting the newest version of the large bilateral, bisectoral dataset of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD).Footnote 4 According to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, during the course of economic development, the sectoral structure of an economy shifts from agriculture toward (heavy) industries, leading to higher emissions. It then shifts further toward advanced knowledge-based industries and services, leading to lower emissions. Consequently, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are expected to exhibit sectoral structures that create ceteris paribus lower economy-wide CO\(_2\) emissions than those of emerging countries at medium stages of development. To examine this economic transition process, we first deploy a North-South setup with OECD and emerging countries and then extend it to all countries covered by the WIOD. Our article particularly addresses the open question of whether (intermediate goods) exports from an (advanced) economy to another (emerging) economy make these two economies more similar or more different with regard to their sectoral structures and related CO\(_2\) emissions. We denote these two alternatives as structural convergence and structural divergence. Assuming that both economies continue their economic growth process and that emerging economies catch up with industrialized countries, convergence decreases average CO\(_2\) emissions across sectors, whereas divergence increases them. Theoretically, the role of international trade in structural change is ambiguous. On the one hand, according to classical trade theories by Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin, different economies concentrate their production and exports on different sectors, resulting in structural divergence. Additionally, Krugman’s New Economic Geography predicts the agglomeration of economic activities, which supports the emergence of specialization and clustering (Midelfart et al. 2003). Induced and directed technological change (Acemoglu 2002, 2010) may reinforce sectoral heterogeneity across countries. On the other hand, when knowledge or, more specifically, (energy- and CO\(_2\)-saving) technologies, spread across borders, supported by international trade, the use of similar technologies will result in similar productivities across sectors and similar sectoral structures within economies, resulting in structural convergence. Similarly, intensifying interindustry trade supports the emergence of similar sectoral structures across trading partners (Midelfart et al. 2003). Eventually, in the theoretical long-term equilibrium of a fully integrated world economy, the sectoral structures will be equalized. The overview by Herrendorf et al. (2014) (Section 6.6.1 International Trade) reconciles the views of these two camps by arguing that in a country with high productivity growth, the development of the manufacturing sector share exhibits a hump shape, while in a country with low productivity growth, it exhibits a downward-sloping shape (Yi and Zhang 2010). In accordance with the outcome of the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory, this theory implies that structural con- and divergence or hump-shaped developments (Stefanski 2014) are theoretically possible across economies depending on (sectoral) productivity growth and the phase of economic development. Therefore, whether structural con- or divergence dominates, in general, across economies and sectors or, in particular, sectors at specific periods of time is an empirical question that we will answer. Compared with the existing literature, our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study showing econometrically that trade in intermediate goods, in general, promotes structural convergence. This means, intermediate goods, used as production inputs, may embody technologies and knowledge that enhance the specialization of trading partners into similar sectors, not into different sectors as predicted by the traditional trade theories. In addition to measuring sector shares in terms of output values, we measure them in terms of CO\(_2\) emissions as a new approach. Although both measures reflect relative sector sizes, they can, in general, differ. If, for example, the output share of the transportation sector increases, while its emissions intensity strongly decreases, its emissions share can ceteris paribus decrease. Therefore, structural convergence based on CO\(_2\) emissions is an explicit measure for converging sectoral emissions patterns across countries. Based on that, we find indications for structural divergence in terms of the CO\(_2\) intensity of production that began in this millennium. This insight is relevant for policy makers because it points to so-called carbon leakage (from industrialized to emerging economies) which undermines climate policy efforts. Several robustness checks, addressing cross-sectional dependence (Pesaran 2006, 2015, 2021), different time lags, an interaction term and energy shares as the dependent variable confirm our findings. The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 derives the conceptual framework, Sect. 3 describes the data, and Sect. 4 presents the econometric results. Section 5 discusses the results, and Sect. 6 concludes the article. The supplementary online appendix provides further statistics and robustness check results.",

Indicator variables used to measure psychological or sociological constructs enter the model through latent variables, rather than being directly interacted with choice attributes. The HC model can therefore be viewed as a combination of a classical discrete choice model, such as the mixed logit model (MXL, Revelt and Train 1998), with a Multiple Indicators, Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model (Jöreskog and Goldberger 1975). The former links some assumed decision process (e.g., utility maximization) and observed explanatory variables (attributes of alternatives, socio-demographics) with observed choices, whereas the latter identifies latent factors linked with observed indicator variables, for example, answers to attitudinal survey questions. The HC framework has been extensively used over the last decade to better understand the attitudes and psychological factors that drive individuals’ preferences toward non-market goods and policies. In the environmental context, applications include stated preference studies on individuals’ choices regarding coastal water quality improvements, land-use policies, conservation policies, and recycling rules (Hess and Beharry-Borg 2012; Hoyos et al. 2015; Lundhede et al. 2015; Mariel et al. 2015; Bartczak et al. 2016; Czajkowski et al. 2017b; Boyce et al. 2019; Zawojska et al. 2019). The latent factors can represent a wide range of psychological measures, such as attitudes toward chargeable policy, awareness of consequences, outcome uncertainty, risk preferences, social norms, morals, personality, and perceived survey consequentiality. The popularity of the HC model stems from the fact that including indicator variables directly in a choice model is considered methodologically flawed because of the lack of causality, dependence on survey question framing (Ben-Akiva et al. 2002), as well as potential measurement error and endogeneity (Guevara 2015). With regard to endogeneity, the usually acknowledged cause of this issue is that responses to attitudinal questions are likely correlated with other unobserved factors, which, if not accounted for, will end up in the error term of the random utility model (Daly et al. 2012; Hess and Beharry-Borg 2012; Kløjgaard and Hess 2014; Hoyos et al. 2015). It is widely believed that the HC model resolves both issues – measurement error and endogeneity (Daly et al. 2012; Hess et al. 2013; Hess and Stathopoulos 2013; Kløjgaard and Hess 2014; Bello and Abdulai 2015). We show that while HC models do indeed account for measurement error, endogeneity can arise from other sources (e.g., omitted variables, simultaneous determination) and requires explicit accounting for in the specification of the model – something that has not typically been addressed in the applied choice modeling literature. Endogeneity arises when explanatory variables in the model are not independent of the stochastic term, which leads to biased parameter estimates. Incorporating indicator variables directly into the choice model, may lead to the correlation of explanatory variables and the stochastic term, because indicator variables are usually not direct measures of latent constructs but rather their functions (Guevara 2015). Walker et al. (2010) and Vij and Walker (2016) show that measurement error, leading to endogeneity, can be accounted for in a straightforward way by using the HC framework and incorporating measurement errors directly into the measurement equation (see also the equation (4) in Sect. 2.2). Campbell and Sandorf (2020) employ simulations to further investigate the performance of HC models while controlling for different strengths of relationship between latent factors, indicator variables, and choices. They find that if these relationships are weak then the advantage of using HC models is greatly diminished. In some cases, putting indicator variables directly into the choice model works just as well, measurement errors notwithstanding. However, endogeneity of indicator variables can also arise from other sources than measurement error. For example, Ben-Akiva et al. (2002) and Guevara (2015) show that endogeneity and inconsistent estimates in HC models may be caused by the omission of important attitudes or explanatory variables. Guevara and Polanco (2016) discuss the endogeneity of indicator variables caused by missing covariates and simultaneous determination. Chorus and Kroesen (2014) list reasons why attitudes or perceptions can be rendered endogenous (other than indicator variables) and discuss the implications for the practical use of HC models. In what follows we investigate whether the HC framework can address such issues by accounting for correlations between error terms in different parts of the model. For clarity, we use the term endogeneity – in line with the general tenor of the literature – to refer to the impact of factors other than measurement error (such as omitted variables). Previous studies have utilized HC models to address the issue of omitted variables and the endogeneity that arises because of it. The usual example given is the case of the endogenous price of a good when the quality attribute is missing (Palma et al. 2016). The usefulness of the HC framework in such cases was also demonstrated by simulations reported by Vij and Walker (2016). However, the setting studied in this paper is different. In the example above, the price is endogenous, and the HC framework is used to solve the endogeneity by imputing the missing attribute (quality) as a latent factor. The latent factor is nevertheless assumed to be exogenous. In the current paper, we analyze the situation where the latent factor, or the indicators that are used to measure it, are endogenous. We, therefore, address the concerns raised by Chorus and Kroesen (2014). Our focus in this study also differs from Campbell and Sandorf (2020). Rather than evaluating the performance of the HC model with data of varying quality (for example, indicators that are weakly correlated with a latent factor), we assume that the data are well fitted for the application of the HC framework – that is the latent variable strongly affects individuals’ choices, the latent variable is well measured by the indicator variables, and there is sufficient data for reliable estimation. We investigate how HC models are affected by the endogeneity bias under such conditions. Overall, our study contributes to the current literature by analyzing the problem of the endogeneity of indicator variables in HC models. We present a Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate how different types and sources of endogeneity and measurement errors are, or are not, accounted for in a typical HC model and how this affects the results (bias). We show that unless a correlation of the error terms is explicitly accounted for, the HC framework by itself does not solve the problem of the endogeneity of indicator variables (or latent factors) caused by omitted variables, and the resulting estimates are biased. We then propose two methods of accounting for endogeneity in HC models and demonstrate that they successfully recover the true values of the coefficients. We also contribute to the non-market valuation literature that utilizes the HC framework to investigate how certain attitudes or perceptions affect individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a given policy approach. We show that accounting for measurement error and unobserved heterogeneity is important for the estimation of mean WTP. We also confirm the results of previous research indicating that HC models can account for measurement error.Footnote 1 In addition, we demonstrate that identifying the true relationship between latent variables and WTP requires the endogeneity problem to be addressed. Overall, our results are important for applied studies which use HC models to discover how psychological factors such as social norms, consequentiality, and environmental attitudes affect welfare measures and policy support. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the general econometric framework of the hybrid choice model. Section 3 describes the design of our Monte Carlo experiment, the data generating process (DGP), the models we compare, and the methodology of comparisons. Next, the results are presented and interpreted in detail. The last section provides a summary and discussion, acknowledges the limitations of our study, and concludes with recommendations for future research. In addition, the software codes and supplementary materials are available online to make the use of hybrid choice models for empirical studies easier and to facilitate future research.",5

In particular, the benefit of EV adoption depends on the size of charging infrastructure, whereas providers of charging stations will not invest in infrastructure provision when the base of EVs in circulation is small. In the presence of unpriced benefits to consumers (e.g. lower search costs), the private deployment of network infrastructure is likely suboptimal (Farrell and Saloner 1986; Katz and Shapiro 1986; Cabral 2011). In turn, policies supporting the early provision of public charging infrastructure can alleviate a chicken and egg dilemma between EV consumers and charging station providers. In this setting, the objective of this paper is to provide novel evidence about how increments to charging infrastructure affect EV adoption decisions, and study how consumers respond to charger installations at early and developed market stages. We employ data for all 422 Norwegian municipalities from 2010 (the first year of comprehensive charger data availability) to 2017, with quarterly information on EV registrations (both battery-only electric vehicles—BEV—and plug-in hybrid vehicles—PHEV) by make and model, and the number of available charging stations, together with the number of charging points within these. Figure 1a illustrates how registrations of new EVs increased from around 90 in Q2 2010 to around 23,000 in Q4 2017, the latter representing 49% of all new car registrations (OFV 2018), the world’s highest rate of EV use (International Energy Agency 2019). Over the same period, the number of charging stations increased from around 640 in Q2 2010 to 2194 by the end of 2017 (Fig. 1b). Charging points follow a similar trend, rising from around 2,600 to 10,240 over the period. Note that EVs can sometimes be recharged at home, however potential adopters still derive utility from the availability of public charging infrastructure. Particularly, Norwegian geographical specificities make a public charging network important (eg. large distances, cold weather, mountainous terrain—see Springel (2021) for a discussion). This issue is especially important for battery-only EVs (BEVs), but plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can also benefit from public charging stations once they run out of electricity. Electric vehicle registrations and charging stations/points in Norway, 2010–2017 Norway has implemented a range of incentive schemes to promote EVs, including subsidies for charging infrastructure, financial incentives such as exemptions from registration tax and VAT, the free use of toll roads, public parking spaces and bus lanes, and discounted ferry tickets. The Bjerkan et al. (2016) survey, for example, showed that these incentives have varying importance to consumers and differing impacts on uptake, but financial incentives are by far the most critical for purchasing decisions.Footnote 2 For a small subset of the population, however, non-financial incentives, particularly free toll road and bus lane use, were ‘critically important’ for their EV purchase decision. We emphasize that these policies were mostly implemented nationally before 2010 (Norwegian EV Association 2021; Fevang t al. 2020), have limited within-municipality temporal variation, and are controlled for in our estimation strategy. Our objective is to isolate exogenous variation in charging infrastructure and quantify its impact on EV purchase. We use two complementary strategies to identify the impact of charging infrastructure on EV adoption from the emergence of the market in 2010 to a more mature market in 2017. First, we regress the log of new EV registrations on the log of charging stations available in a given municipality-quarter, and thereby estimate the elasticity of EV purchases with respect to incremental charging infrastructure. The primary issue with this analysis, however, is endogeneity in the municipality-level availability of charging infrastructure (Li et al. 2017). In particular, demand for EVs and the availability of charging infrastructure are potentially jointly affected by unobserved factors such as environmental preferences and associated government policies (e.g. subsidies for local charging infrastructure). Moreover, indirect network effects imply a reverse causality problem whereby greater EV registrations lead to more charger installations, for example through higher expected financial returns. To isolate the impact of incremental charging infrastructure on EV adoption, we follow Li et al. (2017) and construct a Bartik (1991) instrument based on the stock of public parking spaces available in each municipality and the nation-wide trend of charger installations.Footnote 3 In this context, identification rests on two assumptions: (i) more abundant parking space isolates plausibly exogenous variation in the opportunity to supply charging infrastructure, and (ii) municipalities with more parking space are more likely to respond to a nation-wide trend in EV adoption.Footnote 4 Importantly, these assumptions are conditional on a set of control variables capturing differential changes in prices and income, among other things, as well as quarter fixed effects (capturing national technology trends and policy incentives for EVs), and municipality-model fixed effects (controlling for time invariant EV attributes and within-municipality preferences, as well as municipality characteristics, such as proximity to workplaces and urban centres, commuting routes, and toll road, bus lane and ferry prevalence). This instrumental variable (IV) approach limits any potential omitted variable bias. Based on this, the first contribution of this paper is to exploit the development of the EV market in Norway to investigate how the pre-existing stock of installed charging stations affects the charger-elasticity of EV demand. We use a set of control function (CF) regressions (Wooldridge 2015) in which residuals from the first stage are included in the second stage, allowing us to estimate flexible polynomial specifications in the size of the charging infrastructure.Footnote 5 Our results show that charger-elasticity estimates increase with the stock of charging stations, which suggests that incremental charger installations are subject to increasing returns from network externalities. We further show that the largest impact of incremental charging infrastructure occurs when there is little to no pre-existing charger network. As discussed in Meunier and Ponssard (2020), this is consistent with declining marginal benefits associated with charging infrastructure as the size of the network grows (e.g. through declining disutility associated with locating and reaching a charging point). From a policy perspective, this suggests that subsidizing early infrastructure provision in small EV markets can mitigate the associated inefficiencies and therefore complement other instruments tackling transport externalities (e.g. a carbon tax). Quantitatively, we estimate that a 10% increase in charging stations causes a rise in EV registrations by around 2.2% at the mean of our sample.Footnote 6 We further provide suggestive evidence that consumers respond differently to the provision of charging points, with a corresponding estimate of 1.2%. A higher elasticity for the provision of stations versus points is consistent with existing empirical evidence documenting a behavioral bias called “range anxiety”, whereby drivers tend to systematically over-estimate their required driving range.Footnote 7 See for example DeShazo et al. (2017) and Dimitropoulos et al. (2016). This behavioral effect magnifies the network externality problem, and suggests that expanding the network of infrastructure with charging stations with a single or few charging point(s) delivers the greatest benefits to consumers. The second empirical strategy is geared towards the role of initial infrastructure provision. We focus on a subset of 64 Norwegian municipalities with a base of zero charging stations in 2010 and for which we observe either just one station being installed (one-station group) or multiple stations installed within a window of 4 consecutive quarters (multi-station group). To quantify the impact of this one-off infrastructure provision on EV registrations, we employ the synthetic control method (SCM—Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al. 2010).Footnote 8 In this approach, a synthetic municipality is constructed by giving weights to all those in a set of potential control units (the donor pool), which we take to be all municipalities that never installed any charging stations over the entire observation period. The weights attributed to each municipality in the donor pool are selected so as to minimize pre-treatment differences in cumulative EV sales between a given treated unit and the synthetic municipality. For this purpose, we implement the ridge-augmented SCM (Ben-Michael et al. 2018), which adds a bias-correction term to the original SCM weights and allows for the use of negative weights in the construction of the synthetic control unit (see also Abadie and Imbens 2011). Building on an absence of difference in EV registrations for pairs of treated and synthetic municipalities during the pre-treatment period, the trajectory for the synthetic municipality can be interpreted as a counterfactual trajectory for EV adoption in the absence of treatment. Consequently, a comparison of the treated municipalities and their respective synthetic municipalities quantifies the impact of initial infrastructure provision on cumulative EV purchases. Overall, our results suggest a positive impact of the first charging stations. One year after the installation the cumulative EV sales in treated municipalities increases on average by 5.4% for one-station group and 8.0% for multi-station group relative to control. The average treatment effect increases with time, and 2 years post-treatment we estimate 21.7 and 46.2% increases in the one-station and multi-station groups respectively. These results confirm large (unpriced) consumer benefits associated with early infrastructure provision, so that policy intervention in nascent markets can significantly contribute to initiate adoption dynamics. These results contribute to a broad literature on indirect network effects and two-sided markets in relation to early technology adoption (see Caillaud and Jullien 2003; Armstrong 2006; Rochet and Tirole 2006). For example, Gandal et al. (2000) studies the adoption of CDs and how this depends on and affects the diffusion of CD player hardware, so that both sides of the market await developments in the other before making a commitment. Rysman (2004) demonstrates a positive network effect in the two-sided Yellow Pages market, and Rochet and Tirole (2002) analyze the interaction between payment card users (consumers) and merchants’ acceptance of such cards. Lee (2013) investigates the feedback between consumer demand for video game hardware and software, and software demand for various hardware platforms, demonstrating the negative impact of incompatibility. In our context, these network effects hinder the effect of policies targeting externalities associated with mobility, and therefore call for a policy intervention. Our work also contributes to a growing literature focusing on the adoption of EVs.Footnote 9 In particular, our work is closely related to Li et al. (2017), who study the early development of the U.S. market for EVs based on 2011 to 2013 data for 353 metropolitical statistical areas (MSA) with significant EV sales. They employ a Bartik-style instrument based on the number of local supermarkets to generate exogenous variation in the provision of charging stations, which also uses an assumption that more abundant parking areas facilitate the installation of EV chargers without affecting the trade-off between EVs and standard vehicles. They report an elasticity of around 0.8, which is significantly larger than our central estimate (0.22). Our results suggest, however, that part of this difference can be attributed to the size of the stock of charging infrastructure in MSAs considered in their analysis: 22.13 in Li et al. (2017), and only 3.09 in our data. Using our polynomial specification, we find that the elasticity corresponding to a stock of stations of 22 in our data is 0.54, which illustrates the importance of studying early infrastructure provision in the design of policies supporting EV adoption. Related evidence focuses on the role of policy incentives for the adoption of EVs. For example, Clinton and Steinberg (2019) uses 2011 to 2015 data for the U.S. to quantify the impact of direct financial incentives in Texas and Massachusetts on EV adoption.Footnote 10 Using both panel data and SCM, they show that subsidies increase adoption, although they suggest that the net welfare effect of direct EV subsidies is negative. Similarly, Springel (2021) uses 2010 to 2015 data for 19 Norwegian counties to study subsidies for EVs and charging stations.Footnote 11 She estimates a structural demand model for EVs, showing that subsidizing charging stations is more efficient than directly subsidizing EVs. Relative to these two studies, we provide a first set of empirical results suggesting that indirect network effects are large when the stock of charging stations is small, which provides novel insights for optimal policy targeting charging infrastructure provision in nascent EV markets (Meunier and Ponssard 2020). Finally, our research is related to the non-monetary and psychological barriers to adoption of new energy technologies demonstrated by Fowlie et al. (2015). Jaffe and Stavins (1994) argue that a lack of uptake of energy efficient technologies is due to factors such as incomplete information and unobserved costs, while Heutel and Muehlegger (2015) shows that consumer learning about the practical use and attributes of new technologies increases adoption. Other papers demonstrate the effect of community and personal environmental preferences on the adoption of traditional hybrid vehicles (Kahn 2007; Kahn and Vaughn 2009), for which we account in our analysis. One question we do not directly address is different charger speeds (fast vs. slow) and their relative benefits in varied use-cases. In theory, slow chargers may be better suited to urban areas and locals charging as a supplement to or replacement of home-charging. Fast chargers could be more beneficial on long-distance driving routes, leisure destinations, and therefore, potentially, rural areas. As Greaker (2021) discusses, fast charger availability has been given as an important factor for EV adoption, particularly as an enabler of long-distance and leisure trips. Their theoretical model finds that fast charger standardisation and infrastructure roll-out would increase EV purchases and consumer welfare. Our paper somewhat abstracts from these differences, using overall charger numbers. However, on average, 85% of charging stations in our data are slow chargers. This, along with our analysis of within-municipality network and EV purchase variations, gives us confidence that we are analysing the local effects of nearby charger installations on EV adoption. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines our empirical strategy, first by providing our data and laying out summary statistics, and second by detailing our panel data and SCM approaches. Section 3 then reports our empirical results. Finally, Sect. 4 provides concluding comments.",

A response to van den Bergh and Savin (2021)",November 2022,Johan Lilliestam,Anthony Patt,Germán Bersalli,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The temperature targets of the Paris Agreement require countries to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century, in order to stay within a finite carbon budget with minimal overshoot (IPCC 2018, Riahi et al. 2021). This contrasts with previous obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, which were for emission reductions, but not elimination. This places a new demand on national climate policies, namely that they trigger changes towards a complete transition of global energy supply to zero-carbon sources such as renewables; countries cannot rely on lower-carbon sources such as natural gas to achieve their long-term objectives. The need for transformative change implies that the primary criteria for evaluating the effects of climate policies are whether they trigger the needed technological changes. New, zero-carbon technologies must be invented and developed; these technologies deployed at scale, leading to continued innovation and cost reductions; followed by their mass diffusion, ultimately enabling the discontinuation of fossil energy sources. The effects of policies on short-term emissions are relevant to achieving the long-term system transformation only to the extent that observed emission reductions originate from these activities. In climate policy and climate policy research, the dominant view is that pricing carbon emissions is essential for achieving the Paris Agreement. Some argue that an economy-wide, preferably global carbon price is the only necessary climate policy instrument, while for others, carbon pricing should be the dominant lead instrument but embedded in a wider package, especially with flanking policies to support innovation (Nordhaus 2013, 2021; Edenhofer et al. 2019; van den Bergh et al. 2020; van den Bergh and Botzen 2020). Beyond theoretical and modelling studies, the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of carbon pricing instruments is scarce but growing. Most of the empirical literature on carbon pricing effectiveness use short-term emissions reductions as the dependent variable. Carbon pricing review articles taking technological change – innovation and investment in zero-carbon technologies – as the dependent variable are particularly scarce. Apart from Martin et al. (2016), who included innovation in their review, there had not been a review of these studies until we published one (Lilliestam et al. 2021) (henceforth LPB2021) in WIREs Climate Change. LPB2021 investigated several dependent variables. First, we looked at short-term effects on emissions, and found these to exist in some schemes and periods, consistent with other reviews. Second, we investigated effects on innovation activity, and found that carbon pricing instruments have triggered small increases. Finally, we looked at effects on investment in zero-carbon technologies, such as wind or solar power. We found no evidence that carbon pricing has stimulated such investment and limited but consistent evidence that it has not. Thus, we suggested in LPB2021 that other instruments, including dedicated technology support, that have been empirically shown to accelerate investment in zero-carbon energy technologies, may be of higher value for long-term climate protection. Our review was criticised by van den Bergh and Savin (2021) (henceforth BS2021) in this journal. Their paper was devoted exclusively to critiquing our review, claiming that our analysis was “unfair”, incomplete and incorrect in multiple ways. Most arguments were directed at our choice of technological change, rather than emission reductions, as the central dependent variable. BS2021 also directed attention to papers that, they believe, should have been included in our review. We were not given a chance to respond to their critique at the time it was published. We do so now and stand by our original findings. Moreover, we undertook the additional analysis that BS2021 suggested and find this to further support our original conclusion: carbon pricing has been shown to reduce emissions somewhat and trigger weak innovation effects, but there is no evidence that carbon pricing has triggered zero-carbon investments and scarce but consistent evidence that it has not. We see two criticisms as particularly important and address them in detail. First, the choice of technological change, and especially zero-carbon investment, as the central dependent variable, because this criticism questions the conceptual soundness and relevance of our analysis. We address this in Sect. 2. Second, because the claim that we omitted several important articles for our review potentially invalidates our findings, we expand our review sample as suggested by BS2021, maintaining our selection and evaluation criteria from LPB2021 (Sect. 3). We find this to strengthen our initial findings. In Sect. 4, we respond to the remaining points raised by BS2021.",4
83.0,3.0,Environmental and Resource Economics,11 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-022-00709-7,Efficiency Investment and Curtailment Action,November 2022,Shigeru Matsumoto,Hajime Sugeta,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Governments have introduced various regulatory measures to increase the energy efficiency of energy-consuming products (e.g., Agency of Natural Resources and Energy of Japan 2019; European Commission 2019) while simultaneously promoting energy-efficient products to households (e.g., European Union 2020; U.S. Department of Energy 2019). By investing in the energy efficiency of energy-consuming products, households can lower the effective price of the energy service and thus, can reduce energy consumption without lowering the energy service level. However, households need to incur additional expenses to install new energy-efficient products, since the prices of these products are higher than those of conventional products. Many households have long adopted curtailment actions, such as turning off unused lights and unplugging charging devices. In recent years, power companies have introduced various experimental behavioral programs to change the energy usage habits of households. Some researchers have participated in the program design and have evaluated the effectiveness (Allcott and Mullainathan 2010; Allcott 2011; Tiefenbeck et al. 2013; Frederiks et al. 2015). Although households do not need to spend money when taking such curtailment actions, they are required to spend time on these actions. Thus, households can adopt two types of energy-saving activities: efficiency investment and curtailment action. While money is a crucial factor in efficiency investment, time is often a crucial factor in curtailment action. Since the relative importance of money and time varies between households (Gronau and Hamermesh 2006, 2008), it is natural to expect that the optimal combination of efficiency investment and curtailment action varies between households. How are the optimal combinations of efficiency investment and curtailment action related? Would households lower curtailment action if the price of energy-efficient products were to decrease? Would households stop practicing energy-saving activities after purchasing new energy-saving products? To answer these questions, this study develops an energy-saving model based on a household production framework. We assume that a household receives utility from entertainment activity and energy service. Market goods and leisure time are necessary for entertainment activity. We further assume that a household allocates time among market work, leisure, and curtailment action. If household members work longer hours outside the home and spend more time on leisure, they can enjoy more entertainment activity. However, in that case, they need to cut back time spent on curtailment action and pay higher energy bills. Instead of spending time on curtailment action, a household can purchase energy-efficient products. Although the household can lower the effective price of the energy service through investment in energy efficiency, it needs to reduce the amount of market goods purchased. The household’s energy-saving activity is characterized by a production function with two inputs: efficiency investment and curtailment action. Using this household production framework, we arrive at the following theoretical findings. We show that efficiency investment and curtailment action become substitutes if a household’s utility is given by a Cobb–Douglas function. By contrast, efficiency investment and curtailment action can become either complements or substitutes if a household’s utility is given by a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. If the energy-efficient products become expensive, then the household substitutes curtailment action for efficiency investment. This first cross-price effect within energy-saving activity enhances the substitution between the two energy-saving measures. However, the price increase of energy-efficient products makes energy-saving activities more costly and thus, the cost of the energy service rises more than that of entertainment activity. Consequently, the household reduces its energy service consumption and increases its entertainment activity. This second cross-price effect lowers the energy-saving activity and thus, the time spent on curtailment action is reduced. The second cross-price effect becomes the driving force for inducing a complementary relationship between efficiency investment and curtailment action. In this study, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for making efficiency investment and curtailment action become complements. It is difficult to accurately measure the financial cost of energy efficiency investment and the time cost of taking curtailment action. In our empirical study, instead of investigating how the price change in energy-efficient products affects energy-saving practice, we directly examine the relationship between efficiency investment and curtailment action. For this purpose, we analyze micro-level data from the Survey on Carbon Dioxide Emission from Households (SCDEH) (Ministry of the Environment of Japan 2014, 2017, 2018). In the SCDEH, households are asked about their energy-saving practices together with the age of their electric appliances. The inclusion of information about both energy-saving practices and the age of electric appliances is the major strength of the SCDEH dataset. Other datasets typically used in appliance usage analyses do not satisfy this condition; for example, the US Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) does not include information about energy-saving practices. The Japanese government introduced a regulation called the Top Runner Program in 1999. This program requires manufacturers to achieve the energy efficiency of the most efficient appliance selling in the market at the time of the program implementation by the target year. Therefore, the program guarantees that the energy efficiency of appliances will improve over time. Because the Top Runner Program’s standards being reviewed approximately every 5 years, the energy efficiency of air conditioners (ACs) increased by 78.85% from 1997 to 2010, that of refrigerators (REFs) increased by 78.94% from 1998 to 2010, and that of LCD TVs increased by 47.54% from 2014 to 2012. From 2010 to 2020, the energy efficiency of ACs and REFs improved by 12% and 37–43%, respectively (Agency of Natural Resources and Energy 2015, 2022). Although the replacement of old appliances yields a clear energy conservation effect, many households continue to use old appliances beyond the appropriate replacement period. The Japanese government has strongly encouraged households to replace appliances that have passed the appropriate replacement period, which is about 10 years (Ministry of the Environment of Japan 2022). In the empirical section, we examine whether there is a difference in the intensity of curtailment actions between households that keep using old appliances beyond the appropriate replacement period and remaining households. Although the age of an appliance is not perfectly correlated with its energy efficiency,Footnote 1 we consider the age to be a good proxy variable of product energy efficiency, given the requirements of the Top Runner Program and the drastic energy efficiency improvements over the last 30 years. In addition, most households have limited ability to understand the technical aspects of the energy efficiency of home appliances. For this reason, Energy Star labels are used in many countries. Since it is not realistic to ask households to check the energy efficiencies of their appliances, the government recommends that households gauge the energy efficiency of appliances based on their age. Therefore, an age-related analysis of appliances is consistent with real policies. Our empirical results reveal that households that keep using old appliances are less engaged in curtailment actions than remaining households. This result indicates that households jointly use efficiency investment and curtailment action. We believe that our empirical findings have important implications for energy policy. If households weaken curtailment actions after purchasing energy-efficient products, then the promotion policies for energy-efficient products by many governments would crowd out voluntary energy-saving behavior by households. By contrast, the complementary relationship found in this study suggests that governments can promote energy-efficient products without being concerned about crowding-out problems arising. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the literature on households’ energy-saving behavior. In Sect. 3, we develop an energy-saving model based on a household production framework to show the relationship between efficiency investment and curtailment action. For the empirical analysis, we use data from the SCDEH. In Sect. 4, we provide information about the SCDEH and summarize the socioeconomic characteristics of households that participated in the survey. We also report energy-saving practices of households. We present the estimation model and report the empirical findings in Sect. 5. We conclude with the policy implications of our findings in Sect. 6.",

Barbier,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Underlying the “Dasgupta Review” of the economics of biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021) is a fundamental policy message. Averting the global biodiversity crisis will require humankind to rethink the relationship between economy and nature. Or, as Sir Partha notes in the Headline Messages accompanying his Review: “The solution starts with understanding and accepting a simple truth: our economies are embedded within Nature, not external to it.”Footnote 1 Unfortunately, as the Dasgupta Review documents, our economies continue to treat nature not only as an “external” source of resource stocks and pollution sinks but also as an essentially limitless one as well. Despite the increasing concern over global environmental risks, it has yet to translate into meaningful policy even though we have the tools to do so (Sterner et al. 2019). Much of the Dasgupta Review is devoted to detailing the consequences of this inaction. It “highlights the serious, deep-rooted institutional and market failures that mean societies are failing to invest in the natural capital on which our ongoing prosperity depends, and are instead rapidly eroding that asset base, with growing economic costs and vulnerability to future disasters” (WWF UK 2021, p. 1). The Dasgupta Review identifies many factors that threaten the ecological sustainability of our economies. The following article examines how two policy failures in particular - the underpricing and underfunding of nature – are critical to a major global environmental risk: land use change and terrestrial biodiversity loss.Footnote 2 The main concern is the rapid conversion and degradation of natural habitats, such as forests, wetlands and grasslands. The principal threats are from agriculture, forestry, infrastructure, human settlements and other economic activities. The resulting dramatic decline in plant and animal species has led some scientists to warn of possible “biological annihilation” in coming decades (Cebellos et al. 2017). The scale, speed and impacts of this destruction have been immense. Terrestrial ecological communities worldwide have lost more than 20% of their original biodiversity (Díaz et al. 2019). Natural ecosystems have declined by almost half over the past 50 years, and millions of terrestrial species are likely to become extinct by 2100 (IPBES 2019). Land use change is also a significant contributor to global warming, accounting for 14% of total carbon emissions on average over 2010 to 2019 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Land use pressure has reduced local biodiversity intactness - the average proportion of natural biodiversity remaining in local ecosystems - beyond safe limits across the majority of the world’s land surface.Footnote 3 Even protected areas are not safe. As much as one third of global protected land is under intense human pressure (Jones et al. 2018). Reversing these trends will require a major transformation in how economies use land and nature, as called for by the Dasgupta Review. This article explores different policy initiatives, both globally and within countries, to address this critical problem. After briefly summarizing key trends of land use change and biodiversity loss, the article explains how the underpricing of nature inhibits the creation of the incentives, institutions and innovations needed to change humankind’s relationship with terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. Global biodiversity conservation is also plagued by underfunding, as the international community struggles to compensate developing countries for protecting valuable terrestrial habitats and restoring those that are degraded or converted. Overcoming such underfunding in the coming decades will be critical to halting the rapid decline in terrestrial natural capital. The final part of this article looks more closely at policies to end the underpricing of natural landscape and the underfunding of nature. Collective action will require commitments not only by rich countries to assist poorer ones in protection and restoration efforts, but also by the private sector to invest in nature to reduce the risks from biodiversity and ecosystem loss. The example of peatlands is used to illustrate how such a comprehensive global strategy could be constructed.",5

Ando,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"“The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review” (Dasgupta 2021; the Review) provides a sweeping synthesis of insights from economics into the causes of and possible solutions to our current biodiversity loss crisis. That synthesis has potential to mobilize important global action to slow or reverse biodiversity loss by formalizing the central role nature and biodiversity play in human prosperity. The Review may also improve a wide range of private sector and government decision making by centering natural capital into working definitions of inclusive wealth and sustainable development. Dasgupta’s work sounds a clarion call to action by making clear that our stocks of biodiversity have great value and many of our actions are heedlessly and irreversibly destroying those stocks. However, that synthesis naturally embodies many of the tendencies of the discipline as a whole that can lead economics to pose explanations and solutions that advantage wealthy and powerful entities in our global society rather than those who are poor or otherwise marginalized. For example, economic frameworks tend to seek efficient outcomes without interrogating the sources or consequences of the initial endowments of resources and power, and economic models and analyses often achieve tractability by abstracting from important institutional and cultural details like discriminatory barriers to wealth accumulation and property ownership (Ando et al. 2021). This paper explores two dimensions of the Review itself in which re-focusing could improve both the effectiveness and the equity of its suggested global response to the biodiversity loss crisis. First, effective and equitable global efforts to stem biodiversity loss will need to be motivated and directed by complete and unbiased estimates of the values that biodiversity bring to humanity (Atkinson et al. 2012). However, the methods promoted in Chapter 12 of the Review are limited in their capacity to meet that need. Section II of this paper identifies several features of those recommendations that will tend to underestimate our estimates of the total values of biodiversity and give particularly short shrift to the important roles that biodiversity plays in the lives of marginalized and indigenous peoples. The section makes a suite of suggestions for how valuation approaches can best be used to inform actions that capture both use and non-use values and include the perspectives and needs of people who are typically neglected in governance processes. Second, economists must be careful to focus on action recommendations that will actually effect equitable change. Pareto efficiency has dominated the attention of mainstream economics since the middle of the twentieth century (Sandmo 2015). However, one can correct Pareto inefficiencies in many domains of human activity with actions that burden already-vulnerable people without having much impact on the biodiversity problem as a whole (e.g. Bruno et al. 2019). The early core section of the Review (specifically Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 9) places the locus of responsibility for biodiversity loss heavily on decisions about consumption and reproduction made by individuals, particularly individuals who happen to be very poor. Section III of this paper analyzes the implications of that focus for both cost-effectiveness and equity. Policies and management decisions to reduce the rate of species extinctions can only be effective if they target actions to promote or modify that are large drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss. Furthermore, global action to preserve biodiversity will be inequitable unless we take at least some steps to identify and correct actions taken by wealthy countries and large-scale producers that contribute much to the biodiversity crisis, rather than just targeting actions taken primarily by low-income individuals and households.",1

These indirect economic losses can include business interruptions, macroeconomic effects such as falls in aggregate demand, changes in relative prices, long-term consequences for health and education, and social and political turmoil. Maybe counter-intuitively, indirectly disasters can also generate benefits. For example, a demand surge for (re)construction services can lead to a boom in this sector for several years in the aftermath of a disaster Olsen and Porter (2011). Positive long-term dynamics can also occur when technological innovation and investment in better planning and design are generated by the shock event Hallegatte and Dumas (2009). If associated with deliberate policy, these positive dynamics are sometimes referred to as ‘Build Back Better’ Fernandez and Ahmed (2019), Noy et al. (2020). When these arise out of private sector activity and initiative, they can be thought of as a variant of the Schumpeterian ‘Creative Destruction’ hypothesis.Footnote 1 The common empirical approach employed in assessing the impact of a disaster is to use statistical-econometric techniques to examine whether or how a country’s dynamics have changed after the event. A common practice is to use some form of difference-in-difference estimation (e.g., (Cerra and Saxena 2008; Belasen and Polachek 2009), and Husby et al. (2014)), and other methods, such as propensity score matching (e.g., (Deryugina et al. 2018)) or synthetic control (e.g., (Barone and Mocetti 2014), and Cavallo et al. (2013)). Most of this research focuses on macroeconomic variables from national (or regional) income accounts, where typical variables of interest are aggregate production (GDP), consumption, measures of fiscal spending and revenue, exports and imports, and prices Cavallo and Noy (2011). Importantly, only a few papers find evidence in support of any variant of the positive post-disaster dynamics as described in the build-back-better or creative-destruction hypotheses. For instance, Cuaresma et al. (2008) find some evidence of possible long-run positive effects, but one that is limited to moderate disasters in higher-income regions. Similarly, De Alwis and Noy (2019) and Jiuping and Yi (2013) find some positive longer-term dynamics associated with disasters in which post-disaster assistance was unusually generous (the tsunami in Sri Lanka in 2004 and the Wenchuan earthquake of 2008, respectively). Skidmore and Toya (2002) are atypical in arguing that they identify, on average, a long-run increase in human capital acquisition and total factor productivity in countries hit by disasters. While the broader literature is generally consistent in identifying multiple negative dynamics following disaster shocks, this minority of ‘build back better’ or ’creative destruction’ papers does seem to suggest the possibility of a positive outcome, at least on some dimensions, following some types of catastrophic events, in some countries. In this paper we further explore the potential positive impact of disasters, particularly on technological progress and innovation, by focusing on patenting activity after hurricanes in the United States. To this end we build a county level panel data set of innovation and hurricane damages over nearly 120 years. Ultimately, if there is to be a long-term benefit post-disaster, it will have to manifest itself through some form of technological innovation (i.e., technological progress). As is common in this literature, we measure innovation by patents Popp (2019). Miao and Popp (2014) examined global country-level patent data from the Delphion database for the period 1974-2009, and the corresponding experience with disasters therein. In particular they investigated whether these events were followed by “risk-mitigating innovation” (p. 280). They examine whether floods, droughts, and earthquakes generated future innovation in flood control, drought-resistant crops, and seismic resilience in buildings, respectively. Their analysis rests on the hypothesis that the main channel through which a shock generates future innovation is by changing relative prices. Innovation is induced as relative price changes make the resulting patents more beneficial. These changes in relative prices can come about because the availability of inputs has changed, or because as the salience of certain risks increases. Their results show that disasters can result in more risk-mitigation, but that this depends on the type of disaster and the type of technology examined. In another paper, Hu et al. (2018) examined both recent short-term (2005-2013) province level patents and long-term historic (11 A.D. to 1910 A.D) national level innovation data from patents in China following weather events. They find that mitigating innovative activity in historical and modern times increased as a result of weather events, and that during the modern period these mitigating patents led to more general innovative activity. Similarly, by focusing on a specific sub-sectors (within European agriculture) and patents aimed at climate change adaptation (as identified in the patent text), Auci et al. (2021) are able to investigate both whether climate variability is associated with more patenting activity (it is) and whether that patenting activity is successful in improving productivity (it is as well).Footnote 2 The central contribution of the present paper (relative to the papers described above) is our ability to focus on the longer term impacts on innovation (specific to the hazard, and more generally), and to tie patents with environmental shocks using the exact location of both. We do this within the context of the United States, and without focusing on the agricultural sector and specific crop-related innovations. Focusing on the long-term enables us to potentially, as argued above, observe the full ’benefit’ of the shock in terms of generating new innovation (specific and general). At the same time, focusing locally is important for our purposes, since natural disasters are inherently local and their true impact is likely to be blurred when examining national or even broad regional data Strobl (2011). We focus on local long-term impacts by compiling US data on (ultimately successful) patent applications and the creator(s)’s location (at the county level) since 1900. We match these with localized hurricane damage data constructed from the physical characteristics of the storm, a wind field model, pre-event population exposure, and a stylized damage function. As shown by Strobl (2012) and Felbermayr and Gröschl (2014), such damage data can overcome the endogeneity and measurement problems inherent in using ex-post estimated damages of disasters.Footnote 3 Using a Poisson fixed effects count model we demonstrate that there is indeed some evidence of temporary boosts to disaster mitigation creative activity after a hurricane. But these are dwarfed by a long-term decline, lasting over two decades, of general innovative activity in the damaged area. Thus, while previous research might have identified cross-country or broad regional positive links between disaster events and mitigating innovation, our more localized investigation over a longer time period reveals that, viewed more broadly and over a longer time horizon, disasters are detrimental to general innovation.",1

The analysis of global multi-regional input–output tables has revealed how international emission transfers vary over time, across countries, and by income level (e.g. Peters and Hertwich 2008; Hertwich and Peters 2009; Davis and Caldeira 2010). Between 1990 and 2011, the Kyoto-relevant territorial emissions decreased in the developed (Annex-B) countries while the CBE increased (Kanemoto et al. 2014). In 2008, the Annex-B countries transferred 1.6 GtCO2 to non-Annex-B countries; this amount exceeds the reductions achieved in the Kyoto protocol period until then (Peters et al. 2011). In general, the developed countries are “net importing” emissions (PBE < CBE) while the developing countries are “net exporting” emissions (PBE > CBE). How to interpret these facts? Economic activity and the associated emissions may simply have migrated from the developed to the developing world. Trade liberalization might have encouraged the developing countries to specialize in the production and export of emission-intensive products. “Emission outsourcing” might explain the advanced-economy decoupling success. National emission decreases apparently did not translate into corresponding global emission decreases. Jakob and Marschinski (2013) caution against premature conclusions and emphasize that the interpretation of international emission transfer patterns, and the derivation of climate policy implications, requires better understanding of the underlying driving forces. The size and direction of international emission transfers are determined to a large extent by international technology differences, that is, cross-country differences in the carbon intensity of energy and the energy intensity of production. In the presence of technology differences, exchanging identical products at equal prices would imply emission transfers (Jakob and Marschinski 2013; Jakob et al. 2014). Kander et al. (2015) propose a new scheme to account for the emissions embodied in trade – technology-adjusted accounting – which standardizes the emission intensity at the world average level. Jiborn et al. (2018), Baumert et al. (2019), and Jiborn et al. (2020) implement the technology adjustment in order to appraise competing narratives about the advanced-economy decoupling. These studies seek to evaluate the claim that the developed countries are “systematically outsourcing emissions” to the developing countries, and to assess the extent to which developed-country PBE trends are driven by international trade. The scale of emission outsourcing, it turns out, is much smaller than previously suggested, and the clear divide between the developed world and the developing world disappears. Many developed countries, especially in Europe, are “insourcing” emissions and not “outsourcing” them (Baumert et al. 2019). How to interpret the new facts revealed by technology-adjusted accounting? We propose a new method for technology-adjusted accounting and develop interpretations for the resulting emission concepts. We interpret the technology-adjusted emission balance as a measure of net weak carbon leakage, document how the variable varies across space and over time, analyze its cross-country relationship with per-capita income, and discuss what technology-adjusted accounting implies with respect to the decoupling of emissions and economic growth. The “technology adjustment” implemented thus far really is an emission intensity adjustment: the direct emission intensities (the ratios of emissions to gross outputs) are standardized but not the input intensities (the ratios of intermediate inputs to gross outputs). In input–output analysis (Leontief 1986), the ratios of inputs to outputs are said to represent the production technology (the “production recipes”). This point is not merely a semantic quibble but matters in practice. The observed cross-country differences in the input intensity are non-negligible, e.g. China’s cement, lime, and plaster production requires 0.82 euros worth of inputs per unit worth of output while the same sector in Germany requires just 0.64 euros. On average, Chinese producers require 0.61 euros worth of inputs per euro worth of gross output while German producers require only 0.48 euros.Footnote 1 The same demand will generate greater environmental impacts, ceteris paribus, if more inputs are required per unit of output. A comparative standard intended to represent the world average production technology should also eliminate international differences in the input intensity. In this article we build on the decomposition proposed by Xu and Dietzenbacher (2014) in order to standardize the input intensities across countries. We implement the technology adjustment using EXIOBASE3 (Stadler et al. 2018), which offers finer sector detail than the MRIO tables used by our antecedents. The emission intensity adjustment has a curious feature: it tends to be inconsequential when the analysis draws on highly dis-aggregated data, i.e. input–output tables with fine sector detail. The intensity adjustment is inconsequential, in particular, when the electricity sector is broken down by green and brown energy sources. The energy mix of the domestic electricity sector is a key driver of embodied emissions. As a rough approximation, the emission intensity of Sweden’s aggregate electricity sector is low because Sweden uses hydro power rather than coal, and not because Sweden’s hydro electricity production is exceptionally clean. In general, the emission intensity of the aggregate electricity sector varies a lot more across countries than the emission intensities of electricity sub-sectors vary across countries. Therefore, with fine sector detail, standardizing only the emission intensity – substituting a sector’s world average value for the sector’s country-specific emission intensity – will be relatively inconsequential. Our proposed technology adjustment behaves differently, because the technology adjustment standardizes the direct emission intensities and the intermediate input requirements. Standardizing the input requirements implies, for example, that the aluminum sectors of Sweden and China require the same amount of hydro electricity input per unit of output. As a result, the technology adjustment is consequential even when based on highly dis-aggregated data (EXIOBASE3 provides global MRIO tables with 163 sectors per country). Section 2 discusses related literature and introduces the key concepts used in this study. We explain why we apply the technology-adjustment only to the export side, and why interpret the technology-adjusted emission balance as a measure of net weak carbon leakage. Section 3 introduces the notation for the environmentally-extended MRIO model, describes how the model is used to calculate emissions embodied in trade, and explains the modifications needed for standardizing the production technology. Section 5 discusses the results. The patterns of net weak carbon leakage are quantitatively and qualitatively different from international emission transfers. Emissions in most countries follow country-specific trends, regardless of the emission concept. Weak carbon leakage cannot be considered an important driver of national emission trends.",

Combating climate change requires effort and coordination from all countries, even if they differ in terms of wealth. The public-good aspect of pollution emissions abatement means that coordination failures typically lead to insufficient abatement. Moreover, emissions reduction efforts are extremely demanding for developing countries, which face several other challenges such as health, education, and peace. Ambitious development policies are hence a prerequisite if the poorest countries are to have the capacity to implement environmental policies. Yet, development and environmental policies are often considered separately. The United Nations, for example, splits its activities into two separate initiatives: the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Environment Programme. Only in recent years have attempts been made to link the two aspects, as seen in the Poverty-Environment Initiative, launched by the United Nations to connect its Development and Environment Programmes, for instance. The current paper emphasizes the value of addressing both environmental and development objectives within a single framework. In particular, we show that the well-designed interconnection of development and environmental policies can help to solve coordination problems between developed and developing countries. Although the mechanism at play requires a specifically timed decision process, it does not require a global coalition since countries do not have to collectively negotiate the emission abatement levels of each individual country. We also reveal that developed countries may benefit, even from a purely selfish point of view, from being (more) altruistic thanks to the efficiency gain generated by development aid transfers. Our model comprises one developed country (representing a partial coalition composed of developed countries) and several heterogeneous developing countries. All countries are assumed to be concerned about their own wealth and total emissions abatement. In addition, the developed country is altruistic and hence cares about the welfare of the developing countries. Countries fail to properly internalize the benefits of their emissions abatement to other countries, which typically generates inefficient abatement decisions. By assuming a partial coalition composed of developed countries rather than several developed countries, we limit our focus to the coordination problem between this partial coalition of developed countries and multiple developing countries. This paper shows that the coordination problem finds a simple solution if developing countries can expect to receive altruistic development aid transfers from the developed country. Each developing country anticipates that making a sub-optimal abatement effort will eventually lower the transfer it receives from the developed country. Once the endogeneity of development aid transfers is properly taken into account, the best strategy for the developing countries is to abate exactly the socially optimal level. Indeed, this abatement level maximizes global wealth (accounting for the costs and benefits of abatement) and the welfare of each developing country is increasing in global wealth since it is a normal good for the altruistic developed country. The timing of the decision is central to the mechanism. For incentives to work properly, development aid transfers should be determined after all abatement decisions have been made. In practice, this means that developed countries should not commit to a given amount of aid, but should instead communicate on their degree of altruism, which will determine the transfers they will make once all abatement decisions have been made. The coordination problem is ultimately solved thanks to developing countries’ anticipation of the forthcoming development aid transfer. The mechanism at play in our paper leads to optimal emissions abatement without the need for a global coalition to collectively determine this abatement. Developing countries freely choose their own abatement but have incentives to abate optimally thanks to ex post altruistic transfers. A key restriction of this result is that it only holds if the developed country is altruistic enough to make positive development aid transfers to the developing countries. Since countries can freely decide how much to give to others but not how much to take from others, altruistic transfers are constrained to be positive. If the altruism of the developed country is sufficiently high, the developing countries, anticipating that they will receive aid contingent on their abatement, will choose efficient abatement levels. Conversely, if there is insufficient altruism, the developing countries will anticipate a lack of aid and will choose inefficiently low abatement levels. Interestingly, we show that for intermediate altruism levels, efficient and inefficient equilibria may co-exist, featuring positive and null transfers, respectively. An additional result of our paper is that the developed country could gain in behaving more altruistically, since providing positive aid solves the coordination problem. We highlight this aspect in an extension of our model featuring a strategic delegation setting where the developed country is composed of individuals who differ in their degree of altruism. In this setting, individuals have to democratically select a representative agent who will choose the abatement levels and aid transfers. In a set of cases, we show that the selected representative agent is more altruistic than the median agent. The current paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, it contributes to the literature on the provision of global public goods in general, and climate change mitigation in particular. As highlighted in the literature review of Buchholz and Sandler (2021), a key specificity in the problem of global public good provision is that the agents involved are sovereign countries (i.e., there is no global governance). Thus, the provision of global public goods relies on voluntary provision (e.g., Bergstrom 1986; Cornes and Sandler 1984; Cornes and Sandler 1985) or on the organization of formal coalitions through international treaties, for instance (e.g., Barrett 1994; Carraro and Siniscalco 1993; Hoel 1992). The main take-away from this literature is the under-provision of global public goods, whether through voluntary provision or formal coalitions. However, it has been shown that this provision may be increased via different aspects, such as technological change and uncertainty (e.g., Barrett 2006; Boucher and Bramoullé 2010), countries heterogeneity and side payments (e.g., Barrett 2001; McGinty 2007), or social preferences such as altruism, fairness, or reciprocity (e.g., Buchholz et al. 2018; Nyborg 2018; Lange and Vogt 2003; van der Pol et al. 2012). Unlike these papers, in which the improvement of global public good provision is usually shown through a change in the organization of formal coalitions, the mechanism we propose allows us to solve the coordination problem without requiring formal cooperation. Given the practical difficulties of negotiating with a large number of countries, it is worth highlighting that an optimal outcome can be attained by giving the right incentives for the provision of global public goods to countries outside a formal coalition. Second, our paper contributes to the literature on international development aid. Alesina and Dollar (2000), and Dudley and Montmarquette (1976) show empirically that donors are driven by several motives, such as altruism, historical links, or geopolitical considerations. Azam and Laffont (2003), Epstein and Gang (2009), Hagen (2006), Pedersen (1996, 2001), and Svensson (2000) discuss the efficiency of international aid. These papers take into account the fact that donor countries allocate aid to recipient countries’ governments and not directly to the poor, which generates inefficiencies. Unlike this literature, our model does not consider transfer intermediation and induced inefficiencies, but instead brings international environmental issues to the discussion on development aid transfers. We show that competition for foreign aid among recipients can reduce negative externalities instead of exacerbating inefficiencies. Third, the extension of our model featuring a strategic delegation setting contributes to the literature on strategic delegation in the provision of a public good, and more specifically to the case of a global public good such as climate change mitigation. This literature assumes that a country is composed of individuals who differ with respect to a key attribute (e.g., altruism or environmental sensitivity). It then investigates whether individuals designate a delegate who resembles them or whether they pick a delegate who is more or less endowed with respect to the attribute. In other words, does delegation lead to an over- or under-provision of the public good? Although Besley and Coate (2003) establish an over-provision of public goods, Dur and Roelfsema (2005) and Lorz and Willmann (2005) come to the opposite conclusion. Buchholz et al. (2005) and Rota-Graziosi (2009) examine global public goods and international environmental treaties, finding that respondents assign a delegate who is less “environmentally friendly” than they are. We obtain the opposite result. A detailed comparison of our paper and the latter two articles is provided in Sect. 6. Finally, our paper is related to the literature on household behavior, and more specifically the “Rotten Kid Theorem” introduced by Becker (1974), which relates to the impact of altruistic transfers in sequential games. We further detail the connection to the Rotten Kid Theorem and its related literature at the end of Sect. 4. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our modeling assumptions with \(n+1\) countries. In Sect. 3, we determine the Pareto optimal allocations. Section 4 analyzes the interaction between abatement and transfer decisions and compares two decision processes: simultaneous and sequential decisions. In the context of two countries, Sect. 5 further details the impact of altruism on abatement and transfer decisions and Sect. 6 examines the chosen degree of altruism in a political economy setting. Section 7 concludes.",

In fact, the number of weather-related natural disasters per decade rose by over 370% between 1971 and 2010 (World Meteorological Organization 2014). The traditional approach used to estimate the economic impact of such disasters focuses on their impact on income-based measures.Footnote 1 Unfortunately, this approach has well-known weaknesses in the context of disaster impact measurement. Firstly, income-based measures may increase after a disaster due to the rebuild effort, which would be captured by this measurement approach; however, the associated opportunity costs would be overlooked. Secondly, income-based measures ignore many of the impacts of natural disasters, such as psychological costs, environmental harm, and loss of life. Due to these factors, it is commonly agreed that most estimates substantially underestimate the true impact of natural disasters (Hochrainer 2009; Hallegatte and Przyluski 2010; Kousky 2014; Hallegatte 2015; Deloitte 2016; Sheng and Xu 2019). It is thus natural to look for alternative techniques that can address at least some of these issues and complement the more traditional income-based approach. A relatively new but rapidly developing strand of economic literature focuses on measuring the impact of disasters by analysing the change in subjective well-being (SWB) (including Carroll et al. 2009; Luechinger and Raschky 2009; Kountouris and Remoundou 2011; Calvo et al. 2015a; Berlemann 2016; Sekulova and van den Bergh 2016; von Möllendorff and Hirschfeld 2016; Van Ootegem and Verhofstadt 2016; Hudson et al. 2019; Lohmann et al. 2019; Ahmadiani and Ferreira 2021; Berlemann and Eurich 2021; Frijters et al. 2021). In this paper, we contribute to this literature by estimating the impact of experiencing weather-related home damage on subjective well-being in Australia, using a dataset that is much richer than those used in prior studies. While most papers in this literature use individual-level data on subjective well-being, few use measures of impact at the individual level; thus, they measure the impact of living in an area where a disaster took place rather than the effect of being affected personally by a disaster. In the survey that we use, however, the respondents were asked whether their household had experienced any weather-related housing damage. While a few other studies use similar measures of direct exposure, these studies have small datasets of about 1,000 respondents (or fewer) and lack data from before the disasters.Footnote 2 Instead, our panel dataset spans an 11-year period, with over 20,000 people who were interviewed on average six times. In addition to using a better dataset, we make two methodological contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, Bond and Lang (2019) argue that SWB regressions are highly dependent on the way in which ordinal happiness data are transformed into cardinal data, showing that a monotonic transformation that is rank preserving at the individual level can lead to coefficient estimates of the opposite sign. Following the method suggested by Bloem (2021), we perform a series of data transformations to investigate empirically whether our results are robust to changes in the assumed underlying cardinal scale. Second, the recent literature (Borusyak and Jaravel 2018; de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille 2020; Callaway and Sant’Anna 2021; Goodman-Bacon 2021; Sun and Abraham 2021) shows that the standard two-way fixed-effect (difference-in-difference) analysis can be misleading when the impact of a treatment changes over time. We therefore present the results of both the traditional two-way fixed-effect analysis and the more robust approach suggested by Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021b). Finally, we compare the impact on subjective well-being we estimate, to existing impact estimates on income-based measures, within the same context of natural disasters in Australia. We find that experiencing weather-related home damage has a well-being effect that is relatively small in magnitude and is frequently statistically insignificant. More specifically, our main analysis shows that experiencing weather-related home damage explains at most 12% of the within-person standard deviation of subjective well-being. Our conclusions are generally robust to three different measures of well-being and a variety of assumed underlying cardinalizations and econometric methods. We further show that our finding about the limited impact on subjective well-being is consistent with some of the findings of studies that compute the impact of natural disasters in Australia on other outcome measures and discuss several explanations for the limited impact on well-being. These possible explanations include government assistance, insurance coverage, social comparisons, and the limited ‘average’ intensity of the disasters. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses the literature on well-being and the well-being effect of weather-related disasters.

Barbier,Anne-Sophie Crépin,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Karl-Göran Mäler (KGM) cared passionately about the spread of environmental economics, both into new areas of enquiry and geographically to all parts of the world. (See Xepapadeas and de Zeeuw, 2020 for one of several obituaries as well as Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics (2020), EfD (2020), Stockholm Resilience Centre (2020)). He believed that economics and ecology should be integrated to adress some of the most pressing societal problems. Such integration should be built, he insisted, on the best of what each of the two sciences have to offer. Though KGM was fundamentally a theorist, he was very interested in applications and real-life problems. His interests ranged from economic measures of welfare to valuation, resource management and game theory. KGM cared deeply about emerging markets and developing countries and worked hard to spread environmental economics to the Global South. He arranged workshops in many countries with the aim of interacting with local academics on the application of environmental economics. By teaching the teachers and providing them with theories and methods, these lessons could then be incorporated into their own teaching for the next generation of economists. Eventually, this led to the formation of a series of regional networks across continents promoting the teaching and application of environmental economics. These networks included: in Asia the EEPSEA and SANDEE, in Africa the EENESA, RANESA and CEEPA, and in Latin America the LACEEP.Footnote 1 KGM had a knack for listening to young students and involving them in his enormous network of influential economists and ecologists, including towering giants such as Partha Dasgupta, Ken Arrow, Buzz Holling and Elinor Ostrom. He brought them all together in convivial settings –often including early morning birdwatching. KGM was also instrumental in two additional initiatives that helped spread environmental economics worldwide. He was a partner in the formation of a dedicated PhD program in Environmental Economics at the University of Gothenburg, for which he helped select and mentor students. Around 50 PhDs who graduated from this program later formed the core of the Environment for Development Initiative, which has grown to become a considerable presence in the subject and continues to have intense interactions with the regional networks. The PhD program included a course in systems ecology, for which many students have made memorable visits to the Beijer Institute in Stockholm, where KGM was Director. KGM personally helped many of the students by repeatedly inviting great people like Partha Dasgupta and Elinor Ostrom to teach and act as mentors. KGM also founded the journal Environment and Development Economics. Through generous funding from the Beijer Institute and the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), he ensured that the journal was available to many institutions and academics throughout the world. This Special Issue (SI) is dedicated to KGM’s memory. We wish to honor his work in light of his passion for bringing people together and promoting interdisciplinary science to bear on environmental problems, particularly in countries of the Global South. Many of the authors of the papers in this SI made their first contacts through the regional networks that KGM helped establish. Some are graduates of the Gothenburg PhD program and others are former Mäler scholarsFootnote 2. All of the authors are bound in a life-long friendship and are dedicated to studying environmental problems in developing countries. The following personal stories illustrate this important bond.",

These two activities are linked because wild elephants’ feeding habits prevent bush encroachment, thus maintaining a healthy stock of pastures critical for livestock. The local community manages the elephants through community hunting, which can substantially influence their reproduction. Below some threshold, the elephant population would have difficulties to reproduce, a phenomenon called depensation. Too few elephants would then result in bush encroachment and fewer pastures for livestock. This scenario could be pictured as a drastic shift between two ‘regimes’ in the local ecosystem, where the pasture yielding grasslands—rich in elephants—switches to bushy area, with few elephants and fewer ecosystem services. The latter regime is difficult to reverse. We investigate here the effects of three types of policy interventions on the sustainable management of natural resources in a community wildlife conservation context in Southern Africa. In such a context, common-pool resources (CPRs) are often coupled, simply because they are produced in the same ecosystem, which exhibits complex dynamics: multiple species interact with each other and their environment, sometimes leading to drastic changes, such as ‘regime’ shifts (Biggs et al. 2012), as for elephants and pastures used for livestock grazing. What kind of policy intervention can support sustainable management of CPRs in such a context? Should the authorities inform communities about stock dynamics and potential regime shifts? Should they instead introduce a quota for the elephant stock, which, if exceeded, would trigger a sanction? Or should they use a combination of both interventions? Ecosystem regime shifts—large, abrupt and potentially persistent changes in the structure and dynamics of an ecosystem—can occur when values of key ecosystem variables cross a threshold (Biggs et al. 2012). They often substantially change the availability of ecosystem services that human well-being depends upon (Biggs et al. 2012; Rocha et al. 2015). Regime shifts are costly, often difficult to anticipate, and sometimes impossible to reverse because the pathways for degradation and recovery differ from each other (Folke et al. 2004; Scheffer and Carpenter 2003; Suding and Hobbs 2009). Indigenous communities in Southern Africa manage a substantial share of CPRs, such as wildlife, forests, rangelands, and water resources. Without sound CPR institutions or effective external policies, they risk overexploitation. Seventy per cent of households in the region live in marginalized rural areas and depend heavily on natural resources under communal tenure for survival (DeGeorges and Reilly 2009). They are thus particularly vulnerable to regime shifts. Unfortunately, such shifts are hard to detect early, for example because elephants reach maturity slowly, so people perceive environmental change only long after it has occurred. This study is motivated by a CPR dilemma where collective action is required to manage several CPRs produced in one ecosystem in a sustainable manner and to avoid regime shifts. We focus on CPRs because their joint utilization can present severe management and coordination challenges and because they are common in developing countries. In this study both pastures and elephants are CPRs and benefit the community, but for simplicity, individual resource users only influence the elephant population directly through hunting. Poor management could trigger a regime shift leading to an abrupt and persistent change in the growth rates of both CPRs. We use a framed field experiment with communities managing wildlife under the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) in Zimbabwe.Footnote 1 We compare a policy intervention in the form of a quota (sanctioned with costly punishment) with an intervention that informs resource users about a potential regime shift and an intervention where both instruments are combined. Comprehending human behaviour in relation to regime shifts is imperative, particularly in the context where livelihoods of poor communities depend heavily on the associated ecosystem services. However, despite an abundance of case studies of different types of regime shifts across the globe (see e.g., www.regimeshifts.org), there is limited empirical research on humans’ behavioural responses to regime shifts that affect the flow of ecosystem services. This research is dominated by experimental approaches because it is challenging to observe how exactly behaviour changes in relation to a regime shift in the field. Most of these studies use controlled behavioural experiments in the form of CPR games (Lindahl et al. 2021). The effects of ecosystem regime shifts on individual and collective behaviour has been studied in the laboratory (lab) with students as participants (Schill et al. 2015; Lindahl et al. 2016a, 2016b; Maas et al. 2017; Ahsanuzzaman et al. 2022), and in the field with small-scale fishers in Colombia (Schill and Rocha (in press); Rocha et al. 2020) and Thailand (Lindahl and Jarungrattanapong 2022), or communal farmers in Namibia and South Africa (Prediger et al. 2011). None of these experiments have considered the effects of ecosystems regime shifts in a context relevant for community wildlife conservation, a context in which the resources coming from the same ecosystem are coupled. Each of the two linked CPRs’ (pastures and elephants) growth rates can drop dramatically below some threshold stock levels (depensation). Passing the thresholds triggers an ecosystem regime shift (bush encroachment). By doing so, our approach builds on the study by Lindahl et al. (2016a), who studied behavioural responses to a drastic drop in one CPR. Moreover, there is limited understanding of the relative effectiveness of institutional features such as sanctioned quotas,Footnote 2 information about resource dynamics or the combination of both to influence sustainable outcomes in a regime shift context. While there are some insights from a lab context (Lindahl et al. 2016b), we are not aware of any field experiment that tests different interventions with participants from communities for which ecosystem regime shifts are of serious concern.",1

Vincent,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Economists routinely use treatment effects models to evaluate government programs’ causal impacts on observed outcomes (Imbens and Wooldridge 2009; Athey and Imbens 2017). Identifying causal relationships requires addressing various potential sources of bias, including non-random selection, confounding, and spillover effects. Economists have developed a variety of quasi-experimental impact evaluation methods to address these biases, including matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences. These methods implicitly assume that the economic outcomes of interest are observable. In some settings, however, economists only observe outcomes measured in physical terms, which might lack well-defined economic interpretations. Although impact evaluations using physical outcomes might be feasible, their results do not necessarily serve as useful proxies for programs’ economic impacts. This paper presents a method for inferring the economic impact of a program when outcomes are observed in physical terms. We present this method in the context of forest conservation and demonstrate its empirical application by evaluating a forest zoning system in Thailand that aimed at protecting mangrove forests. Mangroves are coastal ecosystems located in the tropics and subtropics that provide a wide range of benefits to local and global populations. In a series of papers, Mäler and colleagues listed these benefits as including the production of shellfish, firewood, timber, and game; feeding and nursery areas for commercially important fish; shoreline and storm protection; nesting, resting, and feeding sites for birds; and carbon sequestration (Mäler et al. 1996, 2008, 2009; Arrow et al. 2000). A large literature confirms the economic importance of these benefits (Himes-Cornell et al. 2018), including in Thailand (Barbier 2007).Footnote 1 Private land owners, however, often have incentives to convert forests, including mangroves, to more profitable land uses. Since the free market likely fails to supply the socially optimal amount of forest, governments often intervene by implementing forest conservation programs, including protected areas, payments for ecosystem services, and community-based forest management. Most impact evaluations of these programs use forest cover as the outcome variable and aim to measure a program’s causal effect on avoided deforestation (Blackman 2013; Lan and Yin 2017). An impact evaluation of this type defines a program’s average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) as the difference between the realized forest cover change in treated areas—i.e., sites where the program was implemented—and the counterfactual forest cover change that would have occurred in the same areas had they not been treated. The ATT for avoided deforestation is a good proxy for a forest conservation program’s economic impact only if the benefits and costs of conservation are homogeneous (Vincent 2016). Environmental economics theory has recognized that environmental values can instead vary spatially and that government programs to protect the environment must account for this variation since at least Mäler’s (1974) seminal treatise. There is abundant evidence that both the benefits (e.g., carbon sequestration, Asner et al. 2010; biodiversity habitat, Gibson et al. 2011; Le Saout et al. 2013; watershed services, Pattanayak and Kramer 2001; Brauman et al. 2007) and the costs (Naidoo et al. 2006; Polasky 2008) of conservation are highly heterogeneous. Mäler et al. (2008; 2009) emphasize that the economic benefits of maintaining mangroves are “very case sensitive” and can vary greatly by location due to differences in ecological, economic, and institutional conditions. A program that increases forest cover by, for instance, 20% thus does not necessarily increase forest value by 20% too. Depending on the distribution of benefits and costs across the sites included in a program, the ATT for avoided deforestation can either overestimate or underestimate the ATT for a program’s economic impact. We develop an indirect way to estimate the ATT for a forest conservation program’s economic impact by building on work by Heckman (2010), who emphasized the structural framework embedded in treatment effects models. We employ a discrete-choice Roy (1951) model to describe the process of selection into treatment. One can view this model as a random utility model (RUM; McFadden 1973; Manski 1977) and parametrically estimate the effects of forest attributes on behavior in response to a conservation program. A byproduct of this procedure is the estimated propensity score. We show that under certain conditions, a transformation of the propensity score has a utility interpretation, where utility is as perceived by the government agency that decides which forests to include in the program. We use this transformation as a weight to construct a utility-weighted ATT. This new metric can be viewed as a generalized form of the ATT for avoided deforestation, and it offers a better measure of the ATT for a forest conservation program’s economic impact, at least as perceived by the government. Our method connects the impact evaluation literature to the non-market valuation literature. Propensity score matching is a common impact evaluation technique, and random utility models are widely applied in valuing non-market goods (Freeman et al. 2014). We show how to combine these two approaches and exploit their respective advantages. In doing so, we contribute to filling a gap in the environmental policy analysis literature, in which valuation and evaluation are disconnected (Ferraro et al. 2012). Our empirical analysis focuses on mangrove protection in Thailand. In 1987, recognizing both the high value of Thailand’s mangroves and their rapid loss (Charuppat and Charuppat 1997), the Thai government introduced a zoning system for managing the nation’s mangroves (Havanond 2008). This system assigned mangroves to different categories that varied in terms of restrictions on forest use, including conversion to non-forest land uses. We evaluate the zoning system using both the ATT for avoided deforestation and the utility-weighted ATT that we develop, and we compare the results. The utility-weighted ATT indicates that the system avoided the loss of 12.8% of the economic value associated with the protected mangrove area. This impact is about a quarter smaller than the conventional ATT for avoided deforestation, 17.3 percentage points. The difference between the two measures indicates that the zoning system tended to be less effective at reducing deforestation in locations where the government perceived the net benefits of protection as being greater. This relationship is the opposite of what one would expect for a maximally effective program. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical foundations and econometric aspects of our method. Section 3 applies the method to the mangrove zoning system in Thailand. The last section discusses the interpretation of the utility-weighted ATT and its limitations as an evaluation metric.",6

To incentivize private investment in RES, governments around the world engage in costly support mechanisms that mostly come in the form of investment or production subsidies.Footnote 1 These subsidies implicitly build on the assumption that decision-makers act rationally by evaluating private costs and benefits when making their investment choices. Behavioral economics, however, has shown in different contexts that rationality is not necessarily a good assumption (DellaVigna 2009). When utility is context dependent and optimal decision-making involves the prediction of future utility levels, behavioral biases can lead to consumers misvaluing costs and benefits, influencing their decision-making (Loewenstein et al. 2003; Bordalo et al. 2012, 2013, see for instance). This paper studies the presence of behavioral deviations from the rational agent framework in the decision of households to adopt rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) systems. More precisely, I ask whether variations in local weather conditions have an impact on household solar PV adoption decisions. The rational agent framework suggests that long-term investments in rooftop solar PV should not be affected by short-term weather fluctuations, as these do not impact the long-term investment profitability. In contrast, I show that households respond to variations in sunshine and related weather variables and in particular, that exceptionally sunny episodes can lead to increased solar PV uptake. I test for a variety of competing mechanisms and find suggestive evidence that household decisions are affected by factors in line with projection bias and salience. According to projection bias, weather deviations from the long-term mean can impact investment decisions when households ‘project’ profit expectations, based on current weather, into the future. On the other hand, exceptional sunny periods can make the financial benefits related to solar PV investment more ‘salient’, leading to adoption decisions. Providing evidence for behavioral anomalies in the context of solar PV panel adoption, a highly irreversible investment good that receives large amount of subsidies, can offer important insights into the diffusion process of other environmentally-friendly technologies.Footnote 2 To empirically test for the impact of short-lived weather variations on solar PV adoption decisions, I rely on administrative data for solar PV installations in Germany and combine these with detailed weather data. I focus on Germany, a world leader in solar PV deployment, as its institutional features are particularly well-suited for this analysis. First, the distinctive design of feed-in tariffs (FiTs), the main support mechanism for renewable energy investment, guarantees positive financial returns to investors and provides rather stable investment conditions prior to 2014 in an otherwise quickly changing market environment. The presence of this single policy instrument allows potential solar PV customers to calculate their expected financial returns of the investment with little uncertainty. Second, given the long project horizon of approximately 20 years, rational agents should not respond to short-term variations in weather as their average returns will not be affected. This is particularly true as there exists a time gap between the decision to adopt solar PV (purchase period) and the time when the installation is completed and starts to produce electricity.Footnote 3 Third, the adoption of a rooftop solar PV system involves a large financial commitment, comparable to the purchase of a car, which makes it a particularly interesting setting to study. For my analysis, I recover the long-term weather (climate) distribution for each county and look at the differences of actual weather from the long-term averages in a typical county-week. This measure captures the intensity of the weather deviation with respect to the climatic normal. As a second measure, I also consider discretized weather shocks, defined as a weather realization one standard deviation above the long-term mean. In my main specification, I regress solar PV uptake on these weather variables during the purchase period, 6–12 weeks prior to the observed installation date, controlling for a rich set of county and time fixed-effects. My empirical identification strategy takes advantage of the randomness of local weather as well as the time gap between decision-making and completion of the installation. I find strong evidence that sunshine during the purchase period impacts residential solar PV installation decisions in line with the average installation timing. A one standard deviation increase in sunshine hours leads to an approximate increase of 4.7% in solar PV installations. On the other hand, I find a negative and significant impact for precipitation and cloud cover, and a non-significant response to temperature on solar PV uptake. I provide additional evidence to support the causal interpretation of my findings and perform several robustness checks for the main empirical analysis. In particular, I show that large installations, which are typically adopted by profit-maximizing firms are not affected by the same weather response. Moreover, I show that short-lived sunshine shocks lead to additional solar PV installations at the aggregate level, employing monthly data. An important question concerns the underlying channels that explain these effects. In order to further elaborate on the mechanisms, I test for non-linear effects of weather variables and heterogeneous responses to sunshine deviations due to differences in average profitability (solar radiation). I find evidence that households respond to both large and small deviations from the long-term averages and that these effects are non-symmetric. Moreover, I show that sunshine can have heterogeneous impacts based on the average financial profitability of the investment. While these results do not allow me to clearly disentangle projection bias from salience as main mechanism, they indicate that both these mechanisms are present in my setting. I provide additional evidence that the results are likely not driven by other mechanisms affecting investment decisions such as consumer learning, myopia, and beliefs about climate change. Another major concern is that some of the effect could be driven by supply-side responses to weather. To provide evidence that the impact of weather on solar PV installations is driven by the demand, I take advantage of regional summer holiday schedules in Germany to show that in case exceptional sunny periods coincide with the main vacation period, exceptional sunshine does not lead to new installations, while installer activity does not seem to be affected. Furthermore, I obtain data on solar PV prices from a price-comparison website and marketing activities of solar installers through an online survey to show that there are no price discounts during exceptionally sunny periods and that installers do not appear to adapt their outreach activities to the weather. Finally, I study the interaction between online search behavior and exceptional sunshine. All these tests indicate that the main effects on solar PV adoption are not driven by the supply. This paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, there exists a large and growing body of literature, that tests for the impact of weather on people’s behavior and how this might affect economic outcomes. Several studies have related weather variables to financial markets, consumer spending, and other outcomes such as crime.Footnote 4 Most of these studies relate pleasant weather, such as sunshine, with good mood, which might affect behavior of economic agents. Weather has been also used in recent work to test for the presence of behavioral biases in field data. The present paper builds on the literature on projection bias in other consumer domains, such as the purchase of winter clothes (Conlin et al. 2007), college enrollment (Simonsohn 2010), car purchases (Busse et al. 2015), and outdoor movie sales (Buchheim and Kolaska 2017)Footnote 5, and provides evidence for behavioral biases in a large investment good, where weather (sunshine) can be directly linked to profit expectations. Much of the this literature relies on daily variations in weather and looks at short-run outcomes. In contrast, the institutional setting of the German solar PV market, specifically the time gap between decision-making and completion of the installation, allows me to rule out possible alternative mechanisms such as myopia for my findings. Benefits from the installation will only be perceived several weeks after the decision is made. This makes it unlikely that my results are driven by a share of highly myopic consumers that prefer to purchase the good on a sunny day or consumers with biased beliefs about the short-term evolution of weather. Second, this paper is among the first studies to provide empirical evidence for projection bias and salience as an important driver in the household decision to adopt a solar PV panel using administrative data and a revealed-preferences approach.Footnote 6 The paper most closely related is Liao (2020), who studies the impact of weather on solar PV cancellations in California, showing that households are more likely to cancel their contract in case the sign-up period is followed by unfavorable weather. Compared to her study, my contributions are twofold. First, in contrast to California, the German setting is particularly well-suited to study adoption decisions, as the presence of the FiT policy makes it profitable for households to invest in solar and to export all electricity produced rather than to self-consume electricity.Footnote 7 This feature allows me to neglect the potential impact of solar PV production on electricity demand and electricity prices and to focus purely on adoption decisions. Furthermore, given the richness of my data, I am able to test for the impact of individual weather variables, non-linear weather effects on adoption, and heterogeneity by average solar radiation in the county. Non-linear and heterogeneous effects are important as they provide evidence of salience in addition to projection bias effects. Moreover, studying factors influencing product sales is of first-order importance, if the main challenge in new technology diffusion, such as solar PV panels, is to generate uptake.Footnote 8 Second, I provide extensive evidence on alternative channels, collecting novel data from the installer market, elaborating on the link between online search behavior, weather, and solar PV adoption. In particular, I am able to provide evidence against supply-side effects, the most relevant alternative mechanism, when studying market-level outcomes. One potential caveat of focusing on adoption decisions is that sunshine might be related to other channels that impact adoption decisions through increased awareness rather than changes in valuations. However, my findings indicate that customers are responsive to large exceptional weather periods as well as to smaller deviations from the long-term weather averages, making increased awareness and interaction effects with peers and media unlikely to be the only driver for my results. Furthermore, exceptional sunshine might simply lead to short-term displacement of installations, with little impact on aggregate uptake and overall welfare. Yet, my findings show that short-lived sunshine shocks do have an impact on aggregate sales. In the energy context, the rationality of consumer choice has been extensively studied by how much consumers ‘undervalue’ fuel economy when purchasing a vehicle and in the context of the ‘energy-efficiency gap’, which describes the idea that even though investment in energy efficient goods is privately beneficial, technology uptake is generally low.Footnote 9 Behavioral biases in consumer decision-making and cognitive limitations in mental accounting have been put forward as potential channels to account for the existence of the energy-efficiency gap.Footnote 10 This paper contributes more broadly to the understanding of how behavioral factors can impact the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, such as solar PV panels. In this context, De Groote and Verboven (2019) estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of solar PV adoption in Belgium and show that households are myopic, in a sense that they significantly undervalue the future benefits from solar PV investment. Other papers have found strong evidence for peer-effects in the diffusion of solar PV panels (Bollinger and Gillingham 2012; Rode and Weber 2016, see for instance). Finally, in the context on solar PV adoption in Germany and the role of FiT policies, several papers model the diffusion of residential solar PV panels, with the objective to simulate policy changes in the FiT rates (Baur and Uriona 2018) or to highlight the importance of additional factors, such as geography and demographic factors, in modeling uptake (Schaffer and Brun 2015; Dharshing 2017). Germeshausen (2018) provides causal evidence for the impact of FiT on solar PV adoption, employing a bunching estimator. Concerning the application of behavioral factors on solar PV adoption, peer effects and influence from neighbors have been studied in the German context in Müller and Rode (2013), Rode and Weber (2016), Rode and Müller (2021). Similarly, Klein and Deissenroth (2017) analyze the role of loss aversion on solar PV adoption, relying on a “techno-economic” modeling approach in which they combine a net-present value analysis with prospect theory. They show that their proposed model fits the adoption dynamics well in the German residential sector. I contribute to this literature by testing for behavioral biases such as projection bias and salience in solar PV adoption, relying on rich micro-level data and credible exogenous identification from variations in local weather patterns. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides additional institutional details on the German solar PV market and discusses the implications of projection bias and salience on solar PV investment. Section 3 describes the data and empirical strategy. The main results are presented in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 discusses the findings in light of competing mechanisms. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

An analysis of Public Financial Schemes in France,May 2023,Bettina Chlond,Claire Gavard,Lisa Jeuck,Female,Female,Female,Female,"As global greenhouse gas emission constraints are becoming more stringent, substantial reductions must be achieved in all economic sectors. The residential sector consumes a large share of total energy. Residential users account for on average 18.4% of the total fuel consumption in OECD countries in 2017 (IEA 2019) and 25.7% in the EU (EC 2018). The energy efficiency gap, i.e. the difference between actual and optimal energy use (Jaffe and Stavins 1994), remains high in this sectorFootnote 1 due to reasons such as inattention of residents (Palmer and Walls 2015), the landlord-tenant dilemma (Allcott and Greenstone 2012) and high non-monetary costs of energy efficiency investments (Fowlie et al. 2015).Footnote 2 In attempts to close the gap, governments offer a variety of publicly funded financial incentives, including direct subsidies and other instruments, to encourage households to conduct conservation works that improve energy efficiency and thereby also help to reduce GHG emissions.Footnote 3 Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of these government policies is essential to gain insights on which support schemes achieve the highest energy reduction for each euro of public money spent. This matters for fiscal policy, especially in times of constrained public budgets. The involved redistribution between higher and lower income groups also matters. To be able to meaningfully compare instruments in an ex-post evaluation, researchers need data on different instruments that were implemented under the same administration during the same period. In this paper, we assess the performance of four types of financial schemes used to support residential energy conservation works (retrofits) that were all implemented in France between 2014 and 2016: a grant scheme for low-income households, a reduction of the value-added tax (VAT), an income tax credit and the White Certificates. The latter are certificates that French energy suppliers have to collect to a certain amount in exchange for helping energy consumers to reduce their energy consumption. Energy suppliers can then trade the certificates among each other to achieve the energy reductions set by the government. We use the TREMI2017 survey data produced by the French Environment and Energy Agency (ADEME). The dataset covers close to 14,000 observations at household-level and includes information on works related to energy conservation and the adoption of specific financial support schemes.Footnote 4 To address potential endogeneity and self-selection bias, we employ double-robust inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators.Footnote 5 IPW uses the propensity score to compute weights based on the inverse probability of treatment. The procedure assigns high weights to observations in the control and treated group that are most comparable. The double-robust feature additionally employs predictive information of the covariates on the outcomes. As such, the estimator is robust to incorrect specification of either the propensity score or the outcome model and is consistent if only one of the models is correctly specified. We estimate the effect of adopting each scheme on the funding acquired, the private and total investment by households, and the reduction of households’ energy expenses. For each scheme, we use these estimates to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of public funds to reduce energy expenses, the ability of the schemes to induce private investment (leverage effect) and their capacity to increase total investment (additionality). We compare the four schemes along these criteria. We also analyse the distributional effects of the schemes based on the reduction in energy expenses and the funding received for low- versus high-income households. We find that the White Certificates scheme is most cost-effective, followed by the VAT reduction and the grant scheme. The income tax credit is the least cost-effective. The VAT reduction triggers most additional private investment into conservation works, followed by the income tax credit and the White Certificates scheme. The grant scheme for low-income households does not trigger any additional private investment. The VAT reduction also has the highest capability to increase total investment, followed by the income tax credit and the White Certificates. The grant scheme induces least additional total investment. For each of the four schemes, households in the upper and lower half of the income distribution equally benefit in terms of funding received and reduction in energy expenses. Earlier studies set in the US context have diverse findings. While Walsh (1989) does not find any effect of a change in the income tax credit on the propensity to invest, Hassett and Metcalf (1995) find that a 10 percentage point decrease in the value-added tax on energy investment increases the propensity to invest by 24%. Estimates for the cost-effectiveness of financial support schemes to increase residential energy efficiency range between US$3.9 cent and US$47.9 cent per kWh in a heat pump rebate program in Maryland (Alberini and Towe 2015; Alberini et al. 2016). Few studies exist in the European context. Alberini and Bigano (2015) find an Italian income tax credit program to have no effect on the propensity to replace heating equipment. Blaise and Glachant (2019) assess the average impact of conservation works on energy savings in France without differentiating between support schemes. The novelty of our work in comparison with the existing literature is fourfold. First, we present a comprehensive comparison of the performance of four different financial support schemes, while previous econometric studies have commonly focused on one or two schemes. The comparison becomes possible due to the availability of data on energy efficiency works and the use of four financial schemes that were all implemented during the same time period in the same country. Second, we assess the performance of four schemes after adoption while most previous studies analyze the effect of a scheme on the uptake of conservation works. The empirical evidence on the performance after adoption is rare. Third, we compare four schemes according to the criteria of cost-effectiveness, redistribution, additionality of investment and leverage for private investment, whereas earlier studies usually focus on one dimension only, which prevents them from uncovering trade-offs between different performance dimensions. Finally, we provide new insights on the EU perspective. Previous studies that focus on the US context may not carry external validity for the EU context since they are placed in a different institutional and cultural setting. Further empirical evidence on EU member states matters.",

Striking the balance between economic growth and environmental performance has been the catchphrase of most recent studies (Song et al. 2018). Although many scholarly discourses and parleys have recently been focused on environmental efficiency evaluations, there still exists more room for comprehensive studies to investigate the possible effects of economic growth on the environment to help in the conception and formulation of robust sustainability policies. The economy of Asia Pacific includes the ever-expanding and developing nations like India and China, and plays pivotal roles in the increasing global warming. Recent reports indicate that five countries of the top ten highest emitters of CO2 in the world are in Asia (China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia) (Li et al. 2022; Mohmmed et al. 2019). The world’s fuel-based CO2 emission continued to escalate, with China being responsible for 27% of the world’s total greenhouse gases according to a Global Carbon Project report in 2021 (Global Carbon Project 2021). The Asia Pacific region has plans of transitioning to the use of renewable energy and electricity generation via nuclear and natural gas, however, fossil fuel, particularly coal burning continues to be the main source of carbon emissions (Droege 2011). The increasing interest of people in the use of resources and its resultant eco-problems led to Fare et al.’s proposition of environmental efficiency (Färe et al. 1989). The concept is considered to be of theoretical value and practically significant. Environmental efficiency means simultaneously maximizing good outputs whiles minimizing the use of inputs such as energy, labor, etc., and bad outputs such as CO2 (Long et al. 2017). A number of studies have been conducted on environmental efficiency in Asia and other parts of the world including the effect of renewable energy consumption (Jiang et al. 2022), relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, financial development and energy consumption (Chunyu et al. 2021), and the correlation between ICT, renewable energy, financial development, and CO2 emissions (Batool et al. 2022). Previous studies have used the Malmquist Luenberger Productivity Index and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate environmental efficiency in China (Piao et al. 2019), as well as the SBM Metafrontier to estimate the effect of fertilizer usage intensity on environmental efficiency (Long et al. 2018). Using the SBM DEA model, Liu et al. (2020) evaluated environmental efficiency in the transport industry while other researchers have employed the Super efficiency DEA model to estimate the environmental efficiency of Asia Pacific and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies respectively (Twum et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021). However, most of these studies were conducted from single country’s perspective, and the few that considered multi countries did not look at environmental efficiency convergence. Moreover, human capital was not explored as this study seeks to do. Moreover, researchers have emphasized the importance of human capital in economic growth and environmental efficiency. Economic growth is basically driven by human capital accumulation over time and human capital is found to encourage environmental performance in Asia pacific (Twum et al. 2021). Empirical studies established that people with formal education showcase a more pollution-free behavior comparatively, and human capital is favorably influenced by climate change (Kurowski et al. 2022; Tolppanen et al. 2022). For example, in the investigation of the relationship between human capital and environmental quality, using a sample size of 3900 adults, a study found that persons who have higher education tend to grow more environmentally concerned over global warming and exhibit willingness to take environmental actions than those with none (Chankrajang and Muttarak 2017). Moreover, consumer behavior is positively driven by knowledge about climate change (Kurowski et al. 2022), thus human capital remains the primary source of innovation. Literature has extensively discussed convergence in efficiency from a diverse perspective. Criado et al., (2011) confirmed convergence when they studied growth and pollution convergence in European countries within the period of 1980–2005. Convergent clubs, showing different energy intensities are identified among 193 cities within China (Zhu and Lin 2020), where they discovered that foreign direct investment (FDI) and industrial structure drive the formation of these convergent cubs. In the exploration of environmental efficiency and convergence in OECD economies, Camarero et al. (2013) used Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Sulphur dioxide as proxies for environmental pollution, and observed improvement in environmental performance in the OECD countries. They also established a club convergence among the efficient economies. Xu et al. (2020), and studied the dynamic convergence of eco-efficiency in China. Through the application of the Super Efficiency SBM model as well as the dynamic spatial Durbin Model (DSDM), they found a positive autocorrelation in inter-regional Eco-efficiency and established steadiness in convergence over time as environmental efficiency narrowed (Long et al. 2017). A similar study investigated the convergence of environmental efficiency in over 104 countries from 1980 to 2016 and established conditional convergence based on globalization, energy price, and industrial structure (Sun et al. (2020). While Barassi et al. (2011) investigated the stochastic convergence of CO2 in OECD economies, other researchers have examined the same stochastic convergence in per capita CO2 emissions in other emerging economies (Awaworyi Churchill et al. 2020; Yirong 2022). Barassi et al. (2011) showed that CO2 emissions converge over time, although quite slowly. Long et al. (2017) assessed convergence from a sector base and analyzed the environmental efficiency of the cement producers in China, and confirmed convergence in the East, West, and Middle of China. This current study considers a 29-year period, and shows a possibility of convergence among the countries in the Asia Pacific region. This study contributes to the literature on environmental efficiency based on a panel of 14 economies in the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific has made attempts to transition into low-carbon economies, hence, the relevance in assessing environmental efficiency and convergence. Unlike extant studies on environmental efficiency, the novelties of this study are as follows. Firstly, this study analyzes the relationship between trade competitiveness and environmental efficiency. Secondly, the study combines stochastic, absolute β-convergence, and conditional β-convergence to explore the different convergence tendencies within the Asia Pacific regions. Finally, the effect of green technology on environmental efficiency convergence in the Asia Pacific will be analyzed, considering endogenous growth. The knowledge gaps of this study are as follows. First, environmental efficiency is explored across the Asia Pacific region via integrating stochastic, absolute β-convergence, and conditional β-convergence. Stochastic convergence via panel unit root test can overcome the demerits of conventional β-convergence, which might have invalid inference. Furthermore, we also analyze how green technology and human capital impact environmental efficiency from the perspective of endogenous growth. Third, we also analyze effect of trade competitiveness impact environmental efficiency. Last, environmental efficiency is evaluated via metafrontier super EBM efficiency. Metafrontier has the merits to consider the heterogeneity of environmental technology. Super efficiency has the advantages of discriminating different DMUs with the same efficiency value. EBM can address the demerits of conventional CCR and SBM(slacks-based measure). CCR has the demerits of ignoring input excesses or output shortfalls. SBM has the demerits that cannot allow for the proportionate changes of inputs and outputs. The remaining sections are demarcated as follows: section two captures the data and model, section three entails the methodology, whiles sections four and five feature the results, discussion, conclusion, and possible policy recommendations based on findings.",4

Understanding the evolution and drivers of comparative advantage in green productions is particularly important given the growing interest around the so-called green economy as a way to create new business opportunities related to environmental preservation and climate change mitigation. This view recently culminated in the launch of the European Green Deal by the European Commission in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Agrawala et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020). Developing a first-mover advantage in new high-demand products such as electric cars and PV panels was also a strategic goal of the generous fiscal stimulus implemented by President Obama after the great recession, the so-called American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Popp et al. 2021). Despite its key strategic role for a country’s future competitiveness (Fankhauser et al. 2013), data constraints have so far limited empirical research on the green economy. We contribute to filling this gap by examining the drivers of green specialisation in EU manufacturing industries over two decades. In doing so, we assemble a new dataset that leverages granular product-level data to construct measures of green production shares and Balassa indexes of specialisation for 4-digit manufacturing industries. Understanding where green productions are located and why, is a first step to assess the potential benefits of a demand push for the green economy. For instance, job creation effects depend on where production is located rather than on where knowledge is created. This paper contributes to the literature on industry specialisation being the first to systematically focus on green industries, namely on industries producing goods that reduce negative environmental impacts. In our main empirical analysis, we build on the standard framework used to study the drivers of industry specialisation (Midelfart-Knarvik et al. 2000; Romalis 2004; Bombardini et al. 2012; Nicoletti et al. 2020). Mulatu et al. (2010) adopt this framework to study the role of environmental policies and other structural drivers in the location choices of polluting industries in a static, cross-sectional analysis. We enrich this framework by exploiting the panel dimension of our data. This is particularly relevant to study patterns of comparative advantage in emerging and new products such as green ones. Moreover, we take stock from the findings of the recent empirical literature on green innovation to include three new drivers of green specialisation: i. path dependency and persistency of first-mover advantage (e.g., Aghion et al. 2016); ii. complementarity with non-green capabilities (e.g., Perruchas et al. 2020); and iii. diversification of the knowledge base (e.g., Colombelli and Quatraro 2019). With respect to the few papers on green specialisation using export (Mealy and Teytelboym 2020) or patent data (Perruchas et al. 2020; Barbieri et al. 2020), we highlight the importance of observing the fine-grained structure of production across sectors and countries (and not only across countries) to understand specialisation patterns. In doing so, we provide a new angle and a new dataset for the analysis of green innovation that so far has mostly used patents (e.g., Popp 2002; Nesta et al. 2014; Calel and Dechezleprêtre 2016) or self-reported measures of innovation (Frondel et al. 2007, Horbach et al. 2012). While most climate (e.g. Nordhaus and Boyer 2000) and endogenous growth models (e.g. Bovenberg and Smulders 1995) give prominent importance to R&D-driven green innovation, knowledge is also created during the production stage, through learning by doing, as postulated in growth theory (Romer 1990) and innovation studies (Arrow 1971; Hatch and Mowery 1998; Clarke 2006). Overall, patents and productions capture two complementary channels of the process of building a green comparative advantage. We offer new data and evidence on the production channel, which has been comparatively understudied in the literature. A crucial step to provide new evidence on green specialisation is to construct a time-consistent measure of green production that varies at the country-year-sector (detailed 4-digit NACE rev. 2 sectors) level. To this end, we harmonize a product-level dataset compiled by Eurostat for the manufacturing sector, called PRODCOM, using the methodology proposed by Van Beveren et al. (2012). To identify green products, we first select candidate lists of products that have been proposed during recent international negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the OECD. We then refine these lists by eliminating goods with double usages to obtain a favourite list of products that we use to construct  measures of green production at the sector-by-country level. While previous works used product-level data at the country level to study trade patterns in green products (Fraccascia et al. 2018; Mealy and Teytelboym 2020), our new dataset is the first that allows to study green production (rather than just trade) along three dimensions: country, year and highly granular 4-digit industries. Our empirical analysis uncovers a set of novel facts concerning the structure of green production in European manufacturing industries. First, we show that green production is just 2–2.5% of total manufacturing production in Europe. This is in the ballpark of the most precise US measures of the green economy (Elliott and Lindley 2017; Vona et al. 2019). This finding suggests that a very granular dataset such as the one assembled in this paper is crucial to studying green specialisation. This insight is further supported by our second key finding: green production is extremely concentrated in a set of high-medium tech industries mostly producing capital goods. At the 2-digit level, 9 out of 26 manufacturing industries have non-null green production. However, of the 119 4-digit industries contained in those green 2-digit industries, only 21 are green, and 13 of those represent 94.9% of the total green production. Last, we find that, even at a rather coarse level of aggregation (2-digit industries), polluting and green productions occur in two disjoint sets of industries. Consequently, the industries bearing the cost of environmental regulation will be different from those that will receive most of the benefits of the green industrial policies. This difference in the industry exposure to environmental policies also has consequences at the country level. Northern countries, especially Denmark, Sweden and Germany (along with Austria), exhibit a persistent green comparative advantage. In contrast, lower income countries, such as Greece, Romania and Bulgaria and some traditionally industrial economies, such as Italy and Belgium, have retained a specialisation in polluting productions. Going beyond these descriptive facts, we examine the drivers of green specialisation at the country-industry level using panel data econometrics, following the approach described above (e.g., Midelfart-Knarvik et al. 2000; Romalis 2004). Consistent with the descriptive evidence, green specialisation exhibits path dependency, confirming the importance of first-mover advantages. Although our empirical strategy is not designed for policy evaluation, environmental policies seem to contribute to building a first-mover advantage in green industries, while they do not appear to be effective for catching-up or maintaining such advantage. Our regressions also reveal a complementarity between green and non-green specialisation within the same narrowly defined 4-digit industries, although the magnitude of the association is smaller than the persistency of the lead start advantage. Finally, diversifying the portfolio of green products with comparative advantage is also important for sustaining green specialisation. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses conceptual issues in defining green production, provides details on the PRODCOM data we use to compile our dataset and on how we refine existing lists to obtain our favourite one. Section 3 presents descriptive evidence on industry-level dynamics of green production across European countries. Section 4 looks at specialisation in green production at the country level and relates it to environmental policies. Section 5 builds on the descriptive results of the previous sections and looks at drivers of country-industry specialisation in green specialisation. In Sect. 6, we summarize our main findings and provide future research avenues.",
