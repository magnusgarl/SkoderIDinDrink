34,1,Homo Oeconomicus,08 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41412-017-0040-9,Proposals for a Democracy of the Future,April 2017,Bruno S. Frey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Democracy is an old and honorable institution already discussed and practiced in ancient Greece. Over the centuries, it has had its ups and downs, and has transformed itself by allowing (former) slaves and women to have the right to vote. However, democracy is not very dynamic. For instance, the construction of the European Union—which, of course, claims to be democratic—can hardly be considered a further development of the democratic idea for the twenty-first century. Rather, in large measure it represents falling back to the rule of professional politicians who fill the ranks of the European commission, other executive agencies and of the European parliament. Neither do national countries seriously deal with the challenge of the digital world that may impose totally different forms of information, discussion and voting. This contribution focuses on how direct participation of citizens in the political process could be further developed in order to still be prosperous in the future. Recently, there have been strong attacks against existing democracy such as by Brennan (2016) in his book Against Democracy or Van Reybrouck (2016) in his book Against Elections: The Case for Democracy. I consider direct participation rights of people to be a desideratum. The issue I deal with is where, when, and to what extent such participation rights should exist. As a Swiss, direct democratic institutions of my country influence my considerations. The country has fared well with direct democracy. Econometric analyses suggest that Switzerland’s high-income level has been positively influenced by direct democracy (see Kirchgässner et al. 1999; Kirchgässner and Feld 2000; Kirchgässner 2015). Switzerland is also top in many rankings.Footnote 1 Moreover, the Swiss are, next to Denmark, the happiest people in the world (see e.g. World Happiness Report 2016, Update). According to Frey and Stutzer (2000, 2002), when comparing the 26 cantons in Switzerland, and controlling for dozens of other factors influencing happiness, the different possibilities of citizens to participate by direct votes in referendums significantly influence the subjective well-being of citizens. Moreover, foreigners who have no voting rights are less satisfied with their lives than are Swiss citizens even controlling for a large number of other determinants of subjective well-being. When foreign inhabitants in Switzerland get the Swiss nationality, their happiness rises because they are now entitled to participate not only in elections but also in the great number of national, cantonal and communal referendums. I do not intend to provide a survey of direct democracy. This has been done elsewhere (e.g. Frey 1994; Frey and Goette 1998; Kriesi 2005). Rather, I present several concrete proposals of how direct participation rights could be reformed. This discussion is based on the Public Choice approach,Footnote 2 i.e. assuming that individuals are rational actors and respond systematically to relative prices determined by institutional conditions (see e.g. Brennan and Hamlin 2000; Mueller 1996, 1997). The goal is to widen the scope of the present analysis of democracy by suggesting novel ideas to further develop democracy. The author is well aware that all these proposals can be undermined by strategic action.Footnote 3 However, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite-Theorem states that all public decision-making mechanisms are subject to possible strategic action. Thus, the novel proposals here advanced are not the only ones subject to this problem. In what exact way my proposals can be influenced by strategic action, and what mechanisms can be introduced to reduce its impact, must be left to future research. Section 2 shortly considers the application of democracy to new areas. While this aspect has been rarely undertaken, it has been intensively discussed in the social sciences. Section 3 suggests variable voting weights according to several dimensions. The following Sect. 4 discusses a possible reform of how to deal with close referendum outcomes. Section 5 introduces random procedures to improve democracy. Section 6 concludes.",19

The current paper attempts to build on this work by examining the birth location, migration and clustering patterns of 146 of the most important Western philosophers over two millennia (see full list in Table A1).Footnote 1
 Collins (1998) in his majestic tome, The Sociology of Philosophies, a Global Theory of Intellectual Change, covered in great detail the whole spectrum both time-wise and in terms of an extensive coverage of non-Western philosophers. He also very much emphasized the clustering effect operating among philosophers as evidenced by the following. The history of philosophy is to a considerable extent the history of groups. Nothing abstract is meant here—nothing but groups of friends, discussion partners, close-knit circles that often have the characteristics of social movements. Take the upsurge of German Idealism, from Kant to Hegel and Schopenhauer. The first thing to strike us should be the dates: all the major works are between 1781 (Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason) and 1819 (Schopenhauer’s World as Will and Representation)—38 years, the approximate length of a generation. There is a social core: Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, who once lived together in the same house. Fichte takes the early lead, inspiring the others on a visit while they are young students at Tübingen in the 1790 s, then turning Jena into a center for the philosophical movement to which a stream of the soon-to-be-eminent congregate; then on to Dresden in the heady years 1799–1800 to live with the Romantic circle of the Schlegel brothers. (p. 3). Collins ranked philosophers according to how many pages of discussion they receive in various histories of philosophy and then divided them into dominant, major, secondary, and minor figures. No evidence is provided, though, on how precisely this was done. For Greece it is interesting that he had 8 dominant, 20 major, 68 secondary and 237 minor. He later uses a slightly different classification when dealing with the ‘significant’ figures in world history, which he estimates at between 135 and 500 philosophers. He also highlights and maps the personal connections between the significant philosophers but again the evidence for this is not made explicit. The purpose of this paper is to shed a little more light on the hugely informative work of Collins in three ways. First we seek to explain briefly why it might be expected that the most important philosophers would cluster, a topic addressed very well but in a general way by Collins. Second, following the expectation that there were strong arguments to expect them to cluster, we collected detailed data on 146 prominent or significant philosophers in terms of birth location and life-time migration. Third, we seek to examine the extent to which these philosophers worked in clusters, accompanied in most cases according to Collins by a large number of less important philosophers. Given the nature of the data set it is impossible to test any of the explanations posited in a formal way, but some evidence is supplied via case study which throws light perhaps on what explanations for clustering apply to philosophers. There have also been more ‘micro’ studies of clusters of creative workers, such as by Farrell (2001), and Oberlin and Gieryn (2015). The former examined thirteen creative clusters, covering visual artists, to literary artists to inventors of film, the aim being to establish common patterns in collaboration and friendship dynamics. The latter also examined in some detail three clusters of visual artists. It should be noted from the start, that while geographic clustering might occur, it does not follow automatically that it always lead to networking among philosophers. The nature, extent and benefit of networking that might have resulted from the geographic clustering of philosophers is for another paper. Section 2 though will examine the reasons why we might expect philosophers to want to network, through geographic clusters. If there are strong prima facie reasons for this, and it is found that they did in fact cluster over the millennia, then it might be reasonable to assume, a priori, that such benefits did ensue. Section 3 will address some methodological issues that arise in the collection and analysis of the data. Section 4 provides a summary of the key results regarding birth location and migration for the entire period. Section 5 takes a more detailed look at three major epochs in terms of migration and clustering: Ancient Greece (601 BC to 300 BC); the Scholastic period (1001 AD to 1300 AD); and the Post Scientific Revolution period (1610 AD to 1900 AD). Section 6 returns to the issues discussed in Sect. 2, namely why such clustering took place by examining the age at which the first major work of each philosopher was published and whether or not that took place prior to or after their first major migration (more than three months) for work reasons. Section 7 concludes the paper.",4

L. Economou,Nicholas C. Kyriazis,Theodore Metaxas,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Choice under democracy has been an ongoing issue for analysis by economists, political scientists and historians, since at least the appearance of the first democracy in Athens, in 510-507 BCE. Thus, although almost 2500 years separate ancient Athens from modern democracies, some elements of the political context under which choices are being made, seem to exhibit common characteristics. Here, we focus on three examples of choice between public good(s) and private consumption, under direct democracy procedures. We focus on direct democracy because it brings to the fore the two well-known problems of principal-agent and unbundling of issues. In this essay, we analyse Themistocles’ Naval Law of 483/2 BCE, California’s Proposition 13 of 1978 and Greece’s referendum of June 2015. We have chosen these three particular cases, instead of others, because of their differences concerning the actual institutional set-up and historic context, as well as because of their different outcomes: in the first case in favour of defense for the public good and increased taxation, in the second case against the increase of taxation which entailed fewer provisions of a variety of public goods (such as education, health and social services to vulnerable and at-risk residents) and in the third case, it was of no consequence because the outcome was different from the issues of the referendum’s vote (either more or less austerity measures). These differences make, we suggest, the comparison of the three cases interesting.Footnote 1
 The essay is organized as follows: in the next part, we discuss some general issues of choice, followed by an analysis of the similarities and differences between the three cases. Sections 3-5 analyse in greater detail our three cases: Themistocles’ Naval Law, California’s Proposition 13, and the Greek July 2015 referendum. Section 6 offers a comparative analysis of the three cases. In the conclusion, we offer our insights as to why the outcomes differ and the reasons leading to these differences.",9

A Survey of a Few Contributions and a Couple of Suggestions,April 2017,Gianpaolo Rossini,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Historical records of changes of property of large chunks of land are often associated to the aftermath of wars and colonization. One consequence of a conquer by a colonizing country is the manipulation or radical change of local land and real estate regime and registry (cadastre) system. The consequence is arbitrary expropriation of properties, with small or without compensation to the legitimate owners, for alleged security or public needs reasons or simply for the settlement of colons.Footnote 1 In poor colonized areas expropriation is even easier due to the absence of a legal regime for land and estate properties comparable to that of dominating countries. Moreover, in backward countries the popularity of market exchange is low. The introduction of property rights and marketability for land in less advanced countries where commons and orally recorded usage rights are popular is a violation of cultures and habits with dramatic externalities. Where land is not liable to be possessed privately there is no clear attribution of property rights. When land exchangeability is introduced in poor areas the market is poisoned with dramatic asymmetries. Poor incumbent users of land do not have neither the hard currency to resist buying pressures nor any ability to assess the market value of their resources. In peace postcolonial times the “legal” transfer of large properties in poor countries is, to some extent, quite a recent phenomenon, while the “illegal” or “strongly coactive” transfer has never stopped and has gone on with a surprising continuity since colonial times.Footnote 2 Quite often LSLAs occur where legal rules are either new, unclear or absent and private exclusive ownership of land and water are almost unknown to incumbent inhabitants (Cotula et al. 2011; Arezki et al. 2015). Official data, mainly from international development institutions, report that during the last ten years LSLAs have covered a ground surface (48 million ha) almost as large as Spain. The main statistical source of these assessments and of most empirical studies on the subject is the Land Matrix Database, (LMD) which reports recent (since 2000) land transfers (finalized and near to final settlement). This precious matrix is an open source data set which provides a global broad view of LSLA. It is based on updated information from different operators and statistical institutions worldwide. Unfortunately it has no official certification. Data from NGOs and other nonofficial sources make the figures produced by the LMD much larger since to those figures we should add smaller LSLAs made on a piecemeal basis in order to avoid frequent backlash raised by LSLA. These “small” acquisitions would rather add a relevant portion of transfers to published LMD data. LSLAs concern, most of the times, formerly or presently colonized countries. In some regions (such as Zimbabwe) these acquisitions target properties previously “belonging” to colonial farmers (who got them as conquer spoils at the time of colonization) that were later nationalized during the decolonization process. LSLA areas usually show high degree of inequality in the distribution of both wealth and the national product and are economically dependent upon the rich world or the affluent part of the country where LSLA takes place. LSLAs are carried out mainly by multinational enterprises, private financial institutions, large investors from advanced areas including Asia, the Persian Gulf and other emerging countries. These and other features of LSLA raise legitimate worries. Do LSLAs represent the last ditch effort of a disguised fresh wave of neocolonial appropriation of resources belonging to poor people, not able to develop with their own means? Or may LSLAs be an opportunity for the development of backward areas of the world? Different and opposing views are set forth in the literature, in public discussions and within international institutions such as the World Bank (WB). As it appears in Arezki et al. (2015) the WB did favor large foreign projects investments in farmland. Cotula et al. (2011) and other papers are on the opposite side and strongly criticize LSLAs which seem to reduce average welfare and to raise local tensions. Expected economic development is most of the times absent while displacement, anger, and increased inequality could be observed in several African areas such as Madagascar, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Senegal. Literature is quite skeptical about the benefits of selling land to foreigners for poor countries since they never receive proper compensation. Then, most of the aspects of LSLA point to an asymmetric relation between buyers and sellers of land that reminds closely expropriations of colonial type. The majority of international agencies used to recommend LSLA as a way to get out of poverty and underdevelopment. Recently the stance has changed within main development international institutions, including the WB. Our purpose is to survey some specific contributions to see how far are LSLAs from desirable deals for backward regions and how much colonialism is contained in them. In Sect. 2 we consider a case study paper, in Sect. 3 we analyze corruption in LSLAs, in Sect. 4 we go through fairness, in Sect. 5 we examine a game theoretical experimental assessment of LSLAs, in Sect. 6 we see some political economy and touch upon internal conflicts raised when LSLA takes place. In Sect. 7 we draw conclusions and provide a few policy suggestions.",1

While such categorization need not necessarily affect behavior, at times it certainly does. In this paper, we analyze how group membership affects behavior of recipients of actions towards innocent third parties, who happen to share the group membership with a previous, initial actor. More specifically, we want to know if, and if so under which circumstances, revenge is not only oriented at direct perpetrators, but expands to the entire group they belong to. At first sight it appears straightforward that people take revenge against entire groups, not only against direct individual perpetrators, even in routine social and economic life. For instance, consumers buy fewer products from countries which they see as politically antagonistic (Klein and Ettensoe 1999, Leong et al. 2008). Further, on days after terrorist bombings in Israel, Jewish (Arab) judges become more likely to favor Jewish (Arab) plaintiffs in their decisions, and Israeli Arabs face higher prices for used cars (Shayo and Zussman 2011; Zussman 2012). On a political level, for instance, Keynes (1922) perceived the Treaty of Paris’ devastation of the German economy as an act of revenge, and quoted Thomas Hardy’s play The Dynasts: “Nought remains/But vindictiveness here amid the strong,/And there amid the weak an impotent rage.” In its most extreme case, revenge against groups may trigger violent intergroup conflict. After an argument between an Indian Dalit and an upper caste farmer, upper caste villagers attacked 80 Dalit families (Hoff et al. 2011). In Atlanta, 1906, after newspaper allegations of black attacks on white women, a group of white people rioted, killing 25 black men (Bauerlein 2001). In both cases, innocent people were made to suffer for the real or supposed crimes of others. Many field studies of intergroup violence report similar tit-for-tat processes, with harm to members of one group being avenged by attacks on previously uninvolved coethnics of the original attackers (Horowitz 1985, 2001; Chagnon 1988). The psychology of reciprocity may indeed play a part in these phenomena. Laboratory experiments show that humans reciprocate harm done to them, even at a cost to themselves (Fehr and Gächter 2000; Falk and Fischbacher 2006). A natural extension, which would account for the episodes described above, is that humans reciprocate not only towards individuals, but also towards entire groups. We label retaliation against a perpetrator’s group members group reciprocity. However, these examples do not provide conclusive evidence for the motivations underlying group reciprocal behavior. In field studies it is hard to distinguish group reciprocity from in-group bias under external threat (Sherif et al. 1961), or from strategic considerations, e.g. if people are rewarded for defending their coethnics (Chagnon 1988). Therefore, to identify group reciprocity cleanly, we ran a computerized laboratory experiment. We emphasize that we do not believe real-world scenarios like those above can be recreated in the lab. This holds especially for episodes of violent conflict. However, experimenters can study analogous situations, such as intergroup contests and vendettas (Bornstein 1992, 2003; Weisel and Zultan 2013; Abbink and Herrmann 2009). Here, we test for an individual psychological mechanism which may underlie real-world phenomena. We also examine how inequality and unfairness affect group reciprocity. Our theory relates to existing work on in-group favouritism. As previous experiments show, people value group membership, and prefer to interact with others from their own group (Hargreaves-Heap and Zizzo 2009; Currarini and Mengel 2012). They cooperate more with in-group members (de Cremer and van Vugt 1999; Goette et al. 2006; Guala 2012). Group members give more to each other, punish each other less and reward each other more (Bernhard et al. 2006; Chen and Li 2009; Currarini and Mengel 2012). Shared group identity may also provide a simple coordination mechanism for individuals (Chen and Chen 2011). However, these phenomena appear insufficient to explain extreme prejudice of the form outlined above or even violence against outgroups (Brewer 1999). Indeed, in-group bias disappears when subjects allocate a “bad” such as exposure to aversive noise (Mummendey et al. 1992). In response to this explanatory gap, psychologists have developed theories of intergroup emotions, including “vicarious retribution”, a propensity to retaliate against groups (Lickel et al. 2006). We extend this literature by conducting an incentivized experiment which identifies group reciprocity, while avoiding a number of confounds. Of existing experiments, some have examined only verbal attitudes (Stenstrom et al. 2008), while others cannot cleanly distinguish individual-level reciprocity from group reciprocity, because the reciprocator’s choices affect the whole outgroup including the individual who committed the offence (Gaertner et al. 2008; Abbink and Herrmann 2009). Our design makes it clear to subjects that they are interacting with different members of the same group. Our experiment also differentiates group reciprocity from “generalized” or “downstream indirect” reciprocity. This is a phenomenon in which another person’s helpful/harmful behaviour causes the subject to help/harm other people in general (Dufwenberg et al. 2001; Greiner and Levatti 2005; Stanca 2009). Generalized reciprocity could be supported by various mechanisms, including learning, imitation, or changes in mood. By contrast, group reciprocity is directed specifically against the original offender’s group, not just against people in general. We distinguish group reciprocity from generalized reciprocity by including control treatments where subjects can reciprocate against a “neutral” third party. As well as testing for the existence of group reciprocity, we also make a start at understanding its correlates. We examine the relationship between group reciprocity and fairness perceptions. Qualitative studies and cross-country regressions both show a link between inequality, unfairness, and intergroup conflict (Tambiah 1996; Horowitz 2001; Cederman et al. 2011). In different experimental sessions we varied the perceived unfairness of intergroup allocations, by allocating a reward to one group either randomly, or as the reward for group performance in a quiz. We show that group reciprocity is only observed when rewards are allocated randomly—a treatment which subjects perceived as less fair. Also, subjects who perceived the experiment as less fair were more likely to group-reciprocate.",6

Hartwell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Critiques of neoclassical economics have increased in frequency and vehemence over the past decade, spurred on by the global financial crisis, manifesting themselves in one of two variants. The first category has been termed by Arnsperger and Varoufakis (2006) as “unsophisticated:” criticisms that focus mostly on orthodox conceptions of economic behavior and the market, railing against assumptions of rationality or individualistic “instrumentalism” and debating neoclassical assumptions at their margins. These criticisms tend to call for more of the same as an antidote for perceived failings, such as increased regulation (Crotty 2009), better monetary policy oversight (Allen and Snyder 2009), or massive increases in government spending through monetary manipulation (Wray 2011). However, a more sophisticated challenge to the ruling orthodoxy, arising from across the heterodox spectrum (O’Hara 2007 notes it may be the only thing uniting heterodox approaches), has instead confronted the entire foundation of neoclassical reasoning. This further critique has focused on Walrasian assumptions of equilibrium, taking up the original work of Scarf (1960) and Sonnenschein (1972) to call for a “post-Walrasian economics” (Colander Shelley 1998). Based in part upon real world experience (not least in the failures of development economics to bring much of the world out of poverty), the anti-equilibrium critique conjectured that reality contained multiple equilibria, and none of them was necessarily “natural”. Thus, the movement of an economy in the aggregate was highly path-dependent, a concept that was a direct repudiation of equilibrating tendencies supposedly nested within an economy (Davis 2006). But if equilibrium theory is “still dead after all these years” (Ackerman 2002), what has taken its place? Early work dared not contemplate the full consequences of what a violation of the assumption of equilibrium would mean; as Colander (2003:19) noted, the question of a post-Walrasian world wouldn’t be “Why does the economy exhibit instability and fluctuations?” but rather “Why does it exhibit as little instability as it does?” It is only in recent years that complexity theory, with some (but not all) aspects borrowed from the natural sciences, appears to have stepped into explain what exists in this “unbridgeable gap between market behavior and equilibrium theory” (Matutinovic 2010:32). Focusing on an evolutionary approach to economics, and understanding that economic relations are enmeshed in a series of small and large complex adaptive systems (CAS), certain aspects of complexity theory embraces the idea that such systems may not tend to equilibrium. In fact, taken as a whole, complexity theories understand that “out of equilibrium” may be the most often observed state of an economy, pervasive in such areas as foreign exchange markets and the savings and investment nexus (Rosser 1999). The increasing application of complexity theory to economic issues, and its provision of a valid alternative to neoclassical equilibrium-based foundations,Footnote 1 has occurred at the same time as another breakthrough in mainstream economic thinking: the acknowledgement of the importance of institutions in economic development. While Douglass North (1990) is credited with resurrecting institutional analysis in the guise of the “new institutional economics” (NIE), empirical research from Acemoglu et al. (2003, 2005), Rodrik et al. (2004), Glaeser et al. (2004), and more recently Fatás and Mihov (2013) and Flachaire et al. (2014) has confirmed the role that institutions play in determining the wealth or poverty of nations. These approaches have incorporated many of the tenets of new institutional economics, recognizing that economic outcomes are mediated and influenced by institutional make-up and the broader cultural currents in a given society. While there has been a welcome permeation of NIE tenets into empirical growth work, the emphasis on institutions has still been somewhat limited: as Williamson (2000:595) famously remarked, “the confession is that we are still very ignorant about institutions”. Indeed, much of the development literature has only considered broader institutional changes or aggregated categories of institutions (such as “market-sustaining”, to use Rodrik et al.’s (2004) terminology), with a scarce few in-depth case studies examining the richness of institutional complexity and diversity (the entire body of Elinor Ostrom’s work, typified in Ostrom (2005), being the major exception to the neglect of institutions). To again quote Williamson (2000:595), the chief reason for this “ignorance is that institutions are very complex”, a reality that makes them difficult to tackle in an equilibrium framework, given that they have nonlinearities, exhibit threshold effects, and often lack definitive boundaries. In other words, institutions themselves are complex adaptive systems, more suited to a theoretical framework that recognizes this reality than standard neoclassical analysis. This presents the development economist with a most terrible quandary: if institutions are crucial for development of an economy (which is a complex system) but institutions themselves are also complex adaptive systems, how can one possibly hope to achieve a state of higher development? The purpose of this paper is to further our knowledge of institutions in the pursuit of development by examining institutions explicitly from the standpoint of certain aspects of complexity theory. It is my contention that complexity theory has much to recommend it in terms of understanding institutional composition, which then in turn has a direct impact upon the development of a country’s (region’s/individual’s) economic outcomes. In particular, complexity theory may help economists to understand what a “good” institution is and how it can function in a sea of institutions, as well as shedding light on how such “good” institutions come to be. Unfortunately, as this paper will show, the knowledge of the complexity of institutions also presents a difficulty in attempting to influence their development from either a centralized, planning sense or from an external (donor) agent. The key finding of this examination is that understanding economic complexities, relying on institutional and Austrian approaches, may actually come full circle to a neoclassical prescription of laissez-faire, even while eschewing the idea of equilibrium. In other words, equilibrium may exist, but the complex nature of institutions and their operations make it incredibly difficult for a policymaker to “create” (or even understand) this equilibrium. It is may thus be more important to remove barriers from the path to this better state than to actively engage in institution-building. While this faces its own challenges from the point of view of a complex system, it may be a reasonable solution for policymakers.",4

A Comment on “Proposals for a Democracy of the Future” by Bruno Frey,November 2017,Sean Fox,Ron Johnston,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"While we share Frey’s concerns regarding democracy’s global future and applaud some of his provocative proposals, nevertheless many of his suggestions appear utopian and impractical. They are utopian because they are predicated on assumptions that people are rational, deeply interested in participating in public decision making, and are able and willing to devote considerable time and resources towards formulating informed judgements on matters of public concern. They are impractical because they are not suitable for coherent, long-term planning and would likely generate significant (and economically damaging) political uncertainty and instability. Our discussion of his proposals focus on four key issues: the complexity of democratic decision-making; the valuable roles politicians and technocrats play in such decision-making; the challenge of reconciling the geography of political rights in a globalising world; and the importance of recognizing how power fundamentally frames political discourse and outcomes.",4

Fertility rates are still high and the population grew to over 4 million inhabitants by 2016 (Oman Census 2016). Reoccurring topics in the context of a sustainable urban planning of Muscat are higher gross residential density, higher achievement rates (proportion of allocated plots actually built on), and higher shares of residential land in the gross developed area, see (von Richthofen and Scholz 2013), (Nebel and von Richthofen 2016a, b), and (von Richthofen and Cummings, 2017). Since the 1980s the government has implemented a lottery system to distribute land in order to avoid illegal land grabbing, but also to contribute to the development of a modern Capital Area. Land for building homes is provided by the state through a lottery system where adult males (since 1981) and females (since 2008) can participate pari passu.Footnote 1 The land transaction fees for empty plots, only introduced in 2014, are negligible and there is no taxation system to regulate the market for plots. National banks allocate low-interest loans to willing nationals to build upon the allocated plots. The size and shape of plots is a uniform rectangle of 20 m × 30 m (600 m2) for which a typical “Omani Villa” has been developed. The consequences of this de facto free land allocation process at the hands of Omani nationals including urban sprawl and generally wasteful use of land, energy, material and social resources have been described by (Al Gharibi 2014), (Al Shueili 2015), and (Nebel and von Richthofen 2016a, b). Once the land has been allocated, the winners obtain a random plot within a given larger plot of land, that they are allowed to use for their own buildings or to sell.Footnote 2 Due to the demographic pressure, the land is developed further and further away in remote areas. Typically, just the claims for the plots and main roads exist physically at the time of the lottery results. Since the applicants need to be just 21 years old to apply, not all of the lottery participants are in immediate need of starting construction, and additional infrastructure gets into place only once enough houses are being built. Even though the land allocation process organized by the Omani government is accessible to all Omani citizens and national banking loans are granted under very favorable conditions, not all citizens actually claim the plots and not all plots are developed. The overall system of land allocation as a governmental process and construction of houses as a subsidized, yet private initiative seems to be inefficient. The incremental growth process and the problems associated with it have been studied by (von Richthofen and Scholz 2013). Land management measures by a government can have the character of incentives or taxes. The feudal state character of Oman has, since the 1970s, led to an underlying social contract where the government redistributes wealth to its citizens (Valerie 2013). This principle also implies the absence of direct taxation. Taxation in democratic societies is a key for political representation and has thus not been introduced in Oman so far. Incentives, on the other hand, can guide agents to change their behaviors. Possible remedies based on the results of this simulation may include: (1) the development of a land monitoring system based on the simulation results. Currently, the Ministry of Housing has the sole authority to distribute land and has not yet installed an effective land monitoring system. Next to a Geographic Information System (GIS) database, an urban simulation can lead to an evidence-based urban design and ultimately improve the current land allocation system. (2) Modification of the pricing policy for land allocation and the introduction of variable pricing to steer land use and counteract land-speculation. In principle, the pricing policy has not changed since 1990, and land is still allocated by the lottery system to all Omani citizens. The fees paid by the applicants do not currently cover the development costs incurred by the government nor do they reflect market prices. The simulation results question the efficiency of the system and reveal negative side effects such as land-speculation. (3) Procedure to identify and predict genuine demand and suitable prioritization of allotment based on the simulation results. The pricing policy drives an excessive demand for land, making it impossible to identify genuine demand. (4) Coordination with other agencies responsible for the provision of infrastructure. Coordination with other agencies has not significantly improved since 1990. The asynchronous development has many causes that defeat the goal of higher achievement rates. (5) Strengthening housing finance institutions based on an economic simulation model. This is evident in the wide range of low-interest mortgage schemes in operation. (6) Creating provisions for re-acquisition of plots by the Ministry of Housing. Provisions for re-acquisition of plots have been created and the land granted to residents can be reclaimed with appropriate compensation. Finally, one may (7) consider individual household preferences and resident satisfaction. The master planning does not take into consideration individual household preferences nor resident satisfaction. Residents are gradually losing touch with traditional ways of life and local customs as they move into newer neighborhoods. In order to predict the effectiveness of these remedies a much deeper understanding of the actual land settlement process is needed, in particular with respect to timelines, the evolution of house prices and social fairness of the process. Hence, in this land allocation system several questions arise that shall be studied here: What is the actual process of plot settlement, i.e. what patterns can be observed on a timeline? Is this system inherently able to efficiently and completely realize the full housing potential of a development area for all allocated plots? As optimal infrastructure and the overall degree of settlement contribute to the value of a plot, when is the best time to buy/sell? How do prices of real-estate increase over time? Does a land allocation system that offers a plot to each citizen actually contribute to a fair and equal wealth distribution? (Is it real-estate speculation disguised as social welfare?) What measures of urban management should be proposed to gear the land allocation process and settlement towards a more efficient and targeted land-use (taxes/incentives)? Within a larger urban development area, several thousand plots are allocated by lottery in one go. Indicative studies in Muscat Capital Area and detailed studies in the neighborhood of Al Khoud revealed three major stages that are present throughout the progress of this settlement process, cf. (von Richthofen and Langer 2015), (Nebel and von Richthofen 2016a, b), and (von Richthofen 2014, 2015, 2016a, b, c, d, 2017): Stage 1 The first stage is that of the pioneers. This stage is characterized by sporadic, distributed development of houses. The settlement process starts slowly. The pioneers settle out of necessity, not out of choice. Some are urgently in need of a new home such as young couples that want to move out from their parents’ home and start a family, which requires a separate home in a traditional Islamic society like Oman. Slowly others follow. At this stage, construction is an adventure, as neither proper connecting roads are in place (dirt/mud roads dominate the scene), nor continuous water or sewage supply (this is guaranteed by calling respective tank cars), as well as electricity or landline connectivity. Building a home prior to the construction of the neighbors and further road and sewerage means to live in an area deprived of infrastructure and subject to future construction noise, dirt, and pollution. These factors significantly contribute to the lower desirability to settle on plots in this neighborhood in this phase. This stage can last many years. Stage 2 The second stage is that of the convenience movers. Once a neighborhood has been built with a suitable amount of houses “per street”, the municipality starts to develop the plot by paving broader connector streets and side roads, by installing electricity lines (incl. street lighting) and landlines. While this is not the official policy, the municipality has no other choice than to prioritize the road development. A survey for the new residential neighborhood of Al Khoud from 2011 to 2014 revealed this gradual development pattern of road infrastructure (von Richthofen 2016a, b, c, d). Typically at a much later stage, proper water and sewage systems get established. This stage is thus the time for the convenience movers. Building activities become comparably easy (opportunity costs are low) and it is also attractive to buy/sell properties due to the steadily increased quality of municipality services provided. Now people, e.g. unlucky in the lottery draw because their plot is located far away and in an undeveloped area, buy land and start to raise their homes together with those who just waited for the reduced efforts of construction. First shops, business buildings, and mosques are coming into place as a critical mass of customers is reached. Due to the mutual intensification of (governmental) infrastructure provision and (private) housing development, this stage is characterized by an acceleration and steep increase in prices. This stage lasts a few years only. Stage 3 The third stage is that of the saturated speculation. The area is well developed in terms of municipality services yet a percentage of the plots is still empty. These are either plots of indecisive owners (they may have gotten a job in another city, went out of money or are planning on a more longer term), or used as trading objects because their price is coupled to infrastructure, availability, and accessibility of shops, restaurants and service providers as well as the overall structure of the neighborhood. Since males and females can apply for plots as of 2008 but generally only need one plot for their own family, a fair amount of plots have been allocated without a specific purpose. Here, the final price for an open plot (without constructions on it) as well as for already built houses is realized. This stage would come to an end with a full development of all plots. In the following sections, we are giving a mathematical model for this settlement process: In Sect. 2 by means of cellular automata and most likely behaviors of the plot owners (including hypotheses for their tacit aims and preference structures). Here, the actual development in Al Khoud is used as an indicative reference for the settlement pattern in time. For the model set-up, special consideration is given to the development of plot prices by calibrating our assumptions to available sources. This includes a comparative estimation of real-estate prices and their development in Muscat Capital Area that has not been done till now. In Sect. 3 we give the results of several simulations to obtain a tangible view of the settlement process including the observation of certain patterns/structures that can be seen in the actual settlement as well. Moreover, we obtain a picture of how prices for plots evolve. These simulations clearly indicate that the combination of available and built land, as well as the degree of infrastructure provided by the government, is not, as might be assumed, arbitrary even if it does not follow the intended governmental logic of continuous and fair land allocation. The simulation also challenges the underlying assumption that a land allocation system contributes to a fair and efficient provision of housing as intended by the Omani welfare state. On the contrary, the simulation reveals that a subsidized land allocation without land taxation results in unhindered land speculation. Finally, we propose and discuss scenarios for efficient policies necessary in addition to the lottery in order to prevent undesired effects of land accumulation and social exclusion from house ownership. A résumé and outlook wraps-up our study.",4

All of his suggestions ought to be considered and debated, because it is a common assessment that dissatisfaction with political results is mounting. Some of Frey’s suggestions are iconoclastic. For example, the idea of weighted voting, which includes a smooth transition inside or out the electoral body, but violates the fundamental credo of democracy “one person one vote.” I think that for such a discussion we may want to consider besides Frey’s suggestions for weighing (such as time in or area of residence, or the age of the voter), the amount of information of the voter (using education as a proxy?). Another example is the idea of random selection of candidates to occupy politically important positions, which, assuming rationality of individuals is a suboptimal position.Footnote 1 On the other hand, if one does not assume rationality, random processes may be preferable over current political results. For example, a random choice among candidates would have improved the results of the recent American Presidential election (at least in the eyes of almost all international observers as well as political newspapers and magazines in the US). But the introduction of random procedures should be considered in politics as a solution of last resort. (I will return to this point in the end of my essay.) In this rejoinder I will first focus on the suggestions revolving around referendums, particularly the ones that produce very divisive results (Part IV of Frey’s essay), and then propose improvements for mediated democracy of the future.",3
35,1,Homo Oeconomicus,03 November 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41412-017-0054-3,On Sortition. Comment on “Proposals for a Democracy of the Future” by Bruno Frey,June 2018,George Tridimas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In his thought–provoking essay, Bruno Frey (2018) proposes a range of far-reaching reforms of representative democracy to introduce more direct participation in public decision making.Footnote 1 This essay focuses on proposals to introduce random selection. Specifically, Frey proposes to decide the outcome of referendums by lot where the probability that each alternative wins depends on the share of votes polled, and to use sortition (drawing lots among citizens) to fill some public offices. Proposals to replace majority voting with random selection raise questions about the nature of democracy, representation of voters and selection of government officials. The proposal for randomising policy has been made in the literature but has not been applied in practice. Mueller et al. (1972) favour randomized selection of legislators for reducing incentives for pork barrel activities, achieving ex ante equality of voters, representing minorities proportionately and avoiding intransitive voting outcomes. Amar (1984) discusses the benefits of choosing representatives under lottery voting, a system where citizens vote for representatives (as per usual practice), but the election winner is decided by a lottery of the ballots cast, so that a candidate who polls say x% of the vote has x% ex ante probability to be elected to office, rather than 100%. The proposal for sortition of public post–holders has a long and distinguished pedigree in the direct democracy of ancient Athens (507–322 BCE), Venice (697–1797), Florence (1328–1434 and again 1494–1512) and the Swiss Landsgemeinden (1640–1837). This comment discusses the sortition proposal using the intuition gained from the scholarship developed in relation to ancient Athens and arrives at a more nuanced conclusion than Frey’s optimism. In the modern eyes, sortition denies the exercise of choice according to the preferences of the voters and is “a–rational” (Dowlen 2008) as it implies a fixed probability of winning independent of personal effort and other characteristics of those contesting the election. As such, it goes against the grain of a number of well–accepted and reasonable arguments for electing candidates to office. Most importantly, the principle of one–person one–vote to elect government officials offers each citizen an equal opportunity to consent to the government. The policy decisions made by the elected officials, and especially the constraints they impose on individual actions, are then perceived as legitimate. Further, voting in a fair election makes possible to discover the individuals who possess merit and ability to occupy public office and conduct policy, and the outcome of voting embodies the wishes of the majority. If these are true, sortition not only changes the nature of modern democracy but also carries the risk of appointing unqualified candidates to office.Footnote 2
 Section 2 reviews the ancient Athenian practice of selection to office by lot, the institutional setting and circumstances where it was used. Section 3 uses the criteria of representativeness, equity, partisanship, rent seeking, resource economy and suitability for office to evaluate the Athenian arrangement, and contrasts it with the premises of modern democracy. Section 4 concludes.",3

Frey,June 2018,Benoît Le Maux,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In a recent article published in Homo Oeconomicus, Frey (2017) identifies several potential improvements to the functioning of modern democracies, and explains how direct participation of citizens in the political process could be further developed in order to still be prosperous in the future. The author starts the discussion with the example of Switzerland, where income and satisfaction levels have been shown to be positively influenced by direct democracy (e.g., Frey and Stutzer 2000, 2002; Kirchgässner 2015). With that evidence in mind, Frey considers “direct participation rights of people to be a desideratum”. Provided that citizens are rational actors, and that strategic actions are minimized, citizens would influence public decisions in the right direction, leading the economy towards Pareto-optimal solutions. Then several ideas as to how direct participation rights could be performed are presented. Among others, the author suggests voting rights with variable weights. For instance, non-nationals could be given partial voting rights which would increase with the number of years they have lived in the country. Similarly, commuters could have half a vote weight each where they live and where they work. Based on historical evidence, the author also proposes an approach for dealing with narrow referendums, when opposing views are equally distributed around the 50% threshold (i.e., when half the population is for the reform while the other half is against): a formalized procedure could be engaged in which a consensus is to be found. Last, the author evokes a random mechanism, in which the outcome of a referendum would be randomly drawn according to the observed share of votes. Similarly, elected representatives could be selected from a representative sample of the population. As stressed by the author, these ideas need further investigation as politicians’ actions and voters’ behaviors could themselves be influenced by the new institutions. Several examples are coming to mind (see also Nurmi 2017 and Kendall 2017 for additional examples). For instance, Frey (2017) proposes that “non-nationals after two years of living in the country get a vote weight of 20%, after five years 50%, and after ten years 100%”. However, small vote weights would be synonymous with an even lower chance of determining the electoral outcome. Participation would be discouraged for those with small weights, and the outcome could be in fact pretty close to what we would expect with simple binary weights (i.e., zero vs. full weight). Frey (2017) also suggests that “the narrower the outcome of a vote is, the more strongly must the representatives of the two opposing camps engage in a formalized, constitutionally sanctioned procedure in which a solution agreeable to both sides is to be reached”. Yet, the fact that opposing views are equally distributed around the 50% threshold does not necessarily imply strong policy divergence. If a procedure for negotiating compromises is to be introduced, it could be inefficiently costly in terms of both time and effort spent. Even worse, knowing that such compromises are in play, government officials, by strategically setting the agenda, could initially choose outcomes that diverge even more. Last, as suggested by Berg and Holler (1986), several objections can be raised as to the adoption of a randomized decision rule, be it on technical, practical, or psychological grounds. For instance, a practical difficulty with the adoption of a randomized decision procedure concerns the stability of the decision making process, which can be “difficult to obtain if the coalition structure varies in an unpredictable fashion from one vote to the next” (Berg and Holler 1986, p. 428). Of course, abstention, agenda manipulation or practical considerations are strong arguments, but not only in the case of Frey’s (2017) proposition, hence the need for further investigation. In particular, to guide future discussion, I would like to stress three issues which, to my opinion, need further scrutiny: (1) the link between direct participation rights and Pareto optimality (see Sect. 2); (2) the question whether political parties do matter in representative democracies (Sect. 3); and (3) the role of program evaluation in our modern democracies (Sect. 4).",

It was also inevitable that economists would become more sceptical of the old theories and search for new ones. On the latter we have not so many advances on the theoretical front as happened in the 1930s, although quantitative easing and unconventional monetary policy does represent something of a revolution. On the former voters have increasingly been turning to unconventional, even extremist, politicians and policies, But what was a little unexpected was that people would be looking at ways to improve democracy. Of course in a given country the democratic system is often path dependent with its roots buried deep in events of several hundred  years ago, and this acts as a constraint on, and in some cases is a strength of, the political system in those countries. Democratic systems should not stand still, if only because the world does not stand still. Technological change, particularly linked to IT, can open new opportunities for democracy which were not open to those of previous generations and again we should not let the status quo get in the way of useful reform and changes linked to IT or other developments, when such changes can improve democracy. But it seems less likely that reforms born out of citizens’ reaction to economic hardship following the crisis can improve on the system of representative democracy on which previous generations of philosophers, political scientists, the odd economist and others have carefully, or otherwise, crafted. Although of course that should not stop us trying. It is with this hopefully open, but somewhat sceptical mindset, that we begin to analyse the recent proposals put forward by Bruno Frey (2017). In doing this we focus on the motivation of people in voting and the impact Frey’s proposals would have on such motivation. We do however, briefly comment on some other aspects of his proposals. As the reader will see, we do not agree with Professor Frey on many of his proposals. In light of the enormous influence he has had on economics and indeed myself, we do this with some hesitation.",
35,1,Homo Oeconomicus,25 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41412-018-0067-6,The Voter in the House of Mirrors: Comment on “Proposals for a Democracy of the Future” by Bruno Frey,June 2018,Luigi Alberto Franzoni,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In his thought provoking essay, Bruno Frey does not hesitate in taking direct democracy’s side (see Frey 2017). Enlightened by the results of his extensive research on happiness, unequivocally relating well-being with democracy, he endeavours to extend the reach of democratic institutions. He focusses on the principal instrument of direct democracy, i.e., universal vote in referenda, and suggests serval ways in which this instrument can be advanced. In this note, I provide a few critical remarks on his proposals. My remarks will lean more towards my interests in public regulation than in public choice or political economics. Bruno Frey does not hide his unencumbered belief that increasing the people’s voice in public decision-making unequivocally ameliorates social policy. Not all observers, however, would be willing to follow him in this leap of faith. Thirty years of behavioural economics show that people are affected by myriad of cognitive biases, leading to distorted perception of social risks and to inconsistent behaviour.Footnote 1 These biases induce ordinary people to make decisions that do not always serve them well. Given that ordinary people’s decisions are strongly affected by emotional impressions and by framing effects, any enlargement of direct democracy should necessarily come together with measures aiming at improving the “quality” of the vote, impinging on the integrity of the public debate and the lack of ambiguity on the consequences of the vote. Keeping this in mind, we can think of two special functions served by referenda in a democratic political system (i.e., in a system in which politicians are democratically elected): Agenda setting. Referenda bring to the fore thorny issues that organized parties prefer to avoid. The vote allows for the “unbundling” of specific topics from the parties’ general agendas or programmes. This is usually done by forcing a simple yes/no decision on a specific issue. Civic engagement. Referenda foster public debate on the issue to be decided. They invite organized groups and thinkers to take a stand and provide arguments in favour or against the proposal. The final decision rests with the ordinary citizen who feels empowered and less detached from the political rules and institutions governing her life. By posing direct questions on specific issues, referenda are also sometimes regarded as effective preference elicitation mechanisms (i.e., tools to measure social benefits and costs of specific projects).Footnote 2 In the era of the internet, however, many cheaper alternatives exist for the elicitation of preferences (like opinion polls). So, I conclude that the latter function has lost most of its relevance. Previous work of Bruno Frey provides support to the Civic engagement effect (“procedural utility” of direct democracy). People report higher happiness in jurisdictions characterized by institutions with greater direct democracy.Footnote 3 This effect, however, highlights the economic paradox of voting: people revel in casting their vote, even when their individual vote has an infinitesimal chance of being pivotal (and is therefore practically irrelevant). What really matters for the voter, one might conjecture, is not the power to make a political decision, but the sense of empowerment generated by the vote (or the right to vote), and the sense of belonging to a sovereign community. The democratic vote flourishes in the gap between the (negligible) real decision power that it conveys and the (non-negligible) perception of belonging that it nurtures. Using a metaphor, the voting system creates a house of mirrors in which the voter relishes not on his own image, but on the infinite reflections (the community to which one belongs) that his image produces. As I will argue below, Frey’s proposals will build precisely on this image misalignment, and they will amplify it. In view of the valuable purposes that referenda serve in political decision-making, one may wonder how they could best deliver their fruits. The most basic issues to be addressed are: Which groups/institutions can propose a referendum? Political parties, organized groups (how large?), individual citizens? What subject matters can be addressed by the referendum? Can a referendum impinge on technical issues about which ordinary people have little knowledge? Can a referendum enact a constitutional change? What is the majority requested to abolish a law or to enact a new one? What is the minimal participation rate (quorum) for the validity of the referendum? Should people cast their vote in traditional voting booths? Can people vote on the internet? Obviously, the scope of the referendum tool heavily affects its ability to carry out the positive functions mentioned above. For instance, if referenda were to take place on the internet, on a very frequent basis, they would probably do little to foster civil engagement. People could cast their vote in the same way—say, with the same thoughtfulness—with which they assign “Likes” on Facebook. Instead of fostering civic engagement, Facebook referenda might end up trivialising political debate and, possibly, polarising the populace in non-communicating factions (“information silos”).Footnote 4

Additionally, based on a sample of 265 Dutch voters, we gauge the desirability of the Frey’s proposals from the eye of the homo nederlandicus. In the second section, we start with how a rational self-interested agent assesses Frey’s proposals. We argue that from this perspective, there are deliberations both in favor as well as against many proposals, and that one can therefore not say a priori whether the electorate supports the proposed reforms. For some of the proposals in Frey (2017), e.g., voting rights for commuters or immigrants, the connection with the existing Dutch political institutions is straightforward. For others, especially the direct democracy, this is less so the case, as the proposals for reform made by a Swiss citizen, inspired by a system deeply imbued by direct democracy, have a less direct fit with the Dutch system of representative democracy. We discuss how we adjust the proposals and what the opinions of Dutch voters are in the third section of our contribution.

One distinctive feature of Hobbesianism is the fact that sovereignty is both self-contained and total. Another is that politics is prior to morality. It is these two features, and not the reduction of political justification to instrumental rationality, that characterize Buchanan as well as Hobbes’s approach to political contractualism. Of course, these two ideas are related in that they conceive of the political as in some fundamental sense independent of the moral or ethical. This does not mean that moral or ethical norms play no role in politics, only that they do not play a role at the ground floor of fundamental justification of political institutions. The analogy is to John Rawls’s argument in favor of independence of moral theory from epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind (one might also add meta-ethics). That basic norms are (and must be) fundamentally political is arguably the core argument of Thomas Hobbes’s philosophy, embodied to one degree or another in Hobbesian approaches of various stripes. Buchanan is, in this sense, a Hobbesian contractualist. Nevertheless, James Buchanan’s contractual “system” is hard to evaluate as a whole. Unlike John Rawls, who more or less developed a unified contractual theory over two major works or David Gauthier who did so in one book and several later papers, Buchanan’s work on contractual political theory and political economy spans several volumes (19 volumes in the Liberty Fund edition) and he did not approach his contractual theory like Rawls or Gauthier. He did not seek to articulate a final version of his theory in one comprehensive work. In addition, several of his major works are co-authored with Geoffrey Brennan or Gordon Tullock. Collaboration presents certain interpretive problems of attribution. My strategy will be to simply take everything that Buchanan signed his name to as developing a view that he would, at least go along with, regardless of whether it is his considered view. This allows us to treat Calculus and Reason of Rules as being on a par with Limits of Liberty or his later essays. We can identify two core features distinctive of Buchanan’s contractualism. What I will call the independence thesis and individualism, respectively. I will discuss these in more detail in the next section. Here, I want to focus on a neglected aspect of Buchanan’s contractualism where he differs from other contractualists such as Rawls and Gauthier. This is his rejection of looking for a unique solution to what set of principles or rules the contractual model would justify. Contractual theories are usefully thought of as models of justification for a set of governing rules or principles. On this view, contractualism is a justificatory model that relates the reasons of “model persons” to those of real persons. ContractualismN chooses R in M and this gives N* reason to endorse and comply with R in the real world insofar as the reasons N has for choosing R in M can be shared by N*. Contractualism as a justificatory model is an attempt to show the reasons that real people (N*) have for endorsing and complying with a particular set of social rules or norms (R) by showing that model reasoners (N) have reason to choose those social rules (R) in some deliberative setting or model of agreement (M). To generate the normativity of this model, there must be a direct link between the reasons and reasoning of the model reasoners and actual reasoners. What it means to “share” reasons in this context does not necessarily mean that the model contractors need to have the same reasons as real people, only that the reasoning of the model reasoners can be coherently represented as the reasoning of actual persons and vice versa.Footnote 2 Each of these parameters (N,M,R,N*) can be specified in any number of ways. The shape of a particular contractual theory depends on the precise way these parameters are set in the theory. Buchanan has a contractual model of this sort, but where he differs from other theories is primarily in the specification of (R), i.e. the target of justification. A key desideratum of contractualist theories tends to be determinacy in the set of principles or rules that the contract justifies. Indeed, most contract theories aspire to maximal determinacy in the form of uniqueness, which means that the contractual model justifies one and only one set of principles or rules. When the model of agreement (M) is modeled as a bargaining problem, as it is by Gauthier (1986), Binmore (1998), Muldoon (2017), and Moehler (2018), uniqueness requires that there be a rationally unique solution to the division problem. Ken Binmore argues, for instance, that the Nash solution is uniquely rational, while Gauthier (1986) argued for something like the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution, before switching to the Nash Solution (Gauthier 1993), and then returning to a refined version of his original solution (Gauthier 2013a, b). In any case, as Thrasher (2014) have argued elsewhere, uniqueness is bought at the price of the normative link between the model contractors and real people. I call this relationship between the reason of the model choosers and the reasons of real people, the representation condition (Thrasher 2019b). Briefly, the problem is that the assumptions that one needs to introduce to generate uniqueness will require that we either unduly narrow or expand the model reasoning of the contractors in ways that will not be well reflected in the actual reasoning of their real counterparts. As such, they will be alienated from the justificatory reasons of the contract and, hence, the contractual model will lack the crucial normativity that it seeks. The details of how this work will depend on the theory, but it will apply regardless of whether the model uses a narrow (e.g., homo economicus) or expansive (e.g., reasonable and rational) model of rationality in the contract. One of the chief differences between Buchanan’s contractualism and those of the others mentioned, though, is that he gives up on uniqueness. Especially in his comments on Rawls, Buchanan is clear that it is the contractual process rather than the specific result that is important.Footnote 3 He writes: The “principles” that might be said to be implied in this book [The Limits of Liberty] are that the multidimensional trade-off between liberty and law should be recognized, that the interdependence among different laws as they constrain individual liberties should be reckoned with, that continued misunderstanding and confusion above the separate constitutional and post-constitutional stages of collective action leads to disaster…If men will only commence to think in contractarian terms, if they will think of the state in the roles as defined, and if they will recognize individual rights as existent in the status quo, I should not at all be insistent on particulars (Buchanan 1975, 7:222). Given Buchanan’s claim that getting the process right is the main thing and that he isn’t “insistent on particulars” if the process is right, how should we view Buchanan’s contractualism? Rawls was pretty clearly insistent on particulars, specifically his two principles of justice. So much so that even though his contractualist apparatus changed considerably over the course of his work, those principles remained a more or less fixed point (Gaus 2013; Gaus and Thrasher 2015). The schema for contractualism given above is a model that justifies some set of rules or principles, does Buchanan’s theory even aspire to that level of justification? In a sense, no. Voluntariness or exchange, is the core of legitimate politics for Buchanan and no contractual model can override genuine consent. The contractual model only has an advantage over other external norms of evaluation “when attempts are made to reach agreement on change”, which is to say as a tool of democratic persuasion (Buchanan 1977, 116).Footnote 4 More generally, Buchanan (1977, 122–23) argues that political contractualism sees the “state in all its forms…as a necessary part of a complex exchange process that generates mutuality of gain”, rather than a mechanism by which some groups in society secure “profits” at the expense of others through the use of state power. As Sugden (2018, 29) puts it, the metaphor of the contract “draws attention to the analogy between mutual benefit in politics and mutual benefit in voluntary contracts”. If this is right, Buchanan’s contractualism does not seek to justify the independent authority of social principles and norms, but rather to present a model of a mutual beneficial political order of free people who respect each other’s equal authority. That said, there is a grundnorm embodied in Buchanan’s contractualism in the form of what he calls “individualism”. This Madisonian conception of politics is both a methodological and substantive norm that sets the stage for the contracting parties. Without it, politics as exchange cannot get off the ground. Nevertheless, individualism constrains the contractual process, but it is not, itself, a substantive political principle of rule. But, If Buchanan’s political contractualism does not justify a specific set of principles or rules, what does it justify? The answer is that Buchanan’s political contractualism justifies some set of basic rules in the form of a constitution. While the structure of that constitution is not determined by the contract, the contractual method can help us think through what people like us would want in a constitution. So, while the contractual method does not justify a unique set of principles or rules, it does show that some set of rules is required for cooperation and mutual benefit. Buchanan’s political contractualism shows that whatever specification of the political system would be justified, the system will be a democracy ordered by a constitution. To get more precise on the shape of an acceptable constitution, however, we need to look more closely at the two essential elements of Buchanan’s political contractualism.",2

Examining Buchanan’s often implied assumptions concerning the lawmaking process reveals major weaknesses in his constitutional framework.Footnote 2 This paper argues that Buchanan’s approach to the lawmaking process severely limits the theoretical strength of his constitutional framework and ultimately undermines the effectiveness of the institutional promoters of liberty he proposes. More specifically, Buchanan’s rigid legal positivism, combined with his peculiar form of political contractarianism, stifles his view of the sources of law; therefore, he is unable to provide a satisfactory normative account of the complex relationship between the lawmaking process and individual liberty within the constitutional order. Buchanan’s constitutional framework shares two premises common to traditional forms of legal positivism: (1) constitutional law is a deliberate product of human authority,Footnote 3 and (2) no necessary connection exists between law and morality. At first glance, this seems to map on two methodological tenets of Buchanan’s thought: contractarian individualism and ethical subjectivism. On the one hand, the idea of constitutional law being a deliberate product of human authority seems to resonate well with the principle that the ultimate criterion determining the legitimacy of social institutions is an agreement among individuals (contractarian individualism). Law is a deliberate product of human authority inasmuch as individuals agree to construct and design the constitutional order. On the other hand, the idea that law and morality are separate realms aligns with the assumption that no moral structure must predate the original social contract (ethical subjectivism). Law must be separate from morality because individual consent, rather than any form of objective moral criteria, is the sole source of legitimacy for legal institutions in Buchanan’s framework. In short, traditional legal positivism appears to go hand in hand with the idea of the constitutional order as the product of unanimous constitutional agreement. On closer scrutiny, however, Buchanan’s positivist assumptions on lawmaking prevent his own constitutional framework from providing a satisfactory account of contemporary constitutional orders. His rigid form of legal positivism fails to recognize the role judges play in the production of legal rules, the inherently moral component of constitutional principles, and the essential role of private legal orderings. By neglecting the institutional heterogeneity of lawmaking processes, Buchanan’s constitutional framework results in an inadequately constrained political monopoly of lawmaking, thereby failing to recognize effective institutional promoters of liberty against the risk of coercive abuses of political power. The discussion is organized as follows: Sects. 2 and 3 briefly examine the contractarian foundations of Buchanan’s conception of lawmaking. Section 2 considers the nexus between normative individualism and political contractarianism in Buchanan’s political theory. I argue that Buchanan’s constitutional contractarianism does not necessarily follow from his commitment to the ideal of voluntary exchange. Section 3 identifies the strict relationship between political contractarianism and traditional legal positivism in Buchanan’s intellectual scheme. Sections 4–7 take a closer look at various aspects of Buchanan’s legal positivism. Section 4 emphasizes the weaknesses associated with Buchanan’s formalistic account of both legal normativity and the constitutional contract. Section 5 argues that Buchanan’s legal formalism prevents him from appreciating the relevant distinction between rules and principles in the constitutional framework. Recognizing the role of constitutional principles significantly reduces the theoretical relevance of Buchanan’s distinction between the choice of the rules of the game and the choice within these rules. Section 6 explores Buchanan’s conception of the generality of law principle as an example of the analytical limitations of his conception of lawmaking. Section 7 outlines Buchanan’s failure to recognize the importance of private, decentralized legal orderings. Section 8 concludes the paper.",2

Rent seeking occurs, for instance, when companies pursue tariffs to protect themselves from competition, or when an official or lobbyist seeks a subsidy paid for by taxing someone else. Rent seeking frequently leads to unproductive activities through the dissipation of rents, which has a tendency to compound over time, and typically involves the use of state power to coerce, limiting liberty. A central task for constitutional theorists, then, is to identify constitutional rules that prohibit or limit rent seeking, in order to ensure that a society’s economic system benefits all and preserves their liberty. Besides standard rent seeking there is a related, but equally dangerous phenomenon that Buchanan does not explicitly address as a variant of rent seeking: the attempt by sectarian groups to capture governmental apparatus to impose their values on others. The goal of these ideologues is not economic gain, but evaluative gain.Footnote 1 Co-opting state power, they force those with different values to share, or at least submit to, their own sectarian vision of the good society. Like rent seeking, this activity tends to undermine the gains from trade in a market order. Market orders allow people to live out their own values and to contract with others to do so, but sectarian coercion restricts people’s abilities to cooperate with others to realize their diverse values. These activities give the sectarian an unequal gain in utility and may impose a utility loss on others. In this broad sense, sectarian ideologues collect a rent. If we can specify the sense in which ideologues collect a rent, we can expand the reach of Buchanan’s research program. Towards this end, I will spend most of this essay sketching what I shall call ideological rent seeking and the ideological rent seeker. If these ideas prove coherent, extending Buchanan’s program will be straightforward: the best constitutional rules are those that constrain a weighted sum of economic and ideological rent seeking, among other things.Footnote 2 What I propose, in short, is to understand an ideological rent seeker as an agent possessing both ordinary economic preferences about her material interests and ideological preferences concerning how an agent wishes to shape her social world in accord with her worldview and values. Thus, I propose to build ideological values into the utility function of agents in an economic and political system, including in scenarios of constitutional choice. We can then derive a complete utility function for each agent by aggregating her economic utility function—her ranking of economic preferences—with her ideological utility function—her ranking of ideological preferences. While some economists are bound to resist the very idea of an ideological utility function, I will take for granted what I regard as a fundamental truth about utility analysis, namely that is primarily a kind of consistency requirement for preferences and has nothing to say about what may be preferred or chosen. Thus, ideological preferences are as much at home in utility analysis as preferences over material interests. I will begin the essay by introducing the ordinary notion of economic rent seeking (2) and outlining a conception of ideology suitable for extending the idea of rent seeking to sectarian, ideological behavior (3). I next define ideological rent seeking and outline some examples of it (4). I then explain how the idea of ideological rent seeking gives Buchanan’s analysis of rent seeking greater analytical power (5). I next outline how Buchanan’s social contract theory should expand in light of ideological rent seeking (6), and I address some difficulties that ideologues pose for a Buchananite constitutional choice (7).",

The set S is typically interpreted as the attainable set of utility allocations each of which can be obtained by n players through their joint action. The element d in S is interpreted as the threat or disagreement point: if the players fail to reach an agreement, then the bargaining problem (S, d) will be settled at d. Depending on specific situations, bargaining problems can be different. Collect all bargaining problems in a set \( \Sigma \). A bargaining solution defined on \(\Sigma \) picks up an element in a bargaining set S for each bargaining problem (S, d) contained in \(\Sigma \): the picked up element by the bargaining solution for a problem is regarded as the settlement point by the players for that problem. There can be different bargaining solutions satisfying various properties like efficiency, symmetry, etc. In Nash’s (1950) pioneering work on bargaining, he takes an axiomatic approach to study what is now called the Nash solution: he shows that there is a unique solution satisfying a list of reasonable properties (axioms) and thus obtains an axiomatic characterization of the Nash solution. Several other solutions including the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution (Kalai and Smorodinsky 1975) and egalitarian solution (Kalai 1977) have been axiomatically studied in the literature. The collection of bargaining problems studied by Nash (1950) and subsequently by others is such that, for each bargaining problem (S, d), the bargaining set S is convex. However, it has been recognized that the attainable set of utility allocations arising from many economic contexts may not be convex. One of the earliest researchers who recognizes such non-convexity in a bargaining problem is Bishop (1960). Bishop (1960) studies the behaviors of duopoly and shows that the bargaining set for a duopoly bargaining problem can be non-convex when the two firms face conventional demands but have unequal marginal costs. He further cautions that, if side payments are prohibited, then the Nash solution to convex bargaining problems is not applicable in this context. Non-convexity of the attainable set of utility allocations can be removed if it is assumed that players are expected utility maximizers and if the use of lotteries is admitted. In recent decades, these assumptions have been under increasing scrutiny and many researchers have questioned their validity. Non-convexity of bargaining sets thus invites questions about the model and analysis of (classical) convex bargaining problems: How can the classical model and analysis developed by Nash (1950) be extended to bargaining problems with nonconvex bargaining sets? The recent literature on bargaining problems has examined this question and has provided a foundation for applying the theories of nonconvex bargaining problems thus developed to several economic contexts in which nonconvexity of bargaining sets arises naturally. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we review some major theoretical results in the recent literature on n-person non-convex bargaining problems. Secondly, we use two resource allocation problems that give rise to nonconvex bargaining sets to illustrate potential applications of the theories of nonconvex bargaining problems. In our review of the related theoretical literature, we focus on a collection of bargaining problems (S, d) in which: (i) the threat or disagreement point \(d=(d_1, \cdots , d_n)\) is fixed, (ii) any bargaining problem (S, d) is such that, for any point \(s=(s_1, \cdots , s_n)\) in S, \(s_1\ge d_1, \cdots , s_n\ge d_n\) , and (iii) each player has a cardinal utility function. With these assumptions, we consider normalized bargaining problems (S, d) where \(d=(0, \cdots , 0)\), \(S\subseteq {\mathbb {R}}^n_+\) (\({\mathbb {R}}_+^n\) being the n-fold Cartesian product of the set of non-negative real numbers) is  compact and comprehensive, but not necessarily convex. See Sect. 2 for formal definitions. As we noted earlier, the theoretical study of n-person bargaining problems is typically axiomatic. We shall follow the axiomatic approach in our review of major theoretical results on n-person non-convex bargaining problems. Unlike n-person convex bargaining problems where a bargaining solution picks up a unique point in the bargaining set S, a solution in n-person nonconvex bargaining problems can be multi-valued. For example, there can be several points in a nonconvex bargaining set that maximize the Nash product. Depending on how a Nash solution is defined for such bargaining problems, a Nash solution can be set-valued or single-valued. We shall discuss both set-valued and single-valued Nash solutions for nonconvex bargaining problems. In addition, we shall also discuss some other prominent solutions (Kalai-Smorodinsky, Egalitarian) to bargaining problems and the issue of rationalizability of bargaining solutions axiomatically. From our discussions, we will see that many of the axioms used for studying solutions to convex bargaining problems continue to play a major role in characterizing solutions to nonconvex bargaining problems. These axioms include Efficiency, Weak Efficiency, Scale Invariance, Individual Rationality, Contraction Independence (Nash’s IIA) (see Sect. 3 for formal definitions). We will also see that, for the class of nonconvex bargaining problems reviewed in this paper, the characterization results of the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution and the Egalitarian solution can be regarded as straightforward extensions of their counterparts for the class of convex bargaining problems. See Sect. 6 and 7. On the other hand, depending on the nature of nonconvex bargaining problems, one would need to face the challenge of defining a Kalai-Smorodinsky solution or an egalitarian solution appropriately: when a nonconvex bargaining problem contains only a finite number of points, the standard Kalai-Smorodinsky solution and the standard Egalitarian solution may not be well-defined (see Sect. 2)! In the meantime, there are new axioms that are specific for studying solutions to nonconvex bargaining problems. Consequently, solutions to nonconvex bargaining problems exhibit some common features to their counterparts to convex bargaining problems and, simultaneously, have certain new features that are unique to them so that new insights can be derived from axiomatic studies. For example, consider first Nash’s original symmetry axiom (for convex bargaining problems), which requires that, for any convex bargaining problem (S, d) in which S is symmetric with respect to d, the solution point \(s^{*}\in S\) should be such that \(s_{i}^{*}-d_{i}=s_{j}^{*}-d_{j}\) for all \(i,j=1,\cdots ,n\). Note that Nash’s symmetry property captures an anonymity property and an equity property implicitly embedded in it, and in Nash’s framework, these two properties cannot be disentangled. However, in nonconvex bargaining problems, we can extend Nash’s symmetry axiom to two versions (S) and (SS) (see Sect. 3 for formal definitions and discussions): Consider a bargaining problem (A, d) with \(d=0\) such that A is symmetric; then, the axiom (S) requires a solution be anonymous–if \(a\in A\) is a solution candidate, so is any permutation of a, while (SS) requires a solution be equitable–any solution candidate \(a\in A\) must be such that \(a_{1}=\cdots =a_{n}\). Consequently, for nonconvex bargaining problems, we can make a distinction between Anonymity and Equity requirements simultaneously embedded in Nash’s original symmetry axiom. An implication of making this distinction is that the presence of multi-valued solution to nonconvex bargaining problems may allow the existence of anonymous but inequitable solutions. Indeed, from our characterization and refinement results of the Nash solution for nonconvex problems (see Sect. 5), we see clearly the possibility of having anonymous and inequitable solutions to nonconvex bargaining problems. This feature and insight of the Nash solution is inherent to nonconvex bargaining problems. Second, consider the issue of rationalizability of a bargaining solution. For nonconvex bargaining problems, a solution may be set-valued. Consequently, we need certain ‘expansion’ type properties developed in rational choice theory in addition to variants of Nash’s IIA to study rationalizability of a solution to nonconvex bargaining problems. Our results on rationalizability of a solution in Sect. 4 show that, (1) once we take care of expansion type axioms, the results obtained in the context of convex bargaining problems can be extended to the context of nonconvex bargaining problems, and (2) the rationality requirements in rationalizing bargaining solutions to nonconvex bargaining problems are less stringent than those in rational choice theory. The Nash and other prominent solutions to convex bargaining problems have been fruitfully applied in many settings in economics. Given the recent development of theories of nonconvex bargaining problems, one would naturally wonder how and to what extent the developed theory can be applied in such settings. For this purpose, we shall review two applications of theories of nonconvex bargaining problem to economics where nonconvex bargaining problems arise naturally: one instance is when individuals are not characterized by their utilities but by their functionings and capability sets à la Sen (1985), and the other is when discussing distributive justice in a standard problem of resource allocations in economic environments. We will see the reviewed theories of nonconvex bargaining problems can be readily applied to those economic settings (see Sect. 8 for details). The paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 presents notation and definitions needed for our discussion. Sect. 3 introduces several basic axioms used for various axiomatic characterizations of the well-known solutions. In Sect. 4, we discuss rationalizability of bargaining solutions to nonconvex bargaining problems. Section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the Nash solution: characterization, refinement, and extension. Sections 6 and 7 discuss, respectively, characterizations of the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution and the Egalitarian solution. In Sect. 8, we provide two economic applications to illustrate how nonconvex bargaining theories can be applied to resource allocation problems and to the problem of bargaining over opportunity sets. Section 9 contains a brief conclusion.",1

This characterization also involves a standard continuity axiom based on Hausdorff distance. Although this axiom is standard in the literature, we argue that a weaker notion of continuity would be a better conceptual fit with the requirement of consistency, and we ask whether the Nash solution still emerges as the only acceptable one when the weaker axiom is imposed instead. The answer is affirmative. The traditional theory of bargaining, as formulated by Nash (1950), was originally written under the assumption that the number of players is fixed.Footnote 1 The possibility that this number varies was later considered, and characterizations of the solutions that had been central in the classical theory were obtained involving relational axioms pertaining to possible variations in populations (Thomson 2010, is a survey). One of the central axioms in several of these developments is “consistency”. This axiom is the expression for the model of a principle whose implications have now been investigated in a wide range of other contexts. Put in general terms, consistency says that what a solution recommends for each problem in its domain should “agree” with what it recommends for each of the “reduced” problems that results when some of the agents involved initially leave with their “components” of the recommendation and the opportunities open to the remaining agents are reassessed. Depending upon the model, “recommendations” can be vectors of monetary amounts, vectors of goods, list of indivisible goods, combinations of any of those, or more abstractly, profiles of utility levels or welfare levels. Thus the departing agents may leave with assignments of physical resources, or in the latter case with the guarantee that they will reach particular utility levels or welfare levels. A weaker version of the property, “bilateral consistency”, is obtained by imagining that all but two agents leave. (Thomson 2020, is a survey of the literature on the consistency principle.) In the context of bargaining, the consistency of a solution says the following. Suppose that a vector  x has been chosen by the solution for a problem T involving some group Q of players. Then the restriction of x to each subgroup P of Q should be chosen for the problem obtained from T by setting the utilities of all members of \(Q\setminus P\) at the levels specified by x. This is the “reduced problem of T with respect to x and P.” It represents their opportunities if the commitments to the players in \(Q\setminus P\) are to be honored. Geometrically, this problem is the section of T by the affine subspace containing x parallel to the coordinate subspace relative to P. An important result, due to Lensberg (1988), is that the Nash solution is the only solution to satisfy the standard axioms of Pareto-optimality, anonymity, and scale invariance (formal statements are given below) together with bilateral consistency.Footnote 2 This result is based on the possibility that the number of potential players be infinite, a mathematical convenience. Realism dictates that only finitely many players be allowed however, and developing a theory in which only finite populations are allowed seems desirable.Footnote 3 Lensberg does offer a result along those lines: provided the number of potential players is at least three, the Nash solution is the only solution to satisfy the above four axioms together with “continuity”, the requirement that small changes in problems not cause large changes in the chosen outcome.Footnote 4 In the formulation of continuity, convergence of problems is evaluated in the Hausforff topology (the formal definition is given below). Our concern here is with the simultaneous imposition of bilateral consistency and continuity. Informally speaking, the former states the relevance of reduced problems, but the latter ignores them. More precisely, consider a sequence of problems and for each element of the sequence, select a feasible point. Then, it may be that the sequence of problems converges and that so does the sequence of points; yet, for some subgroup of the set of players involved in these problems, the sequence of reduced problems associated with the subgroup and the sequence of points does not converge to the reduced problem of the limit problem associated with the subgroup and the limit point. A more compelling continuity property would take into account whether sequences of reduced problems constructed in the manner just described converge. Such a property is defined by Lensberg (1985) in a characterization of the lexicographic extension of the egalitarian solution (see also Chapter 9 of Thomson and Lensberg 1989). Say that a sequence of problems “strongly converges” if it converges in the usual Hausdorff sense and, in addition, properly defined associated sequences of reduced problems also converge in the Hausdorff sense in the subspaces to which they belong. We say that the solution is “weakly continuous” if under these conditions, the associated sequence of solution outcomes converges to the solution outcome of the limit problem. The question we investigate here is whether, when the number of potential players is finite but at least three, and weak continuity is imposed instead of Hausdorff continuity (and of course still in conjunction with Pareto-optimality, anonymity, scale invariance, and bilateral consistency), a characterization of the Nash solution still results. The answer is yes. It is not the first time that topological issues in bargaining theory have been addressed, Salonen (1996, 1998) being examples. The focus of Salonen’s work is on problems that are not bounded. When specialized to bounded problems, the topologies he considers are equivalent to the Hausdorff topology however. Other authors have considered Hausdorff continuity in conjunction with consistency (Chun 2002). It is an interesting question for future work whether other characterizations that involve Hausdorff continuity persist if weak continuity is imposed instead. In Sect. 2, we introduce notation and definitions, and in Sect. 3 we present the result. In Sect. 4, we conclude.",1

These alternatives can be commodity bundles, resource allocations, income distributions etc. Under well known axioms (von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944; Herstein and Milnor 1953) this ordinal preference relation is representable by a cardinal (expected) utility function, commonly called von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. In our social and economic life we often face more complex prospects resulting from the interaction with others. Examples include starting a business, choosing an employer, collaborating in a research project and joining a political party, a sports club or a social network. In order to decide with whom to cooperate we have to evaluate these complex prospects and it is therefore natural to ask whether there exists an extension of the cardinal utility function on simple prospects to positions in games which are commonly used to model the interaction among individuals. The focus of this paper is on bargaining games as introduced by Nash (1950).Footnote 1 A bargaining game is given by a set of feasible utility allocations available to some group of players and a status quo which is an element of the feasible set.Footnote 2 The players can either agree on some point in this set or else receive their status quo utilities. Roth (1978a, b) claims that the Nash solution (Nash 1950) is a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function on positions in bargaining games, where the weight assigned to a position in a bargaining game is determined by the individual’s attitude towards strategic risk. However, as shown in Gerber (1999), if there are more than two players, then the Nash solution violates one of the axioms that Roth imposes upon the preference relation over positions in bargaining games. This axiom is a considerably stronger version of Nash’s Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. We will show that under a modified condition one can recover Roth’s result for the special case of a preference relation that reflects risk neutrality. It is an open question if a similar result holds for the case of a risk averse or risk loving individual since the asymmetric Nash solution with appropriately chosen weights does not satisfy the modified condition. A characterization of asymmetric Nash solutions as expected utility functions can only be given on the class of two-person games and on the class of hyperplane games. Apart from correcting Roth (1978a, b) the purpose of this paper is to extend the characterization of the Nash solution as a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function on positions in bargaining games to games with arbitrary status quo. To this end we have to impose some additional assumptions upon the preference relation. For example, we will require the preference relation to be translation invariant. The outline of the paper is the following. Section 2 provides the basic notation and definitions and presents a characterization of symmetric and asymmetric Nash solutions. In Sect. 3 we introduce a preference relation on bargaining positions and present the axioms we impose upon this relation. A counterexample shows that the Nash solution violates one of the axioms in Roth (1978a). In Sect. 4 we state and prove our characterization results for symmetric and asymmetric Nash solutions as von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions. We conclude with a discussion of our result in Sect. 5.",2

For instance, partners in a business need to negotiate not only over how to split profits among themselves, but also over how much profit should be re-invested for the following production period, knowing that their level of investment today affects the size of production/profit tomorrow. Countries may attempt to find agreements over environmental issues by taking into account the fact that current decisions can affect the state of the environment and therefore future bargaining possibilities. The focus of the paper is on long-run negotiations in which parties can take actions today to affect the size of future potential benefits they could gain from the bargaining relationship. To address this, we combine bargaining games with dynamic accumulation problems, that is, players do not simply split a surplus for their own consumption, but can also invest part of it and the invested surplus, in turn, affects the size of future surpluses. We modify the classic Rubinstein (1982) game by allowing two (risk-averse) players to consume and invest. The problem is complex, since not only do parties need to solve a (potentially protracted) bargaining stage, but also a dynamic accumulation problem since the agreement they reach at a specific stage affects future bargaining possibilities. Bargaining games which allow parties to make jointly both investment and consumption decisions in a dynamic context are almost unexplored (a discussion of the related literature is contained in the next section). With a focus on (stationary) Markov Perfect Equilibria (MPE)—here consumption and investment are linear time-invariant functions of the state—we will show that the equilibrium is characterized by immediate agreement and is generally unique, but different types of equilibria may arise depending on the value of the parameters. Haggling cannot be an equilibrium phenomenon in our framework because delays are not strategically desirable. A delay in reaching a current agreement implies a delay in realizing not only current mutually beneficial gains but also all future gains. Therefore, even if the current cost of a one-period delay is very small, the total cost of a rejection can be very high for both parties. Also, a player can always avoid a rejection by investing sufficiently.Footnote 1 Although the equilibrium is generally unique, there are three types of outcome that can arise, depending on players’ characteristics, the rate of return and the depreciation rate. First, when there are some frictions in the bargaining process (i.e., both players are sufficiently impatient) and the rate of return is sufficiently high (and/or the depreciation rate is sufficiently low), then both parties extract all the residual surplus (we call this the polar consumption MPE). Second, under certain conditions, there is an (interior) MPE in which both parties leave a positive share of the residual surplus to the opponent. Third, when parties are sufficiently asymmetric, there is an hybrid version of the polar consumption MPE where only one party (the most patient) extracts all the surplus not invested (while the other makes concessions). In standard bargaining games (without investment), extreme demands are not typical, unless the bargaining procedure and/or players’ impatience are also extreme (for instance, in ultimatum games and/or when players value any agreement reached in the future as little as the disagreement outcome). In our model, extreme demands are possible (even in the most interesting case in which a bargaining round is shorter than a production stage) as long as responders can be compensated for accepting them. In other words, the proposer can invest sufficiently and since a larger investment implies a larger surplus in the future, he can then extract the entire current residual surplus without facing a rejection. We will show that equilibria with polar consumption are possible if, first, there are some (not necessarily extreme) frictions in the bargaining process and, second, the rate of return is sufficiently high (and/or the depreciation rate is sufficiently low). In our model, a key role is played by an enriched discounting structure. We not only assume that players’ have (potentially) different rates of time preference but also that in the game there are (potentially) different time intervals across bargaining and production stages. The differential in time preferences has been known to lead to significantly different results from the case in which players are homogeneous (see, for instance, see Lehrer and Pauzner (1999) in the context of repeated games). The assumption of (potentially) different time intervals captures the feature that typically the production stage, in which the surplus is generated, is longer than a bargaining round, that is the time to make a counteroffer.Footnote 2 Hence, one of the aims of the paper is to investigate the resulting (complex) interplay of incentives in the game. We find that while in standard bargaining theory a more patient proposer can extract a larger surplus, in our model this may not hold. The patient party may be forced to demand little to prioritize his investment plan and avoid (costly) rejections. Moreover, when a party becomes more patient, we may have expected that he would invest more, instead the MPE investment rates may decrease for both players (when there are asymmetries). This is because once counteroffers become cheaper for a fairly impatient party, he is able to consume more: investing less and demanding a larger share of the residual surplus. This, in turn, forces his (more patient) opponent to make larger concessions and invest less. Finally, if a party becomes more patient, this may make a rival better off.Footnote 3 Investment plans can be high enough that the rival can effectively exploit the prospect of a higher future consumption levels and extract a larger share of the current surplus. As a result, he will be better off. Muthoo (1999, Chapter 10) is the first contribution with a focus on a repeated (non-cooperative) bargaining game with investment decisions in addition to the standard consumption decisions. Muthoo (1999)’s focus (and that of related contributions, e.g., Zapal 2018) is on steady-state stationary subgame perfect equilibria (while ours is on MPE). As a result, the investment decisions are simplified since parties need to invest as much as necessary to have surpluses of the same size. Indeed, Muthoo’s aim is to apply Muthoo (1995), which is a bargaining model without investment (where parties share an infinite number of surpluses with the same size) to the accumulation problem. In this sense, the problem of how much parties invest in a strategic framework remains open.Footnote 4 Subsequently, Flamini (2012) develops an algorithm to identify the (symmetric) subgame perfect equilibrium in a dynamic bargaining model significantly simpler than in this model (e.g. the number of bargaining stages is finite). In contrast, the current paper focuses on a general model of dynamic bargaining with potentially an infinite number of bargaining stages and possible asymmetries between players (hence, one obvious complication is that it is not possible to apply backward induction and the asymmetry significantly enriches the interplay of forces within the game). There are also two other literatures, namely, on the hold-up problem and on the tragedy of the commons, which are related to the problem considered in this paper. However, there are fundamental differences between these problems and our dynamic bargaining game with investment. In the hold-up problem, parties have the ability to make sunk investments that affect the size of a surplus, before bargaining over the division of such a surplus. Since the investor, who bears all the costs of the investment, cannot appropriate all the benefits, the resulting investment is lower than the efficient level. Typically, only one party is involved in the investment problem, moreover, the investment is once and for all (see, for instance, Gibbons 1992; Muthoo 1998; Gul 2001). An exception is in Che and Sákovics (2004), where parties keep investing until an agreement has been reached, however, once this is struck, the game ends. Differently, the focus of this paper is on parties who jointly and repeatedly need to agree on how much to invest and consume. The second literature, on the tragedy of the commons, considers different parties who can extract part of a surplus for their own consumption and the remaining surplus will affect the size of surplus available in the next period (see, for instance, Levhari and Mirman 1980; Dutta and Sandaram 1993). The tragedy of the commons rests in the fact that parties consume more than the efficient level and therefore the surplus extinguishes quickly (over-exploitation of natural resources is a classic example). Although the typical framework analyzing the problem of the tragedy of the commons is a dynamic accumulation game, it does not include any negotiation (everyone can consume as much as he wishes, given the stock available). Two notable exceptions, which have introduced bargaining in these dynamic accumulation games are Houba et al. (2000) and Sorger (2006). In Houba et al. (2000) parties can potentially bargain forever (á la Rubinstein), but differently from our framework, they need only agree once, since this agreement will be ever-lasting. In contrast, Sorger (2006) is closer to our paper, since in each period parties can reach an agreement over the levels of consumption (Sorger 2006, also allows for endogenous threat points), however, the bargaining process is not formalized, in that it is given by the maximization of Nash products.Footnote 5 We consider a fully non-cooperative bargaining approach and characterize (analytically for some cases) the strategic behavior that arises in equilibrium and the incentives that players need to take into account when forming their strategies. We show that the interplay of forces in our framework can be significantly different from Sorger (2006) and asymmetries can have important consequences in the solution of the problem. The paper is also linked to the large literature on public good provision. A recent, very interesting example is Bowen et al. (2014) which investigate two parties who have to decide over public spending under a simple bargaining procedure (take-it-or-leave-it) with the crucial feature that in disagreement they spend nothing (under discretionary spending) or must implement the previous policy (under mandatory spending). Hence, the status quo is endogenous in the latter. Differently from our case, the size of the surplus is the same in every bargaining stage. Instead, we are interested in long-run relationships in which current decision can determine the size of future surpluses and the bargaining procedure is substantially richer than an ultimatum (players can make counteroffers). The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the model. In Sect. 3, we analyze the MPE; first, in a simple case, in which the elasticity of substitution is equal to 2 (in Sect. 3.1.1) then more generally with a focus on interior solutions in Sect. 3.1.2. The cases in which at least a player consumes all the residual surplus is in Sect. 3.2. Some final remarks are made in Sect. 4. Most of the proofs are contained in the Appendix.",1

What social discount factor should he have used? Is it even meaningful to speak of a correct social discount factor? Why are we discounting the welfare of our children and grandchildren anyway? Doesn’t their welfare count as much or more than ours? The aim of this paper is to put the question of social discounting back on the research agenda, to which end it questions both the theoretical and the empirical basis of discounting. It then offers a new slant on an alternative first proposed in Binmore (2016) to demonstrate that exploring such alternatives is not a hopeless enterprise. The particular alternative studied in this paper is even more radical than the various forms of hyperbolic discounting that have been proposed in response to the failings of exponential discounting in the laboratory. It is based on the finding of psychologists that duration in terms of objective time on a clock is not always an important factor in how we remember the past—that we do not replay the past as though it were a movie, but usually recall only isolated snapshots from our past experience.",

Ballots that include a “none of the above” option or allow voters to cross off the names of those against whom they wish to vote are exceptional. The State of Nevada (Damore et al., 2012), and India since 2013 (Diwakar, 2015) are among the few places where a “none of the above” option is offered. Crossing off names is allowed in French municipal elections (in villages of fewer than 1000 inhabitants) and in Latvian Parliamentary elections. When dissatisfaction cannot be explicitly voiced the options left to voters are abstention (the exit option), spoilt ballot papers, votes for populist or extreme parties (the voice option) and votes for a mainstream party (the loyalty option). The main disadvantage of these options is that the signal that they send out is not clear. For example abstention may reflect dissatisfaction, disinterest or boredom and spoilt ballot papers may be a rational expression of discontent or due to errors. An “approval and disapproval ballot” requires voters to cast one vote for each candidate, which can be a vote in favor of the candidate, a vote against him/her or a neutral vote. Such a ballot offers an explicit option to express dissatisfaction and allows voters to vote in favor of more than one candidate. Three rules using this ballot were tested during a voting experiment conducted on the day of the 2017 French presidential election. The experiment, in which 859 electors from Allevard-les-Bains (in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region) participated, was both a scientific project and a citizen initiative. Voting experiments with electors have been conducted in France since the 2002 presidential election (Baujard & Igersheim, 2011; Balinski & Laraki, 2011; Balinski et al., 2003; Baujard et al., 2014; Favarque et al., 2011). Experiments have also been conducted in Austria during the 2015 regional election (Darmann et al., 2017), in the Czech Republic during the 2002 presidential election (Oreski & Cech, 2020), in Germany during the 2008 regional election and the 2009 federal election (Alos-Ferrer & Granic, 2012) and in Romania during the 2012 local elections (Roescu, 2014). Most experiments ask voters to evaluate each candidate by assigning him/her a grade from a set of grades. Two sets of qualitative grades have been tried: {approval, non approval} and {excellent, very good, good, acceptable, poor, to reject} and three sets of numerical grades: {0,1,2}, {− 1,0,1} and {0,1,…,20}. One general conclusion is that participants appreciate the possibility of assigning a grade to each candidate. The two sets {0,1,2} and {− 1,0,1} are preferred to the set {approval, non approval} but the set {0,1,…,20} proves too complicated (Baujard et al., 2013). Participants attach meaning to numerical grades and behave differently with set {− 1,0,1} and set {0,1,2} even if the resulting rules are equivalent (Igersheim et al., 2016). Whenever several positive or negative grades are proposed differences of interpretation may arise. For example what one voter requires for the grade “excellent” may be what another voter requires for the grade ""very good"".",1

Holler,Florian Rupp,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the preface to his “History of Florence,” Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) remarked that it was his intention when he “first resolved upon writing the things done by the Florentine people…to begin” his “narrative with the year 1434 of the Christian era, at which time the family of the Medici, by the merits of Cosimo and his father Giovanni, exercised more authority in Florence than anyone else” (Machiavelli, 1882 [1532]:7). Indeed, the year 1434 was a turning point. When Cosimo de’ Medici (1389–1464) came back from exile, his supporters had already taken power and dominated the institutions of the Florentine republic in a way such that he could wield “unrestricted power”—not by official political positions but by having his close affiliates filling the positions which were decisive for the well-being of Florence and of the Medici. Once this was achieved the power game inside Florence was decided. Relationships between the leading families and business enterprises were still important, but, for the next 60 years, they did not decide upon who was governing Florence. The Medici was the answer. But how did the Medici gain this position? There are many stories of riots, plots, bribes, exiles, executions, etc. that we find in the piles of history books—but of course we also find them in Machiavelli’s “History of Florence.” However, there is not as visible a history of the underlying business networks and family ties, of coalition formation, of cooperation, and of discrimination that indeed enabled the Medici’s political domination. The motivation of this paper is twofold: to get a deeper understanding of (a) how Cosimo di Medici transferred the oligarchical political system into an autocratic regime and (b) what are the underlying conditions—more specifically, the Medici’s business and marriages networks—which supported this transformation. We find answers to (a) embedded in the outstanding personal characteristics of Cosimo and of his way of decision making.Footnote 1 In this paper, we will focus on (b). We draw the inspiration and most of the data from the seminal paper “Robust Action and the Rise of the Medici, 1400–1434” by Padgett and Ansell (1993). However, while Padgett and Ansell analyze the evolution of the various networks after the Ciompi revolt of 1378–1434 when Cosimo took power, with references also to earlier periods, we take the 1434 networks as given and ask about the power distribution in these networks. But power is a highly abstract concept.Footnote 2 This also shows in our analysis which uses power indices, based on the power of forming coalitions. Nevertheless, the results confirm the outstanding power position of the Medici in their network environment which were a favorable precondition supporting Cosimo’s grip to autocratic power. Section 3 offers a short introduction into power index analysis. Our measures are the Public Value (PV) and Public Good Index (PGI). In Sect. 4, we apply these tools to get a better understanding of the network that resulted from the Florentine elite marriages 1395–1434. Making use of the same method, we study the Florentine business network in Sect. 5 and the marriage-business network in Sect. 6 of the same period. The latter combines the marriage and the business network and the result concurs with the fundamental observation that the Medici did not marry from those families with whom they engaged in economic relations, nor did they do business with those whom they married. In fact, they did not marry those with whom they lived, but they did business with them. In the concluding Sect. 7, we discuss network rigidity and social embeddedness—illustrated by the Medici and their less successful rivals. The next section (Sect. 2) contains a brief introduction into some aspects of the Florentine history and the history of the Medici family inasmuch as these histories add to the network analysis in the following sections. Readers who are interested in the power index method and our analytical results only, are advised to skip this section. However, if so, then readers miss some historical antecedents that motivated this study—and which could be of general interest in understanding the rise of the Medici family and the power of networks. Note that the units of our theoretical analysis—families, parties, marriages, and business—are highly aggregated and our analysis does not allow detailed conclusions. Our focus was to outline a conceptual framework and to test whether the results are conclusive. Because only then, if this step can be accepted, we find it appropriate to ask more specific questions and to fill in more detailed data to answer these questions.",4
38,1,Homo Oeconomicus,07 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41412-021-00113-4,From Polytheism to Monotheism: Zoroaster and Some Economic Theory,December 2021,Mario Ferrero,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The prophet Zoroaster is credited with the founding of the first monotheistic religion in history sometime around the middle of the second millennium BCE, antedating the Israelites and leaving a lasting imprint on Second Temple Judaism and, through it, on later monotheistic religions. While founders and missionaries of other religions set out to overthrow the preexisting polytheism and replace it with an entirely different product, Zoroaster carried out a “reform” of Iranian polytheism, asking his followers to change their ways and beliefs but not to throw away all they had. Consequently, lesser divine beings or “gods” and many old rituals remained, to the dismay of modern European Christian scholars who were looking for a “pure” monotheism. This selective continuity was arguably facilitated by the fact that, alone among the known historical founders of great religions, Zoroaster was a trained, working priest of the traditional religion. Zoroastrianism spread through the Iranian plateau by grassroots conversion for centuries before it rose to state religion in the Achaemenian Empire in the 6th century BCE; and despite the unrelenting pressure from Islam since the Muslim conquest of Iran in the mid-seventh century CE, it still survives today in tiny communities in Iran and India (there called the Parsis) who have remained unswervingly loyal to the traditional beliefs and practices of the faith, remote as they are. This extraordinary endurance calls for explanation. Furthermore, unlike Jesus of Nazareth and many early Christians, Zoroaster was not martyred and martyrdom has no place in the religion’s tradition; and unlike Moses, other Jewish prophets, Jesus, many Christian saints and martyrs, and the prophet Muhammad, neither he nor his followers are reported as performing miracles (Woodward, 2000). Hence, two of the most powerful engines of historical conversion to monotheism (as modeled in Ferrero, 2014a, 2016) are missing in Zoroastrianism, which makes its success and persistence all the more remarkable. One might think that the big question of the transition from polytheism to monotheism could be more fruitfully studied focusing on the big success stories—the great monotheisms that dominate today. However, as will be discussed below, the later entrants are in some ways all derivative of one another and ultimately of Zoroastrianism itself—the original ancestor. That is why this admittedly exotic and remote exemplar may hold some important lesson for the political economy of religion. This paper is a first attempt to understand the Zoroastrian story in terms of rational choice, using the tools of economic analysis. It will argue that two intertwined factors are key to this understanding: the theological structure and the role of the priests. In this, the paper follows in a line of research on the political economy of polytheism that began with Ferrero and Tridimas (2018) on ancient Greco-Roman religion, and Basuchoudhary et al. (2020) on Hinduism. Comparisons with these two polytheistic systems will help to put Zoroastrianism into analytical perspective. On the other hand, the paper contributes to the meager economic literature on the birth of monotheism, which includes Raskovich’s (1996) pioneering work on Judaism as well as Ferrero’s (2014a, 2014b, 2016) on Christianity. Iranian polytheism was a close cousin of Indian polytheism as they both took shape in very ancient times when the Indo-Iranians were still semi-nomadic cattle herders on the Central Asian steppes; subsequently the two peoples parted ways and their religions evolved in different directions. In turn, Indo-Iranian religion was a member of the Indo-European family, and some important family features can be discerned in the Iranian member, including a few deities and a number of important beliefs and rituals. The Avesta—the corpus of Zoroastrian holy scriptures—was transmitted orally by rote memorization in the priesthood for millennia before it was committed to writing in the Sasanian period (probably as late as the 6th century CE). Its oldest part, the Gathas, is a collection of 17 hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself and composed in an archaic form of the language which is close to that of the Rig Veda—the earliest text of Indian religion. Presumably because of its special holiness, this part seems to have been memorized exactly and handed down in a fixed form down the centuries. The rest, written in a later form of the language known as Younger Avestan, appears to have been handed down in a more fluid oral tradition, with each successive generation of priests updating the language, making changes, and adding new material. Nevertheless, it contains some very ancient material. Precisely because some substantial part of the pagan beliefs, rituals and observances survived into Zoroastrianism, scholars can use parts of the Avesta to reconstruct ancient Iranian polytheism, with the help of comparisons with the earliest strata of the Vedic texts. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an outline of traditional Iranian polytheism and Sect. 3 describes Zoroaster’s innovations and the subsequent development of the faith. Section 4 models two aspects of Zoroastrianism, one focusing on the theology and another on the expansion of a missionary faith. Section 5 offers some comparative discussion and concludes.",

39,1,Homo Oeconomicus,26 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41412-021-00107-2,Hans Albert’s Systematic Approach to Critical Rationalism,October 2022,Jitka Paitlová,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Hans Albert was born on February 8, 1921 in Köln, Germany. Although he grew up in a middle-class Protestant family, he soon recognized “the incompatibility of the scientific and religious worldview” (Zimmer and Morgenstern 2011, p. 13). This attitude deepened in his later criticism of theologians and their dogmatic ways.Footnote 2 In the mid-1930s, Albert became a sympathizer of the pessimist critic of culture and philosopher of history, Oswald Spengler. Reading Spengler strongly influenced Albert’s choice of profession—he enlisted in an artillery regiment to start the career of a military officer (1939). During World War II, he fought all over Europe and was wounded several times. At the beginning of May 1945, he escaped into American captivity, where he spent 8 months until arriving home on Christmas Eve the same year. His laconic characterization of his then state of mind: “I was 24 years old. I lived half of my life, 12 years, under Hitler’s reign, and I spent half of that time, about six years, serving this dominion. It will take another twelve years before I finally establish myself professionally” (Albert 2010, p. 56). In Albert’s intellectual development, the war marked a hard awakening and in consequence his first intellectual rebound, that from Spengler. After studies of business administration that according to his own account had the special attraction of occupying so little of his intellectual capacity that he could pursue his wider intellectual interests, Albert became in the early 1950s a doctoral student of the sociologist and economist Leopold von Wiese. When writing his dissertation Rationalität und Existenz. Politische Arithmetik und politische Anthropologie [Rationality and human existence—political arithmetic and political anthropology] he was still under the spell of German philosophers like Hugo Dingler and Martin Heidegger. Dingler had formulated a theory of science in which he combined pragmatism with realism. Albert was inspired in particular by considering the eternal quest for certainty of the conclusions of thought. He became interested in controversies about how in the chain of reasoning ultimate principles in which knowledge is anchored could be justified as certain.Footnote 3 With hindsight it may be deemed ironic that in his dissertation, Albert was still influenced by the early Martin Heidegger. It is one of the revolting aspects of German intellectual history that proponents of “deep German philosophy” like Martin Heidegger and his associates who had been intellectual supporters of the pseudo-heroism of the Nazi abominations dominated the German academic scene after WWII while those philosophers who had been publishing in path-breaking journals like “Erkenntnis” (closed down by the Nazis until its restart in 1975 by Wilhelm K. Essler, Carl Gustav Hempel and Wolfgang Stegmüller) had been expelled and were mostly unheard of in the postwar German academic environment which was dominated by those who had sympathized with pre-scientific modes of thought. That Albert later sharply criticized Heidegger from the point of view of critical rationalism is widely acknowledged, that his later adversaries of the Frankfurt School did not do this as far as the “methods and modes” of thought are concerned, goes mostly unnoticed.Footnote 4 In any event, the second of Albert’s early intellectual turns came soon. After graduating in the summer of 1952, Albert became research assistant (a kind of postgraduate in the present American system) to Gerhard Weisser (a professor of social policy). At that time, due to his reading of the writings of the Viennese philosopher Victor Kraft, he became acquainted with logical positivism. Kraft was a former member of the Vienna Circle and he contributed to developing the academic meetings in Alpbach (a village in the Tyrol in which Erwin Schrödinger spent the last years of his life and was buried in 1961). It was in Alpbach where Hans Albert later should meet Karl Popper. To better understand the work of the Vienna Circle, Albert had begun to study logic in some depth. Yet, after reading Popper’s book The Logic of Scientific Discovery, he gradually abandoned the views of logical positivism. That was Albert’s third intellectual turn and for that matter a lasting one. In 1958, Albert first encountered Karl Popper in Alpbach. Albert admits that until he met Popper personally, he was still influenced by Victor Kraft and accepted the positivism of the Vienna Circle. He had initially thought that Popper also belonged to the Vienna Circle, but after the personal encounter he to his surprise found that Popper sharply criticized positivism and defended metaphysics: “It soon became clear to me that Popper’s rationalism […] was a more satisfying opinion than […] neoclassical empiricism.” (Albert 2010, p. 94) In 1968, ten years after their first personal encounter, Albert’s relationship with Popper was, so to say, “ratified” by the publication of Albert’s philosophically most significant book, Traktat über kritische Vernunft.Footnote 5 Popper highly praised this book, which is dedicated to him and his critical rationalist perspective and acknowledged Albert’s work as a contribution to critical rationalism in its own right. Albert says about Popper that he was a very complicated man, literally “a thinker who was busy with important problems and did not want to waste his precious time on banalities” (Zimmer and Morgenstern 2011, p. 30). Despite Popper’s aforementioned “irritability”, Albert never had any direct conflicts with him. Neither of the two agreed with all of the other’s theses, but they both preferred to avoid clashes which is remarkable in view of Hans Albert’s general love of controversy and his proclivity “to fight things out”. In any event, although they differed on certain points rather strongly, they got along smoothly with each other—certainly facilitated by their agreement on the foundations of critical rationalism.Footnote 6",1

By means of pure reasoning we can also acquire analytical knowledge of logic and mathematics. Yet, can we extend our knowledge to the realm of morals, that is, can we know which actions are morally obligatory or prohibited and which normative demands are morally valid or invalid? Disputes concerning this question have been raging in moral philosophy for a long time. Adherents of ethical cognitivism answer the question affirmatively. Ethical non-cognitivists take the opposite stance. According to their view, knowledge of means-to-ends relations is possible and can form the factual basis of moral evaluations and demands. Moreover, it is possible to know which kind of moral convictions, moral views and rules as a matter of fact prevail in a specific society.Footnote 1 Yet, in the eyes of the non-cognitivists, these prevailing moral convictions and views themselves are not knowledge-based. They are seen as incorporating prescriptive or evaluative elements expressing personal volitions and evaluative attitudesFootnote 2 that (ultimately) result from personal choices and decisions rather than knowledge of facts.Footnote 3 In line with general critical rationalist proclivities Hans Albert as the leading German critical rationalist has been a particularly persistent critic of ethical cognitivism.Footnote 4 But within critical rationalism there have been dissenting voices. Interestingly enough it has been argued that Popper's falsificationism applies to prescriptive moral theories roughly in the same way as to descriptive empirical theories and that this analogy justifies a variant of ethical cognitivism.Footnote 5 Subsequently I intend to critically examine such views in some detail. The aim is to lay out the meta-ethical implications of basic epistemic assumptions of critical rationalism, especially of the version advocated by Albert.",2
39,1,Homo Oeconomicus,01 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41412-022-00122-x,"How to Escape from Model Platonism in Economics: Critical Assumptions, Robust Conclusions, and Approximate Explanations",October 2022,Max Albert,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Model platonism in economics is a methodological attitude that immunizes economic theory against empirical criticism. Technically, platonism (spelled with a small “p” to indicate that this is a modern position rather than Plato’s) is “the view that there exist such things as abstract objects—where an abstract object is an object that does not exist in space or time and which is therefore entirely non-physical and non-mental” (Balaguer, 2016). Model platonism in this sense results if one takes the assumptions of a model to be statements about an “ideal type” while empirical inquiry is concerned with “real types” existing in space and time.Footnote 4 Since the model’s assumptions define the ideal type, they are necessarily true (unless they are contradictory). If economic theory talks only about ideal types and not about real types, it contains no testable claims and is immune to empirical criticism. The term “model platonism” is, however, not restricted to a platonism in the preceding sense. It encompasses all methodological positions denying that economic models can contain testable claims. Nevertheless, model platonism leaves room for empirical economics: one can investigate how historical situations differ from models. However, if economic models involve no testable claims, such comparisons yield no evaluations of the models but only implicit classifications of historical situations: a situation under investigation is judged to be more or less similar to a model, where similarities along some dimensions may, of course, be accompanied by dissimilarities along others. “Unrealistic assumptions” just fall under the heading of dissimilarities. Model platonism, then, turns empirical economics into economic history, but economic history without a lesson. After all, noting similarities and dissimilarities between models and historical situations is just a way to re-describe the empirical data.Footnote 5 By themselves, these data yield neither explanations nor predictions nor policy advice. This would require a theoretical model that applies to the situation under investigation—which we cannot have according to model platonism. One might, of course, select some model for predictions or policy advice anyway. However, the only conclusion from failures would be that, in the situation under investigation, the model was, in an important respect, not similar enough to the situation, implying that the researcher chose the wrong model. Model platonists can only blame researchers for failures; the models are always innocent.Footnote 6 In order to save empirical investigations from practical irrelevance, model platonists have two options. The first option is inductivism. Roughly speaking, inductive arguments are arguments whose premises describe observed cases—for instance, similarities and dissimilarities between a model and several historical situations—and whose conclusions are about, or extend to, unobserved cases, in particular, future cases. The problem with inductive arguments is that their conclusions do not follow from their premises, that is, one can, without contradiction, accept the premises and still reject the conclusion. Inductivists maintain, nevertheless, that science proceeds by induction: they claim that, at least under certain circumstances—for instance, if the number of observed cases is large enough—it is rational to accept the conclusions of inductive arguments. There is, of course, nothing wrong with forming conjectures inspired by observations (or, for that matter, by anything else). According to critical rationalism, however, these conjectures need to be tested severely before they can be accepted. Listing supporting cases is no substitute for severe testing. A severe test is an effort to find counterexamples. It makes use of background ideas and, possibly, competing conjectures suggesting where counterexamples might be found. New conjectures should not be accepted unless they have survived a serious search for counterexamples. Indeed, survival of such a search is the best reason we can have for accepting a conjecture.Footnote 7 This principle applies not only to science, where counterexamples are failed predictions, but also to logic and mathematics (Lakatos, 1976). A logical or mathematical proof is nothing but a chain of conjectures about deductive relations between propositions. Each of these conjectures can, in principle, be refuted by a counterexample. If no counterexamples can be found, the proof is tentatively accepted. The subjective feeling of certainty caused by reading a well-presented proof is irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that a critical discussion among experienced specialists has yielded no counterexamples to any of the steps in the chain of deductions. Inductivism, then, cannot solve model platonism’s problems. Another option is more attractive. Model platonists might develop assumptions about the circumstances under which models with unrealistic assumptions are, in certain respects, sufficiently similar to situations in time and space. This means that there are two levels of theorizing: a first level where unrealistic models are developed, and a second level concerning the relation of the unrealistic models to experience. Yet, a list of second-level assumptions would be a second-level model. If this second-level model can do without unrealistic assumptions, the same should be possible on the first level. And if the second-level model also features unrealistic assumptions, model platonists face, again, the same problem they were unable to solve on the first level. Model platonism, then, is hardly convincing once one begins to wonder how it might make sense of empirical investigations. Before turning to the critical-rationalist alternative, I want to discuss two important variants of model platonism: the theory-as-tautology view and structuralism. Both run into the problems just discussed. In each case, the problem of unrealistic assumptions takes center stage. According to the standard view, economic theories come in the form of models, and models are lists of assumptions. Let \({A}_{1}\) to \({A}_{n}\) be a model’s assumptions. We write \(\wedge\) for “and” and \(A\) for the conjunction \({A}_{1}\wedge \dots \wedge {A}_{n}\). Let \(F\) be a conclusion of interest (or a conjunction of such conclusions) that follows from these assumptions. As an example, consider the neoclassical model of a competitive exchange economy, which consists of the following assumptions, stated in a non-technical way: There are many agents, each of which is endowed with specific quantities of several consumption goods. Each agent has a complete preference ordering over the set of all conceivable bundles of these goods. There are perfectly competitive markets for the goods where agents trade these goods at market-clearing prices. External effects are absent. From the conjunction of these assumptions (\(A\)), it follows that the allocation of goods resulting from market transactions is efficient (\(F\)). Which claim of this model should be tested? Superficially, the logical structure of the model gives no hints. Clearly, it makes no sense to test just \(F\): the model’s message is not that, unconditionally, market allocations are always efficient. Any relevant testable claim derived from the model must be a conditional claim.Footnote 8 One might be tempted to consider, as an alternative to just \(F\), the conditional statement “if \(A\), then \(F\)”, symbolically \(A\to F\). However, since \(F\) follows from \(A\), the statement \(A\to F\) is a conceptual truth or “tautology”, as it is often called in economics: it is true but contains no factual information. From a logical point of view, \(A\to F\) is equivalent to “All bachelors are unmarried”.Footnote 9 The theory-as-tautology view holds that economic theory consists solely of tautologies like \(A\to F\): the only message of a model is that its conclusions must hold under its assumptions. This view is quite unattractive. Tautologies, after all, do not explain or predict. We cannot explain why Uncle Bill is unmarried by pointing out that he is a bachelor. Nor makes it any sense to use the fact that he is a bachelor to predict that he is unmarried.Footnote 10 Moreover, the theory-as-tautology view runs into problems when confronted with the question of how theory and empirical investigations interact. Empirical testing of a tautology like \(A\to F\) is obviously a waste of time since the result is known beforehand, independently of all empirical facts. If we find no cases where \(A\) is true, \(A\to F\) is irrelevant but not refuted. If we find cases where \(A\) is true, that is, cases where all the assumptions of the model hold, then \(F\) must hold—just as every bachelor must turn out to be unmarried. So what does empirical work achieve? On the basis of the theory-as-tautology view, there is no reasonable answer. For instance, in a book that, at its time, was regarded as an exemplary combination of theory and empirical investigation, the econometrician and international-trade theorist Edward Leamer retreated to the claim that “[a] judgment about the success of an empirical approximation to a tautological theory is ultimately a matter of aesthetics” (Leamer, 1984, xvi). Yet, claiming that a tautology is only approximately true is a contradiction, as when one claims that almost all, but not all bachelors are unmarried.Footnote 11 The only attractive aspect of the theory-as-tautology view is that it absolves theorists from taking unrealistic assumptions seriously. Leamer (1984), for instance, is concerned with a model of international trade—an extension of the neoclassical model of the competitive exchange economy—whose assumptions are highly unrealistic, as he points out in great detail. Not only are most of the assumptions false for the years and countries he considers; for some of them, it is almost inconceivable that they could ever be true of any group of trading countries at any time and place. While the conjunction \(A\) of the model’s assumptions is false, one can still empirically check some conclusion \(F\). In Leamer’s case, \(F\) is a linear relation between trade vectors and factor endowments across countries. However, what could one learn from testing \(F\)? Should \(F\) turn out to be true in some situation, it would be unclear why—the model, at least, cannot explain such a result since it states conditions for \(F\) that did not hold. Should \(F\) turn out to be false, this implies that at least one of the model’s assumptions must have been false in the situation under investigation—but this was already known before the test. Unrealistic assumptions, then, make it difficult to say what a test could achieve. This difficulty should matter. But according to the theory-as-tautology view, it does not. As a tautology, the theory cannot and need not be tested. Of course, while the assumptions of the model might be false, elementary logic implies that the conclusion of interest might still be true. Indeed, in Leamer’s (1984, 187) opinion, the linear relationship works surprisingly well in the two years, 1958 and 1975, under consideration, despite drastic deviations from the model’s assumptions. Because the whole exercise is not considered as a test of a model or a theory, it does not matter that the econometric test is just concerned with the model’s conclusion. Leamer the trade theorist, then, is completely safe from Leamer the econometrician. The trade theorist states only the tautology \(A\to F\) and is silent on the question of whether any of the assumptions or the conclusion might be true. The econometrician shows that \(A\) is false but that \(F\), nevertheless, looks quite good from an econometric point of view. This is considered as a surprise and might please the trade theorist. But if \(F\) had been rejected, the tautology \(A\to F\) would still be true. The empirical results themselves are contributions to economic history. Leamer found that, in two years, a certain linear relationship held up quite well among sixty countries. No conclusion for other times and places follows. Any conclusions going beyond the data require as a further premise some non-tautological theory; however, according to the theory-as-tautology view, economics has no such theories on offer. A second variant of model platonism is called structuralism. While the theory-as-tautology view appears only in side remarks, structuralism is a movement in philosophy of science.Footnote 12 Structuralists view the model of the exchange economy as a purely formal structure involving variables like “agent 1”, “good 1” and so on. An assumption like “agent 1 has ten units of good 1” must be considered as a formula which is neither true nor false. In order to apply the formal structure, the variables have to be interpreted in terms of a specific historical situation. Of course, not any interpretation will do. There exists an intended interpretation: “agent 1” has to be interpreted as a person, “good” as a consumption good, and so on. For instance, in the situation under consideration, there might be a person, Adam, and some apples. We stipulate that agent 1 is Adam and that good 1 is apples, with pieces as unit of measurement. With this interpretation, “agent 1 has ten units of good 1” turns into “Adam has ten apples”, which is true or false depending on the number of apples owned by Adam. Given an interpretation of the complete formal structure, we can ask whether the interpretation turns all formulas into true statements. In this case, the set of all the things providing the interpretation (Adam, the apples, and so on) are said to be a model (in the logico-mathematical sense) of the formal structure. What economists call a model, then, structuralists consider as a formal structure (a set of formulas), and each interpretation that turns the formulas into true statements is called a model. From this point of view, the principal empirical question is whether the formal structure has any models. Since structuralism considers scientific theories not as statements about the world but only as formal structures, it has also been called the “non-statement view” of scientific theories. If structuralism meets unrealistic assumptions, model platonism results. A formal structure whose intended interpretation yields unrealistic assumptions has no relevant models (in the logico-mathematical sense) in space and time. The way out is to assume that there exists a model of the formal structure not in time and space but as an abstract object. When we then interpret the formal structure in terms of the abstract object, the formulas turn into true statements about the abstract object. This move brings us back to platonism in the strict sense of the term. According to structuralism, what theoreticians have to say is, again, necessarily true and not subject to empirical criticism. Empirical economists are left with the task of finding out which economic model fits which historical situation. Since, however, no economic model fits exactly (because of the unrealistic assumptions), they can only classify the situations they consider as more or less similar to the theoreticians’ abstract objects. This is, of course, just a way of re-describing the observational data. In order to achieve more, structuralists need to embrace inductivism or resort to second-level theorizing about the relations between the theorists’ abstract objects and the world of experience. Some economists explicitly oppose the unrestricted use of unrealistic assumptions, demanding greater realism in economic models. On the face of it, these economists seem to reject model platonism. Yet, a closer look reveals that demands for more realism alone are insufficient to escape from model platonism. Let us begin with the intuitively appealing idea that a model with unrealistic assumptions should in some sense be a good approximation to the situation under investigation. This seems to rule out wildly unrealistic assumptions. Alas, Friedman (1953, 15) defines a model to be a good approximation if and only if the conclusion of interest from the model holds in the situation under investigation. With this definition, the requirement that a model should be a good approximation to the situation under investigation just means that the conclusion of interest should hold. Again, it does not matter whether the assumptions are realistic or unrealistic. Some economists have tried to improve upon this idea of models as approximations by adding robustness requirements, thereby restricting the use of unrealistic assumptions. According to Gibbard and Varian (1978, 674), even models with very unrealistic assumptions may help us to understand a situation if their conclusions are robust, meaning that the conclusions do not depend on the details of the assumptions. Similarly, Ng (2016, 182) considers simplifying assumptions to be acceptable if they simplify the analysis but do not change the conclusions substantially. Pfleiderer (2020, 84–85) argues in favor of using a „real-world filter“, rejecting models if critical assumptions contradict what is already known. Rodrik (2015, 19, 26–27, 94–98), citing an earlier version of Pfleiderer’s paper, agrees and requires critical assumptions to be close to reality. Actually, Solow (1956, 65) already expresses similar thoughts in an opening paragraph that reads like an implicit criticism of Friedman (1953). All these considerations come down to the same point: one may use unrealistic assumptions only if this simplifies the analysis without changing the conclusion of interest. This robustness requirement sounds reasonable, but as it stands, it is useless. Let us state the requirement formally. Let \(A\) be the conjunction of the assumptions of the unrealistic model and \(F\) the conclusion of interest from the model, so that \(A\to F\) is a tautology. “Unrealistic” means: in the situation under investigation, it is known that \(A\) is false. Robustness in this sense would require that the unrealistic model \(A\) could, in principle if not in practice, be replaced by a perfectly realistic model \({A}^{*}\) also implying \(F\). It is surprisingly trivial to check empirically whether robustness in this sense holds: just check \(F\). If \(F\) turns out to be false in the situation under investigation, this implies that \({A}^{*}\) is false for any tautology \({A}^{*}\to F\); hence, robustness fails. If \(F\) turns out to be true in the situation under investigation, and if we assume that \(F\) is no miracle and, therefore, amenable to an explanation in principle (even if we may be unable to find this explanation), then there must exist some perfectly realistic model \({A}^{*}\) implying \(F\). Consequently, the robustness requirement holds if and only if \(F\) is true.Footnote 13 For this reason, the robustness requirement invoked by the post-Friedmanian proponents of realism adds nothing to Friedman’s approach to approximation. Again, an unrealistic model turns out to be a good approximation if and only if the conclusion of interest from the model holds in the situation under investigation because then and only then the robustness requirement holds. While the demand for more realism in economic models goes in the right direction, it must be supported by a more detailed analysis of a model’s components, which then allows for a better characterization of robustness and approximate explanation.",3

But two things that stand out are his concept of a ‘technology’ and his application of that concept to a wide variety of social practices – including the ‘scientific’ practices of economists.Footnote 1 Technological descriptions can be implemented in practice; but a technology as such cannot determine whether it should be implemented; or, where some technology is as matter of fact ‘embodied’ in some practice, whether that practice should be sustained in cases where human actors can intentionally influence that practice. Each intentional implementation of a technological blueprint is an ‘experiment’ in itself. That experiment can be empirically assessed in a value-neutral manner in terms of whether the combination of nomological hypotheses represented and/or implied by the technological description are corroborated by its predicted effects or not. Obviously, all the familiar distinctions between causality and correlation come into play here, as do methods such as randomized controlled trials, time series and econometric analyses. Though employing these methods can be seen as expressive of Hume’s aim of introducing “experimental methods to moral subjects”,Footnote 2 we do not intend to discuss the Humean program of ‘social science’ in general here. For our purposes, it is essential to note that from Hans Albert’s critical rationalist-cum-realist point of view, all these activities can and ought to comply with the methodological norms of standard scientific practice – in particular the requirement of value-neutrality. The economic philosophy characterization of the process of critical rationalist examination of technologies amounts itself to a technology which is to be assessed according to its own critical rationalist standards (in terms of its likely empirical consequences for pursuing certain ‘hypothetically’ presumed ends of evidence-based disciplinary practice).Footnote 3 In this conceptualization, Albert’s technology concept may be seen as the benchmark in economic philosophy: like disciplinary science, economic philosophy should subject itself to norms of value-neutrality when exploring (institutional) means that may be conducive to human pursuits (whichever these may be). Buchanan appears to accept the spirit of technological analyses; but he thinks that he can add elements to the technology benchmark without violating basic methodological precepts of value-neutrality. However, once he starts to spell these additions out in terms of his contractarian approach, it becomes clear that his intended restriction of technological analyses to universally acceptable technologies is inconsistent with value-neutrality. Buchanan’s contractarianism cannot be accommodated within a conception of economic advice-giving that respects the requirement of value-neutrality as a constraint on scientifically legitimate argument. Maybe there are other additions that do not fail to comply with value-neutrality, but we will focus here on illustrating why Buchanan’s contractarian universalism is not consistent with a modern critical-rationalist/realist scientific economic practice as spelled out by Albert. Instead of talking about Hans Albert, we will rather practice what he preaches; and adopt his technological perspective in criticism of Buchanan’s aim of deriving a universalist foundation of his normative contractarianism within economics.Footnote 4 The present essay argues that incorporating universalist quasi-Kantian contractarian ethical principles of ‘Buchantianism’ (Bu-Kantianism) into precepts of what economists should do (Buchanan 1964/1999, vol. 1, pp. 28–42) violates other values to which Buchanan and his followers declare allegiance: Buchantians cannot coherently claim to respect the sovereignty of envisioned advisees and then restrict their advice-giving practice exclusively to technologies that are to the advantage of all potential advisees.Footnote 5 To put this central point slightly differently, Buchanan and his followers do not fully subscribe to the norm that economic advisors ought to be partisan for the particular interests of particular advisees. Buchantian economic advisors would in this regard deviate not only from the role-obligations of other counselling professions as traditionally perceived (the medical and legal professions exemplify) but also from Buchanan’s declared aim of respecting the sovereignty of individual advisees in setting the agenda: if advisees are not asking for what serves the interests of all potential advisees symmetrically, insisting that advice should exclusively focus on what serves the interests of all rather than the interests of particular advisees who may not themselves be universalists, is violating Buchanan’s own mantra not to ‘play at being God’ (Buchanan 1975/1999, vol. 7, p. 4). A critical rationalist ‘Albertian’ technologist whose analysis can serve as advice to sovereign individuals — ones who ‘give’ for themselves the ends, aims and values to be pursued — can avoid any such incoherence. She can focus on the empirical suitability of technologies in a value-neutral way, while remaining silent on whether the ends to which the technologies may be put should or should not be pursued. Under this neutrality condition, providing technological information to those who as a matter of fact want to use that information to serve the ends of all is perfectly compatible with having those who use the technological information to serve their own individual purposes regardless of whether this affects others negatively or not. In the next Sect. (2.) we will briefly explore where economics may be located “between predictive science and moral philosophy” in Buchanan’s scheme of things and beyond; and then turn to different types of norms that might be relevant in economic advice-giving (3.). Next, we expand on our diagnosis that Buchantianism seems to miss the conceptual distinction between particularistic and universalistic individualism (4.).

Vanberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The title “Embroiled in Controversies” (In Kontorversen verstrickt) Hans Albert (2007) has chosen for his autobiography is clearly meant to characterize the nature of his life’s work. Indeed, in much, if not most, of his writings he critically scrutinizes contributions from various academic fields, including philosophy, theology, law and, in particular economics, the field he had chosen to earn his academic degrees in. Unaffected by strategic concerns that might have recommended displaying a more deferential attitude towards a discipline one wants to earn degrees in, Albert adopted quite early on a critical outlook at the neoclassical style of thinking that dominated in teaching and in textbooks (2007, pp. 65 f.). The neoclassical version of economics he found wanting in two respects. Firstly, with its tendency to focus on “the money flow and the flow of goods” ([1963] 2012, p. 316),Footnote 1 it fails to account for the fact that economics is a social science, a science that deals with social relations among human beings. Secondly, with its tendency “to immunize economic statement and sets of statements (models) from experience” (ibid. p. 300) —a tendency Albert referred to as “model Platonism” (ibid.) —it fails to meet the essential requirement for qualifying as an empirical science, namely to posit nomological hypotheses that exclude, i.e. are incompatible with, certain logically possible cases (ibid. p. 306), or, in other words, hypotheses that are falsifiable. It is scarcely surprising that, by displaying his critical assessment of standard economics in his doctoral and in his Habilitation theses, Albert invited resistance among those who were to judge the merits of his works, and a number of obstacles needed to be removed before he was granted his doctoral degree and the title “Privatdozent”, the license to teach.Footnote 2 As Albert reports in retrospect (1977, pp. 15 f.; 2006 b, pp. 211; 2007, pp. 72 f.), over time he came to revise his assessment of economics, if not in its neoclassical incarnation, but as a research tradition. While upholding his critique of the model-Platonism in economic thought, he radically changed his view of the relation between economics and sociology. In contrast to the view, argued for in his early writings, that the deficiencies he diagnosed in neoclassical theorizing might be remedied “by sociologizing economic thought” ([1963] 2012, pp. 315), he came to recognize that he had overestimated the possibility of improving economics by theoretical imports from sociology, and underestimated the explanatory potential inherent in the discipline’s own classical tradition (1977, p. 13; 2007, p. 81). The ambivalence in Albert’s relation to economics, the peculiar combination of his continued critical outlook at its neoclassical version and his conversion to a defender and advocate of the explanatory potential its classical, Smithean tradition offers, provides the background against which this paper takes a closer look at what has been a subject of Albert’s life-long struggle with economics, his critique of welfare economics. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 looks at the methodology of critical rationalism that informs Albert’s critique of neoclassical economics. Section 3 summarizes Albert’s outlook at classical political economy as a general paradigm for social science. Section 4 discusses his critique of welfare economics and its suggested solution to the problem of “rational politics.” Section 5  provides a critical assessment of Albert’s “social technology” approach. Section 6 contrasts the latter with the perspective of constitutional political economy. Section 7 applies this perspective to Albert’s critique of the concepts of consumer sovereignty and voters’ or citizens’ sovereignty. Section 8 concludes.",3
