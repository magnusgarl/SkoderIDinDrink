They can also be helpful to analyze the efficiency of a tax policy or to measure the level of social stratification and polarization. They are most frequently applied to dynamic comparisons (comparing inequality across time). The Gini concentration coefficient based on the Lorenz curve is the most widely used measure of income inequality. The Zenga point concentration measure, based on the Zenga curve, has recently received some attention in the literature. The true values of income inequality coefficients are usually unknown and they can only be estimated on the basis of sample data coming from household budget surveys. Estimators of concentration coefficients are usually nonlinear, thus their standard errors cannot be obtained easily. The methods of variance estimation that can solve this problem include: various replication techniques, Taylor expansion, and parametric procedures based on income distribution models. The main objective of the paper is to use survey data to analyze income inequality in Poland by socio-economic groups by means of selected concentration measures and their decomposition. This approach can further be used to assess relative economic affluence of one subpopulation with respect to another and to estimate stratification indices. To complete the analysis, some variance estimation techniques that can be used to estimate the standard errors of Gini and Zenga inequality measures should also be presented and applied.",2

Progress taking place in various fields and integration with the European Union set directions for further changes concerning work safety and the approach to the development and improvement of employee competence. Today, people are increasingly considered to be a crucial element on which the success of an organisation depends, and the need for the effective and appropriate development of employees is more important than ever (Znajmiecka-Sikora and Kędzierska 2011). As indicated by the analysis of organisations, they often embrace the concept of learning organisation more and more. That term defines the contemporary organisation as such that is capable of satisfying customer needs and competing in the market thanks to its ability to learn and adapt to changing operating conditions. That is achieved by the organisation (to put it quite simply) through the openness of its employees to new ideas and trends as well as constant improvement and development of its members, structures, and processes that take place in it (Bieńkowska 2009). As indicated by a study conducted on the group of 4,000 employers, Polish employers have to fulfil numerous requirements specified in a variety of legal provisions in order to offer their employees safe conditions of work. They often get lost in a maze of regulations. With a view of satisfying the safety requirements imposed on them, they engage qualified employees and delegate safety-related tasks to them. At present, Polish employers expect Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) service employees to know applicable legal regulations, be able to prepare required documentation (e.g., OSH instructions), asses occupational risk or draw up a post-accident report, and effectively cooperate with inspection agencies such as the National Labour Inspectorate or the National Sanitary Inspectorate (compare: Znajmiecka-Sikora et al. 2009, 2010). Moreover, several years’ professional experience of the authors of this article, who acted in the capacity of expert witnesses or specialists in occupational safety and health, proves that there are numerous irregularities in maintaining safe working conditions by employers, which makes accidents occur. Actions taken by OSH services turned out to be insufficient in the majority of such court cases, and OSH personnel showed an outrageous lack of knowledge when appearing before the courts. The article aims to analyse the knowledge, qualifications, and professional competences of OSH service employees—a group that is crucial for maintaining an appropriate safety level in the organisation—in the context of employers’ expectations.",

Labor market discrimination exists when two equally qualified individuals are treated differently solely on the basis of their individual characteristics. Inequalities in the labor market can occur in many different ways, such as by gender, sexual orientation, age, race, disabilities, religion, language, etc. (Cain 1986, p. 693) Disparity can be multidimensional and linked to inequality in skills, education, opportunities, happiness, health, life expectancy, welfare, assets, and social mobility. It is mostly measured by wage differentials, but the non-income dimension is also considered (see Heshmati (2004) as an example). Labor market discrimination by gender, race, and ethnicity is a world-wide problem and, as Neuman and Oaxaca (2003) have claimed, estimation of various types of discrimination has become routine since the wage decomposition methodology was popularized by Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973). Therefore, there is a large amount of research concerning different types of inequalities reported in the literature. For instance, problems of racism are discussed by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), age discrimination by Neumark and Stock (1999), and disablism (disability discrimination) by Baldwin and Johnson (1994), among others. Eurobarometer research has pointed out two negative phenomena: violence against women and wage inequality between women and men. Gender equality is a policy objective of basically universal acceptance and is a subject of interest in many national governments, international organizations, research institutes, and political pressure groups. The strategy for equality between women and men (2010–2015) was adopted by the European Commission on 21 September 2010. Also, the United Nations Millennium Declaration promulgates the pursuit of gender equality as one of the eight Millennium Development Goals to be reached by 2015. Problems regarding women’s participation in the labor market became one of the main issues under current discussion because of the financial–economic crisis and aging of societies in developed countries. In our research, we focus on gender wage disparities in the labor markets of European Union member countries. The paper consists of five sections based on literature reviews and my own empirical research. The first section provides a general overview on gender discrimination. Next, different measures of inequalities are presented. The section following that is dedicated to the description of the labor market in centrally-planned economies and the impact on the current situation in transitional countries. A literature review regarding gender inequality is presented in the fourth section. The last section contains some results of empirical investigations. The main aim of our analysisFootnote 1 is to answer the question: What affects gender disparities in earnings? The analysis initially focuses on the European labor market as a whole. Gender pay gap (GPG) data estimated by Eurostat on the basis of metadata from the Structure of Earning Survey (SES) are provided. The paper is also concerned with the labor market in Poland that represents the largest (in terms of population, territory, and GDP) transition economy country among new European Union member states. Research is provided applying micro data from the Labor Force Survey (LFS).",10

One attractive alternative investment opportunity in the financial market was investment in art. Thus, there is growing literature in arts and investment: Frey and Pommerehne (1988, 1989a, b), Pesando (1993), Chanel et al. (1994), Mei and Moses (2002), Worthington and Higgs (2003, 2004), Campbell, (2004, 2008), Hsieh et al. (2010), Higgs (2012) and Frey and Cueni (2013), among others. The majority of publications refer to well-developed art markets. However, the existence of “emerging” markets was already noted by Kraeussl and Logher (2010). The art market in Poland is limited in scale as it has only been developing since 1989, when the transformation of the economic system began. During the communist regime, the level of life and everyday living problems did not allow Polish society to create demand for artworks similar to the one in Western Europe. However, even in that time there were individuals who could collect art and afford even high pieces. The past two decades were characterized by changes in income distribution and the structure of consumption that caused the increased interest in the art market in Polish society. The aim of this paper is to describe the art market in post-communist Poland and to discuss the results of our investigation concerning construction of the art price index for Polish paintings. The hedonic art price indexes are evaluated on the basis of hedonic regressions which are estimated using data from auctions of paintings held in Poland in the years 2007–2010.",6

Thus, Du and Li predict that governments with more abundant fiscal resources will impose stricter bank capital regulation to minimize efficiency losses from moral hazard that occur under soft budget constraints on banks. That is, they argue that bank capital regulation becomes an institutional solution to the problem of soft budget constraints on banks. In contrast to Du and Li (2007), this paper focuses on soft budget constraints on firms, not on banks. It may be supposed that bank capital regulation prevents banks from refinancing poor projects and hardens the budget constraints of firms. However, this paper shows that bank capital regulation is one of the causes of soft budget constraints on firms. In this paper, the definition of a soft budget constraint on a firm is as follows. A firm has a soft budget constraint if the lending bank allows the firm to continue to operate even when continuation is ex post inefficient.Footnote 2 Dewatripont and Maskin (1995) have shown that soft budget constraints arise because the initial investment is sunk. In their model, refinancing that would be ex ante inefficient is ex post efficient due to sunk costs. This paper assumes ex post inefficiency in order to show that soft budget constraints arise not from sunk costs but from bank capital regulation. That is, in contrast to the models of Dewatripont and Maskin (1995) and Berglöf and Roland (1997), refinancing of poor projects is ex post inefficient when seen in isolation. The analysis of this paper has some interesting results. First, bank capital regulation may induce soft budget constraints on firms. Second, soft budget constraints are more likely to arise when the regulation is less strict, that is, when banks’ minimum required capital ratios are lower. Third, soft budget constraints are more likely to arise when the liquidation value of a project is smaller and the return from the project and its success probability are larger. This paper is also related to the literature on financial institution failures. In the literature, many researchers, such as Barth (1991), Amos (1992), Cebula (1994, 2010), Litan (1994), and Chou and Cebula (1996), have examined factors behind financial institution failures. These factors include (1) economic conditions, such as the growth rate of gross product and the cost of funds; (2) bank financial conditions, such as capital ratios and charge-offs; (3) banking deregulation, which increases competition among banks and lowers the profitability of banks; and (4) monetary policy, such as high growth rates of money supply in a stagnant economy, that induces banks to make risky loans with low rates of return. In comparison with the existing literature, this paper offers a new explanation for bank failures. Specifically, this paper suggests that bank capital regulation may increase the probability of bank failures by bringing about the soft budget constraint problem, which reduces the profitability of banks. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the basic model. The third section analyzes bank behavior in the absence of bank capital regulation, and the fourth section analyzes bank behavior under binding bank capital regulation. The last section concludes with a summary and some implications.",

One of the crucial questions in analyzing the investment opportunities is whether assets such as works of art appearing on the Polish auction market should be the subject of our concern during the turbulences that characterize contemporary financial markets. Another question is whether the artworks and their prices and rates of return, as alternative investment features, can be taken into consideration. As there is growing interest in the economics of culture and art, many theoretical publications on the subject appeared (Hausner, Karwińska, Purchla 2013); (Forte, Mantovani 2004); (Throsby 2010); (Towse 2011) among others. Moreover, there is a broad discussion in the world literature on various aspects of art as an investment, focusing on methods of calculating indices of art markets that are necessary in defining the return on investment in art. The objective of this article is to fill the gap in research on the Polish emerging art market. There are Polish artists who have achieved international recognition and financial appreciation, and whose works exceeded the price level of $1 million: Tamara de Lempicka (who is a prominent member of a small group of global female artists; the most valuable painting by Lempicka ever sold publicly reached $8.5 million at Sotheby’s NY in 2011), Henryk Siemiradzki (above $2 million at Sotheby’s NY in 2011), Roman Opalka ($1.2 million at Christie’s London 2010) and Piotr Uklański ($1 million at Philips London in 2006) [Gajewski, Potocki; 2013; 6–8]. However, their works are rarely auctioned in Poland, which has developed its separate art market segment. The domestic Polish auction market trades the artworks of painters who have not managed to get on the global market yet. But, as the source of paintings proved quite effective by revealing talented and appreciated painters, there is a need to show the returns on investment in artworks within the Polish art market and to compare it with art markets in other EU countries. There has been neither a hedonic price study nor any other studies on Polish painters. The objective of this study is to construct a quarterly Polish art market index and to answer the question on the rates of return on this market. It will enable us to discuss the relationship of Polish art indices and returns with the indices of European (i.e. French and British) art indices and returns based on data published on the website www.artprice.com.",6

We focused on artwork evaluation for private and public institutions (Forte and Mantovani 1998a, b, 1999a, b, 2000a, 2004; Mantovani 2001, 2008a, b; Forte et al. 2001). We developed the Forte-Mantovani (FM) art matrix to assign economic value and financial return to paintings. In addition, we developed other tools for art goods decision-making such as a fuzzy methodology to take care of non-quantitative variables and product cycle theory to assess the cycles of artist production and art schools according to the profitability of investments in visual arts. The FM art matrix, a variant of the Boston matrix, has four quadrants for high and low values and variable or stationary values (Table 1). The Boston matrix helps financial investors and industrial companies better allocate resources. It is used as an analytical tool in brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis. With the Boston matrix, investors can analyze the revenue streams of shares listed on the stock exchange (Mantovani 2008b). The FM matrix examines art products and capital values, capital gains and losses and, in some cases, current revenues.Footnote 1
 Cultural goods have an existence value and a use value. Their existence value may not be reflected in the market valuation. The use value, generally, for visual art goods does not manifest itself in monetary prices because either these goods belong to private owners, who enjoy their use directly, or they belong to a public or non-profit entity, which offers them to users at political prices or for free. Nevertheless, there is a market assessment of the use value through its capitalization by the market price assigned by collectors and art dealers (who work on supply and demand) and by art experts. One may also take into account the assessment by the public that visits art exhibits and museums measured by their visit frequency. The four-quadrant FM matrix depicts the capital value of the valuation on the vertical axis (medium to high versus low) and the variability of the valuation on the horizontal axis (high versus low). In the top left quadrant of the matrix, art goods with high capital value and high variability are positioned. Art goods with medium value and low variability are categorized in the top right quadrant. In the bottom left quadrant, works of mediocre or low value subject to increases or decreases are placed. Finally, in the bottom right quadrant works with stationary, mediocre, or low value are listed. In the top left quadrant, the star works, classified as super star, star, and starlets, are presented according to their value. They can move from one subcategory to another and, in some cases, fall into one of the right quadrants. The top right quadrant is where the blue chips and cash-cow works are placed, classified as super chips, top chips and blue chip standard depending on their value. Some of these are decayed stars. Others could become stars after market promotion. The bottom left quadrant is the place for questions. These are works with unclear value, casual variations (random), or works of doubtful authenticity, which could be either fake or authentic. The bottom right quadrant is labelled portfolios and dogs. Portfolios are works that appear as mediocre low price investments. Dogs are bad works with no market value and no value to experts. Analyzing the economic value of artworks derived from prices achieved at international auctions, including 560 auction houses in 16 countries in 1985 (Art Sales Index 2007), we identified both endogenous and exogenous variables (Forte and Mantovani 1998b) that were relevant in determining economic value (Table 2). The endogenous variables selected for the FM Art Matrix belong to three classes of factors inherent to the particular work: artistic values, hedonic values, and technical factors. The first class, artistic values, includes the author, his/her work, and the art movement to which the work belongs. The second class, hedonic factors, includes functional and practical values (such as those of a tapestry, mosaic or jewel), extra-artistic information values (political and religious figures, portraits of famous persons, historic events) and pleasant sensations. The third class, technical factors, consists of dimension and materials, provenience (from a famous art collection, connection with other works), rarity, state of conservation, and existence of a signature. We divided the exogenous variables into two classes regarding, respectively, macro socioeconomic variables and microeconomic variables relating to the different markets. The first class of exogenous variables includes national preferences and general political factors influencing public and private choices, socio-cultural trends, business cycles and macroeconomic trends. The class of microeconomic exogenous variables includes the institutions of the art markets, free trade and regulated markets, information flows, and marketing promotion practices. The purpose of the value determination for an artistic work using the FM matrix is to provide central and local governments, museum managers, insurance companies, non-profit entities, financial institutions, private investors, traders and experts with a manageable, objective, uniform method of evaluation. Our method of valuation implies an objective procedure with predefined steps for determining the value of artistic goods. The first step consists of assigning the good to one of the four matrix quadrants in order to start the valuation process. This initial judgment provides basic indications about some macroscopic elements of value accepted at first glance, such as the recorded price realized in an auction by the artist. For works coming from authors never sold through auction, the assessor may classify the works, comparing them with similar works of authors sold at auction. The next step in the evaluation consists of finding the range of proper subclasses to which the work may belong by considering the relevance of the ten endogenous and six exogenous assessment variables. The third stage is the evaluation performed potentially using indicators derived from econometric analysis of existing datasets. Economists cannot take the place of an art expert, but can make important contributions regarding artistic value through empirical analysis. To improve the assessment of the impact of qualitative variables on the economic value of cultural goods, as presented in our Art Matrix, we adopted the Fuzzy Set Method (Facchinetti et al. 2003), to determine the appropriate auction reserve prices. Indeed, this theory provides a systematic framework to deal with qualitative concepts expressed with linguistic logic translated into quantitative parameters by a complex system of variables using “fuzzy” relations. The term “fuzzy” means that there is an intrinsic lack of precision and uncertainty about the causal relationship between sets of qualitative inputs and outputs suitable for translation into crisp quantitative measures. The fuzzy logic procedure takes the form of a complex decision or assessment tree in which the sequences of linguistic variables extend their branches. In our case, the linguistic variable is derived from an assessment with several variables (i.e., a multiple attribute valuation [MAV] of art goods) so that the values the “fuzzy” method assigns to the art goods are ranges of values imputed to the linguistic variables. For the “defuzzification” into crisp variables for the FM art matrix, we adopted an interval of values between the minimum and maximum ranges with reference to statistics derived from past auctions in the international market. The starting point requires assigning the art work to one of four main defined categories: stars, blue chips, portfolios dogs, and questions. For each category, the second step is the decision tree design. The linguistic classification may proceed differently for the stars and for authors belonging to the blue chips and portfolios. For the stars, it may be easier to identify from the outset the subclass or group of subclasses of linguistic variables to which they likely belong. For the blue chips and portfolios, normally the MAV operation starts with identification of the general linguistic variable leading to a given quadrant, with the sub classification task remaining. For works identified as dogs, the MAV stops there. For lemons, it may be worthwhile proceeding further. For the star, blue chips and portfolios, at the basis of the design are the main branches of the linguistic variables, which in the final evaluation involve artistic values, hedonic values, sociological macroeconomic factors, and microeconomic factors. These branches are not the final variables. Therefore, the simple decision trees with four branches can become large, with more than 30 independent branches by the end. Practically, the initial distinction among quadrants implies that the MAV does not work with a unique system of parameters, such as for translation of inputs of linguistic variables into ranges of numerical values. The aggregation into rule blocs of intermediate variables differs in the various quadrants. The range of values in the FM art matrix is articulated by a decision tree which leaves the final choice up to the evaluator’s judgment. The purpose of the evaluation is relevant. A reserve auction price implies a strategy of prudence requiring the selection of a value in the upper range, unless one needs to clean the auction.",

An Empirical Investigation,February 2017,Friedrich Schneider,Reinhard Neck,Michael M. Strugl,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the 1970s and 1980s there was a first wave of popularity and vote functions, which were estimated for almost all highly developed OECD countries.Footnote 1 In the last 10 years these functions have enjoyed a certain revival, with studies for Germany (Kirchgässner 2009) and Denmark (Paldam 2004) revealing new, and quite surprising, findings: The economic situation has much less influence on popularity than in the first wave of studies, where the majority of investigations showed a statistically highly significant and quantitatively important effect of the unemployment rate, the rate of inflation and the growth rate of income on popularity or on the outcomes of elections. In this paper an attempt is made to undertake an empirical investigation exploring the extent to which the economic situation influences the popularity of Austrian parties. Additionally, our study is a first attempt to estimate the influence of the economic situation on outcomes in the 86 election districts in the federal elections in 1999, 2002, 2006 and 2008. We find that the influence of the economic situation is mixed, becoming less important the more recent the elections are.",

The Explosives Industry, Regulatory Capture and the Swedish Government 1858-1948",May 2017,Josefin Sabo,Lena Andersson-Skog,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Many scholars when studying institutional change and regulatory processes have identified regulatory capture as a major problem as it distorts market conditions and is the result of a bargaining process where certain interests are prioritized over others (Stigler 1971; Peltzman 1976; Becker 1983; Hady 2006). In the regulatory capture literature, the capturer is often pictured as the established, mature party, a company or branch already dominating an industry. A classic example is George Stigler’s well-known case of competition on the transport market during the interwar years in the U.S. The railroad industry responded to the increasing competition from trucks by influencing authorities to introduce government regulation that restricted the allowed transport weight of the trucks, thus limiting competition in advantage of railroads. (Stigler 1971). According to Stigler, there are several ways of achieving regulatory capture, for example, by direct methods, such as discriminating pricing policies and vertical integration. Indirect methods, such as establishing of long-term personal relationships between corporate managers and technicians from the industry and officials with the regulatory authority, may also be used. Here, a close collaboration may also involve certain mutual advantages, such as building trust and future loyalty, cooperation with and obedience to the law. Regulatory capture is, for obvious reasons, often considered to be an obvious risk of distorted conditions on the market. Posner (1974), Peltzman (1976), and Becker (1983) also argue that when the line between governmental and market interests is blurred, the regulatory process opens up to the influence of other pressure groups outside the industry. Recent literature has shown that regulatory capture can be found in various areas like transportation and telecommunications, energy and environmental policy, farming and financial services (Hady 2006; Smyth and Söderberg 2010). Regulatory capture must also be considered in light of other regulatory concepts, where there is a common distinction between self-regulation, co-regulation and government regulation. Government regulation is a process in the political arena, without access to private interests, whereas self-regulation means that the company or economic actor makes decisions that are not necessarily profit maximizing in the short run, but result in other kinds of benefits. Co-regulation indicates a government that controls rule-making, but delegates the implementation of regulatory decisions to the market (Latzer et al. 2003; Funke 2015). Co-regulation characterized the regulatory process in Sweden during the 1960s and 1970s, when the Rönnskär smelter, the world’s largest producer of arsenic emissions practically abolished them as a result of the active involvement, initiatives and the leading role played by the company in the regulatory process and the establishment of a new legislation. This was a process of regulatory capture and co-regulation that benefited all parties (Bergquist 2007). In this article, we argue that the regulation of the explosives industry in Sweden between 1858 and 1948 can put a slightly different perspective on regulatory capture. First, in this case it was the upstart company, the Nobel Dynamite Company, not the established explosives companies that, in negotiations with the regulator, succeeded in establishing new national regulation. Second, the method behind the successful capture combined indirect and direct methods with a common risk-minimizing trait for the public and it developed in cooperation with the regulator. This paper briefly describes the industrializing government, technological development and regulation in the nineteenth century Sweden. A short description is given regarding the traditional explosives industry and its regulation from the black powder era to the modern dynamite industry. Three decision-making processes are discussed as examples of regulatory capture in relation to the Nobel company. Regulatory capture and self-regulation are also discussed.",1

Fast transition of adverse economic factors, associated with the economic crisis across national borders and local economies, was the result of globalization and transnational economic systems. It was also the result of the emergence of multinational corporations, whose scope covered a number of countries on all continents. Above all, the globalization of financial markets, and other related markets, caused the current global crises to be deep and spatially extensive, affecting many areas of socioeconomic life. As shown by the recent global crisis, the real estate market is an important segment of the economy because it both affects and is affected by the financial sector. It is the crisis in the financial markets, defined as episodes of rapid changes in the financial markets, connected with deficiency of liquidity or insolvency of market participants, that caused the global economic crisis in 2008 (Bordo et al. 2000). The dynamic development of modern financing instruments, conditioning debt repayment on the ability to enter into new commitments (refinancing) or a low level of investors’ equity involvement in the real estate market, connected the discussed financial crisis with the real estate market (Minsky 1986). The instability of the financial system, caused by increased lending of subprime mortgages, became the cause of the recent crisis in the U.S., which spread to other countries and continents. However, in some countries, signs of recovery from the crisis can be noted.Footnote 1 Some questions arise: Was the unfavorable trend on the supply side for new apartments reversed? Can one talk about sustainable improvement of active property development companies? The effects of adverse changes, both in the real estate and financial markets were felt by participants involved in real estate transactions. Most of the available publications link the crises in the real estate market, the banking sector, insurance sector, and financial markets. Few discuss the economic condition of individuals on the new investment supply side. Too seldom is research undertaken within the real estate market and on the impact that the crisis had for actors directly related with services in this market, such as property developers and the broadly understood construction industry (Peto 2011; Al-Malkawi and Pillai 2013). However, investments in the housing market are most sensitive to changes in the economic environment and characterized by short business cycles. Hence the study of the housing market and developers serves as a barometer of the situation throughout the entire real estate market. It is clear that the economic downturn, including the slump in the real estate market, should have had a negative impact on the condition of property development companies. Financial results for these companies do not confirm the persistence of unfavorable trends for all European real estate markets. Lack of investor confidence in the real estate market caused an outflow of capital and limited execution of new projects. The residential property segment, sensitive to signals from the capital market, the overall economy and households, strongly felt the economy deteriorating in 2008. How are development companies faring compared to in the real estate market? Is the performance of property development companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) (technical or short-term analysis) a good indicator of the actual financial condition of these firms? How do the financial results of the discussed companies (fundamental or long-term analysis) relate to it? The attempt to answer the above questions signals a new approach to the issue of economic downturn in the real property market. The aim of this study is to evaluate selected local real estate focusing on the socioeconomic potential of housing markets and property development companies listed on the local stock exchange. A ranking of residential real estate markets has been created for these European markets that will indicate their development potential. For a selected market, a research hypothesis on the strong correlation between the condition of property development companies and the state of the housing market during the economic downturn in the real estate market was tested. For this purpose, basic economic and financial indices were used for classification and positioning of individual real estate markets. To test the hypothesis, multivariate methods of data classification were used. The results may help property development companies in investment decisions in international markets and may provide national authorities with clues to determine the cause of a weak position for a given country in an international ranking.",5

Economic recovery is slow and the question is often raised as to whether economic policies can contribute to higher growth and employment. As monetary policy is conducted on a supranational level by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the countries of the Euro Area, fiscal policy is seen as the only instrument remaining to deal with weak growth and high unemployment at a national level. An additional problem stems from the relatively high level of sovereign debt in most European countries which, according to many observers, prevents expansionary fiscal policy measures such as aggressive increases in government expenditures or decreases in tax rates. The so-called “austerity policy” prescribed by the European Commission is also seen as one of the reasons for the weak performance of the Euro Area with respect to output and employment over the last few years. Keynesian policy measures are proposed increasingly frequently to deal with these problems. The alleged trade-offs between growth and employment enhancing policies and the goal of budget consolidation have recently led policy makers in the “periphery” of the Euro Area to complain about the restrictions imposed by the “austerity”-oriented policy stance of the European Commission. In addition, as most of the economies involved are small open economies, there is also a trade-off between expansionary fiscal policy and problems with the external balance. Higher aggregate demand for such economies entails higher imports, and if the international competitiveness of such an economy is low, this leads to the piling up of external debt, with possible negative repercussions on domestic demand. Examining these possible trade-offs requires empirical analyses of the effectiveness of fiscal policies with respect to economic growth and employment especially for small open economies. The Slovenian economy is a case in point for such an examination. Entering the EU in 2004, the same time as most of the countries from Central and Eastern Europe, Slovenia was the only country in former Yugoslavia to do so. It introduced the euro as legal tender as early as 2007. It is a prototype of a small open economy with strong trade and financial links to other economies in the Euro Area. Moreover, it is one of the few small open transition economies that was already in the Euro Area before the Great Recession. Although the economic development of Slovenia was successful in terms of GDP growth and a reduction in unemployment before the Great Recession, the country was severely hit by the Great Recession and the Euro crisis, due to its exposed international position and domestic government failures alike. Here we examine the question as to whether Slovenia would benefit more from a demand or supply-side orientation of its fiscal policy with the help of an econometric model. We use the Slovenian Policy (SLOPOL) model, an econometric model of the Slovenian economy we constructed, to simulate the effects of various tax and spending policies on important macroeconomic variables as well as on the public debt level (see the online supplemental appendix for the dataset). We describe the macroeconometric model SLOPOL10, used for the empirical analysis, with more details of the model given in Weyerstrass et al. (2018). A forecast of the Slovenian macroeconomy for the years 2017 to 2030 obtained with the model is presented, which serves as the baseline solution for the policy simulation. The forecast implies moderate growth, decreasing unemployment and a rising public-debt-to-GDP in the medium run. It turns out that expenditure side budgetary measures with a strong supply-side content (especially research and development (R&D) related spending and enhancement of human capital) will be most successful and effective at stabilizing Slovenian output, while tax policies exert more influence on employment. In both cases, demand-side effects are weak at best, while supply-side measures can be instrumental in obtaining sustainable growth and full employment.",2

Schumpeter and his efforts to treat economics methodologically. Some authors argue that Schumpeter maintained his principal scientific positions over the course of his life.Footnote 1 It is said that he came up with his main ideas very early on in his European times and that he worked out those ideas more thoroughly during the following decades without changing his early positions very much. Compared to this view, one may see at least one clear shift in Schumpeter’s principal positions between the early and late periods of his career. The paper discusses this shift, which is centered on Schumpeter’s scientific positioning. In Das Wesen und der Hauptinhalt der theoretischen Nationalökonomie (1908), Schumpeter developed and pioneered his methodological individualism which is acknowledged. However, a comparison of these early positions with methodological writings in his History of Economic Analysis (1954) shows that he did not shift from methodological individualism to an institutional perspective that addresses the academic interplay and sees economic action rooted in historical predispositions, paths and social constraints. Both perspectives are related to each other. In our view, this clearly articulates a perspective of institutional economics that emphasizes social embeddedness of economic behavior. Currently Schumpeter is viewed as a truly interdisciplinary theorist. He worked continuously in a perspective which can be characterized as academic cross-fertilization. Therefore, posthumously, Schumpeter’s different articles were sorted into books as collected papers, political speeches, articles in socioeconomics, papers on economic policies, essays on daily politics, papers on economic theory, and articles on the history of economic thought (e.g. Schumpeter 1952, 1953). In a first instance, many contemporaries know primarily Schumpeter’s ideas as they were developed in The Theory of Economic Development (Schumpeter 1963), perhaps also his book on Business Cycles (Schumpeter 1939) and, of course, his argumentation in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (Schumpeter 1942), but lesser known is his systematization of academic development and his methodological roadmap. The discussion focuses on the principles of Schumpeter’s academic thought, which led him to create his diverse works and which were reflected systematically in some of his writings, from which Schumpeter emerged as a theorist of science. Besides working on specific substantial topics, throughout his life Schumpeter dealt with methodological issues in different works. He wrote articles on rationality, on positivism in economics, on mathematical methods in economic theorizing (Schumpeter 1906), How to Study Social Sciences (translated title) (Schumpeter 1915), Gustav von Schmoller und die Probleme von heute (Schumpeter 1926), and many more articles. Referring to books, his book Epochen der Dogmen- und Methodengeschichte (Schumpeter 1914, published in English as Economic Doctrines and Method in 1954), was certainly a major contribution to methodology in economics. Despite these many different works, I view Schumpeter’s first book Das Wesen und der Hauptinhalt der theoretischen Nationalökonomie (Schumpeter 1908) and his last book History of Economic Analysis (Schumpeter 1954) as those studies are among his most diverse and show his latest and most up-to-date statements concerning the division of social sciences and the role of economics in relation to sociology, history, and other academic branches. Das Wesen und der Hauptinhalt der theoretischen Nationalökonomie (Schumpeter 1908) was published when Schumpeter was only 25 years old. He wrote the book while staying in Cairo, Egypt, before his career started in Vienna. History of Economic Analysis (Schumpeter 1954) was published four years after the death of Schumpeter, which was in 1950. The substantial preface of the History of Economic Analysis reads like a manual on how to refer to the different academic branches and how to integrate them into a coherent universal social science, which is far from being a narrow economic science of modern representation (Bögenhold 2014). Schumpeter must be regarded as someone who stayed on the solid ground of a well-studied history of mainstream economics which led him to argue offensively for an institutional approach integrating economics with different further social sciences by avoiding the formulation of a divisional order or ranking, which was already highlighted by Swedberg (1991). Of course, Schumpeter’s History of Economic Analysis has been extensively printed, translated and reprinted in several editions. However, especially the preface appears somewhat neglected in Schumpeterian discourse and his argumentation needs so much more text marking, because it must be read as a fine synthesis of arguments as developed in the first battles of methods between Carl Menger and Gustav von Schmoller and the second battle of methods between Schmoller and Max Weber and others (Shionoya 2005; Bögenhold 2008; Backhaus and Hansen 2000; Louzek 2011). In this sense, the old controversies were updated. In History of Economic Analysis (Schumpeter 1954), many questions were addressed in a more elegant and rigorous way. While Schumpeter is mostly regarded as a pioneer of evolutionary economics (Kurz 2012, 2015), who argued in favor of this perspective in The Theory of Economic Development (Schumpeter 1963), and especially in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (Schumpeter 1942), the last one containing the famous formulation of creative destruction (Fagerberg 2003), one may also view Schumpeter as an institutional economist who was searching for his methodological program.",2

It is also an outstanding case for a complex multi-tier system of participating party incentives and frequently of conflicting interests. Since Kenneth Arrow (1963) first addressed the issues of asymmetric information in health insurance, several authors discussed the impact of asymmetric information on the quality and cost of medical services. (e.g., Ellis and McGuire 1986, Ma and McGuire 1997, De Fraja 2000, Chalkley and Malcomson 2002 and Siciliani 2006, Barile et al. 2014, Beeknoo and Jones 2017, Frank et al. 2000) However, their papers focused on one-sided asymmetric information between physicians and their patients or between health care institutions (hospitals) and the health care funding agency. As is well-known from the literature, one-sided asymmetric information in a transaction will result in welfare loss and in cost efficiency loss. (e.g., Laffont and Martimort 2002) Should regulators apply cost-based regulatory tools rather than incentive-based methods, the loss becomes even larger.Footnote 1 This loss can only be reduced, but cannot be fully annihilated, even by incentive-based regulation. This paper’s main contribution to the existing literature is the analysis of the relationship of the participants in health care services and health care funding when information asymmetry between them is two-sided. That is, both participants (the patient and their physician, the doctor and their hospital, the hospital and the health care funding agency) possess private information. (Herein the physician will be a “she” and the patient a “he”.) This will lead to completely different results than what the previously mentioned authors have found. A circle model will be presented that starts from the relationship between the physician and patient, then turns to the relationship between the physician and health care institution. The model continues with the relationship between the health care institution and the public health funding agency (PHFA) (the Social Security Administration in the U.S.) and ultimately with the government.Footnote 2 Then the model chain returns to the potential and actual patients through the relationship between the government and the taxpayers who ultimately finance the health care system. A brief discussion of the differences between Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and Western advanced countries follows, focusing on the level of information asymmetry and its consequences in these two groups of countries. As mentioned before, the problem of information uncertainty in health care services has been discussed by several authors, but Kenneth Arrow (1963), the pioneer of the topic summarized who first designed a formal theoretical model, based on the economics of information, to analyze the issues related to asymmetric information in health care, mostly in health insurance services. Some of the additional important studies on this subject are: Maynard and Bloor (2003), Choné and Ma (2004), Bolin et al. (2010), and Leonard et al. (2013). These studies are considered as the point of departure but this paper tries to dig deeper. The latest results of the theory of mechanism design will be applied. (e.g., Maskin 2008 and Myerson 2008). The relationship between the physician and the patient will be discussed first, focusing on asymmetric information between them.Footnote 3 It is obvious that the medical doctor does not work in a vacuum and does not autonomously make decisions, but competes for better positions, for prestige and, finally, for higher remuneration and cost compensation with other physicians within the facility. At the same time, she is part of a team and a complex hierarchy of interrelationships within her own institution that may also have a considerable impact on treatment efficiency. When the paper starts discussing the physician-patient relationship, it is obvious that this is a simplified approach to the complex interrelationships within an institution’s medical staff. This simplification just serves as a more transparent description of the transactions between patients and medical doctors. No distinction is made between asymmetric information and asymmetric competence affecting the patient–doctor relationship in the analytical model that follows, but it is assumed that the physician has private information and private knowledge about medical assistance that results in moral hazard and adverse selection issues within their relationship. That is, the patient cannot monitor the doctor’s effort level, and he has only probabilistic knowledge about the doctor’s efficiency level. The patient’s and the physician’s relevant variables and objective functions are presented in the framework of one-sided information asymmetry first. That is, it is assumed that it is the doctor who has private information with regard to the patient. However, these cases will not be discussed in detail because they are just the obvious repetitions of the classical information asymmetry models (e.g., Laffont and Martimort 2002). Tables 1, 2 and 3 display the optimum outcomes of these cases, because the paper intends to focus on those cases where both the patient and the doctor possess private information. Consequently, they can and usually will opt for a mixed strategy. In order to simplify the analysis it is assumed that the patient’s health condition, given by a dichotomous variable si, will improve \( \left({\overline{s}}_i\right) \) with probability πH or with probability πL, respectively, if the doctor’s medical service is efficient or inefficient. It is also assumed that πH > πL; and the patient’s condition does not improve \( \left({\underset{\_}{s}}_i\right) \), it can even deteriorate, with probability 1 − πH or 1 − πL when treatment is efficient or inefficient. The doctor cannot foresee the patient’s post-treatment condition before starting treatment. Only the probabilities given previously are known. The quantity of examinations and treatment, measured in homogenous disease group (HDG) scores is denoted by q which can be large \( \left({\overline{q}}_i\right) \) or small \( \left({\underset{\_}{q}}_i\right) \). Another assumption is that the time span of the patient’s medical treatment is a linear function of the quantity of examinations and treatment. For this reason, it is not explicitly plugged into the model, but it will be incorporated in qi. Patient i, as principal, seeks medical treatment from the physician (from his agent) and his valuation function on the treatment is given by: where ui(si, qi) is the patient’s benefit from medical assistance in monetary terms. The patient’s benefit consists of several contributing factors, such as, e.g., his income under healthy conditions, the value of his time for relaxation, the value of services he provides for his family, etc.Footnote 4 It is assumed about ui(si, qi) that \( \frac{\partial {u}_i\left({s}_i,{q}_i\right)}{\partial {q}_i}\ge 0;\kern1em \frac{\partial^2{u}_i\left({s}_i,{q}_i\right)}{\partial^2{q}_i}\le 0 \) if \( {q}_i\in \left[0,{q}_i^{\ast}\right] \), or \( \frac{\partial {u}_i\left({s}_i,{q}_i\right)}{\partial {q}_i}<0; \)\( \frac{\partial^2{u}_i\left({s}_i,{q}_i\right)}{\partial^2{q}_i}>0 \) if \( {q}_i>{q}_i^{\ast } \). These conditions imply that the patient attaches higher value to a more profound and longer treatment up to a certain point, although his marginal utility is decreasing along with the treatment, but her total utility starts decreasing beyond that point. wi(qi) is the patient’s lost wage or income due to the treatment for which \( \frac{d{w}_i\left({q}_i\right)}{d{q}_i}={w}_i \), i.e., the lost wage is a linear function of the treatment’s time span and intensity. pi(si, qi) is the patient’s gratitude payment he pays directly to the doctor for medical attendance when medical services are funded and provided by public organizations. Alternatively, it can be the financial compensation for health care services in private health care facilities, for which \( \frac{\partial {p}_i\left({s}_i,{q}_i\right)}{\partial {q}_i}>0,\frac{\partial^2{p}_i\left({s}_i,{q}_i\right)}{\partial^2{q}_i}\le 0 \); α ∈ [0, 1] is the parameter signaling the doctor’s professional position in the medical hierarchy normalized to one. Furthermore, it is assumed that the patient pays a higher gratuity to the doctor—the amount of which is directly related to the physician’s accomplishment—when his health condition is improving than if his condition does not improve or it deteriorates: \( {p}_i\left({\overline{s}}_i,{\overline{q}}_i\right)>{p}_i\left({\underset{\_}{s}}_i,{\overline{q}}_i\right) \) and \( {p}_i\left({\overline{s}}_i,{\underset{\_}{q}}_i\right)>{p}_i\left({\underset{\_}{s}}_i,{\underset{\_}{q}}_i\right) \); Mi = ∑nmi(n) is the patient’s total contribution (tax) payment to the PHFA up to the date (denoted n) when he fell ill. The patient seeks to maximize his net utility as given in eq. (1), observing the doctor’s financial constraints. The patient cannot precisely monitor the doctor’s effort level, nor does he know the doctor’s exact efficiency level. He only has the following probabilistic information about his physician: the conditional probability of receiving an efficient treatment, provided that the doctor exerts high effort, is νH, hence, the probability of obtaining inefficient treatment despite the doctor’s high effort is 1 − νH. In a similar vein, the conditional probabilities of receiving efficient or inefficient treatment with the doctor’s low effort are respectively, νL and 1 − νL. The physician as the agent also maximizes her own utility for which her evaluation function is: where N is the number of patients treated by the doctor, αbi is the share of the doctor’s financial compensation (salary) directly related to treating patient i, and ci(qi) is the total direct cost incurred by the doctor from treating this patient, while ψ(ei) is the doctor’s effort cost for patient i. Thus, \( {\sum}_{i=1}^N\alpha {b}_i=b \) is independent of the physician’s accomplishment. It is usually derived—especially in European countries—from the nationwide salary scale of public employees, which depends on \( {\sum}_{i=1}^N{M}_i \) and on other exogenous factors. The problems stemming from asymmetric information and asymmetric competence between the physician and the patient are complicated by the fact that many of the factors affecting their transactions are exogenous. For instance, \( {\sum}_{i=1}^N\alpha {b}_i=b \) is determined by public agencies, while Mi = ∑nmi(n) depends on the taxation rules and on the patient–PHFA relationship. The patient-doctor relationship is complicated even further by another factor. While the physician’s net benefit decreases with increasing costs, the doctor—as an employee of a health care facility—may inflate these costs. For example, she can order unnecessary diagnostics and other examinations the costs of which will then become a bargaining chip in the negotiations between the health care unit and the PHFA. This issue will be analyzed later. Because of these indirect effects, the factors affecting a specific transaction by asymmetric information and competence—say, between the patient and his doctor—may have additional impacts on other, but closely related transactions. Consequently, the optimal solutions for the individual transactions can only be derived by solving a system of simultaneous equations. The paper starts analyzing the patient–doctor relationship keeping this fact in mind. The patient cannot closely monitor the doctor’s effort level and he does not know the physician’s efficiency level either. He only knows that the doctor incurs an effort cost of ψ(eH) = ψ with high effort, or an effort cost of ψ(eL) = 0 with low effort. In addition, the patient knows that the physician may operate at a high or at a low efficiency level with the previously given probabilities. Her efficiency level is directly related to her effort. As mentioned, treating the patient comes with treatment costs c(qi) besides the doctor’s cost of effort. It was assumed that the doctor’s cost function is identical by type across all of her patients, hence her treatment costs will only depend on the quantity qi of medical services she provides to individual patients. As already briefly mentioned, the doctor is capable of elevating her level of competence (that is, her efficiency), and that will reduce her treatment costs. The high level of treatment will be denoted by \( {\overline{q}}_i \), while the low level of treatment is denoted \( {\underset{\_}{q}}_i \). In a similar vein, \( \overline{c}\left({\overline{q}}_i\right) \) denotes the costs of efficient treatment, while \( \underset{\_}{c}\left({\underset{\_}{q}}_i\right) \) labels the costs of inefficient treatment. The doctor intends to maximize her own utility, therefore she will treat the patient with high effort only if her participation, incentive compatibility and limited liability constraints are respected.Footnote 5 From the patient’s perspective, medical treatment is at optimum if he incurs the smallest amount of side payment (gratuity payment) at a given level of treatment. This outcome can be attained if the doctor’s constraints are fulfilled with equality in the largest feasible number. The information rent of the efficient physician will be affected by the relative strength of the impact of adverse selection and moral hazard. Different constraints may be binding depending on the probability distribution of efficiency types and effort level, and on the magnitude of the effort cost. Three different cases can be distinguished depending on which of the physician’s constraints are binding. Which constraints of the different efficiency types will be binding will depend on the relative magnitude of the information rent and effort cost. The outcomes of these cases are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The physician’s incentivization becomes a much more complex task if the doctor opts for a mixed strategy since she does not possess all the relevant information about her patient and she also knows that the patient’s health condition will improve with less than a probability of 1 after his treatment. Patients can also withhold information that results in a two-sided information asymmetry between the patient and his doctor. The doctor’s incentivization becomes perverse under a mixed strategy: it punishes the efficient physician while it extends rewards to the inefficient ones. It is assumed that the patient is also aware of the fact that his doctor exerts high effort, consequently, she provides efficient service only with a less than unit probability. The mixed probabilities of the physician can be calculated from the doctor’s indifference condition: That is, the doctor exerts high effort only with probability\( \rho =\frac{\alpha {b}_i+\alpha {\underset{\_}{p}}_i+\alpha {\pi}^H\varDelta {p}_i-{\underset{\_}{c}}_i}{2\alpha {b}_i+\varDelta {c}_i+\alpha \varDelta \pi \varDelta {p}_i-{\psi}_i} \) in order to provide efficient service. She chooses a low effort level that may result in an inefficient medical service with probability 1 − ρ, where \( {\underset{\_}{p}}_i \) is the doctor’s gratuity with low effort, \( {\underset{\_}{c}}_i \) and \( {\overline{c}}_i \) are the costs of inefficient and efficient service, respectively, and \( \varDelta {p}_i={\overline{p}}_i-{\underline{p}}_i \), Δπ = πH − πL, \( \varDelta {c}_i={\underline{c}}_i\bar{\mkern6mu}{\overline{c}}_i \). Real life experience from several Eastern European health care systems attests that the above assumption about the doctors’ mixed strategy is not a pure theoretical assumption. Medical doctors exert only the minimum level of effort in order to save their patients from dying but they do not want their patients to recover too quickly. If patients stay longer at the hospital, the doctors can receive larger side payments during that period and report higher costs of treatment to the PHFA (Table 4). Only the case when the adverse selection incentive compatibility constraint (ICC), of the efficient doctor and the limited liability constraint (LLC) of the inefficient doctor are binding will be discussed.Footnote 6 In addition, only the first order conditions of the patient’s optimization problem will be presented here, with efficient service: while in case the service is inefficient: As can be seen from eqs. (4) and (5), the level of efficient service will be below, while the inefficient service’s level will be above its optimum. That is, the efficient doctor exerts only so much effort and service that the patient’s condition does not deteriorate—but it does not necessarily improve either, while the inefficient doctor over-treats patients. Health care professionals work in different medical organizations with diverse working conditions. For instance, there is a profound difference between the institutional background and the interests of a primary care physician and those of a doctor who works at a national clinic. The following analysis is simplified to the basic conditions in order to focus on the issues of asymmetric information between, and different interests of, the health care staff and its institution. The health care facility will be labelled as the hospital that requires health care services from the doctor. As the principal, the hospital expects efficient treatment of her patients and high effort in medical activities from the doctor (the agent) in this relationship. However, the hospital cannot closely monitor the doctor’s effort level, nor can it exactly know the doctor’s efficiency type. The management of the hospital only knows that in case the doctor exerts high effort, her accomplishment can be efficient with probability νH, while it can be inefficient with probability 1 − νH. Should the doctor exert low effort, the probability of efficient or inefficient treatment will be νL or 1 − νL, respectively. The hospital’s main interest is to maximize the number of patients (I = M · Nj), but it faces the following budget constraint: \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{K}_i\left({q}_i\right)\le \overline{K}, \) where Ki(qi) is the treatment cost of patient i, which comprises both the flow expenditures and the investment and maintenance costs—but not the wage costs—per patient, Nj is the number of patients treated by doctor j, M is the number of doctors at the hospital, while \( \overline{K} \) is the hospital’s budget received from the PHFA except the hospital’s wage costs. The hospital’s financial resources can be the planned amount pre-announced by the PHFA with probability ω, but it can be below the promised amount with probability 1 − ω. These probabilities are known both by the hospital and by the patients. The doctor strives to maximize net utility that can be described with regard to the patient-doctor relationship before, with one exception: the doctor seeks to receive the largest amount possible from the hospital’s budget: where is the doctor’s salary based on the salary scale of public employees, Ki(qi) consists of the treatment costs of patient i incurred by the hospital, \( {\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{c}_i\left({q}_i\right) \) is the total cost incurred by the doctor while treating her patients, while \( {\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{\psi}_i \) is the doctor’s effort costs. If the physician pursues a pure strategy, choosing either the accomplishment and effort level of the efficient doctor or those of the inefficient doctor, the information asymmetry between the hospital and the doctor results in similar solutions that could already be seen in the patient–physician relationship. Therefore, the feasible solutions of the hospital’s net benefit maximization are not derived here, since these can be easily obtained by substituting the hospital’s benefit and cost functions into the previous model on the patient–doctor relationship. As shown in the patient–physician model previously, should the doctor observe an unambiguous and trustworthy strategy from the hospital and she also opts for a pure strategy, the hospital will extend positive incentives or punishment to the doctors which will incentivize them to act according to their efficiency type and exert the expected effort level. By extensive experience, hospitals in several countries rarely apply this type of incentive regulation because the hospitals’ managements also face much uncertainty and cutbacks of their institution’s public financial resources by the PHFA. Consequently, they struggle for survival. In addition, the hospitals’ managements should have the financial resources to be able to pay the information rent to the efficient doctors as the doctors’ incentive pay. Being aware that the hospital’s public budget is uncertain if the doctor opts for a mixed strategy, the hospital will only be able to extend perverse incentives. That is, as a result of the hospital’s budget allocation, the efficient doctor will have a lower than optimal accomplishment and exert the minimum level of effort, while the inefficient doctor will have a higher than optimal accomplishment, and both of them may strive for enforcing side payments from their patients. Consequently, the hospital’s expenses will exceed the optimal level. The objectives of different government agencies constitute a fairly complex bundle of goals. The ministry or department of health care (with the professional organizations backing) intends to enforce professional rules and considerations, while the PHFA strives to meet the budgetary target directives of the central government. At the same time, the PHFA plays its own game with the ministry of finance and with the parliament in European countries, or with the Senate and Congress in the United States that ultimately decide on the government’s budget. The analysis of the central health care budget allocation is simplified to the informational and bargaining relationships between the PHFA and the medical facilities. Herein, these medical facilities are labelled as hospitals, although there are crucial differences in the financing methods and operational conditions among the hospitals, the outpatient clinics and the primary care physicians. We only involve PHFA in this discussion. The PHFA—the government agency responsible for financing public health care from the government budget—sets the maximum budget for the hospital. The public budget can be a high amount, Bh or at a low level, Bℓ independent of the hospital’s achievement. The PHFA’s main objective is to maximize the difference between the financial value of the hospital’s accomplishment—measured in HDG scores—and its public budget. The hospital is capable of improving its cost efficiency level by effort, but the PHFA cannot closely monitor the hospital’s effort level, nor does it know the hospital’s efficiency level with certainty. It only knows that the hospital provides efficient health care services with probability μh if it exerts high effort, or the hospital’s efficiency level may still remain low despite its high effort with probability 1 − μh. The hospital’s cost efficiency is affected by several exogenous factors as well. Hence, it can attain high efficiency despite low level of effort with probability μℓ, or its efficiency remains low with probability 1 − μℓ. It is an obvious assumption that μh > μℓ. The hospital maximizes its net total revenue which is the difference between its budget allocated to the hospital by the PHFA on the one hand, and its costs of operation plus its labor, investment, and maintenance costs on the other. At the same time, the hospital cannot be certain that it will receive the promised budget from the PHFA. It only knows that the PHFA’s promises about the hospital’s budget can be trusted with probability ω, but the PHFA is untrustworthy with probability 1 − ω. Then the hospital must decide whether it opts for a pure or for a mixed strategy, where the weights of its different strategy options can be calculated from the probabilities of the PHFA’s trustworthiness or untrustworthiness, respectively. Since the hospital cannot be fully confident about the PHFA’s promises, it may opt for a mixed rather than for a pure strategy by taking into account the probability of the PHFA’s trustworthiness. Only the case of mixed strategies will be discussed here, for the pure strategy cases are very similar to the ones presented with regard to the patient-doctor relationship. The net financial benefit of the efficient hospital from treating \( I=M\cdotp {\sum}_{j=1}^{N_j}{i}_j \) patients with high effort is with probability μh. With efficient treatment but low effort level it will be with probability μℓ, when the hospital is confident that it will receive its budget promised by the PHFA. With the hospital’s inefficient accomplishment but its high effort, and with trustworthy PHFA, the hospital’s net benefit is with probability 1 − μh. It will become, with low effort level and inefficient services, with probability 1 − μℓ, where \( I=M\cdotp {\sum}_{j=1}^{N_j}{i}_j \) is the number of the hospital’s patients, if the size of the health care personnel in the hospital is M, and employee j provides medical services to Nj patients. Public funds allocated to this hospital at a high level are \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{B}_{i,j}^h \), while the low level budget is \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{B}_{i,j}^{\ell } \). Total wages paid to the hospital’s personnel are \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{\alpha}_j{b}_{i,j} \), and total costs of medical services will be \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{K}_{i,j}^h\left({t}_{i,j}^h,{q}_{i,j}^h\right) \) or \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{K}_{i,j}^{\ell}\left({t}_{i,j}^{\ell },{q}_{i,j}^{\ell}\right) \) at high or at low efficiency level, respectively. The hospital’s effort cost with high effort is \( {\sum}_{j=1}^M{\sum}_{i=1}^{N_j}{\psi}_{i,j} \). If the PHFA is untrustworthy, the efficient hospital’s net financial benefit with high effort becomes, with probabilityμh With low effort but high efficiency level the hospital’s benefit will be, with probability μℓ Should the hospital’s accomplishment be at the inefficient level despite its high effort, its net financial benefit will be, with probability 1 − μh With low effort level it becomes, with probability 1 − μℓ For the sake of simplicity, the following notations are introduced: where the lower index of K stands for the hospital’s effort level and the upper index represents its efficiency. The probabilities of the efficient and the inefficient hospital’s mixed strategies must be found first. The efficient hospital will choose the efficient strategy with probabilityπ, while it will opt for the inefficient strategy with probability 1 − π, where The inefficient hospital opts for a strategy compatible to its (in)efficiency level with probability ρ while it chooses the alternative strategy with probability 1 − ρ, where: where ΔB = Bh − Bℓ, \( \varDelta {K}_h={K}_h^h-{K}_h^{\ell } \), and \( \varDelta {K}_{\ell }={K}_{\ell}^h-{K}_{\ell}^{\ell } \), \( \varDelta {K}^h={K}_{\ell}^h-{K}_h^h \), finally, \( \varDelta {K}^{\ell }={K}_{\ell}^{\ell }-{K}_h^{\ell } \) at the relevant values of (t, q). Depending on the relative magnitudes of the information rent the PHFA needs to pay to the efficient hospital to incentivize it for high effort and to provide medical services at its efficiency level, on the one hand, and on the allocative efficiency loss from reducing the required accomplishment of the less efficient hospital in order to retain sufficient resources to pay the information rent on the other, different scenarios may occur. The amount of the hospital’s information rent is basically set by the relative strength of adverse selection and moral hazard. Only the final results of the two possible scenarios here that may occur in the relationship between the hospital and the PHFA with double information asymmetry are presented. It can be concluded from the previous results that the government agencies use perverse incentives toward the hospital. They restrict the efficient hospital to a lower than optimum level of accomplishment by providing less than optimal level of public funding, while they allocate a larger than optimal budget to the less efficient hospital. By doing so the government agencies incentivize the hospital to strive for a larger than optimal level of accomplishment. Hence, the good types will be punished and the bad types will be rewarded. Another option occurs, if incentivizing the hospital for high effort would cost more to the PHFA than the efficient hospital’s information rent. In this case, the limited liability constraint of the inefficient hospital and the moral hazard ICC are binding. The hospital’s information rent increases to such a level that it would not be a sensible solution for the PHFA to deteriorate the hospitals’ allocative efficiency even further in order to save money for the information rent. However, perverse incentivization of the hospitals, incentivizing the efficient hospital to a lower than optimal level of accomplishment while inducing a higher than optimal level of performance from the inefficient hospital, does not cease to exist. Based on the previous analysis the readers can conclude that the hospitals’ incentive regulation is not viable if the government agencies responsible for the management of the public health care sector are not trustworthy. The active population of most European countries (also the active part of society in several Asian, North and Latin American countries) pays a health care tax to the public health care budget (managed by the PHFA) and they expect to receive high quality service for their financial contribution. Actual and potential patients of the health care system can hope for high quality service if the state (the national parliament and the government) allocate a sufficiently large budget to the public health care institutions. The government uses the financial contribution of former, current and future patients to finance the medical institutions, but it is also interested in keeping as large a share as possible of the health care contributions within its budget to use for other purposes. That is, the government’s objective is to maximize the difference between the citizens’ financial health care contribution and its budget allocated to the health care system. The economic and political factors affecting the government budget, the tax system and public health care funding are interrelated in an even more complicated way than what has been shown with regard to the other relationships affecting health care. However, the analysis is simplified by focusing on the information and money flow between patients and the government through the taxation and budget allocation system. Neither the patients nor the government possess perfect information about the other party’s type and effort level. Patients only know that government can be trusted with probability ω, but it is untrustworthy with probability 1 − ω. The government only knows that the patients’ health care contribution can attain a high level with probabilities σh or σℓ if the patients exert high or low effort, respectively, but the patients’ financial contribution will be low with probabilities 1 − σh or 1 − σℓ at their high or low level of effort, respectively. It is assumed that the government strives to induce high effort from the patients. The objective function of patient i will be similar to the previous ones: where Bi is the share of patient i from the health care budget, and Ei labels patient i’s financial health care contribution. Since the government incentivizes the patient for high effort, his participation constraint will be: which can be rearranged to The patient’s moral hazard ICC becomes: Let the total contribution of all patients be denoted\( E={\sum}_{i=1}^N{E}_i \), while the total health care budget allocated by the government is \( B={\sum}_{i=1}^N{B}_i \). Then the government’s objective function becomes: The government can collect the largest net revenue—which is the difference between the patients’ total financial contribution and its own budget allocated toward health care—if the patients’ participation constraint and moral hazard ICC are binding. To simplify the analysis even further, it is also assumed that the patients are risk neutral. Then Bh and Bℓ will be the solutions of the following system of equations: Solving the equations in (21) results in the government’s optimum level of public health care spending at high or low levels of the patients’ financial health care contribution, respectively: With simple moral hazard—that is, when the government is trustworthy and its health care budget allocation depends only on the magnitude of the adult population’s financial health care contribution—the patients’ participation constraint and moral hazard ICC will be: Since both constraints will bind at optimum, the outcome will be: that is, the government—and parliament—will finance the public health care system up to the amount of the population’s health care contribution. Comparing eqs. (22) and (24) immediately shows that an untrustworthy government will allocate budget resources to the public health care system in an amount that exceeds the optimum level if the population’s health care contribution is at a high level, while it will provide a lower amount to the health care system than what would be feasible at the given level of the population’s financial contribution.",14

In March 2012, Serbia was granted EU candidate status. In September 2013, a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) entered into force between Serbia and the EU. Formal accession negotiations started January 21, 2014.Footnote 1 The primary motivation of countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Western Balkans to strive for EU integration is the prospect of economic gains. It can be taken for granted that closer economic integration brings about economic benefits in terms of higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth and more employment. Based on the empirical evidence, it can be concluded that growth effects arose mainly from higher exports and foreign direct investment. The removal of trade barriers reduced trade costs, intensified competition in the Single Market and made companies more competitive globally. The reduction in barriers for intra-EU trade also made the countries in the EU more attractive for investment by foreign companies (Vetter 2013). However, the extent of these benefits is controversial, and their magnitude was often overestimated ex ante. As a prominent example, the influential Cecchini Report (Cecchini et al. 1988) forecast that the completion of the European Single Market would raise EU-wide GDP by 4.5% to 6.5%. Most reports that were issued ex post, however, came up with much lower estimates. Empirical analyses show that the Single Market has realistically increased GDP in the EU by 2% to 3%. One reason for the differences between the ex post and ex ante estimations may be data problems in the ex post study. More important, 25 years after the envisaged completion of the European Single Market, integration has still not been completed in many fields. This applies particularly to the free movement of services, the creation of a Digital Single Market, as well as liberal professions. In 2013, the European Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Policy requested a new Cost of Non-Europe report in the field of the Single Market. This report considered the economic cost of market fragmentation as well as the gaps and shortcomings in five areas: the free movement of goods, the free movement of services, public procurement, the digital economy, and the body of consumer law known as the consumer acquis. The report estimated that completing the Single Market in these fields would bring potential economic gains ranging between 5% and 8.6% of EU GDP (Pataki 2014).",2

A naïve regression of economic outcomes on the size of the stimulus, however, leads to a biased estimate of the stimulus effects, as it does not take into account the endogeneity between the stimulus and the economic downturn. Therefore, the studies based on cross-state variations (including this paper) use instruments assumed to be exogenous to the downturn to circumvent this endogeneity problem. While these papers concentrate on the employment effects of ARRA, this paper analyzes the other objective stated in the act, that is, the promotion of economic recovery. Specifically, this paper uses a two-stage least-squares regression to estimate the effect of ARRA layouts on state-level gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The instruments are based on the factors used in the statutory formulas for distributing the funds.Footnote 1 These factors, like the number of vehicle miles driven on federal highways, are assumed to be exogenous to economic conditions. Additionally, control variables are included, like the pre-crisis house-price growth, that might be correlated with both the instruments and the economic downturn. The ARRA was one of the first laws enacted under the Obama administration and can be seen as one of the latter’s main achievements (e.g., Flores 2015; Von Drehle 2016). The effectiveness of the approximate $800 billion stimulus has been contested, not only by politicians but also by journalists (e.g., Goldman 2010; Schmid 2010). The above-mentioned papers on ARRA’s employment effects using cross-state variation in stimulus and economic outcomes, however, show (using different instruments to solve endogeneity problems) that the stimulus had a positive effect on employment, either in the public or the private sector (or both). This is consistent with the results presented in Klein and Staal (2017) and in this paper, which both also exploit cross-state variation, but focus on economic growth instead of employment. Klein and Staal (2017) only considered the effects of ARRA spending done by the Health and Human Services Department, and, therefore, merely used pre-ARRA Medicaid spending as an instrument in the estimations. However, the current paper uses a broader approach by also considering ARRA spending by other departments, and uses additional instruments based on further factors that were also used in the allocation of ARRA spending. Thus, the current analysis provides more comprehensive evidence on the effects of ARRA spending. A limitation of this paper (and of Klein and Staal 2017) is that it does not take into account the lag structure that enabled spending to influence the economy (i.e., whether 2011 growth was the result of 2009, 2010, or 2011 spending). Such an analysis is not possible, as the source of ARRA spending data, the now-extinct federal website (recovery.gov), only provided cumulative measures. Of the Recovery Act spending, 36% was on tax cuts and tax credits, 32% on contracts, grants and loans, and 32% entitlements. Of the entitlements, spending on Medicaid was the largest component (and the single largest component of total recovery spending), and of the contracts, grants and loans, the largest components were grants to education and transport (Government Accountability Office 2014). This analysis includes most of the spending on contracts, grants and loans, and on entitlements, but excludes spending done by the Department of Labor (DoL). The two main reasons for excluding DoL spending are that (i) there is almost no source of exogenous variation in this spending since it is almost exclusively driven by a state’s unemployment rate, and (ii) recovery.gov did not report this spending by state. Following the other studies that are based on cross-state variation in spending, spending on tax cuts and credits was excluded. Therefore, these studies implicitly assume that the latter spending is orthogonal to the spending categories analyzed.",

What the ancient Greek philosopher Heraklitus meant by “everything flows”, is also valid for social sciences. John Maynard Keynes came up with his observation very clearly: “The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist” (Keynes 1936, p. 383). When an economic crisis occurs, as was the case in 2008, contemporaries tend to question certainties of belief systems including academic systems of knowledge. Existing paradigms evolve to become a subject of inquiry. Among those new topics is a claim to acknowledge the history of economic thought (HET) as an important, although neglected, domain of economic inquiry. During the last decades, HET has mostly been abolished or has disappeared in many contemporary teaching curricula in economics. When the latest methods in econometrics and mathematical procedures are put into the reading schedule in university education, reading of the history of our own discipline appears to be nearly forgotten. In general, the study of the history of economic thought is held in low esteem by “mainstream economists and sometimes openly disparaged as a type of antiquarianism” (Blaug 2001, p. 145). An unforecasted crisis, such as the economic crisis and downturn in 2008, teaches us that our academic understanding of economic processes may be incomplete, that our analysis of economic relationships must be more comprehensive, integrating further perspectives of thought, and that contemporaries cannot afford to have a good command of economics without a working knowledge of the changes in and the tradition of our own subject. Although there exist active professional societies in many countries which try to celebrate and foster the history of economic thought, especially the U.S.-based History of Economics Society (HES) and the European Society for the History of Economic Thought (ESHET), which each have an annual conference, maintain journals and many further activities, it does not look as if those societies and related scholars belong to the core faculties of the subject economics. Practice tells us that courses in history of economics are taught less and less, and in many institutions, they are no longer part of the curriculum (Roncaglia 2014). Many even raise the question of whether the history of economics should be considered a subject of history rather than of economics (Kates 2013). However, can we learn anything by reading in history of economic theory, and, if yes, what may it be? Peter Boettke raised the pertinent question: Why, indeed, read the classics in economics? “There are antiquarian reasons—reading the works of the great political economists of the past does give us a glimpse of the genius of an earlier age. But reading an old work in economics is not unlike watching a silent film or news clips of an old baseball game. It is quaint and romantic to look in on the past, but it is useful to remember that this world we sometimes worship from afar was a world without indoor plumbing, without modern transportation…” (Boettke 2000, p. 1). This paper is about the question why it is not only useful but also necessary to invest into history of economic thought. It is difficult to clarify the domain of economics in clear words when teaching undergraduates. Usually we operate with simplifications, which highlight a general theory as a body of “cohesive ideas set within a structure that seems internally consistent” (Wunder 2010, p. 23). As Viner put it in 1917: “There is a tendency among economists to fear over much for the integrity of their science and to try to maintain its borders intact by carefully avoiding encroachment on the fields of other science” (Viner 2017, p. 236). At a first glance, such a monolithic view of theory may be convincing, since it does not acknowledge contradictions, empirical failures, a plurality of competing paradigms and, especially, it ignores change. “Methodology used by economists today is very different from what was used 30 years ago, and what was used 30 years ago was very different from the methodology used by such great economists as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. The economic methodology that is taught in undergraduate courses today is the result of centuries of intellectual debate, and the origin of this body has been filled with differing thinkers often in violent disagreement with each other” (Wunder 2010, p. 23). Man contemporary academic disciplines, not only economics, are experiencing a flood of material in terms of publications and new people (Bögenhold 2010). The topics have multiplied in many directions and whole new areas of discourse have emerged (Chafim 2016), each with separate research organizations, global conferences, journals, curricula, academic career opportunities, as well as patterns and publication opportunities. Parallel, shifting disciplinary boundaries have been observed inside and outside economics (Cedrini and Fiori 2016). During the second part of the twentieth century, an organizational segmentation began, which provided proof of Max Weber’s statement given in his famous article “Science as Vocation” (1988a), namely that the individual can achieve something really substantial on academic ground only in a situation of increased specialization: “In our time, the internal situation, in contrast to the organization of science as a vocation, is first of all conditioned by the facts that science has entered a phase of specialization previously unknown and that this will forever remain the case. Not only externally, but inwardly, matters stand at a point where the individual can acquire the sure consciousness of achieving something truly perfect in the field of science only incase he is a strict specialist” (Weber 1988a, p. 526). A variety of new specialized fields of economics were founded, among them industrial economics, labour economics, small business economics, household economics, economics of aging, but most notably game theory and diverse applications in combination with econometrics. Use of advanced statistics and econometrics have expanded substantially, (Weintraub 2002; Morgan 2012) which can be summarized broadly as diverse sorts of “mathiness” (Romer 2015). Taken together, one may conclude that we have entered “The Age of the Applied Economist” (Backhouse and Cherrier 2017) where elegant theoretical reasoning and historical foundation are being lost. Discussing “The Future of the History of Economics” (Davis et al. 2002) showed the need to acknowledge the history of economics and other social sciences, but also serious practical weaknesses in doing so in times when the history of economics is out of fashion. This paper will primarily present the perspective of Joseph A. Schumpeter, who dealt in detail with the questions of how to deal with historiography as a tool for appropriate economics in his substantial introduction to the History of Economic Analysis (1954). While points of discussion and neglect of history occurred for many years, it is less known that Schumpeter (1954) already pointed out very clearly that history of thought must be acknowledged because it provides a manual to gain systematic knowledge in order to be better equipped for research on future developments.",7

There are many disputes and lawsuits related to the fair value of copyrights. The dominant position of collecting societies has resulted in a number of the European Commission decisions as well as judgments of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and national courts, concerning the activities of collecting societies and the level of fees collected. The problem has been widely analyzed, mainly by law specialists. Recent years have seen an increase in the enforcement of rights related to copyright ownership. People in different countries have protested against the signing of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). This process has caused the number of compensation-related court cases for different copyright owners to escalate. Typical cases in Europe involve the fees paid by hotels and spas to copyright management organizations (CMOs). Some of these cases were judged by the European Court of Justice; in particular regarding CMOs in Spain (ECJ Case C-306/05 2019) and the Czech Republic (ECJ Case C-351/12 2019). Development of a proper method for calculating the value of copyrights and related rights is an important task in the current climate of the new economy. The hotel industry is a very competitive market and copyright costs are significant. There is a lack of a commonly used and widely accepted methodology to calculate the level of royalties collected by CMOs (Kossecki 2012, 2015). The problem is very serious for many sectors of the economy, where profitability strongly depends on the level of fees paid to collecting societies (discotheques, bars, restaurants, hotels, cable operators, television broadcasters). It also influences the legal security of the companies. The amount of fees has been questioned by both copyright owners and their users, which has led to court cases lasting for years, in Poland.",3

Thanks to the economic recovery, child poverty in Europe declined, but is still unacceptably high. According to Eurostat (2017) in 2016, 24.8 million children in the European Union, or 26.4% of the population aged 0 to 17, were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This means that the children were living in households with at least one of the following three conditions: at-risk-of-poverty after social transfers (income poverty), severely materially deprived or with very low work intensity. Almost half of the children were at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Romania (49.2%) and Bulgaria (45.6%). They were followed by Greece (37.5%), Hungary (33.8%), Spain (31,7%), Italy (32.8%) and Lithuania (32.4%). At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest percentages of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion were recorded in Denmark (13.8%), Finland (14.7%) and Slovenia (14.9%), ahead of the Czech Republic (17.8%) and the Netherlands (17.6%). Poverty deprives children of educational opportunities, childcare, access to health care, adequate food and housing, family support and even protection from violence. In the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in 20 February 2013, the European Commission published a European recommendation on child poverty. According to this act (European Commission 2013, p. 1): “children are more at risk of poverty or social exclusion than the overall population in a large majority of EU countries; children growing up in poverty or social exclusion are less likely than their better-off peers to do well in school, enjoy good health and realise their full potential later in life”. Moreover “early intervention and prevention are essential for developing more effective and efficient policies, as public expenditure addressing the consequences of child poverty and social exclusion tends to be greater than that needed for intervening at an early age”. The recommendation, which is a key issue within the Europe 2020 Strategy, is expected to give children visibility in the context of the smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth that the EU envisages. The recommendation could serve as a resource to help member states achieve the targets of lifting 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion and reducing the rate of leaving school early to below 10% by 2020. Strategies that can be launched comprise adequate income support (fiscal incentives, family and child benefits, housing benefits and minimum income schemes). These strategies should be combined with support to parents to access the labour market and services that are essential to children’s outcomes, such as quality (pre-school) education, health, housing and social services. Also important are opportunities to participate and use their rights, which help children live up to their full potential and contribute to their resilience. According to the Eurostat database (Eurostat 2017), the child poverty rate (children at risk of poverty and social exclusion) for Poland in 2016 was 23.3%. In the next year (2017) the rate decreased to 16.8%, placing Poland close to Germany (18%). Reasons for this change may include the reduced unemployment rate associated with the notable economic growth observed during the last few years as well as the pro-family policy of the government. The aim of this paper was to compare income inequality and poverty for different types of Polish households defined by the number of children. Special attention was paid to changes in income distribution during the period 2015–2016, when the Family 500+ child benefit program, aimed at supporting Polish families with children, was launched. Under the program, parents can receive a tax-free benefit of PLN 500 (about EUR 120) per month for the second and any consecutive children until they reach age 18. A microsimulation analysis (Szarfenberg 2017) revealed that the impact of the program on the structure of poverty risk in Poland can be substantial. The influence of the number of children on the distribution of household incomes, including inequality and poverty, was examined by Jędrzejczak and Kubacki (2013), among others. The relationship between the structure of the household and income inequality and poverty with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups, including families with children, has also been studied for many countries (e.g. Jäntti and Bradbury 2001) and for the European Union (Eurostat 2013). These studies suggest that household composition has a significant impact on income and poverty diversity in many countries, especially in southern and eastern Europe, where couples with dependent children are at more than an average at risk of poverty. Jäntti and Bradbury (2001) compared programs aimed at counteracting poverty among children, including family support benefits and tax relief schemes. They revealed that comprehensive family-policy packages including a general child allowance, like Family 500+, aimed at supporting families with children can be more effective than tax-relief schemes. The long-run impact of family support has also been examined recently (Butcher 2017; Aizer et al. 2016). Monti et al. (2015) conducted an interesting analysis of the impact of the Italian income tax system on the income of households with children. The current research was based on individual data from the Household Budget Survey conducted by the Polish central statistical bureau (Statistics Poland 2015, 2016). This survey is the basic source of information on revenues, expenditures, food consumption and other aspects of the living conditions of subgroups of the population. The following family types were considered: marriages without children, marriages with one child, marriages with two children, marriages with three children, marriages with four and more children. Statistics Poland (2015, 2016) does not classify persons living in informal relationships as a specific category and includes them in existing household types. Single parent households (less than 2% of the sample) were excluded due to lack of data on number of children. To account for the influence of different household sizes on the results of the inequality and poverty analysis, for each household, available income was converted into equivalent income. Equivalence scales enable comparisons of the material situation of households differing in size and demographic structure. The new Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) square root scale was used, dividing household income by the square root of household size (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 2019). The data obtained from the Household Budget Survey permit analysis of different factors influencing income distribution and inequality. For the inequality analysis, besides the popular Gini index, known to be proportionally oversensitive to changes in the middle-income distribution, the quintile and decile share ratios were used. They are more sensitive to changes in the tails of the income distributions. To conduct poverty analysis, head-count-ratio as well as the poverty gap and squared poverty gap indices were estimated, which permitted measurement of the intensity, depth, and severity of poverty for different family types. Income inequality refers to the degree of income difference among various individuals or segments of a population. Inequality indices play an important role in income distribution analysis for comparisons across different geographical regions, social groups or family types, and time periods. It is well known that high income inequality can have several undesirable political and social consequences, such as poverty and the polarization of economic groups, which is the process of further differentiation of the poor and the rich, while reducing the middle-income group. Inequality and poverty may not always be positively correlated although they are usually seen as similar and are in fact highly related concepts. One can imagine a strictly egalitarian distribution of incomes, where all the income receivers are poor, or a highly dispersed population not affected by poverty. However, most empirical evidence based on income data from many countries found a strong positive correlation between inequality and poverty. High income inequality is considered the basic determinant of poverty (Hills et al. 2019). The Gini index (Greselin et al. 2013), is the most widely used measure of income inequality, mainly because of its clear economic interpretation. Over its 100-year history, numerous formulas and definitions have been developed. In representative studies, the version of the Gini coefficient estimator often used is the one in which the values of the random variable Y are replaced with expanded values accounting for the sampling scheme (Jędrzejczak 2012): where y(i) is household incomes in a non-descending order, wj is the survey weight for the i-th economic unit and the \( \sum_{j=1}^i{w}_j \) stands for the rank of the i-th economic unit in the n element sample. Distribution quantiles of a random variable Y, identified as household or personal income, or the estimators of these quantiles, have been applied to the construction of the inequality indices as the quintile dispersion ratio and decile dispersion ratio (Foster et al. 1984). The quintile share ratio can also be defined as the ratio of the sum of incomes of the richest 20% of the population to the sum of incomes of the poorest 20%: where GKj is the jth quintile group. Similar ratios can also be calculated for other quantiles, such as deciles or percentiles (95th and 5th) of income distributions. The decile share ratio has the following form: where GDj is the jth decile group. The reciprocal of the decile share ratio takes values from the interval (0,1) and is called the disparity index or the dispersion index for the end portions of the distribution: If the index \( {\hat{K}}_{1/10} \) is closer to the 1, the inequality is lower (mean incomes in the extreme decile groups are the same). During a thorough income distribution analysis, the problem of inequality measurement is usually interrelated with the estimation of poverty and occasionally wealth indices for the population groups. To obtain reliable poverty characteristics, it is crucial to define and estimate the poverty threshold. There are numerous definitions of this threshold, using the absolute or relative approach. The relative poverty line utilized by Eurostat is \( {y}_p^{\ast }=0,6 Me, \) where Me is a median of equivalent income distribution. A comprehensive review of absolute and relative approaches to poverty measurement with special attention paid to data quality aspects can be found in Lemmi et al. (2019). The most popular poverty index is the head-count ratio, also called the at-risk-of-poverty rate (ARPR): where: np is the number of poor individuals or households (with income below the poverty line) and n denotes the number of all households. This index determines the share of households whose equivalent income (or consumption) is below a poverty threshold. The head-count ratio (5) can be estimated from the n-element sample data by means of the following formula: where: Ii is the indicator function taking the value of 1 when the i-th household equivalent income is below the poverty line, and taking the value of 0 in the opposite situation, and wi is the survey weight for i-th economic unit. The poverty gap index provides information regarding the distance of households from the poverty line. This measure captures the mean aggregate income or consumption shortfall relative to the poverty line across the whole population. Estimators of the poverty gap index, which incorporate sampling weights wi, have the following form: where: yi is household equivalent income, \( {y}_p^{\ast } \) denotes the poverty line (poverty threshold), np is the number of poor households and wi is the survey weight for the ith household. The squared poverty gap index (poverty severity index), estimated from the following expression, takes into account not only the distance separating the poor from the poverty line (poverty gap), but also inequality among the poor. The squared poverty gap index places higher weight on those households further away from the poverty line. The empirical analysis presented herein is based on the Household Budget Survey (HBS) which is a random sample of the Polish households selected by Statistics Poland in the years 2015 and 2016. The subject of the analysis was household available income. To account for the influence of different household sizes on the results of the inequality and poverty analysis for each household, available income was converted into equivalent income using the OECD scale. To generalise the results, appropriate survey weights were taken into account when estimating statistical characteristics of particular family types. Table 1 presents basic statistical characteristics of household available income for the whole country and for the distinguished family types in the considered period. This table shows that between the years 2015 and 2016 the average incomes increased for all family types. Moreover, the distributions of income became more homogenous relative to their means; i.e. variability between the mean incomes for different family types, calculated by the coefficient of variation (not displayed in the table) decreased from 15.6% in 2015 to 7.7% in 2016. Despite these important observations, the assessment of income changes based on only the average income and its dispersion seems insufficient as income distributions present high positive asymmetry and heavy tails. Therefore, the article later presents the results of the study of income inequality and poverty. The results of the inequality analysis are in Table 2. When comparing the family types within the same period, they have relatively similar characteristics which demonstrates a similar degree of inequality, but comparing the values of the indices for the same groups between 2015 and 2016, one can notice a clear decrease in inequality. In 2016, the Gini index as well as the quintile (\( {\hat{W}}_{20/20} \)) and decile (\( {\hat{W}}_{10/10} \)) share ratios decreased, while the disparity index \( {\hat{K}}_{1/10} \), which measures dispersion for the end portions of the distribution, increased in relation to 2015. The change in the disparity index reveals a reduction in disproportions between extreme decile groups. The only exception was for marriages without children, where the decile share ratio (\( {\hat{W}}_{10/10} \)) increased and the disparity index \( \left({\hat{K}}_{1/10}\right) \) decreased. The level of income inequality is related to the level of material poverty, as distributions with a high level of inequality are usually more at risk of high poverty rates The results of the poverty analysis (Table 3 and Figs. 1, 2, and 3) report the estimates of poverty indices (\( {\hat{W}}_p \), \( {\hat{PG}}_p \), \( {\hat{PS}}_p \)) for different family types and the whole country.

Source: Own calculation using data from Household Budget Survey (Statistics Poland 2015, 2016) Material poverty by family types and changes during the period were analysed using various indicators based on a poverty threshold. The relative poverty threshold (poverty line) was adopted in line with the Eurostat approach. (60% median of equivalent national income). The poverty threshold was estimated for 2015 as PLN 1258.61. In 2016 it increased to PLN 1343.14, providing a measure of change equal to 106.7%. The poverty threshold in 2016 was 6.7% higher than the respective level in 2015. In Figs. 1, 2 and 3 variability can be observed over different family types and over time, in the head-count ratio, the poverty gap index and the squared poverty gap index, respectively. Differences between the types of households in Poland were the highest for the head-count ratio. For the poverty gap index, the groups were more homogenous. The estimated values of the head-count ratios increased as the number of children in a family increased and reached an extremely high level for marriages with four and more children in 2015 (Fig. 1). For this group the poverty gap and squared poverty gap indices were the smallest, mainly due to low inequality among the poor households. The significance of the differences between the means for different family types was examined using statistical hypothesis testing. The results of the two-sample t-tests for population means are presented in Table 4. According to the third column of this table, the differences were statistically significant and the p-values for the marriages with two, three and four and more children were smaller than 0.0001. In 2016, a significant decline in head-count-ratios \( {\hat{W}}_p \) was also observed, especially for marriages with two children or more. Using two-sample t-tests to compare population proportions, the p values for these family types were smaller than 0.0001 (Table 4). Thus, the percentage of poor families was significantly smaller in 2016 than in 2015. Particularly notable differences appeared for the marriages with four or more children, where the share of poor households in the population of all households measured by the head-count ratio was 38.9% in 2015 and decreased to 16.7% (Fig. 1). For the remaining groups, marriages without children and with one child, the differences were smaller with p values equal to 0.0375 and 0.0504, respectively. Also, for marriages with four or more children, a drop in the poverty gap \( {\hat{PG}}_p \) and squared poverty gap \( {\hat{PS}}_p \) indicators was observed. Thus, the distance between the poor and non-poor families decreased. The product of the \( {\hat{PG}}_p \) index and the poverty line, interpreted as the average amount that would have to be given to poor households so that the poverty phenomenon would be totally eliminated, decreased in 2016 compared to the previous year for marriages with at least four children. In particular: \( {\hat{PG}}_p\bullet {y}_p^{\ast }=0.183\bullet 1343.14=245.80\ \mathrm{PLN} \) in 2016; \( {\hat{PG}}_p\bullet {y}_p^{\ast }=0.231\bullet 1258.61=290.74\ \mathrm{PLN} \) in 2015. In total, poverty decreased by 1.2 percentage points (Table 4) which means that approximately 160,000 households came out of poverty.",7

In the years to come, new countries will join the club of ageing societies. Numerous studies have documented that the use of long-term care (LTC) increases as people age or if people have a disability, which is a correlate of age. Hence, the LTC sector has grown over time, in tandem with the ageing population. The challenges raised by increasing demand for LTC have been met in different ways around the world. In countries like the U.S. and Germany, insurance-based systems play an important role, with for-profit or non-profit organizations being major actors both in paying the bills for LTC and in providing care for those insured. Under such systems, eligibility rules regulate entrance to LTC (Rahman et al., 2016). In contrast, if the public sector is the main provider of LTC services, like in the UK and the Scandinavian countries, budget constraints and need assessments play an important role. In this paper, the focus is on public provision, represented by the case of Norway, where formal LTC is almost exclusively provided through the public sector. However, many of the issues addressed will also be relevant to other countries. In the public sector, resources are commonly allocated through stepwise processes, with political decision-making at the higher levels and bureaucratic or professional decision-making at the lower levels. In the Scandinavian context, resources are first allocated from the central government to municipalities. Next, the local government assembly allocates the municipality’s budget to the main sectors, such as LTC and education. At the third step, sector budgets are allocated to sub-sectors of LTC. In this paper, the focus is on the third level of decision-making, i.e. what determines the capacity of the nursing home sector and the home care sector in municipalities. Since caring for an individual in a nursing home usually is far more expensive than home care, this issue is of great importance to the public sector, which in many countries covers most of the costs for nursing home care, as well as home care. It is also important to care recipients themselves, who may have to pay high fees for nursing home care, and whose quality of life may be profoundly affected by the form of care they receive. Finally, the balance between care at home and in nursing homes may be important to informal caregivers who carry part of the caring burden in the case of home care, and to relatives who may receive smaller bequests if family members become institutionalized. Many researchers have addressed an individual’s choice between institutional care and home care if free to choose (Mommaerts 2018). This is certainly an important question, but for countries where decisions on LTC are taken in the stepwise manner just described, the choice between the two forms of care should be examined at every step of the decision process. In the sequel, such an investigation is carried out by estimating a model that identifies what determines municipalities’ allocation of LTC resources between home care and nursing home care. This issue has received scant attention in the economics literature. The model estimated herein sheds light on several important research questions in public sector decision-making: (1) How will a municipality split an increase in funds available for LTC between home care and nursing home care? The results show that home care will increase more than nursing home care. (2) Will an increase in central government unconditional block grants, with a clearly stated intention to increase municipalities’ supply of nursing home beds, meet the goal? The results provide convincing evidence that it will not. (3) To what extent do municipalities substitute home care for nursing home care? The results indicate only a slight substitution. (4) How do municipalities accommodate differences in morbidity and mortality in their supply of the two forms of care? The results indicate that they do so very well. (5) Does the provision of LTC by municipalities function well as an insurance mechanism against an individuals’ loss of functionality? According to the results, they do function quite well in this respect.",

A Catholic Point of View,November 2020,Klára Katona,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Before the 2008 financial crisis, relevant background literature supported a strong connection between the functions of financial intermediation and economic growth. The fundamental function of the financial-intermediary sector, which collects savings and allocates them to finance investments, highlights a direct connection between financial intermediation and economic growth. Several empirical studies examined this theoretically perceivable relationship (e.g. Cetorelli and Gambera, 2001; Guiso et al., 2004). Another relevant function of the financial market is monitoring and evaluation. It is too expensive for other stakeholders to control the management of the firms. However, banks could successfully undertake this control (Diamond 1984). Long-term cooperation between banks and corporations may also decrease costs derived from informational asymmetry. A developed financial system not only accelerates economic production but also reduces the volatility of investment and growth by providing liquidity to firms (Larrain 2006). In 2008, the financial crisis undermined absolute faith in a theoretically and empirically assessed correlation between financial intermediation and economic prosperity. As a negative spillover effect, the United States (U.S.) financial system crisis quickly expanded to the entire world economy. The financial system could not contribute to economic growth. Instead, it enhanced the economic recession. The system increased risks in the economy and the volatility of investments, and could not monitor firms effectively either. How could this happen when the starting point of the crisis was the U.S., a country that has one of the most developed and liberalized financial systems in the world? Before 2008, several distinguished economists identified discrepancies between economic models and real economic reactions, foreseeing the possibility of a crisis. They suggested complex reform of both the entire financial system and market economy (e.g. Arrow 1992; Stiglitz 2002). Among proposals for fundamental change in the economic system, lack of morality was identified as a possible explanation for the economic crisis in general and especially for the 2008 financial crisis. However, moral interpretation of the economy and the concept of morality itself can vary based on differing philosophical traditions and religions (Taylor 2014, pp. 34–38). Morality can be measured by indices, such as the Freedom from Corruption or World Index of Moral Freedom, which regard religiosity as a negative factor in relation to other moral criteria (Crabtree 2020). At the same time, there is a venerable tradition of reconciling economics with the moral concept of major faiths from Ibn Khaldún (1332–1406) in Islam to Weber’s (1930) famous work on Protestant ethics. The religious approach received further confirmation in contemporary literature and validated the economic relevance of morality from different religious views, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity (e.g. Zsolnai 2010; Vinod 2013; Addas 2008; Sedláček 2011). Alternatively, the link between morality and economics is neither evident nor widely accepted in the economics literature, such as the Chicago or Austrian schools of economics which deny the economic relevance of ethics (Mises 1951, pp. 45–50; Friedman 1970, p. 17). Those economists who described economic actions without moral considerations also provided reasons for the 2008 financial crisis and offered solutions to prevent crises independent of ethical aspects. Contrary to the morally neutral interpretation of the economy in mainstream literature, this study supports an opposing economic viewpoint and tries to theoretically and empirically explain the ethical concerns of economics from the special perspective of the Catholic Church. Among major religions, for more than 100 years the Catholic Church has had one of the most consistent and unified teaching concerning this question. The Catholic Church has drawn attention to the inseparability of morals and the workings of the economy in several papal encyclicals which built successively on each other, confirming and making more sophisticated the statements of each previous one. Catholic social teaching (CST) emphasizes the importance of morality in every human activity, including economic activity. CST declares that there is no domain of economics with its own facts and laws. The economic sphere is part of human activity. Precisely because it is human, it must be structured and governed in an ethical manner (Benedict XVI 2009, §7, 53). The Catholic Church also suggests that without ethics, the economy will function incorrectly. This study is novel in its ability to reveal that CST is not only part of the moral philosophy but also suggests valid explanations and solutions for dysfunctions in and reasons for the financial crisis. The paper highlights those principles of CST which argue for the role of morality in economics, and tries to demonstrate the economic validity and legitimacy of Catholic thought by analyzing theoretical and empirical evidence of economic discourse on the driving force of the economy and possible reasons for the crisis.",2
26.0,4.0,International Advances in Economic Research,20 November 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11294-020-09808-x,European Insurance Markets in the Face of the 2007 Financial Crisis,November 2020,Adam Śliwiński,Tomasz Michalski,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The 2007 financial crisis suggests that, at the turn of the 21st century, financial markets exhibited more intensive symptoms of chaos. Products, as well as regulations concerning insurance institutions, were affected. This paper was inspired by several observations. First, few studies focus on innovation and development in the insurance sector and its influence on economic growth (Laeven et al., 2009; Tufano 2003; Allen and Gale, 1994). The impact exerted by the financial sector, in which the insurance industry plays a crucial role on economic growth, remains rather unclear. History provides clear examples of the role of financiers in enhancing economic growth. For instance, the special category of investment banks and an accounting system that enables screening and monitoring to distant investors were developed to finance the construction of railroads in the 19th and 20th centuries (Laeven et al., 2009). Another example of the role insurance plays in creating and supporting economic growth is the activity of Lloyd’s of London, one of the world’s biggest risk markets. Some historians claim that this market played a substantial role in helping England become a global empire by speeding up the shipbuilding process (Hodgson 1984). Although published studies have not confirmed the influence of insurance-sector development on economic growth, it could be assumed that such influence exists and is positive. Nevertheless, the direction and significance of impact depend on the behavior of insurance entities and kind of insurance coverage (Cummins et al., 2016). This paper analyses whether the insurance sector in chosen European countries has been innovative and if so, can support the process of economic recovery following the 2007 financial crisis. The paper compares the state of development of insurance sectors in chosen European Union (EU) countries at two points in time, 1997 and 2010. The research builds on Michalski’s (2001) study that analysed the state of development of insurance sectors in EU countries in 1997. The year 2010 was selected for the analysis because there were some signs of economic recovery following the 2007 crisis. This approach permits the examination of changes taking place in insurance sectors during the crisis. The main feature that distinguishes the paper from previous studies is application of a taxonomy that permits the comparison of the state of development of insurance sectors in chosen countries at the two different points in time. The conclusions drawn from the analysis can be used in an assessment of the innovativeness of the sector.",

Several studies were conducted on the issue (e.g., OECD 2011, 2015). The trend of rising inequality has become a priority for policymakers and calls for the analysis of various aspects of income inequality, including measurement and decomposition by regional areas, income sources and recently across genders. For social and economic policies, it seems interesting to compare income inequality across the European Union (EU) countries and regions. The focus of the present paper is on income distributions across Poland and Italy because the aforementioned countries represent different economic backgrounds. Poland still suffers the effects of the transitioning from a centrally-planned economy to a market-based economy, and Italy is a former well-established market economy. Moreover, according to the Tárki European Social Report (TÁRKI 2009), a study on intolerance to income inequality across countries confirmed a markedly lower level of acceptance of inequality in the post-socialist bloc than in the other European countries. Nowadays, there is open debate about the observed discrepancy between income distributions of men and women. Women make up almost half of the workforce, yet, on average, they continue to have lower incomes than men. Gender equality is one of the fundamental values of the EU. The EU is dedicated not only to defending this right but also to promoting gender equality within the member states and across the world. This was the core aim of the European Commission’s Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019.report (European Commission 2016). Naturally, gender can affect people’s working lives in different ways. Therefore, even if it is illegal for employers in EU countries to pay men and women different amounts for doing the same job, there are many other reasons why, on average, substantial income differences between men and women can be observed. Differences in pay are caused by many concurring factors, and an interesting in-depth analysis can be found in Blau and Kahn (2003). Occupational segregation is perhaps the main reason. Men are more prevalent in higher-paid industries, while women are mostly in lower-paid industries. The differences in remuneration across industry sectors all influence the gender pay gap (Blau and Kahn 2000). There is also vertical segregation. Few women work in senior and better-paying positions. Moreover, in many countries, there is still ineffective equal-pay legislation regulating women’s overall paid working hours. The distribution of the workforce across working hour bands is generally more even for women than for men, due largely to the higher incidence of part-time work among women. Thus, a greater proportion of women work fewer hours. Finally, some barriers to entry into the labor market are related to the education level and single parenting rate (Leythienne and Ronkowski 2018). Gender equality also means equal economic independence for women and men is still observed. It refers to equality in decision-making, and, in a wider setting, requires equal dignity, integrity and the ending of gender-based violence. In this paper, an analysis of data from household budget surveys carried out in Poland and Italy in 2015 is presented, with special attention to the income gender gap within each country and for macroregions. The calculations were based on microdata from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Condition (EU-SILC) (Eurostat 2015). The original contribution of the present research is the variety of chosen metrics, complemented by the descriptive and inferential tools. More in detail, after estimating the Dagum model for each distribution, summary measures, like the Gini and Zenga inequality indices, were evaluated and the Zenga curve was adopted to detect changes at each income quantile. Afterward, a comparison of the empirical distributions was developed by a relative approach, providing an analytic picture of the gender gap for both countries. The analysis moves beyond the typical focus on average or median earnings differences, toward a perspective on how the full distribution of women’s earnings relative to men’s compares. Finally, the analysis was carried out in the different macroregions of the two countries and the results were discussed. Results of EU-SILC show that the popular Gini inequality indexes for net household incomes in the two countries were rather similar and equaled 0.34 and 0.35, respectively. Nevertheless, the comparative studies conducted by Jedrzejczak (2015) and Zenga and Jedrzejczak (2020) revealed substantial differences in inequality patterns much higher for the Italian macroregions when compared to the Polish ones. In particular, a relatively strong negative correlation was observed between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and income inequality measured by the Gini index in the Italian regions, while in Poland this correlation was slightly positive. As a result, in Italy, the highest-inequality levels occurred in the poorest regions, while in Poland, the opposite was observed.",2

There is no consensus in the theoretical literature on what role fiscal deficits play in creating internal and external equilibrium in an economy that will eventually manifest in current account deficits. Thus, this question must be evaluated empirically. Collignon (2012), Ahmad and Fanelli (2014), Papadopoulos and Sidiropoulos (1999), De Castro and De Cos (2008), Trachanas and Katrakilidis (2013), Arghyrou and Luintel (2007), Bajo-Rubio et al. (2009), Legrenzi and Milas (2012), Afonso and Jalles (2017), Paniagua et al. (2017), Brady and Magazzino (2018), Constâncio (2020), Wysocki and Wójcik (2021), and Albu and Albu (2021) are among the empirical works that examined fiscal sustainability in the Eurozone, but reported contradictory results. The twin-deficits hypothesis posits that a continuous budget deficit puts more strain on the current account deficit. Empirical exploration of the theoretical relationship of the twin deficits started in the 1980s when the United States (U.S.) (under the administration of President Reagan) experienced huge government deficits and external balances. Due to these simultaneous increases, many researchers attributed a large part of the deteriorating external balance of the U.S. during the period to the advent of huge government deficits, leading to a wide range of empirical investigations in many countries. However, the results remained inconclusive for many reasons. For example, the methodology used to analyse the relationship varied from well-specified theoretical models to using simple one-to-one relationships between the budget deficit and current account deficit, as well as the use of different sample periods. Due to the inconclusive results reported by both the theoretical and empirical literatures, it is imperative to re-examine the issue using a different methodology. The literature agrees that fiscal policy can exhibit nonlinearity due to its sensitivity to political decisions. This paper undertakes this analysis using data from Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (GIIPS) using nonlinear techniques. These economies represent a litmus test to examine the dynamic causal relationship of the twin deficits, due to their huge government deficits and external deficits, as well as increases in their public debt in recent times. The existing research on the twin-deficit hypothesis in the GIIPS countries has focused mainly on a linear causal relationship and ignored the possibility of a nonlinear causal relationship. A major gap in the literature remains regarding the twin-deficit relationship for these economies. The first main contribution of this paper is that the study conducts a battery of unit root tests, including the Ng-Perron test (NP) (Ng & Perron, 2001), which can overcome problems associated with traditional Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (Dickey & Fuller, 1979), Phillips and Perron (PP) (1988), and Kwiatkowski et al. (KPSS) (1992) unit root tests. The Ng-Perron unit root tests correct for size distortions in the presence of negative serial correlation and also have a relatively higher power to detect the level of integration compared to traditional unit root tests. Second, the study examines the causal relationship using two different types of parametric causality tests, the pairwise Granger causality test and the Toda-Yamamoto causality test. Third, the study examines not only linear, but also nonlinear, causality between government deficits and external deficits in the GIIPS countries. In addition, the nonlinear test of Brock et al. (1996) (hereafter BDS) was conducted, but using the nonparametric methodology of Diks and Panchenko (2006), which rectifies the potential over-rejection that tainted the non-linear Granger causality test of Hiemstra and Jones (1994). The empirical findings confirm the presence of a nonlinear causal relationship for twin deficits with causality running from trade balances to government deficits in Greece and Italy, a non-linear unidirectional causality from government deficits to trade balance in Portugal, and a non-linear bidirectional causality between trade balances and government balances in Ireland and Spain. The five countries in this study are Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. The main variables (the fiscal, current account, and trade deficits) are all expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Table 1 and Figs. 1-3 provide an overview of the fiscal and external balances for the sample period (1980–2020). A comparison of the mean values of the current account deficits and trade deficits shows that the trade deficits are greater than the current account deficits in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. This implies that trade changes are crucial to their current account deficits. GIIPS Fiscal Deficits, 1980:Q1–2020:Q1. Source: Datastream Databank (Refinitiv, 2020) GIIPS Current Account Balances, 1980:Q1–2020:Q1. Source: Datastream Databank (Refinitiv, 2020) GIIPS Trade Balances, 1980:Q1–2020:Q1. Source: Datastream Databank (Refinitiv, 2020) The fiscal deficits in all the countries in the sample are lower than the 5% critical value, except in Greece where the fiscal deficit is greater than the 5% critical value (Fig. 1). The major reason for this was that Ireland had a surplus between 2003 and 2007 and Spain had a surplus between 2005 and 2007. Both countries later returned to deficits. In the period from 2008 to 2020, all the countries recorded higher deficits. This can be traced to the global recession, macroeconomic instability, and uncertainties due to the European sovereign debt crisis from which the GIIPS countries suffered more than the core Euro countries, such as Germany and France. The deficits imply that when spending exceeds revenue, an increase in public debts will occur. Figure 2 shows that in Italy and Ireland, the current account deficits were greater than the trade deficits on average, implying that these two countries are net exporters of goods and services. Thus, it can be concluded that higher liabilities abroad are the main cause of the increase in the current account deficits. The highest trade deficits were recorded in Greece, representing about 64% of GDP in the second quarter of 1981 (Fig. 3). This implies that total imports were greater than total exports, and thus Greece is a net importer of goods and services.",2

Expected and Unexpected Effects of Municipal Tax Policy,November 2021,Mario Hesse,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Consolidation of public budgets is an ongoing issue of fiscal policy. At the same time, many municipalities are confronted with structural problems that do not allow them to balance their budgets despite good framework conditions. Overall, the literature gives a diffuse picture of public budget consolidation. In addition, there is little scientific literature dealing explicitly with the municipal (local authority) level. Therefore, this paper integrates international literature, focusing on the case of German municipalities and adds empirical findings. As little research has been devoted to this topic thus far, the paper provides valuable insights. The paper provides a first overview of the literature on consolidation instruments related to public budgets and applies the findings to the municipal level in Germany. However, many approaches on the national and international level are not transferable to municipalities directly. Local authorities only have limited influence on their expenditure and revenues. Thus, the study refers to instruments and strategies that enable municipalities to balance their budgets on a permanent basis.Footnote 1 The empirical examination reveals the effects of different fiscal instruments on the success of budget consolidation, especially for tax increases. As Stiglitz (2010, p. 1) pointed out, “analytically, the task of deficit reduction is simple: cutting expenditures and raising taxes.” The practical implementation of fiscal consolidation in local municipalities is especially complicated against the background of their federal and political-economic integration. Important secondary objectives of deficit reduction are the preservation of local self-government and the need to maintain services of general interest and technical infrastructure even in difficult budgetary situations. A government shutdown is not allowed to happen in a German municipality. Against the backdrop of intense debates on instrumental design, there is agreement both in theory and in practice that there is no panacea for municipal budget consolidation. Although a mix of different consolidation instruments is suggested in the literature, debate about the individual instruments within this mix is not equally weighted. Even though empirical results frequently depend on the municipalities’ structural and legal specifics,Footnote 2 the literature suggests that higher revenue will stimulate higher expenditures. Thus, tax increases seem to be a rather unsuitable instrument for fiscal consolidation, as they will not fully contribute to budget improvement. However, particularly in the case of deficit-induced tax increases, empirical results tend to contradict an automatic reaction (Chapman & Gorina, 2012). Alesina and Perotti (1995) empirically identified the composition of fiscal impulses for successful budget consolidation early on, which strongly influenced the subsequent economic debate on the topic. According to their study, successful consolidation packages were 80% expenditure-side instruments, mainly cuts in social transfers and staff expenditure. The results were later replicated and confirmed (Von Hagen & Strauch, 2001). Since the 2008/2009 crisis, there has been an increase in empirical studies on fiscal multipliers in practice and growth impacts of the corresponding fiscal stimuli (Alesina & Ardagna, 2009).Footnote 3 Considering already high tax ratios in many countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2012) regarded a reduction in expenditure as the most promising option. Expenditure cuts have been considered to be more effective and long-lasting (Sutherland et al., 2012; Molnar, 2012; Wagschal & Wenzelburger, 2008). Cuts in the social sector, staff expenditure and subsidies appeared particularly promising (Sutherland et al., 2012; Molnar, 2012). The literature shows that instruments on the expenditure side dominate practical consolidation policy, both at the general government and municipal level (Blöchliger et al., 2012; Büttner & Wildasin, 2002). In contrast, it is suspected that revenue instruments contribute to consolidation, but they are regularly discussed only as a last resort (Molnar, 2012). Instead, the deterrent effect of higher taxes and levies are given priority, assuming negative growth effects (Romer & Romer, 2007). In this context, a tax increase can cannibalise the revenue it generated and thus neutralise or even reverse the intended primary effect (Mountford & Uhlig, 2008). Spatial tax evasion appears to be particularly relevant for the municipal level as companies may manage their settlement and/or expansion decisions on a fairly small scale. Thus, tax increases have historically been a rarely used consolidation instrument, particularly for companies (Alesina & Perotti, 1995). Since this observation in the mid-1990s, the trend towards a reduction in corporate taxes has continued to the present. However, a more in-depth examination of the literature reveals a differentiat picture. Large consolidation packages turned out to be more successful if they included instruments on both the revenue and the expenditure sides (Molnar, 2012). There is growing evidence, that spending cuts induce greater (negative) macroeconomic effects than revenue increases (Barrell et al., 2012; Hagemann, 2012; Alesina & Ardagna, 2009).Footnote 4 Recent literature shows that even tax reforms including higher tax rates may have positive impacts on the economy (Bhattarai & Benjasak, 2021). Fiscal consolidation packages in the OECD consisted both of revenue increases and expenditure cuts in a country-specific mix (Kastrop et al., 2017). Regarding macroeconomic and distributive effects, Paulus et al. (2017) also revealed mixed results for European countries, supporting tax increases as consolidation instruments. Consequently, empirical studies do not show an overall preference for expenditure-side over revenue-side instruments.",2

This work highlights the understudied aspect of repatriation, which the present data analysis unpacks. Conflicts, social unrest, natural disasters and economic crises are considered immigration disruptions to regular labor immigration patterns (Bylander 2018), with the pandemic being no different from a natural disruptor (Liao 2020). Human mobility restrictions in response to COVID-19 created disorder among immigrants (Dommaraju 2020). Expatriates have been associated with executive assignments (Borrmann 1968; Negandhi & Estafen, 1965). Immigrant workers faced adverse impacts, such as long working hours, isolation, poor quality of living standards, social discrimination, and mental pressures. Their dependents at home faced financial strains due to reduced cash flow from their working relatives. Moreover, immigrant workers were in constant fear of being sent back to their home countries due to the impact of COVID-19 in their host countries (Karim et al., 2020). To curb COVID-19 transmission, most countries where immigrant workers work enforced lockdowns, which reduced working hours and job opportunities. Previous research suggested that expatriates were satisfied only when their international assignment or travel included options for career development, job enrichment and the presence of a supportive family (Kim & Tung, 2013), and relocation was motivated by financial reasons (Lett & Smith, 2009). With these prospects gone due to the pandemic, the environment where employees were assigned became seriously adverse, if not hostile. In the past, countries saw the positive effects of immigration in boosting economic prosperity in the host country (Morley 2006), skill endowment and productivity (Borjas 1994). Since there is a lack of consensus on how expatriates should be defined, the conception of McNulty and Brewster (2017) was used. They critically conceptualized expatriates as international business travelers (IBTs) and commuters, virtual workers, assigned employees, self-initiated labor seekers, migrants (skilled and unskilled), and sojourners (retirees and students). The present study draws attention to Oman, a Persian Gulf country, and explores some early effects of reverse immigration. Looking at expatriate data that include what such definitions tend to capture, the study finds that despite reverse effects, these are definite differences between ethnic groups. This suggests that possible reverse effects in immigratory flows (often induced by exogenous shocks) should not be examined only in the aggregate. Expatriate populations manifest different dynamics depending on their ethnic background, social networks or even bilateral agreements between countries. The Aspirations-Capabilities framework aspires to capture how macroeconomic factors influence ideas (e.g., expectations) and resources (e.g., financial or human) conducive to the decision to migrate or not. For the first time in the English language literature, the study investigates a set of hypotheses to test the Aspirations-Capabilities framework and whether this hypothesis survives the robustness of the pandemic exogenous shock. The analysis explores whether the COVID-19 pandemic shock negatively impacts expatriates in the host country, as well as identifies heterogeneous effects across different ethnic groups. The focus on Oman deviates from prior research focused solely on a source country and a host country, where the major concern is the reason individuals choose to migrate from a less developed to a more developed country (Karemera et al., 2000; Serlenga & Shin, 2021). Instead, the focus is on the exogenous effect of the COVID-19 shock on ethnic expatriates in the host country.",

An increase in savings thus increases investments, and a higher capital stock increases the standard of living. In an open economy, due to the international mobility of capital, the relationship between national savings and investments is weaker, but Weil (2009, p. 69) showed that national investments still significantly depend on national savings. This explains why policy makers have a keen interest in household savings decisions. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the determinants of household savings decisions, and more specifically on the effects of negative interest rates. According to Brandao-Marques et al. (2021), there are no empirical studies focusing on the effects of negative interest on household savings behavior. Indeed, to my knowledge, this paper is one of very first to do so. One of the responses of monetary policy makers to the global financial crisis and subsequently the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (World Health Organization 2022) pandemic is the introduction of negative interest rate policy (NIRP, see, e.g., Claeys 2021). Indeed, NIRPs remain controversial and one of the concerns is that a NIRP could lead to non-linear effects of monetary policy. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that a NIRP leads to a statistically and economically significant increase in household savings. A further contribution is a more detailed analysis of the effects of NIRP on the effects of the specific determinants of household saving behavior. The detailed analysis gives insights regarding which economic theory increases or loses its predictive power in times of NIRPs. This makes the presented findings relevant for policy makers and for a better economic understanding of negative interest rates. Deaton (1977) presented the disequilibrium-savings theory of savings. This theory predicts that unanticipated income changes, unanticipated inflation effects, and previous saving levels have a positive effect on household savings. Friedman (1957) introduced the permanent-income theory, while Modigliani and Brumberg (1954) and Ando and Modigliani (1963) described the life-cycle theory. The latter two theories can be used to predict a positive effect of income uncertainty, and negative effects of social security, the old-age dependency ratio, the participation rate of the elderly and health expenditure on households’ savings. Finally, Barro (1974) provided a theoretical foundation for the Ricardian equivalence proposition. This proposition maintains that government deficits have a positive effect on household savings. This paper analyzes determinants of savings behavior using a panel of 20 countries. The data for the years 2000 to 2020 are from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. The regression analysis uses a fixed-effects least-squares approach with household savings ratio as the dependent variable. The main conclusions are that the positive effect of income uncertainty and lagged saving rates gets smaller for negative interest rates, weakening the support for the disequilibrium-savings theory. Larger government deficits increase savings even more when rates are negative, strengthening the Ricardian equivalence effect. The predictions are also considered based on the permanent-income and life-cycle theories. On the one hand, negative interest rates weaken the predicted negative effects of health expenditure and weaken the predicted positive effect of income uncertainty. On the other hand, negative interest rates may strengthen the predicted negative effect of social security on household savings. This implies that negative interest rates have a mixed effect on the empirical validity of the permanent-income and life-cycle theories. Instead of a comprehensive review of the vast empirical literature on household savings behavior, this literature review is limited to studies based on an approach similar to the one used in this paper. Feldstein (1974, 1977, 1980) and Fredriksson and Staal (2021) presented evidence that social security depresses household savings, as predicted by the permanent-income and life-cycle theories. However, Koskela and Virén (1983) did not find a significant effect of social security, but presented evidence supporting the disequilibrium-savings theory. The findings presented in Nicolescu-Aron and Mihăescu (2012), Aizenman et al. (2019), and Fredriksson and Staal (2021) support the latter theory, indicating that unanticipated income, unanticipated inflation and the perceived optimal savings ratio have positive effects on savings. Finally, El Mekkaoui de Freitas and Martins (2014) and Aizenman et al. (2019) provided evidence for the Ricardian equivalence proposition.",

New Evidence from European Insurers,May 2023,Evaggelia Siopi,Thomas Poufinas,Charalampos Agiropoulos,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Since the financial crisis that began in 2007–2008, the European Union (EU) has undertaken an ambitious scheme for supervisory and regulatory reform. That crisis spurred a severe worldwide economic crisis that marked the next decade and the first quarter of the twenty-first century. Until the coronavirus (COVID) pandemic broke out in 2020, it was probably the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. The 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers sparked an international banking crisis. The European debt crisis began with a deficit in Greece in late 2009. The 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis involved the failure of all three of that country’s major banks. Relative to the size of its economy, the Icelandic crisis was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in history. Regulatory authorities reacted. The United States (U.S.) enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 in order to ""promote the financial stability of the United States"" (U.S. Library of Congress, 2010, PL 111–203). In 2009, countries around the world adopted the Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Because regulation is a complex interaction between politicians, civil servants, industry, interested groups, regulatory bodies, and consumers, its true impact demands close scrutiny. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA, 2009a, b) introduced new solvency capital requirements as a system of governance and a mechanism for cooperation and coordination between supervisory authorities. Called Solvency II, this scheme took effect on January 1st, 2016 and applies to all European insurance and reinsurance companies (EIOPA, 2009a, b, 2015a, b, 2016, 2018). It attempts to create a level playing field for the European insurance sector. In addition to prescribing rules for the governance of insurance companies, Solvency II emphasizes the capital required to cover the assumed risks and safeguard the solvency of insurers. Solvency II seeks to reduce the risk of failure of an insurance company to cover the claims of the insured and protect policyholders from losses due to such events. In addition, Solvency II sets rules for more detailed, public information included in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) and not just in the Report to Supervisors. Increased transparency should boost confidence in all types of insurance: life insurance, non-life insurance, and reinsurance. As risk taking is the primary component of the business of insurance, an insurer's risk management process is laid out in its own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA) (EIOPA, 2015a, b). ORSA includes a risk-based assessment of the insurer’s solvency needs based on its business profile and own risk appetite. It must be considered in running the business. This study advances the existing literature in two ways. First, it identifies the most important variables affecting the solvency capital requirement (SCR) ratio, which is vital for the viability of European insurance companies. Second, this study sets a benchmark for monitoring and forecasting the effectiveness of the risk management process that insurers implement. Such forecasting ability is of the utmost importance for the insurance sector, since solvency enables insurers to deliver benefits promised to policyholders and fulfill their social obligations.",

Recall the situation faced by the young prince. His father, King Hamlet, has suddenly died. Shortly thereafter, Claudius, brother to the dead king and young Hamlet’s uncle, is chosen to be the new ruler of Denmark and marries the recently widowed Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother. Next comes the shocking news that a ghost in the form of the late king has appeared outside Elsinore, the royal castle. Hamlet’s investigation leads to a meeting with the ghost, who claims to be the spirit of Hamlet’s father. The ghost further alleges that his mortal existence ended via a murder perpetrated by Claudius, and calls for young Hamlet to seek revenge. This is Hamlet’s state of affairs as of the end of Act 1. It is only at the very end of the play, in Act 5, scene 2, that Hamlet, himself about to perish, avenges his father’s death by killing Claudius. The goal of this article is to read the most famous tragedy in the English language through an economic lens. In short, is Hamlet rational? In economics, rational choice concerns the connection between one’s preferences or goals and the decisions made in their pursuit. A person’s (fixed) preferences are their own business, taken as a given by the economic analyst. To be rational is to choose appropriate (or at the extreme, fully optimal) means to satisfy your preferences or to achieve your goals: the “reasoned pursuit of self-interest” (Sen, 2018, p. 11,225). Preferences themselves cannot be mistaken from the economics point of view. An irrational choice, however, is a failure to appropriately advance the satisfaction of those preferences. Choices generally are made under uncertainty. One cannot know in advance the precise outcomes of our actions. The optimal decision at any moment in time might result in a very poor, even a tragic, outcome, from the decision maker’s point of view, once the uncertainty is resolved. In dealing with uncertainty, however, a rational approach does include holding reasonable beliefs about the likelihood of future outcomes arising from alternative choices, and adjusting those beliefs suitably as new, relevant information emerges (Elster, 2015, pp. 244–246).Footnote 2 Appropriate investment in acquiring such pertinent information constitutes another dimension of rational behavior under uncertainty (Elster, 2015, p. 235). The three components of rational choice under uncertainty are: (1) appropriate decisions given one’s preferences and beliefs, (2) appropriate beliefs given the information available, and (3) appropriate investments in generating relevant information (Elster, 2015, p. 235). A major barrier to making judgments about rationality is that the underlying, presumably fixed preferences are not themselves directly observable. To infer preferences from choices is to assume rationality, not to judge it. Nonetheless, one can make reasonable suppositions about preferences given testimony and context, whether in real life or in the lives of literary characters. Hamlet’s words and actions, for instance, suggest that he possesses a strong preference for avenging his father’s murder, if his father was indeed murdered and if Hamlet is well assured of the identity of the perpetrator. Other elements of Hamlet’s preferences admit of more ambiguity, Does Hamlet have any interest in his continued existence, and does he care about trying to escape any responsibility or negative consequences if he does take revenge? Contrary to Olivier’s contention and the traditional literary view that sees Hamlet as excessively indecisive, Hamlet’s approach to decision making under uncertainty comports well with economic rationality. Hamlet’s decisions concerning his pursuit of revenge, his beliefs given the information available, and his efforts to gather more information, are all quite sensible. One moment, not of delay, but of rashness (the mistaken killing of the counselor Polonius, which a quick glance could have prevented) is the potential irrationality that leads to a stage strewn with bodies. Even Hamlet’s decision to strike before verifying his victim’s identity possesses a plausible logic. In any event, the common view of Hamlet as indecisive is unwarranted. While the broad contours of Hamlet’s path to revenge are consistent with economic rationality, some aspects of his story remain curious. Among the features that raise questions are: (1) the precise method Hamlet adopts in the hope of acquiring more information; (2) Hamlet’s attempt to convince others that he has lost his reason; and (3) the degree of Hamlet’s concern with his own existence and wellbeing. The examination below of these elements of the play, however, once again serves to undermine the notion that Hamlet routinely behaves in a less-than-rational manner.",

Their key importance was shown very clearly by the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis in the U.S., which was mainly caused by a housing bubble that started in the previous decade (Shiller, 2007). The empirical literature aiming to shed light on their behaviour comprises two main strands. The first type of studies analyses their relationship with economic fundamentals. For instance, Capozza and Helsely (1989, 1990) provided evidence on the long-run equilibrium relationship between real house prices and real income. The second category of papers focuses instead on the univariate statistical properties of house prices. Earlier studies carried out unit root tests (e.g., Meen, 1999, for United Kingdom (UK) regional prices; Cook & Vougas, 2009 for aggregate prices in the presence of structural breaks; Clark & Coggin, 2011, and Zhang et al., 2017, for the U.S.; Arestis & Gonzales, 2014, for 18 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries). However, this approach, which is based on the dichotomy between I(0) stationary and I(1) non-stationary processes, imposes rather restrictive assumptions on the behaviour of the series of interest. A more general framework, which is more informative about properties such as persistence and mean reversion, is represented by fractional integration (Granger, 1980; Granger & Joyeux, 1980; Hosking, 1981). In this case, the series of interest is modelled as an I(d) process, with d being allowed to take any real value, including fractional ones. This approach encompasses a wide range of stochastic behaviours. More specifically, if d = 0, the process is said to exhibit short memory, with its autocorrelations (if non-zero) decaying at an exponential rate. If d > 0, the process is characterised by long memory, and the autocorrelations decay at a rather slower hyperbolic rate. If 0 < d < 0.5, the process is covariance stationary and, as long as d < 1, mean reversion will occur, even if the fractional parameter is in the non-stationary range. Finally, d = 1 corresponds to the unit root case, and d > 1 to explosive behaviour. Papers modelling house prices using this method include among others Gupta et al. (2014). However, all these studies focus on long-run persistence only and do not allow for possible breaks. More recently, Canarella et al. (2021) instead used a fractional integration model including both a long-run and a cyclical component to analyse persistence in both U.S. and UK house prices over a long time span, and also tested for breaks. They found that long-run persistence plays a greater role. Breaks occurred at different times in the two countries being examined (earlier in the U.S.), which implies that national factors were their main drivers of house prices. The present study belongs to the second strand of the literature on house prices, which carries out univariate analysis, and also follows a fractional integration approach as in the more recent contributions mentioned previously. However, unlike them, the present study provides evidence on U.S. house price behaviour by geographical area. More specifically, it examines data for various census divisions. This is an important addition to the existing body of empirical literature, since there can obviously be significant differences between the housing markets of different areas of a country (the U.S., in the current case) that are not captured by the aggregate price series. Thus, different policy prescriptions might be appropriate in each case. The other issue addressed by the current analysis is the possible presence of breaks in the series under examination, which is also of key importance to understand changes in the housing market that might have occurred as a result of a variety of factors (fundamentals or others), again with implications for the design of effective stabilisation policies.",
