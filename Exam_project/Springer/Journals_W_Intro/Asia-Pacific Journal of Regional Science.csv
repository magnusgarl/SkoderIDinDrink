Bailly,Lay James Gibson,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With almost no advanced notice, regional science’s founder, Walter Isard could make a convincing presentation on the academic influences that have shaped regional science. If he were visiting a department of sociology he might title his presentation “Sociology’s Contributions to Regional Science,” for a department of psychology it would be “Psychology’s Contributions to Regional Science.” Isard was so well read and thoughtful that he could do a convincing job with the contributions of economics, geography, environmental science, planning and just about any other discipline, multidisciplinary field or professional field. This skill made him welcome and at home in a variety of settings—making a presentation to a group of undergraduate students at the University of Geneva, to a group of colleagues at the British–Irish Section of the Regional Science Association International, or when speaking to development professionals somewhere in the Asia-Pacific realm. It also made him a powerful advocate for regional science. He in one presentation could make regional science something universal and at the same time a discipline tied to all, or at least many, other disciplines. Professor Isard is now gone but his legacy lives on. We are certain that if Professor Isard were still alive he would be the first to encourage regional scientists to track developments in disciplines and fields that complement the emerging discipline of regional science. Professor Isard also had good instincts when it came to recognizing emerging research themes and when it came to positioning regional science at the front of the pack of disciplines prepared to contribute to the understanding of emerging research themes. An example was his 1973 book on Ecologic-economic Analysis for Regional Development: some Initial Explorations with Particular Reference to Recreational Resource Use and Environmental Planning. This book (Isard et al. 1973) tied regional science to environmental impact analysis and environmental planning-fields that were emerging but certainly on the fringe in the days prior to environmental quality legislation. In this paper we will explore a handful of disciplinary and professional developments that have important implications for the way that regional science is practiced today. We will also consider some critical research themes that are certainly not the exclusive turf of regional science but are themes that can clearly benefit from the perspectives and approaches that regional science offers. Our intention is not to provide a comprehensive review of the research themes followed by regional scientists during the last one-half century. Mulligan (2014) did a superlative job of this in his recent comprehensive review of regional science. Our goal is to encourage regional science to continue exploring ways of contributing to the solutions of critical problems facing scientists, public policy leaders, and private decision makers.",3

This paper examines progress toward achieving this long-term goal and related labor market adjustments that have occurred in pursuit of this goal. The paper reviews China’s economic development since the “Opening Up” policy was adopted in the late 1970s through the recent slowing of growth and a renewed commitment to transforming the economy once again to an innovation-based model as part of its effort to achieve sustained economic growth. The paper concludes that China is not only making measurable and significant progress but is also doing so in a way that raises the question of whether China has invented a new economic development model? This conclusion is made with the caveat that China still faces a number of barriers for fully achieving self-innovation outcomes. This paper and the examination of the development of self-innovation capacity in China are focused at the national level despite the fact that spatially uneven growth has been a nagging problem for China since “Opening Up” in 1979. The evolution of self-innovation capacity has also been uneven as far as one can determine at this time. Yet, as will be illustrated below, significant effort has been made centrally to ensure that resources to support innovation reaches all parts of China where major investments from central government sources along with provincial and local match have been made to this end. Despite this effort at geographically spreading the resources for innovation, historical institutional factors have favored success in some areas over others. Recently some parts of China are beginning to show an ability to self-innovate new technologies and processes erected on and around highly sophisticated innovation centers that bear a strong similarity to those in the more “perfumed parlors” of innovation around the world, e.g., Austin Texas, Cambridge, UK, Silicon Valley. Because the spatial spread of this process is in an early stage of development, this paper defers an analysis of this issue to future research. At the same time, the spatial aspects of this process are considered further but briefly in the conclusions. The 13th Chinese 5-year development plan released in 2015 stresses the overriding goal of achieving sustainable economic growth. The plan is the result of the slowing of growth of the Chinese economy over the past several years leading up to 2015 and the belief that achieving sustainable economic growth is a major priority. Innovation is a leading element of the strategy that is proposed but there are other components. These include increased consumer spending aimed at reducing high consumer savings levels, service sector growth, entrepreneurship, increased investment in health and higher education, reduced capital controls, and reducing corruption. An examination of the plan in detail would be an informative exercise but far too complex to undertake even briefly in this paper. Thus, given the importance that is stressed on innovation in the plan, this paper is focused on an examination of the recent history of China’s investment in building self-innovation capacity and progress that appears to have been made toward this end. Consideration of the sustainability goal is left for others. The reader interested in this broader goal and plan may find the following sources of interest: (Johnston 2015; Prassad 2015; Smith 2015). The first two decades of China’s development plan focused primarily on de-collectivization of agriculture but by the late 1980s policy emphasis turned to privatization and contracting out some manufacturing functions from State Owned (SOCs) to private companies and thus transforming the economy from import to export oriented as it borrowed insight and guidance from the evolving experience of the export-oriented growth model of the Four Little Dragons. The ensuing rise of China’s manufacturing-based economy depended on obtaining production and marketing technologies from more developed countries. To the extent that innovation was involved in the rise of the manufacturing economy, it was imitation based with Chinese companies inventing and implementing incremental changes on top of basic technologies and improvements acquired from others (Heilig 2012; Zhang and Stough 2012; Kerr 2013; Tse 2014). From “Opening Up” and later as increased privatization unfolded, China’s leadership understood that sustained growth would ultimately depend on its ability to innovate its own technologies and methods (Economist 2015). So, it set about creating a technically skilled labor pool and initiating a variety of experiments aimed at strengthening home grown innovation. From the early to mid-1990s, China implemented huge financial support programs and incentives aimed at promoting self-generated innovation. For example, national and sub-national programs providing support for technology incubation and government venture capital (e.g., the Torch Program) to support new technology companies were implemented and tested across the country (China.org.cn 2004; Blank 2013) with nearly every medium- to large-sized city receiving central government support in combination with locally provided resources (e.g., match or/or finances) to create new technologies and processes. While these policies initiated many experiments (e.g., technology incubation programs and/or technology development centers), the immediate results were at best marginally successful and then mostly in a few places like Singapore and later Shenzhen. There are many reasons for these seemingly failed policies and programs which are considered below in the next part of the paper. It is important to note that the early attempts to move China toward self-innovation helped officials (national and local) learn that more than financial incentives and low-cost labor would be required. Until recently, the slow to develop innovation skills resulted in a growing belief among foreign economic development and growth experts that China would experience great difficulty creating a self-innovation-driven economy and thus would be heavily dependent for some time on acquisition of technical inputs from external providers via imitation and other methods (Abrami et al. 2014). Events in the past several years suggest that China may be altering this external perception as indigenous globally competitive technology and technology-led companies have emerged. For example, a recent report lists four of China’s internet and technology companies among the top ten in the world (Wired 2014). Further, the U.S. National Science Board (the board of directors for the U.S. National Science Foundation) reports that China’s share of high technology manufacturing rose from 8% in the early 2000s to 24% in 2013 and for a similar period China’s global portion of technology manufacturing grew from approximately 2 to 14.5%. While the U.S. portion remains dominant, it fell from 37.5 to 30% of global technology manufacturing (Abrami et al. 2014; Wertime 2014). These are only a few indicators or examples that China’s economy is moving toward becoming a large and mature innovation-based economy. This was not thought possible just a few years ago. This possibility is examined in detail below in Part 4. Before turning to the analysis, it is an instructive digression to consider Daniel Bell’s (2015) thesis that China’s society and thus its model of governance can be understood in terms of three layers. At the top is a decision and leadership structure that is based for the most part on meritorious principles. China has expended huge resources developing a leadership training, evaluation, and testing program that aim to identify and select the “best and the brightest” for the top leadership positions in China’s government. However, this occurs only after candidates complete a long trek that began with elections at the village and district level in urban areas, and only later progressed to more senior leadership roles (Bell 2015). The more one rises to and seeks higher senior party level leadership positions, the more one must demonstrate (through interviews, oral and written examinations, and continued high levels of performance) that he or she has sufficient broad and deep knowledge, and experience to successfully participate in senior level decision making (Bell 2015, pp. 63–109). Beneath this, merit-based decision framework is a middle layer of the structure that is experimental. Learning from experimentation has been a central element since “Opening Up” as demonstrated by the creation of the Special Economic Zones in the Coastal areas as early on economic development experiments for testing and evaluating market principles. This early experience provided “lessons learned” and the dissemination of “best practices” in support of subsequent formation of next generation development zones. The Shenzhen special economic area experiment is an intermediate case of a special economic zone being erected upon best practices learned from earlier experiments and experience. The modern history of China’s attempts to create an innovation economy may be viewed as a series of learning experiments that revealed workable practices and constraints that needed to be more carefully managed. Finally, Bell (2015) argues that democracy operates at the local level as described briefly above about how local and regional candidates for the more senior leadership positions are usually required to compete for those positions through elections. This practice began in the early 1980s in Guangxi province and “the new constitution adopted in 1982 included a clause defining the village committee and residents’ committee as self-governing organizations of the masses in rural and urban areas, respectively, including the provision that officeholders should be selected by election.” (Bell 2015, p. 181). The importance of China’s recent seemingly increased indigenous innovation did not happen because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) just ordered it, but, it is also, importantly, the result of more than 2 decades of experimental efforts to create an innovation economy. The lessons learned from failed and sometimes successful attempts have produced innovation approaches that are indigenous in nature and seem to be coming increasingly more successful especially in the past few years. The paper is organized in several parts following this Introduction. The concept of an innovation economy is examined and described in terms of associated input and output factors, not the least of which is the labor market, in Part 2. Next, the rise of the Chinese economy from “opening up” until signs that the manufacturing-based economy was beginning to decline in the 2nd decade of the 2000s is examined in part 3, along with the barriers to innovation. Following this, in Part 4, the rise of the Chinese innovation economy is presented. In part 5, the vision of China’s innovation-based economy is examined and discussed in terms of recent experience and on the basis of changes in both input and output indicators. Also, barriers that still beg attention are considered. The issue of the spatial distribution of self-innovation process in China is considered in Part 6. Conclusions and discussion of the implications of the rise of China’s innovation economy for the rest of the world and future Chinese economic development are presented at the end. The Chinese labor force has experienced several transformations from the beginning of opening up through the manufacturing-dominated economy to the present time when its innovation economy is evolving (Kerr 2013). China’s quest and rise to the status of an innovation economy is marked by many changes and transformations of its economy not the least of which is the continued adjustment of its labor force skill base to support a more self-innovation economy. This paper, in addition to its basic purpose to examine the development of an innovation economy in China, also demonstrates how the Chinese labor force has evolved and transformed as new economic realities appeared.",6

Haynes,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Internet can be accessed using a wide range of data rates. Although there is no standard definition of Internet service based on transmission speed, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defines broadband Internet as having transmission capacity higher than 1.5 or 2 megabits per second (Mbps). This speed is faster than the primary rate interface relying on a 64 kilobits per second (kbps) transmission standard (ITU 2003). Dial-up as a slower narrowband service allows an Internet user to dial and connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provides commercial Internet access. In Nepal, commercial operators offer Internet services both on wireline and wireless platforms. Various types of Internet-based services, such as e-government, e-commerce, and e-health, are available. The number of (broadband) Internet users has been steadily increasing and this growth trend should continue in the short-run. The Government of Nepal (GoN) has been an important player in promoting Internet access and services (see Parajuli and Haynes 2017). However, the relationship between broadband and narrowband services has not been examined. This study investigates the causal relationship between broadband (asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)) and narrowband (dial-up) Internet subscribers in Nepal. This paper is arranged in the following way. Section 2 provides background on information and communications technologies with the focus on broadband services. Research methods, hypotheses, and data are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the empirical findings. Concluding remarks and policy recommendations are in the final section.",2

To recover and revitalize a region that has suffered a great deal of damage from this great earthquake, we take into account Porter’s (1998, 2000) concepts of clusters and Krugman’s (1991) concepts of core-periphery (CP) and analyze the potential for ongoing economic development in disaster regions in Japan, using two new industry clusters with innovation. The two clusters used are the automobile industry cluster, which targets the entire disaster region and whereby innovation comes from aggregation of different industries in mega-regions, and the food industry cluster, which targets individual disaster-struck prefectures, focusing on their leveraging of regional resources. Indeed, the industry clusters are nothing new. However, policy makers and political officers have recently begun to adopt industrial clusters with innovation as industrial and regional policies in Japan. This paper will adopt the dynamic two-regional computable general equilibrium (D2SCGE) model and will set as a base scenario that takes into account targets for revitalization in Japanese depopulating economy, reflecting productivity improvement in each industry region and increased workforce participation across not only disaster regions and other regions as well. With these ground rules set, we will construct the “new food industry cluster formation scenario”, which leverages local resources in each region, and the “new automobile industry cluster formation scenario”, which applies more broadly to mega-regions and innovation as mentioned above. We will then assess the economic effects of the formation of each new industry cluster with productivity improvement. In other words, we will clarify what ripple effects exist for disaster region economies through a simulation created based on these scenarios and show the necessity of the formation of two types of industry clusters with productivity improvement within disaster regions in Japanese depopulating society after the Great East Japan Earthquake.",8

Accordingly, Cooke and Morgan (1998) has focused on innovation networks as a determinant of innovation with associated knowledge flows. The network innovation model from collaborative economy studies in sustainable innovation examines the issue of fostering sustainable innovation across a region. However, the situation in a rapidly changing local economy means that innovation change is very complex. Understanding the features of the space in which innovation occurs is a key to enhance regional innovation potential, particularly in modern ‘mega city regions’ where space is not easily separated from external influences (Hall and Pain 2006). Few empirical analyses regarding spatial innovation model requirements have been conducted. In particular, the influence of space on knowledge flows that lead to innovation have not been analyzed empirically to determine the actual relationship between network space and innovation. On the other hand, there are many policies for encouraging innovation in various aspects of regional development. The OECD (2009) has reviewed methods for transforming spaces within regional innovation clusters while various other actors have implemented these ideas. The Netherlands and Germany have developed the regional innovation system as a central element in their long-term regional spatial planning programs. More specifically Korea has developed a regional innovation system as part of its regional development vision, 2003–2008 (APCTT-ESCAP 2011). Similarly, Japan’s innovation systems are discussed in terms of regional specific industrial policy and local industrial clusters. This study focuses on the similarities and differences in innovation policies and the spatial innovation models used in Korea and Japan. Korea and Japan are similar in promoting innovation system, but they differ in terms of the method of distribution and promotion of policy. Korea has promoted the theme of ‘centralization and selection’ while Japan maintains its traditional distribution strategy. Despite this governmental and agency concern in fostering innovation, this top–down implementation has not achieved the expected results. This study takes an empirical approach by analyzing both formation factors and the actual situation of the spatial structures of innovation networks in Japan and Korea. Comparing Japan and Korea, who have similar socio-economic conditions but different innovation policy, allows an investigation of networks with structural and spatial differences and their related challenges in regional planning.",5
1.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,09 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-017-0039-z,Assessing adaptive capacity during the drought period in the Murray–Darling Basin,April 2017,Yogi Vidyattama,Leonie J. Pearson,Itismita Mohanty,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The ability of communities to adapt to difficult climatic conditions has played a significant role in determining the vulnerability of a community in the long term (Adger et al. 2007). This ability to adapt varies by community (Kelly and Adger 2000; Smit and Wandel 2006). McLeman (2010) argues that this adaptive capacity is “closely linked to social, economic, political, institutional, and cultural processes”. The various communities in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia’s largest river basin, are examples of how different communities have adapted to a long period of drought. This study aims to investigate the adaptive capacity of different communities in the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) throughout the ‘Millennium’ drought. Droughts are an increasing focus of research due to their impact on agriculture and communities and research into the impact of drought has informed policies in many countries (e.g. Banerjee et al. 2013). Recent work on the impact of drought (i.e. impact of prolonged periods of higher temperatures and decreases in water availability) has identified lasting impacts on the social-ecological system resulting in ecosystem disturbances (Banerjee et al. 2013), economic losses (Salami et al. 2009) and livelihood change (Reece and Haribabu 2007) in both developed and developing countries (Dijk et al. 2013). This paper builds on a new area of research focusing on the recognition of community or regional adaptive capacity. This emerging field is outlined in a recent work undertaken in the Murray–Darling Basin in Australia, principally focused on irrigation users and communities as discussed in Kirby et al. (2014) and Marsden Jacobs Associates et al. (2010). We extend this work by clearly focusing on the absolute capacity of the human system as a critically important characteristic to understand how a system reacts to changed climatic conditions (see O’Brien et al. 2004; Pearson et al. 2011 for this discussion). By undertaking this work, we hope to better inform future drought management in similar communities both in Australia and internationally. We will achieve this by addressing the following research question: What are the dynamics of adaptive capacity in agricultural areas such as the Murray–Darling Basin during long periods of drought? To answer this question, this paper is structured as follows. The next sub-sections review the literature on drought in the MDB area and on measuring adaptive capacity. Section 2 discusses the data and methodology. Section 3 discusses the results and Sect. 4 concludes this study. The Murray–Darling Basin is economically, socially and environmentally important to Australia (Rao et al. 2015). The MDB covers over 1 million km2 covering a catchment area of 23 rivers and tributaries and supports a population of about 2.5 million people, including Australia’s capital city, Canberra. With almost 40% of Australia’s farmers residing in the MDB, the basin produces 14% of Australia’s total agricultural production and around one-third of Australia’s food supply. The MDB experienced drought during the first decade of the new millennium (the start of the twenty-first century), measured as an uninterrupted series of years with below median rainfall. CSIRO (2010) noted that there was a dry spell from 1997 to 2009 with the driest period in reliable climate records. Rainfall fell by 11.4% in Southeast Australia where the basin is located, and in the basin the fall was 13%. Emerging analysis and research have revealed that most of the basin was in severe drought over this whole period (see Dijk et al. 2013, Kirby et al. 2014). As the streamflow in the overall basin system was down by 44%, this drought brought many consequences for the ecosystems (Murphy and Timbal 2007), the economy (Kirby et al. 2014) and society (Berry et al. 2010). Kirby et al. (2014) show the reduction in the production of cotton, rice, dairy and meat in the area during the drought followed by a reduction in employment, especially in the cotton and dairy industry. This reduction not only affected the MDB region, but also affected the food supply of Australia as well as the rest of the world (Qureshi et al. 2013). The impact on the local economy was much stronger with a reduction in the gross regional product as well as a decrease in employment (Wittwer and Griffith 2011). Although there was an observed impact on the economy in terms of reduced total gross product and employment, the analysis of the impact of drought on the overall socioeconomic condition of the area is still limited, despite a strong argument on the negative effect of drought on mental health, physical health, the environment, and people’s livelihood (Berry et al. 2010). Key exceptions are Loch et al. (2012) who considered water for environmental purposes and farm viability and Kirby et al. (2014) who looked at irrigator preferences and governance sequencing. It is important to note that there were changes in the overall Australian macroeconomic condition over the period of the drought that could also have affected the adaptive capacity in various areas of the basin. The overall structural change in the economy is one aspect that is likely to affect the adaptive capacity in this rural area. Australia has moved from a primary industry orientation with agriculture accounting for around one-third of the output in the nineteenth century to a predominantly manufacturing industry in the 1960s to a mainly service sector today (Connolly and Lewis 2010). The period 2001–2011 also saw the global financial crisis which started in 2008, in which countries such as Spain and Italy had GDP lowered by more than 5% in that year. The Australian economy experienced positive growth over this same period, although the unemployment rate jumped from 4.5% in 2008 to around 6% in 2009. This unemployment rate was much lower than that of most OECD countries (Junankar 2013). However, it shows that the changes in adaptive capacity measured in this work may not only be due to the drought, but may also be due to overall changes in the economy. A region’s capacity to adapt to extreme conditions such as drought is a contested issue. We see adaptive capacity as the ability to respond to external stimuli to take advantage of the opportunities or moderate the damages (adapted from Gallopin 2006; Brooks et al. 2005). Smit and Wandel (2006) outline the key criteria for capacity within a contextualised understanding of adaptation. To summarise, the overall adaptive capacity is context specific and varies by place, scale and entity. We recognise that all aspects of adaptive capacity are interdependent and as such are related to the degree that humans are embedded within the environmental system’s resources and processes (Adger 2003; Pelling and High 2005; McLeman and Smit 2006). Extensive work has been undertaken on the measurement of adaptive capacity. Eakin and Lemos (2006) have identified seven domains of adaptive capacity—human capital, information and technology, material resources and infrastructure, organisation and social capital, political capital, wealth and financial capital, institutions and entitlements. The work by Gilbert and McLeman (2010) found that the economic capital, social capital and human capital are the significant factors in the capacity to adapt of rural households in Alberta, Canada. These determinates are based on the livelihood approach to capacity (O’Brien et al. 2004) and are critically important for large heterogeneous studies in which the magnitude and direction of each determinate change significantly. Hill and Engle (2013) point out that the important component is the understanding of how the combinations of human, social, natural, physical and financial capacities are able to anticipate and cope with the extreme conditions. They highlight the two main challenges—the tension of various approaches for different scales of government or community and the integration and flexibility across the different indicators of adaptive capacity (Hill and Engle 2013). Stenekes et al. (2012) further point out that there is also the issue of whether to look at the adaptive capacity of the individual unit like the person or household or the capacity of the area as a whole. The point of differentiation between the previous studies and this work is that we endeavour to apply the framework as the construct for a quantitative index of capacity to various communities in the MDB at a relatively small area scale and at different points in time surrounding the drought. The approach uses principal component analysis, which means each indicator is assigned a weight, and the different points of time would also mean the relationship between the variables could be different resulting in different weights. Nelson et al. (2010) argued that the various weights tell a story about how adaptive capacity is constructed differently at different time periods. In addition, this work allows us to observe changes in adaptive capacity over time. This is an important contribution as there is lack of assessment on the impact of adaptive capacity using cross-sectional and time series data (Stenekes et al. 2012).",1

It is especially focused on India, but our analysis applies to developing countries in the Asia–Pacific and other regions as well. The world is urbanizing fast; more than 54% of the population lives in cities and towns. The Asia–Pacific region is at the forefront of the urban revolution sweeping across the developing world. While the global urban population increased from 2856 million in 2000 to 3880 million in 2014, urban population in the Asia–Pacific region went up from 1440 million to 2070 million between the 2 years (Table 1). Half of the region’s population is expected to be urban by 2018. Between 1980 and 2010, the region’s cities experienced an increase of about one billion people; they will witness an addition of another one billion by 2040. The region currently has 17 megacities, including the three largest globally: Tokyo (38 million), Delhi (25 million) and Shanghai (23 million). The next largest megacity in the region, namely Mumbai, is the sixth most populous city globally, with 21 million people in 2014. By 2030, the Asia–Pacific region is likely to have 22 megacities. By 2050, cities in China and India alone would have added 696 million—India, 404 million and China, 292 million (United Nations 2015, UNESCAP 2015). Numbers such as these have serious implications for housing, basic services and infrastructure. They reflect the magnitude of the challenges faced by planners, policy-makers and administrators in Asia–Pacific countries. While developing countries in the Asia–Pacific region are faced with enormous ‘backlog’ and ‘current’ needs of affordable housing and basic services, the ‘growth’ demand from the numbers to be added to cities and towns in the coming decades is mind-boggling. Accommodating them with housing and civic services is going to be a daunting task. Paradoxically, while cities in the region, as elsewhere in the world, are the engines of economic growth and wealth creation, they are subject to ‘exclusionary’ urbanization. The rapid strides in economic growth in Asia–Pacific countries due to globalization and structural transformation have led to the emergence of a thriving middle class, numbering almost 2 billion people. But, the region is still home to the largest urban slum population and the biggest concentration of urban poor in the world (UNESCAP 2015). Asia has 60% of the world’s slum population. According to the World Bank, 758 million people in Asia live below the $1.25 international poverty line. The slum-dwellers and the urban poor are subject to utter deprivation reflected in residential, occupational and social exclusion (Joshi and Sanga 2009; Darshini et al. 2009; Mohanty 2014). Considering the massive problems of urban poverty, slums, housing and exclusion, countries across the Asia–Pacific region have initiated affordable housing programs for the urban poor, including slum-dwellers. For example, the Government of India launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in 2005 with a focus on citywide infrastructure and basic services to the poor. The Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) and Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP) components of JNNURM aimed at providing a garland of seven services to the urban poor: land tenure, affordable housing, water, sanitation, education, health and social security—called the 7-Point Charter. The programs targeted the construction of 1.5 million houses for them through public sector-led housing, a target which could not be achieved in 10 years. In 2015, BSUP and IHSDP have given way to a new national mission called Housing for All by 2022. A general observation on affordable housing initiatives launched by India and other developing countries is that they are government-led, not market-driven. They fall far short of the need. They have also not been able to make the desired qualitative impacts on the lives of the marginalized sections in cities. Many houses constructed by governments for the urban poor are also far away from the centers of livelihoods. Further, policies and programs have not addressed the root cause behind the lack of affordability in housing. The urban poor in India, as in other Asia–Pacific countries, are not only weeded out of the land and housing markets, they are also excluded from the urban planning process. This dual deprivation lies at the heart of the affordable housing problem. Ironically, the ‘master plans’ of cities have not been in sync with their income distribution structure. As a result, a quarter of the urban population in India is deprived of ‘legal space’. The housing shortage is estimated at 18.78 million, with 96% of it pertaining to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG) categories (MoHUPA, Government of India 2012). While there are strong reasons to include these segments in urban development processes, global experiences suggests that inclusion will not occur unless it is grounded in the model of urban planning. In this regard, there have been increased attempts in developed countries to create affordable housing as part of developer-led programs based on the instruments of inclusionary zoning (IZ) and inclusionary housing (IH). These instruments include a range of land use and housing policies that aim at capturing the gains from rising land and property values due to urban planning and development. The gains captured are used for creating affordable housing for low or moderate income groups. The literature on the design and functioning of IZ and IH is grossly limited. However, theory and empirical evidence suggest that they are based on sound economics and long-term considerations of social equity and cohesion (Calavita and Mallach 2010; Hickey et al. 2014; Jacobus 2015). Research reveals that in many developing countries, including Asia–Pacific countries, inclusionary zoning and housing programs have not met with much success. This is primarily due to the fact that unlike the IZ/IH models practiced in developed countries, they did not link the provision of land and affordable housing to the poor to incentives to landowners or developers. The Town Planning Scheme (TPS) in Gujarat, India, however, incorporates inclusion into the urban planning model with incentives to stakeholders. The landowners are incentivized to pool land under the TPS as they benefit from increased value of land due to spatial planning and infrastructure development. The TPS earmarks up to 10% of undeveloped land for housing the socially and economically weaker sections (SEWS). It also makes urbanization self-financing—with no burden on the public exchequer. The success of TPS, practiced over decades, suggests that inclusionary zoning/housing can be designed combining both efficiency and equity objectives. Inclusion works when rooted in the processes of urban land and housing markets and urban planning to correct for market failure. Private landowners and developers need to be roped into take up affordable housing as a business proposition with incentives provided by the planning system. Policy-makers and planners may consider planned urban development as a process of value creation through the market, giving ample scope for value capture and recycling to promote inclusive urbanization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 highlights the issues of affordable housing in India. Section 3 presents the economic case for inclusionary zoning and housing. Section 4 describes inclusionary zoning and housing practices adopted by countries around the world to promote inclusion of the poor in urban land and housing markets. Section 5 provides directions for reforms to promote affordable housing through the market place in Asia–Pacific countries, including India. Section 6 deals with the agenda for inclusive cities and concludes.",7

Japan, which suffers from a shortage of minerals and energy and depends on imports for its primary energy needs, has been preparing to reopen nuclear power stations since 2015. The input–output model is a tractable tool to describe industrial linkages and contributions to regional economies. We examine the economic effects of production in zones surrounding the Hamaoka nuclear power station in Shizuoka Prefecture before and after a natural disaster interrupts its operations. We incorporate a hypothetical extraction method into the regional input–output framework. Using a regional input–output model and GIS employment data for Shizuoka Prefecture, we calculate and compare the effects of backward and forward linkages along different sizes of the station’s zone. We aggregate zone-specific data into a region and incorporate them into the regional input–output model. Then, we estimate economic damage from a natural disaster that interrupts production in a selected area. By measuring zones of different estimated sizes, we can measure consequences and their density functions. We derive and compare density functions of the effects of backward and forward linkages. We assess the economic implications on zones surrounding the nuclear power station. Results indicate that a production stoppage along the zone generates large indirect negative effects on the regional economy. Our results suggest that disaster prevention and recovery policies should consider industrial structures and their economic implications in zones surrounding nuclear power stations. This area-based approach is useful in evaluating the economic impacts of nuclear power stations and analyzing economic losses from natural disasters in a specific area. Economic damage from natural disasters can be either direct or indirect. Direct damage typically involves labor and capital stock, and indirect damage arises from damage to capital stock. Indirect damage includes monetary effects mediated by the market and external effects not mediated by the market. Field surveys and questionnaires are generally used to ascertain direct damages after a natural disaster. As it is difficult to measure the economic ripple effects of a disaster, indirect damage is measured using economic and cost-benefit models (Kunreuther and Rose 2004, Taniguchi 1998). Damage that extends beyond a single region is analyzed while taking into account feedback and spillovers between regions. The sensitivity of spatial distribution of natural disaster’s damages and economic hot spots are evaluated using spatially disaggregated economic models (Cole 1998, Yamano et al. 2007). The dynamic process of a disaster is investigated using the sequential interindustry model (Okuyama and Chang 2004, Okuyama et al. 2004). Additionally, a methodology has been developed that combines an input–output model and the hypothetical extraction method that evaluates how loss of production affects identified sectors (Miller and Lahr 2001, Miller and Blair 2009). The method is extended for a partial extraction (Dietzenbacher and Lahr 2013). Following the Great East Japan Earthquake, studies have again recognized the importance of the effects of supply constraint, and extensive research examines forward linkages to measure supply-side effects when economic activity ceases after a disaster (Shimoda and Fujioka 2012). In his pioneering study, Toyoda’s (1996) questionnaire survey estimated flow damage during the period that production ceased and used an input–output model to estimate direct and indirect damage caused by reduction in capital stock. Tokunaga and Okiyama (2014) use an applied general equilibrium model to quantitatively analyze indirect damage attributable to the Great East Japan Earthquake. To construct measures to prevent and mitigate potential damage from future natural disasters and to aid in early disaster recovery and restoration, an advance assessment is necessary. Prevention and mitigation measures can reduce human suffering following natural disasters, which involve regional characteristics and perhaps periodicity (World Bank and United Nations 2010). However, there is a trade-off between human suffering and economic damage. Moreover, we cannot expect to eliminate all economic damage; therefore, it is necessary to estimate direct and indirect costs and the extent of damage before and after disasters. Additionally, it is important to measure economic effects pre- and post-disaster from the viewpoint of allocating investment in disaster prevention and mitigation effectively and in recovery and reconstruction (Shibusawa and Miyata 2011). Evaluating economic and environmental impacts is critical for nuclear power stations. Manuel and James (1979) evaluate the economic and environmental effects of the construction and operation of a nuclear power facility on a given region. They analyze changes in output, employment, pollution levels, water usage, and local government budgets using the extended input–output model. Lewis (1985) evaluates the impact on employment to analyze the extent to which one nuclear power station generates economic benefits for its host economy and how extensively they change after its closure. Jang et al. (2011) evaluate the economic costs of a severe accident at a Korean nuclear power station using probabilistic cost assessment, focusing on the costs of evacuation and radiological health effects. Silva et al. (2012) estimate two kinds of accident costs—cost per server accident and cost per kWh—in a virtual nuclear power plant to assess the consequences of severe accidents. Park (2005) estimates damage costs following an accident at a nuclear power station and indicates that they may exceed the upper bound of the rule on compensation for nuclear damage. Yonemoto (2016) evaluated the changes in the backward-linkage effects within the six regions of the Fukushima prefecture for 3 years following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake using the multi-regional input–output tables. We propose a method for measuring the economic effects of backward and forward linkages among production activities of companies in the zones surrounding the Hamaoka nuclear power station. In conjunction with adjusting the size of the surrounding zone, this study measures the economic ripple effects of production during normal periods and once activities have ceased owing to disaster. It does so using a regional input–output table and the number of employees per district in surrounding municipalities. Section 2 describes our method for measuring the economic effects using the Shizuoka Prefecture input–output table and the number of employees per district in surrounding zones. Section 3 discusses the measurement of economic effects on zones surrounding the nuclear power plant during normal times. Section 4 describes the economic effects caused by stopping production in the surrounding zones. Section 5 considers the effects on the regional economy if the zone where production ceases expands. Section 6 concludes.",4

Batabyal,Hamid Beladi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"According to Lund (1984), the term “remanufacturing” refers to an industrial process in which worn-out products are restored to like-new condition. This researcher goes on to point out that in remanufacturing, a series of industrial processes, often taking place in a factory environment, leads to the full disassembly of a discarded product. Next, usable parts are cleaned, refurbished, and put into inventory. The product is then reassembled from the old parts—and sometimes new parts as well—to produce a unit that is fully equivalent and sometimes superior in performance and average lifetime to the original new product. In the United States, in contemporary times, two reasons account for the salience of remanufacturing. First, on the regulatory side, in an attempt to curtail injurious environmental outcomes, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken some practical steps. In this regard, it is worth accentuating the agency’s implementation in 1995 of the “Comprehensive Procurement Guideline.” Inter alia, this guideline sought to cut waste and promote resource conservation by making sure that materials collected in recycling programs would be used again to manufacture new products.Footnote 1 Second, there are the actual cost savings experienced by firms. To see this, consider the following two examples from Mitra and Webster (2008). These researchers have noted that in 1997, Ford was able to avoid the disposal of more than 67,700 lb of toner cartridges and thus saved $180,000 in disposal costs. Similarly, in 1995, Union Carbide saved $75,000 by avoiding disposal costs. Given the growing salience of remanufacturing from both an environmental and a practical perspective, a growing literature has now begun to examine the nature and the desirability of this industrial process from different vantage points. We now briefly survey this literature. Simplifying matters just a little, we can look at remanufacturing either from the perspective of firms or from that of consumers. Let us concentrate on firms first. Lebreton and Tuma (2006) study remanufacturing in the context of the disposal of 600,000 tons of used tires in Germany. On the basis of their analysis, these researchers point to specific factors that are likely to elevate remanufacturing rates in this country. Ferrer and Swaminathan (2006) analyze the competition between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)Footnote 2 and an independent operator (IO). In a multi-period setting, the IO may intercept cores of products made by the OEM to sell remanufactured products in subsequent time periods. These researchers show that when the threat of competition rises, the OEM is more likely to fully utilize all available cores and offer the remanufactured product itself, at a lower price. Do remanufactured products cannibalize new product sales? This question has been analyzed by Atasu et al. (2010) who show that a product portfolio that includes both new and remanufactured products can make it likely for a firm to get to additional market segments and thereby block competition from new low-end products or third-party remanufacturers. New and remanufactured goods are often sold in the same market and, therefore, it makes sense to consider them together in the design of a product line. Aydin et al. (2015) adopt this last point of view and set forth a new methodology that permits them to compute the maximum profit and the market share associated with a product line. Shi et al. (2015) study the stability of the Nash equilibrium arising in the game between an OEM and a remanufacturer. They show that a higher willingness-to-pay (WTP) on the part of consumers can either fortify or weaken the stability of the relevant Nash equilibrium. Even so, a higher WTP always hurts the OEM and benefits the remanufacturer. Finally, Batabyal and Beladi (2016a) is the only paper we are aware of that has analyzed the competitive interaction between an OEM and a remanufacturer when the goal of both firms is to use expenditures on product development to capture a dominant share of the market in which they are operating. We now discuss remanufacturing from the perspective of consumers. In this regard, note that just as firms can take actions to increase their market share, for any good such as a cell phone, consumers can also influence the market shares obtained by an OEM and a remanufacturer through their purchases of one or the other kind of good. Having said this, to the best of our knowledge, Batabyal and Beladi (2016b) is the only paper to have conducted a game-theoretic analysis of the strategic interaction between two types of consumers who, with their individual purchase decisions, attempt to raise the market share of either new or remanufactured toner cartridges. In the course of their analysis, these two researchers note that one way to extend the analysis in their paper would be to analyze a game in which the firms that produce the new and the remanufactured goods are able to influence consumer preferences by advertising the relative strengths of their goods. Several researchers such as Giuntini and Gaudette (2003) and Hong et al. (2015) have recognized the importance of advertising in making consumers aware of the properties of both new and remanufactured goods. Even so, as these and other researchers have pointed out, there is very little theoretical research on advertising and its effects in the context of remanufacturing. Given this lacuna in the literature, in this paper, we analyze the hitherto unstudied strategic interaction between a new good producer and a remanufacturer who use negative advertising on television (TV) to compete for a greater share of the market for a particular good. Section 2.1 describes the simple static game modelFootnote 3 in which an OEM and a remanufacturer choose how much negative advertising time to buy simultaneously. Government regulations limit the total amount of negative advertising time either firm can buy.Footnote 4 Section 2.2 provides the normal form representation of the game between the two rival firms. Section 2.3 specifies the best response functions of the two firms. Section 2.4 first determines the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game under study and then points out that this equilibrium is unique. Section 2.5 ascertains the amount of negative advertising time the two firms would buy if they could come to a binding agreement to curtail this kind of advertising. Finally, Sect. 3 concludes and then discusses two ways in which the research described in this paper might be extended.",

In general, with more people concerned about protecting the environment at both local and global levels, dependence on vehicular transportation in cities has brought about problems. Too much dependence on autos causes air pollution, which has detrimental health effects. Traffic congestion wastes time, money, and energy. The most troubling issue related to continuing dependence on car use, however, is global warming. To implement transport policies conducive to creating a sustainable environment, it is necessary to measure correctly the external costs of vehicular transport, such as traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, global warming, and traffic congestion. In Japan, it is expected that highway costs be paid by road users through highway tolls. Using a data set from Japan, this paper aims to estimate the external costs of vehicular transport on highways and to evaluate how extensive these external costs are by comparing, for example, highway tolls, operating costs of highways, and GDP. Our study has several distinguishing characteristics. The most important is that we estimate each individual highway’s external costs by considering specific vehicle transport characteristics of highways, such as average speed at the peak period, total traffic volume, types of vehicular transport, and so on. Second, this study distinguishes five kinds of external costs of vehicular transport for individual highways in Japan: (1) traffic accidents; (2) air pollution; (3) noise; (4) global warming; and (5) traffic congestion. Third, using a data set of over 100 individual highways in Japan in 2005, we analyze the relationship between the external costs of vehicular transport and traffic volumes in general. As far as we know, there is no previous research investigating, through a large number of observations, the magnitude of the external costs of highways. Finally, for the purpose of creating prudent transport policy, we assess the magnitude of external costs by comparing highway fares, the degree of GDP, the fuel tax level, and other factors. To attain the objectives mentioned above, we organize our study as follows. After the introduction, in Sect. 2, the previous literature is summarized. In Sect. 3, after explaining the research framing of this study based on theory related to external costs, we explain our method and basic formula for estimating the external costs of road transportation (highways). In Sect. 4, we describe specific equations for the five main categories of highways’ external costs. The main methodology follows Mizutani et al. (2011), the main difference being that this study is concerned with highways, while Mizutani et al. (2011) focuses on traffic in cities. Therefore, some equations for the estimation of external costs are different here. In Sect. 5, the observations of highways and main data sources are explained. In Sect. 6, based on these equations, we use a data set for highways in Japan to estimate the external costs of vehicular transport on highways. In this section, by comparing highway tolls, GDP and so on, we evaluate how extensive highways’ external costs actually are. Furthermore, we investigate the regional disparity in the external costs of highways. In the concluding remarks of the last section, we summarize our major findings and describe implications for policy makers regarding regions and transport systems.",1

To increase adaptive capabilities of rice crops with such diversity, Asian rice culture has developed irrigated cultural systems for managing water environment suitable for crop growth (Kaida 1991). Establishing such a system generally involves extensive civil-engineering works including construction of a network of irrigation infrastructures such as dams, farm ponds and canals; improving and compacting farmland soils with soil amendments; and leveling off undulated paddy fields to hold surface water during rice cultivation. Likewise, irrigated rice culture systems across the river plains of Japan have gradually expanded over the centuries through close cooperation of civil engineering and farming. During the last century, this has evolved into a unique set of academic disciplines and public-work sectors for developing irrigated agriculture, which extensively incorporates modern agronomy and civil engineering and is distinguished from other types of public works (hereafter “PW”) (Ueda 1999). In recent decades, the discipline has expanded to include rural infrastructure development, and culminated in Agricultural Infrastructure Improvement and Rural Development (hereafter “A&R”) Projects under the auspice of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFF). From these historical backgrounds, construction activities for “A&R” infrastructure may have a different technological structure from more usual types of PW like road construction. Furthermore, “A&R” is known to exert unique benefits on an economy, both directly and indirectly, after the completion of construction stage. “A&R” will not only enhance sustainable agricultural production, but also supply various external benefits including flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, erosion prevention, preservation of aquatic ecosystems, enhancing recreational and cultural functions of farmlands and rural areas, among others (MAFF 2003). These distinctive characteristics of “A&R” warrant analyzing economic and environmental impacts of undertaking “A&R” and compare them with other types of PW, although this study alone cannot investigate all the relevant aspects, because we are going to limit the scope of study to the construction phase of PW. Thus, the following literature reviews are mainly focused on the construction aspects of PW to avoid stretching the arguments too far. From an economic perspective, one of the major objectives of implementing PW is to stimulate the regional economy where the project is undertaken. Therefore, many studies have investigated the impacts of PW on regional economies using the interregional input–output (IRIO) analysis. This analysis is useful for evaluating interregional spillover (leakage) effects and hence the net economic impact to a regional economy. Japan has an advantage for conducting IRIO analyses on PW, because the national government has consistently developed IRIO tables comprising 9 regions as well as various input–output (IO) tables that describe construction sectors in detail. Therefore, Katada et al. (1997) studied the efficacy of PW as an economic stimulus using the “Construction IO” (described in Sect. 2) at the national level, and revealed that the efficacy had declined during the last decades. Similarly, Takabayashi and Shimoyama (2005) investigated the output and employment effects of PW using IRIO, and revealed both effects were in decline partly because of mechanization of the sector. Ishikawa et al. (1996) developed an IRIO table featuring 47 prefectures across Japan and detailed descriptions of PW that enabled analyses of more detailed interregional relationships of industries. Using this technique, Ishikawa and Miyagi (2003–2004) revealed that the output effect could spill over into distant prefectures, especially large metropolitan areas like Tokyo. From the viewpoint of environmental impacts, one of the major concerns for PW is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, because PW may affect climate change not only at the initial construction activities of large facilities, but also afterward, when infrastructure facilities remain for many years causing long-lasting effects (IPCC 2014). Abe et al. (2002–2003) examined distributions of GHG emissions across sectors and regions using IRIO, and showed the construction sector emitted 1.5% of the national total in 1995. Nakamura et al. (2012a, b) investigated GHG reduction effects of wooden biomass energy production projects using regional IOs, and revealed the projects contributed to the mitigation of interregional inequalities through trading CO2 credits. Kunimitsu and Ueda (2013) investigated bio-ethanol production from rice straw in Vietnam and concluded that larger benefits in GHG reduction could be achieved if advanced technologies were employed. Many other studies have similarly investigated GHG emissions or reductions from various renewable energy projects with IO. Meanwhile, among studies focusing on the construction sector, Acquaye and Duffy (2010) investigated GHG emissions for the Irish construction sector at the national level, and proposed the procurement of construction materials that satisfied low emission standards. Nässén et al. (2007) investigated GHG emissions for the Swedish building sector, and found discrepancies between the results from IO analysis and the bottom–up Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach. However, research focusing on the GHG emissions from PW is still scarce, partly because of the diversity of activities accompanying PW, which potentially makes the bottom–up LCA approach rather complicated. In this regard, evaluating GHG emissions with an IO analysis has advantages in simplicity of methods for dealing with complex activities by aggregating them into an industrial “sector”, as well as direct linkage to a wealth of interindustry databases compiled by public authorities. Looking over the above literature, the Japanese studies mostly employed national/interregional IOs and/or the Construction IOs published by the Japanese government. However, these tables lack detailed information on the A&R projects mentioned earlier. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the detailed economic and environmental impacts of such projects at the regional scale by incorporating some unpublished datasets into the published IRIO tables. In addition, to complement the little available information on GHG emissions from PW in general, we also employ a part of the Construction IO to compare emissions (as well as economic impacts) among various kinds of PW. By integrating the above data sources, we aim to compile an extended IRIO table that incorporates regionally differentiated PW sectors. Alternatively, however, we may as well employ the simplified method of Miyazawa (2002), who suggested that economic impacts of PW could be concisely calculated by first evaluating a vector of final demands by PW, such as concrete and steel, and then pre-multiplying it by the published Leontief inverse matrix comprising standard interindustry sectors. His method, however, requires the evaluation of final demand vector each time an analysis is conducted, and therefore makes regional case studies more complicated. By contrast, the extended IRIO model of our study can automatically compute differentiated impacts on regional economies more straightforwardly by inputting just the total outputs of various types of PW. This advantage will be particularly relevant in Sect. 3.4 where scenario analyses are conducted. Furthermore, although this study limits the scope to the construction stage of PW and leaves out the life cycle impacts after completion of facilities, it provides the first step towards evaluating total effects of PW on a regional economy and climate change. Therefore, our approach will make future advancements in this direction easier, because further extensions can be made with the IRIO table to incorporate “infrastructure management” along with “infrastructure development” sectors, enabling the evaluation of life-cycle impacts through an integrated procedure.",3

Moreover, we tend to consider that democracy receives stronger approval in societies that respect the fundamental values and principles of modern civil society, such as human rights, rule of law, and freedom of speech. One common implicit premise of the concept of “democratization” is that the individuals that trust the “modern democratic values” previously mentioned should be the foremost supporters of democracy. However, if we allow democracy to simply mean that a majority rules, we often observe examples of the demand for democracy being not fully rooted in well-founded civil societies, at least from the perspective of western-world civil societies. In 2011, the relatively secular autocratic government in Egypt was replaced by a “democratic” regime led by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party in the Arab world that had been oppressed under the incumbent regime. However, because suspicion exists that the Muslim Brotherhood is connected to ideological extremism, the principles of such Islamist parties are not generally considered to be fully congruent with the western values of civil societies. In general, newly born democracies are unstable and often overthrown by incumbent establishments, such as the military and royal families. However, a compelling explanation for the rapid decline in the Muslim Brotherhood’s rule in Egypt is that it lacked endorsements from a broad range of constituencies, which should include secular and liberal citizens. The observation of Arab Spring and the subsequent political chaos in some countries tell us that the simple assumption of democratization previously mentioned might be too optimistic and suggests that arguments over democratization or, more generally, studies on the endogenous transition of political regimes, should pay more attention to the issues of religion and secularism. This is the central motivation of the present paper. This paper develops a theory of endogenous political transitions and cultural transmission, and analyzes how the cultural value of secularism evolves and declines in a society, interacting with changes in political regimes between democracy and dictatorship. Each of the main building blocks of the model is inspired by preceding contributions. First, individuals are heterogeneous in their private and social attitudes toward the use of “civil liberties”. Typically, “religious” individuals negatively value divorce, abortion, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, whereas “secular” individuals are in favor, or tolerant, of them. Moreover, we consider that civil liberties are referred to in every possible social and economic issue on which evaluations contrast between two types of individuals. As in Esteban et al. (2015b), the degree of liberties allowed for each citizen is restricted by a legal cap (limitation), and a democratic government with secular citizens in the majority adopts more tolerant and liberal caps than a government with religious citizens in the majority. In this paper, the attitude of a dictatorial government toward civil liberties is a debatable point. It would be too hasty to conclude that a repressive dictatorial regime should impose a more severe cap on liberties to prevent the regime from being overturned. Some issues related to civil liberties, such as gender equality, are highly related to the economic scopes of individuals’ lives, especially for secular individuals. Too severe a cap may badly damage the economic fundamentals of a nation. To the extent that economic prosperity is a non-negligible concern for a dictatorial government, such as through the need to increase the tax bases, we could justify that dictatorships have a more liberal government than religious democracies. This is especially true when the degree of religious intolerance in a society is substantially high. Second, the framework for analyzing political regime changes and an endogenously evolving political culture is motivated by Ticchi et al. (2013). Given opportunities for regime switches (coups against democracy and rebellions against dictatorships), the results of the political struggles depend on the extent to which citizens are mobilized to protect or establish democracy. In Ticchi et al. (2013), democracy is more likely to win as the population that stays committed to democracy increases, and this relationship is monotonic. In their framework, citizens activated for democracy are implicitly assumed to be more socialized to modern civic values. Therefore, they can simply conclude that the values of modern civil society always consolidate democracy. However, in this paper, secular citizens who should be more familiar with modern values face a tradeoff between secular dictatorship and religious democracy. This dilemma complicates the relationship between the support for democracy and the diffusion of secularism. Third, the attitudes toward civil liberties evolve from generation to generation, according to a cultural transmission process as described by Bisin and Verdier (2001). Through this process, children acquire preferences for civil liberties either from their paternalistic parents’ socialization efforts or through contacts with random “role models” from the entire population. The evolutionary process of secularization is studied in Bar-El et al. (2013), which also applies the framework of Bisin and Verdier (2001). However, in addition to families and society, we assume that the government can intervene in this socialization process through the contents of a school education and that this public intervention is politically determined by political regimes. A democratic government with religious citizens in the majority would make pro-religious interventions, leading to a remarkable feature of the model: it is possible that secularization expands under a secular dictatorship and shrinks under democracy when secular citizens are not the majority. Given the significant possibility that secular citizens stand on the side of a secular dictatorship, the combination of the diffusion of secularism and regime switching can exhibit an interesting trajectory. Anti-secularization under a religious democracy and secularization under a secular dictatorship could alternately emerge. Unless the number of secular citizens in a population approaches a majority, a cycle of secularism accompanied by political regime switches continues. Paradoxically, to foster a society’s stable secular ground, the nation needs to maintain a secular dictatorship for a long period. Then, the nation can consolidate democracy once its regime changes. However, if the instability of political regimes is potentially inherent in the nation, it is more likely to be trapped into such a weaker secularization cycle. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an overview of the related literature. Section 3 presents the basic model and Sect. 4 describes the political equilibria during a period with a fixed political regime. Section 5 considers political regime transitions, and Sect. 6 describes the cultural transmission of preferences for civil liberties. Section 7 characterizes the combined dynamics of secularism and political regimes, and the final section concludes.",2

Analysing spatial compliance patterns for the case of transparency legislation in China,October 2017,Stefan Brehm,Jesper Svensson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Political and economic objectives during early stages of industrial development often are at odds with a firm regulatory commitment to protect the environment from excessive industrial pollution and resource exploitation (Grossman and Krueger 1991; Stern et al. 1996; Olson 1963). Turning points may be reached when a rising middle-class prepares to organize against vested economic interests (Rock 2002; Tsang and Lee 2013; Foster 2014); when pollution related health problems and human misery begin to destabilize the social and public order (Deng and Yang 2013; Johnson 2013); or when clean technologies become easily and cheaply available (Kemp and Soete 1992; Antle and Heidebrink 1995; Tester and Langridge 2010). The shift towards sustainable production is a slow moving process, which gradually permeates certain sectors or regions. Yet, the technological and institutional change synchronizing ecological preservation and economic development is not inevitable and there are many factors that may enable or constrain this process (Boyd and Folke 2011). From a regulatory perspective one of the most fundamental issues concerns the appropriate level of government overseeing and enforcing environmental standards (Oates and Schwab 1988; Wellisch 1995; Sigman 2014). Centralized regulation can be futile particularly in vast territorial states that feature a high degree of economic, social, and political heterogeneity. By contrast, decentralized regional standards overcome the “one-size-fits-all” problem but at the same time incentivize jurisdictions to compete for mobile capital by lowering environmental standards in a “race-to-the-bottom” (Engel 1996; Levinson 2003). China is often cited as an example where the devolution of fiscal authority contributed to an unprecedented high-growth period lasting for more than 30 years in concert with large-scale environmental degradation that is threatening the health and livelihood of China’s citizens and beyond (Jahiel 1998, 1997; Stern 2004; Kostka and Mol 2013a). The market preserving federalism literature asserts that local governments in China act as economic facilitators because they are allowed to retain the lion’s share of resulting tax income (Qian and Weingast 1996; Montinola et al. 1995). At the same time, however, streamlining economic incentives with quasi-federalist structures undermined environmental standards even though regulation in this realm remains the prerogative of the Central Government. Ample regulatory space between vague national laws and detailed local implementation guidelines, for instance, allows local governments to hollow out the spirit and guiding principles of environmental regulation. The literature refers to this implementation gap as “local protectionism” because it is assumed that lower government ranks resist national legislation to protect their own economic interests (Van Rooij 2006; Van Rooij and LO 2010). Local governments might even engage in state corroding activities (Cai and Treisman 2004). For instance, they may assist corporations to circumvent costly national environmental requirements through lax regulation, report false data, cover up for pollution, or grant undefined grace periods. Yet State and Party organizations remain strictly centralized, which renders local leaders accountable to their superiors (Blanchard and Shleifer 2001). While this system of basic compliance has been discussed widely in terms of economic decision-making (Zhang 2006; Enikolopov and Zhuravskaya 2007; Xu 2011) it was only recently that researchers extended this view into the field of environmental governance. Studies in this vein call for a revalidation or at least stronger differentiation of the central-local dichotomy (Kostka and Mol 2013b; Li and Higgins 2013; Li et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2013). Several regions and cities embarked on substantial efforts to initiate an ecological turn around. Factors contributing to this shift are political leadership, intensified civic engagement in environmental matters, more effective institutional arrangements for decentred governance, a stronger emphasize on the rule-of-law, and revised criteria for cadre evaluation. The uneven distribution of incentives and opportunities arising from improving environmental governance may translate into divergent compliance patterns. On a general note, there is broad agreement that economic development is a decisive factor shaping environmental governance in China. In addition recent case studies bring to the fore idiosyncratic factors facilitating a policy shift where some municipalities take the lead in ‘turning green’. Yet little is known how cities shape broader patterns of environmental law enforcement. Does economic decentralisation instigate a green divide among Chines urbanities? Or does political centralisation promote inter-jurisdictional convergence? This study seeks to provide some answers for the case of environmental transparency regulations. We review the literature on environmental governance in China and derive three main hypotheses about emerging spatial enforcement patterns. We deploy a spatial Durbin model to analyse data for 126 key environmental protection cities and regional economic hubs between 2010 and 2012. The results give reason to suppose that municipalities within the same province converge towards similar enforcement levels while nation-wide compliance with transparency regulations is becoming increasingly dispersed.",8

China has five layers of government, and each level of government, except the central government, receives financial transfers from the higher ranks of government and distributes the financial transfers to the lower levels of government. This system has operated since China’s national foundation. This system is convenient for us to focus our attention only to central–provincial intergovernmental relations because the central government concerns the transfers only to the provincial level governments.Footnote 1 In other words, the central government need not consider the transfers to lower level governments than provincial levels. As for the central–provincial intergovernmental relations, there were several changes in intergovernmental fiscal transfer systems, such as the fiscal contract systems that existed between 1979 and 1993, and the fiscal sharing system that has existed since 1994. Revenue and expenditure shares have changed dramatically following the decentralization of the 1980s and by revenue recentralization and expenditure decentralization from 1994. Figure 1 illustrates the trends in local government’s shares of revenue and expenditure, both with and without extra budgetary revenues and expenditures.Footnote 2 These historical changes complicate the assignment of central and local government responsibilities. (See, for example, Martinez-Vazquez and Qiao (2011) for a discussion). Trends in budgetary shares based on inclusion of extra budgetary items Several researchers have investigated these historical changes and their determinants. Of course, no researcher can explain these changes consistently or establish a rule in relation to them. Huang and Chen (2012) pointed out that there is no systematic rule for distributing fiscal transfers from the central to provincial governments. As Zhang and Zou (1998) pointed out, variations among provinces are too large to form a simple rule or to introduce some incentive mechanism; for example, based on theoretical insights from fiscal federalism. In this paper, we develop a new approach to analyzing nonsymmetric Nash bargaining. Our approach involves restricting bargaining between the central government and provincial governments over shares of fiscal revenues and expenditures. This simple approach differs from those adopted by researchers on fiscal federalism, or decentralization, but enables us to shed new light on intergovernmental fiscal relationships. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we survey the literature on fiscal federalism, or decentralization, and intergovernmental relationships in China. In Sect. 3, we develop a two-person bargaining game and use its first-order condition to develop a simple econometric model. In Sect. 4, we conduct an empirical investigation. In Sect. 5, we conclude the paper and discuss remaining issues.",1

In Japan, the following two purposes have been proposed.Footnote 2 The first purpose is compensation, or relief for victims. This entails the compensation for the loss of victims by giving them an amount of money commensurate to the loss they suffered. Loss includes not only monetary losses, but also mental losses, such as pain and sorrow. Damages compensating for mental suffering are often called pain and suffering damages or solatium.Footnote 3 The second purpose is deterrence or prevention and punishment. Showing that a case results in the imposition of damages can deter similar kinds of tortious acts in the future. Punishment of tortfeasor occurs by imposing the burden of paying damages.Footnote 4 Related to deterrence and punishment, satisfying a feeling of retribution is mentioned occasionally as a purpose for imposing damages. There has been debate in Japan over which of these two is the main purpose of damages in tort law. This debate is not limited to a descriptive argument over the function that the damages system serves in the real world. It contains a normative argument over what function the damages system should serve and what function we should think it serves.Footnote 5 This kind of normative argument affects the actual legal system in Japan.Footnote 6
 For example, the normative aspect has become one of the obstacles in introducing punitive damages into the civil justice system in Japan. Critics say that the amount of damages is too low in Japan.Footnote 7 In response to such criticism, the introduction of punitive damages has often been proposed. However, many critics argue that punitive damages do not align with the Japanese legal system because the main purpose of damages in Japan is compensation, and importance should not be attached to deterrence and punishment. The courts have also agreed with such arguments.Footnote 8
 However, there is room to introduce punitive damages in the future. In the Justice System Reform Council,Footnote 9 for example, although they said that “the punitive damages system does not align with the Japanese legal system, which rigidly separates civil liability from criminal liability”, they also announced that “the system should be further studied as a future possibility”. Moreover, one member of the council said, “if the way of thinking and values of the people in Japan as a whole change in the future, the contents of damages in civil law will also change”.Footnote 10
 “The way of thinking and values of the people” in the above statement can be seen as attitudes toward punitive damages and the damages system in Japan. The way of thinking and values of the people can affect law and policy. Laws that are not consistent with the values and thinking of the people are not effective and are hardly complied to by the people.Footnote 11
 Nevertheless, the values of the people and their way of thinking about punitive damages and the damages system in Japan has rarely been investigated. The above-mentioned debate about the purpose of damages and punitive damages presents only the views of scholars and the courts. Do ordinary people in Japan also limit the purpose of damages to compensation?Footnote 12 How do they connect the purpose of damages with the amount of damages? In this article, we statistically analyze survey data on damages in Japan and try to examine these questions. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide an overview to tort law in Japan and the US as it is related to our main topic, the purpose of damages. In Sect. 3, we explain the survey design. In Sect. 4, we analyze the data obtained from the survey, and in Sect. 5, we present our conclusions and suggest further research.",1
1.0,2.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,26 October 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-017-0060-2,The soft budget constraint problem and hard budget solution of outward reinsurance markets for providing insurance to local economy against natural disaster,October 2017,Takuya Nakaizumi,Satoru Yano,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Disaster does enormous damage to the regional economy. It often happens among Asian countries. Damages are more severe and continue longer without insurance. Thus, adequate provision of insurance is even necessary for local economies. However, there are few literature studies to consider providing adequate insurance to local or developing economies. In local economy, there might be only small insurance companies with limited fund instead of big insurance companies. And it could be an only insurance provider to help local people against disaster. At first sight that looks helpless against disaster. As it is, if those companies cannot assess international reinsurance market, they might be useless. But if they could, these companies provide enough insurance to support local community against disaster. They can cede the insurance to the other insurance company via international reinsurance market. Thus, access to the international reinsurance market is the first priority. The primary insurance company of the original insurance contracts retain the soundness of management by transferring excess risk that they cannot hold to reinsurers through the reinsurance market. The primary insurance company cannot confirm the underwriting of the original contract until the reinsurance arrangement is completed.Footnote 1 In case the primary insurance company delays in the reinsurance arrangements, they will carry a major part of the risk in management. Thus, the reinsurance market has become indispensable for the primary insurance company, and the conditions for reinsurance coverage presented by the reinsurer to the primary insurance company will affect the conditions for coverage of the original contract. Thus, the insurance market is greatly affected by the reinsurance market. The reinsurance market is said to be based on the mutual trust between the primary insurance companies and the reinsurers, that is, the primary insurance companies examine the risk on the original contract and hold it as their private information. They voluntarily disclose the conditions for coverage of the original contract to the reinsurers (the “Principle of Utmost Good Faith”: the primary insurance company cannot withhold an indication of misrepresentation to the reinsurer when applying for the reinsurance contract, but it is sufficient not to withhold the important facts as well as obligations applicable to the original insurance contract). Reinsurers, on the other hand, unconditionally pay the reinsurance claims based on information provided by the primary insurance companies without conducting on-site surveys of interest or facilities by themselves (the “Follow the Fortune Doctrine”: reinsurers share the destiny of the primary insurance company). Thus, the primary insurance company is expected to properly examine the interests and set conditions for coverage when underwriting the original contract without any additional estimation by the reinsurers. However, in general, if the primary insurance company transfers its risk to others without any additional investigation or obligation, it has no incentive to properly examine the original contract. Any information on the original contract is private information of the primary insurance company, which can cede some favorable conditions on its own because of insufficient information disclosure. Moreover, even if a thorough examination is made, accidents can occur after such examination. Thus, there are often cases of insufficient means to prevent moral hazards based on mere public disclosure information. In such cases, how does the primary insurance company properly underwrite the original contract? Reinsurers have limited assuming capacity. In case a reinsurer is supposed to bear unlimited liability, such as with Lloyd’s, only no limited liability corporation can become a member of it. However, after a traditionally unlimited individual reinsurer (risk underwriter) reached the limit of its assuming capacity, it was allowed to assume under its corporate name with limited liability. In addition, securitization renders the available capital market available larger than a few underwriters transferring risks. The reinsurance market should have some mechanism to solve the asymmetric information problem. By analyzing the mechanism behind the mutual trust relationship between the cedent and reinsurer, the robustness of securing the integrity of the primary insurance company can be established through an efficient reinsurance market and inexpensive insurance. However, previous studies have not considered why “Utmost Good Faith” is established, as in Aase (1993), which describes it simply as, “There is [an] evaluation system and penalties.” In Brandts and Laux (2007), even if the performance of the primary contract is private information and reinsurers cannot be identified, the reinsurers can distinguish a primary insurance company with a low risk rate if the insurance company has the option to securitize insurance risk. In the model of Brandts and Laux (2007), however, at least one of the multiple reinsurers has the same information as the primary insurance company, that is, critical measurement of the issue of asymmetric information. In the reinsurance market, primary insurance companies often cede to multiple reinsurers for various reasons, such as business relationship, reinsurance, distribution of the ceded destination, acquiring underwriting technic, and acquiring information on market trends. In this study, the primary insurance company cedes to multiple reinsurers because of the commitment effect of hard budget constraints, which, as we theoretically show, can be one of the factors to solve the asymmetric information problem in the reinsurance market. Suppose a primary insurance company cedes to reinsurers with large capital size and sufficient solvency, such as Munich Re or Swiss Re. Further, one company does not assume full coverage but cedes to other reinsurers with small capital size and limited solvency. Each major insurance company in Japan cedes to a reinsurer, including one who has not obtained a high rating.Footnote 2 This means avoiding the soft budget constraint problem of a major reinsurer that it functions as a commitment of the primary insurance company to properly examine the primary contract. That is, for a major reinsurance company, even if the information disclosed in the underwriting contract is insufficient, there is a very small possibility of a default occurring later. Thus, the primary insurance company is not provided with an adequate incentive to examine the contract. On the other hand, suppose that the primary company cedes to several reinsurers with poor solvency. The likelihood of some of them defaulting is high, and so the primary insurer is forced to undertake an appropriate examination of the original contract to avoid bad reputation of the manager of the defaulting primary insurance company. This is how a primary insurance company’s private information as to whether or not it has examined the primary contract properly is judged by the reinsurer. We found that a reinsurer with financial restrictions is an adequate indication of a case improper investigation that caused the default and bad reputation of the manager of the primary insurance company. We derive the equilibrium reinsurance contract as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Thus, this is not simply because local insurance has liquidity constraint. It contains a incentive problem. We show that decentralized insurance market is more efficient due to the soft budget constraint problem. We will now briefly explain the soft budget constraint problem (Soft Budget Constraint Syndrome) and examine it. Soft budget constraint is a concept presented by Kornai (1980) when analyzing the centralized economy wherein the government and others provide financial assistance to inefficient enterprises. In other words, in a centralized economy, it is easy for additional investments of large funds to be made to companies that would otherwise go bankrupt, implying that it is easy for such companies to be relieved, which means that the incentives for advancement of efficiency of enterprises are obstructed. Kornai considered this soft budget constraint problem as a major reason for the low performance of the socialist economy, especially relating to the lack of goods services. Later, Qian (1994) also showed that such additional financing is one reason for the lack of goods services in the Soviet economy. However, whether the soft budget constraint problem is likely to occur in a centralized economy was not theoretically developed until the 1990s. Following Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), the theoretical research has been categorized according to which elements are centralized when the soft budget constraint problem occurs. These factors are roughly divided into (1) concentration of funds, (2) concentration of production, and (3) concentration of corporate ownership. Dewatripont and Maskin’s (1995) seminal work examines the concentration of funds. Dewatripont and Maskin’s (1995) seminal work examines the concentration of funds. In their model, when a renegotiation takes place, there could be situations where additional funds are added to inefficient projects in advance. In such a situation, additional investments could go to projects that should not be funded in advance, and then the problem of not being able to exclude such projects would arise. Thus, those who have been centralized are more likely to gain additional loans, indicating that efficient projects are more likely to be adopted. Qian and Xu (1998) describes this as a soft budget constraint problem by which it is difficult to adopt new technologies under a centralized government. Segal (1998) considers the centralization of production (2). Then, Li (1998) discusses the soft budget constraint problem with public ownership (3). Finally, from a survey of the above studies, Maskin (1996, 1999) and Akai (2003) are important. Akai (2003) is a reference that includes Japan. For a recent survey, see Vahabi (2014). In our above study, we used the incomplete contract theory as a soft budget constraint problem and theoretically discussed it relating to the inefficiency of government organizations and that in financing. On the other hand, this paper considers the problem of the risk burden of reinsurance. Where the reinsurer is a huge reinsurance company with a small default risk, the underwriting is not carried out appropriately, but when the underwriting capacity is poor and there are multiple reinsurers and large default risks, the underwriting examination is carried out appropriately. Thus, the commitment effect of the hard budget constraint in the reinsurance market can be shown as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and Sect. 3 derives the equilibrium. Section 4 concludes the paper, validating it practically.",1

The ageing of population affects the individual saving behavior and the capital accumulation. The capital accumulation causes the unbalanced population distribution between regions in such countries. On the other hand, we find that expanding longevity is caused by private health expenditure and public health policy. When a government adopts public health policy, this policy contains both the acute medical care policy and the precautionary medical policy. For example, in Japan where the oldest longevity country in the world is, Japanese government adopts the precautionary policies that include the mandatory and periodical medical check to the employee, the subsidy to cost of medical check for the non-employee, the promotion of diagnosis to metabolic syndrome and others. Obviously, the precautionary health policy makes the life longevity expand. Therefore, the precautionary public health policy affects longevity, individual consumption/saving behaviors and, aggregately, the ageing of population and the unbalanced population distribution between regions. If such a government tries to improve the ageing of population structure by the policies, the government takes consideration into individual fertility choice that increases the number of children and the precautionary public health policy that affects the life longevity. Figure 1 describes the transition of prevention expenditure and average lifespan age in Japan. We consider that precautionary public health policy improves the health of household. Improvement of health condition decreases the mortality with some diseases. If the number of people who live on retirement generation increases with high survival probability, it is natural that the average life span tends to rise. From this Fig. 1, we find that such expenditure tends to increase and that the average life span age of both male and female in Japan also tends to be older from 2000. Increasing prevention expenditure contributes to extend longevity through prevention health treatment. Thus, we need to develop the model to describe these relationships.Footnote 1

 The prevention expenditure, male average life, and female average life in Japan. Many literature studies gave us the theoretical discussion for the ageing of population and fertility choice. According to Chakraborty (2004), high-mortality societies do not grow rapidly because a shorter life span discourages savings. Chen (2010) shows that declining mortality brings about a quality–quantity tradeoff of fertility choice in an economy without social security. Becker and Barro (1988) have shown that social security might affect private savings and the demand for children. Incorporating parents’ child-care costs and an uncertain lifetime into the model, Yakita (2001) finds that increased life expectancy lowers fertility and that pay-as-you-go social security does not reverse fertility. However, because these literature studies do not discuss how longevity affects residential choice in the model including parents’ child-care costs and an individual’s uncertain lifetime, there is still room to examine the ageing of population and the unbalanced population distribution between regions. There are also literature studies to examine the migration of households and firms between regions. Introducing increasing returns of scale into a two-region model, Krugman (1991) and Ottaviano et al. (2002) show that a core–periphery distribution appears because of home market effects and decreasing transportation costs between regions.Footnote 2 As their models are fundamentally static models to deal with population as given and not to take account of population dynamics. To construct a model incorporating intergenerational behavior of households, their migration, and firm activities between regions, Sato (2007) introduces regional migration into two-period overlapping generation model and examines the relations among economic geography, fertility, and migration. Sato and Yamamoto (2005) discuss the effects of agglomeration economy or congestion diseconomy on demographic mechanisms. However, because their model does not include survival provability to the retirement generation, the equilibrium fertility rate in their model does not depend on the survival provability and they do not examine the relationship between the ageing and economic geography. To discuss our issue, we develop a model based on Naito and Omori (2017). Naito and Omori (2017) develop an overlapping generation model with longevity and show that the imbalance of the population distribution between urban and rural region enlarges concomitantly with longevity.Footnote 3 Since Naito and Omori (2017) do not introduce the factors to expand longevity policy into model, the relationship between longevity policy and urban agglomeration has not been examined. Above discussed, one of the factors is precautionary public health policy. Introducing precautionary public health policy into Naito and Omori (2017) model, from the point of public policy, we discuss the relationship between ageing and urban agglomeration in this paper. We present an overlapping generation model with regional migration, public health policy and longevity. We analyze the effect of public policy to expand longevity on an equilibrium population distribution between an urban region and a rural region in a steady state. The organization of this paper is the following. The next section presents the basic model, which describes the behavior of households and the production sector. The section also presents derivation of the equilibrium. Section 3 presents the comparative statics analyses of the effects of precautionary public policy on a steady state. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the results derived in this model and present remaining unsolved problems.",3

Batabyal,Peter Nijkamp,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The question of whether and how best to provide a pensionFootnote 1 to retired citizens is one that has greatly concerned governments in different regions of the world. As noted by Hindriks and Myles (2013, p. 775), this concern arises in part because “the issues that are raised with pensions are the potential transfers of resources between generations and the effect on savings behavior in the economy.” In addition, retired persons in many developed countries have formed lobbying groups that actively seek to promote their welfare—such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in the United States. Given the practical significance of pensions, economists have analyzed the provision of pensions and the reform of pension systems from a variety of perspectives. Therefore, there is now a vast literature on this subject. We now briefly summarize the more recent literature to give the reader a sense for some of the issues that researchers have grappled with.Footnote 2
 Focusing on the Netherlands, Van Sonsbeek (2010) studies how the aging of the population affects the sustainability of public finances. He first shows that under certain conditions, the pension costs of the state rise faster than the number of pensioners and then examines the budgetary and labor participation effects of five pension reform policies. Raab (2011) studies the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system in Austria and demonstrates that the behavioral responses of pensioners to financial incentives are not only large but also differentiated by gender. Behaghel and Blau (2012) study one way to reform social security in the United States (US) by varying the so-called full retirement age. The key finding emanating from their study is that retirement behavior in the US is characterized by the presence of framing effects. Boersch-Supan (2013) concentrates on the challenges faced by the governments of nations with ageing populations and points to the salience of what he calls “negative behavioral effects” in pension design. Specifically, he contends that such effects can be minimized by debunking false beliefs about ageing and, at the same time, providing better information about the chances and the challenges associated with the process of ageing. It is well known in the US that claiming social security benefits before reaching the full retirement age can permanently lower benefits. As such, Knoll and Olsen (2014) show that a delay in claiming benefits leads to larger increases in both monthly and lifetime benefits than what would be possible with an incentive scheme that alters the early retirement reductions. Reyers et al. (2015) use South African data and show that behavioral factors play an important role in predicting retirement behavior. Specifically, these researchers contend that behavioral factors related to bounded rationality and computational complexity in the decision-making environment influence the decision to either access or not access accumulated retirement funds when changing jobs. An important lesson emerging from the above review of the recent literature on pensions is that behavioral factors have a substantial impact on decision-making by agents. In a recent paper, Hollanders (2015) draws on the prior research of Cronqvist and Thaler (2004), Benartzi and Thaler (2007), and Willis (2011) and credibly supports this perspective. He convincingly argues that because choices by agents are affected by framing, because agents do not have much financial knowledge, and because agents do not choose actively, discussions about pensions and pension reform by policymakers ought to be informed by the findings of behavioral economics. Having said this, it should be clear to the reader that a variety of behavioral factors can influence decision-making by agents in the context of pensions. Therefore, in order to be concrete about the contribution of our paper, we focus on the notion of myopia. As pointed out initially by Feldstein (1985) and more recently by Andersen and Bhattacharya (2011), myopia or shortsightedness in decision-making by forward looking agents can provide a rationale for the existence of pensions. The logic behind this result is as follows. Left to their own devices and because they are shortsighted, a substantial number of agents will save inadequately. Therefore, in such a situation, a paternalistic government can increase the welfare of such shortsighted agents by instituting a PAYG pension system. We adapt the theoretical framework in Andersen and Bhattacharya (2011) and in Hindriks and Myles (2013, pp. 781-807) and use a simple, two-period overlapping generations model—on which more below in Sect. 2—to study two types of deviations from perfect foresight that have, to the best of our knowledge, not been studied adequately in the extant literature. The first type of deviation we study is the myopia or shortsightedness that leads to the undervaluation of future consumption. We refer to this type of deviation as pessimism. The logic here is that young agents do not adequately think about the twin facts that they will age and that their health will decline in the future because such thinking makes them pessimistic about their future. The second type of deviation we analyze is the overvaluation of the benefits from an existing PAYG pension system and we refer to this type of deviation as optimism. In this case, the logic is that young agents think they will be richer in the future—possibly because of ongoing economic growth—and hence they are unrealistically optimistic about the generosity of the PAYG pension system.Footnote 3
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 delineates the two-period overlapping generations theoretical framework. Section 3 analyzes the case of pessimism in detail and then answers the question as to whether pessimism provides a rationale for pensions. Section 4 examines the case of optimism at length and then sheds light on the question as to whether optimism provides a justification for a PAYG pension system. Section 5 concludes and then offers two suggestions for extending the research described in this paper.",

The question of much interest is how and why those two merchants dealt with real and insurance differently. The United Kingdom and Japan have many things in common. First of all, they are both typical island nations: the former is located off the western edge of the European continent, and the latter off the eastern edge. Second, both nations are the constitutional monarchies which also belong to the exclusive club of the Group of Seven. The British people sing the national anthem “God Save the Queen” whereas the Japanese people sing the one “Long Reign the Emperor”. Third, both countries are the advanced nations which have long history and unique cultures, and are economically very strong and influential. Fourth, chivalry is not yet dead in the noble country of the Union Jack whereas the samurai spirits are still alive in the beautiful country of the Rising Sun. In an economic perspective, both the United Kingdom and Japan are clearly great nations. Besides, the two countries are proud of being “insurance superpowers”. It is surprising to see, however, that the ways people have dealt with risk and insurance are so different between the two. Since the British people tend to make their saving decision on the basis of cost and benefit, they purchase insurance as a mere item of portfolio selection. In contrast, the Japanese people regard insurance as a good means of security against possible hazards: the way they buy life insurance is psychologically motivated rather than economically oriented [For this point, see Yamamoto (1970) and Mizushima (1995)]. Although Japan today is accelerating the process of transition toward westernization and getting closer to Western Europe and the United America, the historical and cultural foundations of Japan remain the same as before. The unique culture that has been nurtured more than 1000 years cannot be changed by the transformation of the economic environment in recent 70 years or so. Mizushima (1995), a leading authority on insurance, once remarked: If we take a close look at the Japanese insurance system from the viewpoint of the insurance thought which has been commonly shared by the Western people, then we have to reach the conclusion that “the insurance superpower” does not necessarily mean “the insurance-advanced nation”. More specifically, we must find a right answer to the question of whether and to what extent such “mismatch” between culture and insurance exists in Japan (Mizushima 1995, p. 3). We think that Mizushima has posed us a very important problem. The question of whether and to what extent the Japanese insurance corresponds to the culture might be an interesting question. We wonder, however, if it is really a right question to ask. Mizushima prefers a variety of pluralistic views to a single definite viewpoint. If we adopt such a pluralistic view à la Mizumima, we may proceed to say that the correspondence between culture and insurance should not be one-to-one: many forms of insurances may be associated with one culture. In the present paper, we would like to focus on the role of merchants in the market economy and partially give an answer to the Mizumima problem aforementioned. More specifically, we pick up Liverpool merchants as a representative of the British system and Ohmi merchants as a good sample of the Japanese system. The problem of how and why they deal with risk and insurance differently is posed, and will be carefully examined. The contents of this paper are as follows. Section 2 will introduce and examine the view of J. R. Hicks on the mercantile economy, on which the entire framework of our investigation here is built. Section 3 will study Liverpool merchants and their role in the classical triangular trade. The Zong events followed by the civil insurance trial will be a focal point of investigation. Section 4 will turn to Ohmi merchants and their role in the Japanese triangular trade. It will be seen that those merchants served well as main promoters of the mercantile economy in pre-modern Japan, and that their influence on the modern Japan remains a great deal. Section 5 aims to discuss and compare the unique insurance system adopted by Ohmi merchants and the modern one used by Liverpool merchants. Final concluding remarks will be made in the Sect. 6.",4

Variables such as inflation, growth, and exchange rates are usually associated with high levels of volatility in developing economies than in the developed world (IMF 2002; Serven 2003). The impact of these macroeconomic uncertainties on investment behavior continues to attract attention (see Huizinga 1993; Serven 2002, 2003; Byrne and Davis 2005). This interest is, perhaps, due to the sensitivity of domestic economic variables to changes in both internal and external markets (Chowdhury and Wheeler 2015). While there are many sources of uncertainty, the one arising from the volatility of exchange rate is crucial, due to its potential to influence many other financial and economic variables like interest rate, trade, output, and stock or equity prices (Cote 1994; McKinnon and Ohno 1997; Byrne and Davis 2005). These uncertainties may put cost of capital and future profitability in an unpredictable position, which can influence investment decisions though the direction of the effect of the uncertainty is ambiguous (Caballero 1991; Abel and Eberly 1994; Serven 2003; Chowdhury and Wheeler 2015). Thus, as countries adopt strategies to boost output, concerns are usually raised about how macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from volatility in variables such as exchange rates affect investment, especially private investment. In the last few decades, the determinants of investment, particularly private component, have received attention due to its significant contribution to output (Khan and Rhenihart 1990). It is argued that private investment is associated with higher efficiency, and its ability to create jobs is large. In view of this, many countries and development partners support and promote policies focusing on private investment to propel economic growth for job creation. Many studies analyzing the factors affecting private investment have devoted their analyses to the effects of exchange rate volatility on the private sector (Goldberg 1993; Serven 2003; Bhandari and Upadhyaya 2010; Chowdhury and Wheeler 2015). Exchange rate volatility results in erratic swings in the profitability of investment in the traded and non-traded goods sectors of the economy, and may consequently make the cost of capital unpredictable (Serven 1999; Chowdhury and Wheeler 2015). Many studies have examined the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on private investment on various economies and/or blocs. However, none of these studies has focused on the BRICSFootnote 1 bloc which is emerging as a powerful economic force. In 2010, about 25% of global output emanated from the BRICS bloc (GoI 2012). By 2050, the contribution to global output from the bloc is expected to surpass that of current world economic powers like G7 countries (Wilson and Purushothaman 2003), and they are working assiduously towards this target. Trade (merchandise and invisible) with the rest of the world has been growing at a faster rate. The high economic performance of these economies has been attributed to the high level of investment, especially in the private sector (GoI 2012). However, currency uncertainty (volatility) in the BRICS has been listed as one of the major challenges facing these economies (GoI 2012), as volatility influences investment decisions. Therefore, the significance of an investigation into the impact of exchange rate uncertainty on private investment cannot be overstated. Thus, the present study aims to explore the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on private investment in BRICS economies. Having introduced the theme, the rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, we briefly review related literature on the link between uncertainty and investment. The first part of the review relates to theory, while the second part focuses on empirical studies on the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on private investment. Section 3 explains our methodological techniques, whereas Sect. 4 presents and discusses the results. We conclude the study in Sect. 5.",6

In fact, companies and research institutes in developed countries dominate world research and development (hereafter R&D), and these countries experienced rapid economic growth after World War II.Footnote 1 As a result, intellectual property rights protection has been one of the most important policy issues, because many policymakers presume that strong and comprehensive patent policies increase the profitability of R&D and promote economic growth. Consequently, patent policies in many countries have been strengthened since the 1980s. The fact that strong patent protection increases the profitability of R&D leads to the following hypothesis: firms or industries dependent on their research divisions have incentives for carrying out political activities to achieve stronger patent policies. Political activities by firms usually take the form of campaign contributions and government lobbying. As evidence that supports this hypothesis, Fig. 1 indicates the lobbying expenditures by industry in 2015. According to the Center for Responsive Politics (2015), the total amount spent on lobbying in the United States in 2015 reached 32.2 billion dollars. Figure 1 suggests that, at 509 million dollars for lobbying activities, the health industry, including pharmaceutical and medical companies, spent the largest amount of all industries on lobbying. Moreover, communications/electronics is also involved in political activities, spending 385 million dollars for lobbying. Because these industries are R&D intensive, they have strong incentives to use political tools to influence the government’s policy-making process. [Source: Center for Responsive Politics (2015)] Lobbying expenditure by industry in 2015. Many researchers discuss the effect of patent policies on development and economic growth. Among the theoretical studies, Judd (1985) uses an exogenous growth model to examine how patent length affects the market equilibrium path. After the development of the endogenous growth theory by Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992), numerous studies have investigated the relationship between patent policies and economic growth. Specifically, Iwaisako and Futagami (2003) use a variety-expansion growth model based on Romer (1990) to show that the optimal patent length to maximize social welfare is finite. Lai and Qiu (2003) and Grossman and Lai (2004) develop the North–South trade model to analyze the international effects of patent protection, and show that the governments of developed countries choose stronger patent protection than developing countries. Their analyses, however, assume that governments maximize household utility as a measure of social welfare, and ignore incentives for firms to engage in political activities. In contrast, Eicher and García-Peñalosa (2008) shows how private incentives to protect patent rights affect economic growth. They show that multiple steady states can emerge in their model; one steady state is high-growth equilibrium characterized by stronger patent protection, and the other is no-growth equilibrium in the absence of patent protection. However, they do not consider the role of government explicitly. This implies that they cannot examine the interaction between patent holders and government. In the literature of political influence on patent protection, Chu (2008) is also important because his model examines interdependence between patent holders’ incentives to engage in political activities and the government policy-making process. His model succeeds in explaining the distortion of policymaking due to political activities. However, he uses a semi-endogenous growth model. In semi-endogenous growth models, economic growth depends on the rate of population growth, not on policy variables. This means that patent policy has no effect on economic growth in his model. Therefore, his framework cannot explain how political activities affect innovation and economic growth. This drawback is unsatisfactory because many researchers have already studied the relationship between patent policies and economic growth. The purpose of this study is to clarify how patent protection distorted by campaign contributions affects innovation and economic growth. To achieve this goal, we provide a theoretical analysis based on the fully-endogenous quality-ladder model developed by Grossman and Helpman (1991, Chap. 4). As many researchers point out, the fully-endogenous growth model causes scale effects. Nevertheless, we use this model because it provides richer implications for policy analysis than a semi-endogenous growth model does. Using the fully-endogenous growth model enables us to examine the influence of politically determined patent policy not only on welfare, but also on the growth rate. As a result, our model succeeds in analyzing broader interactions among policy-making, welfare, and economic growth than Chu (2008) does. Our main results are as follows. First, we determine the existence of a patent policy that maximizes innovation intensity under some mild assumptions. The existence of innovation-maximizing patent protection reflects two effects of patent policy on research activity: the profit magnification and patent cost effects. Second, we show that campaign contributions by patent holders result in a stronger patent policy than welfare-maximizing policy (using the average utility of patent holders and non-holders). This result is basically the same as Chu (2008). Third, we prove the following results. If the innovation-maximizing patent policy is greater than the optimum patent protection for patent holders, campaign contributions raise the rate of innovation to an excessive level from the viewpoint of social welfare. On the other hand, if the innovation-maximizing patent policy is smaller than the patent policy that maximizes social welfare, campaign contributions decrease not only social welfare, but also the rate of innovation. The third result is important because it cannot be derived from Chu (2008), which uses a semi-endogenous growth model. This result implies that political distortion caused by campaign contributions can affect not only welfare, but also innovation. Importantly, our analysis shows that the rate of innovation distorted by campaign contributions is too high from the viewpoint of social welfare. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic elements of the model and identifies equilibrium conditions. Section 3 establishes the unique steady-state equilibrium and explicit solutions for the endogenous variables. Section 4 examines how the government determines patent policy. Section 4.1 considers the case in which the government is benevolent and maximizes social welfare, while Sect. 4.2 examines how campaign contributions by patent holders affect patent policy and innovation. Section 5 provides concluding remarks.",1

Ten percent of them entered as technical interns who were permitted to stay in Japan for a limited period to acquire skills to contribute to their home countries’ development. 5.5% of them are non-Japanese spouses of Japanese nationals. Obviously, international marriage itself is a legal residence status, but some foreigners enter Japan by means of a fake marriage. In addition, around 5.5% of them entered Japan as students, then neglected their studies and engaged in part-time jobs beyond the permitted number of hours, and continued to stay in Japan illegally after their visa status expired.Footnote 2
 We classify illegal residents in developed countries into two categories. Based on the expected lifetime income, some illegal immigrants in developed countries prefer a high risk and high-cost entrance with a low risk of detection during their stay. Immigrants by fake marriage or disguised political refugees are included in this category. They spend a considerable amount of money to obtain fake documents that need to be submitted at the border to the immigration bureau. Even when the quality of fake documentation is high, some of them are detected by border control, and in those cases, they must pay penalty charges and return to their home country immediately. But, if they successfully pass border control and enter as legal permanent residents, their risk of being detected are quite low during their stay, since opportunities to re-evaluate their status are quite limited. On the other hand, some illegal immigrants prefer a low risk and low-cost entrance with a high risk of detection during their stay. Most overstaying residents are included in this category. As tourists, technical interns or students, their entrances are costless and completely legal, but after their visas expire, they face the risk of detection by internal investigation actions taken by the host country government. There are numerous studies about illegal immigration. Ethier (1986) is the pioneering theoretical study that introduced two common restriction policies to address illegal immigration, border control (border enforcement), and internal investigation (internal enforcement). Ethier concludes that by border control (and also by internal investigation, when employers can assess the immigration status of their employees), it is not possible to simultaneously accomplish two political targets (i.e., reduction of the volume of illegal immigrants and the improvement of the productivity of unskilled workers). But, he suggests that the combination of the two policies could reduce the cost of restriction. We note that Ethier refers to two different types of restriction policies but does not distinguish between different groups of immigrants who are targeted by these two policies. Different policies are considered to be effective to all illegal immigrants.Footnote 3 We also note that previous studies sometimes assume that the host country government adopts only one of the restriction policies. For example, Bond and Chen (1987) and Yoshida (1993) take only the internal investigation policy into consideration and focus on its effect on the economy of the host country and the global economy. Using an efficiency model, Carter (1999) also studies the economic effects of illegal immigration referring only to the internal investigation policy. Djajic (1987) is an extended dynamic model of Harris and Todaro (1970), and also implicitly considers the existence of internal enforcement.Footnote 4 As an example of a theoretical analysis with border control policy, we refer to Yoshida (1998), which re-examines the Bond and Chen (1987) model using a different immigration policy. Based on this, we assert that an important aspect has been ignored. Different policies may be considered effective to different types of illegal immigrants, that is, border control may reduce only some types of illegal immigrants such as those with fake visas, and internal investigation can mainly detect illegal immigrants in another category such as overstaying residents. However, past studies have not focused on this aspect. On the other hand, the worker’s optimal choice of whether to be a legal migrant, an illegal migrant, or continue to stay home (in a developing country), was analyzed by Kondoh (2000), considering the difference in the potential ability of each worker and the skill formation period required to be a legal skill holder as seen in Djajic (1989). But, there exist no studies about the choice of a potential illegal migrant, whether to enter with high risk and high cost but stay with low risk, or to enter with low risk and low cost but stay with high risk. To address the former type of illegal immigrants, the effective restriction policy should be border control, while for the latter type border control is meaningless, but internal investigation could successfully contribute to their detection. In this study, we attribute the reason of this different behavior of illegal immigrants to the individuals’ skill diversification. We focus on the economy of the host country and analyze optimal policies to reduce the total number of illegal immigrants and/or enhance the average quality of immigrants. In addition, we pay particular attention to the effects of legalization of illegal immigrants with relatively high productivity. In Sect. 2, we present our model. Section 3 is devoted to the analysis, and concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 4.",2

One source of pollution is consumption. Detergents, soaps, fats, vegetable peelings, human body waste (Mara 2004), and fumes from transportation vehicles, such as motorbikes and cars, which deteriorate the environment, particularly surrounding the people who discharge these pollutants, have consequent negative effects on their own health. For instance, water pollution increases the incidence of diseases, such as diarrhea, malaria, and dengue fever, and air pollution increases cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (OECD 2012). Thus, for economic development, the negative effect of pollutants from consumption on utility has to be considered when examining the impact of economic changes. In developing countries, urban unemployment is also a concern. In this respect, the prominent theoretical study by Harris and Todaro (1970) explains the phenomenon of coexistence of massive urban unemployment and rural–urban migration. In the Harris–Todaro (HT) model, the urban wage rate is fixed by institutions at a higher level than the rural wage rate and the urban expected wage rate is assumed to be equal to the rural wage rate. Thus, urban unemployment appears in equilibrium. The various aspects of the HT model are investigated by many theorists. Corden and Findlay (1975) introduced inter-sectoral capital mobility into the HT model, and the stability condition of their model was analyzed by Neary (1981). In the mobile capital HT model, paradoxical results are obtained regarding factor accumulation: labor expansion decreases the level of unemployment, but capital expansion increases it. Afterwards, several studies have incorporated the environment into the HT model (Chao et al. 2000; Daitoh 2003; Tawada and Nakamura 2009; Nakamura 2013; Yabuuchi 2013; Pan and Zhou 2013; Li et al. 2014). In the aforementioned studies, the motive of migration is the difference between the rural wage rate and urban expected wage rate. On the other hand, in the framework developed by Tawada and Sun (2010), migration occurs because of rural–urban differences in utility, which is affected not only by the expected wage rate, but also by the environment in each area. Their study demonstrated a counterintuitive result: a reduction in pollution generation rate increases unemployment, but does not affect workers’ welfare. Moreover, their study showed that the paradoxical results regarding the effect of factor accumulation on unemployment obtained in the mobile capital HT model could disappear. These results are derived under the assumption that the urban environment deteriorates by production in the urban area, while pollution from consumption is not considered. The present study, therefore, fills this gap in the literature and focuses on the latter aspect: it assumes that urban (rural) environment deteriorates by pollution from consumption by urban (rural) inhabitants. This study also assumes that migration occurs by rural–urban differences in utility, which is affected by the local environment (Tawada and Sun 2010). Such a labor allocation mechanism is adopted in this study as contentment with local amenities, including the quality of the air, is important for migration intentions, which is based on an empirical study which uses data of developing nations in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America (Dustmann and Okatenko 2014).Footnote 1 The major findings of this study are as follows: (1) a reduction in the pollution generation rate may decrease urban unemployment, while workers’ welfare necessarily rises. That is, the paradoxical results in Tawada and Sun (2010) can disappear. (2) As for the effect of factor accumulation on unemployment, paradoxical results obtained in mobile capital HT model may vanish.",2

In particular, the mixed oligopoly model has been suggested as being a very useful measure to investigate the issues of privatization in a nation or regional economy. For instance, De Fraja and Delbono (1989) indicate that nationalization is always socially better in a mixed oligopoly market, whereas if there are a greater number of firms and it is close to the optimal level, privatization is socially desirable. Moreover, Matsumura (1998) suggests the possibility of partial privatization being optimal, and indicates that full privatization is not optimal when firms own the same technology. While these researches paid attention to the privatization on an economy, the interaction between governments on this issue is also given particular attention. Among them are Fjell and Pal (1996), Pal and White (1998), Fjell and Heywood (2002), Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2005), Sepahvand and Cornes (2007), Fujiwara (2006), and Han and Ogawa (2008). In particular, Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2005) analyze the strategic interactions between governments by considering the inefficiency of public firms, and thus, suggest that both governments take privatization (no privatization) if the marginal costs of public firms are high (low) enough, and only one government chooses privatization if the marginal cost is on the intermediate value. Han and Ogawa (2008) consider an international mixed market with two countries, and indicate that market integration discourages privatization; moreover, the privatization rate under cooperative equilibrium is higher than that under a non-cooperative equilibrium. Furthermore, Matsumura and Okamura (2015) point out that the optimal degree of privatization is higher when there is less market competition under the assumption of quadratic production costs. Han (2015) analyzes a mixed oligopoly model with two countries and indicates that there is excessive privatization in the international mixed oligopoly market. However, above studies, by assuming only private firms export to a country or region, have failed to incorporate the competition between the public firms nor dealt with the issue of policy initiatives between the central and local governments in the privatization. It is true that most public firms primarily provide public or quasi-public goods. Therefore, in the issues of privatization, it is very important to examine which one should take the initiative in the policy between the central and local government by comparing both systems: centralization and decentralization. Generally, the economic system becomes more complicated as the economy grows. Thus, it becomes difficult for the central government to cover all the economic policies in the country, and thus, the roles of local governments have been emphasized. This implies that the local governments have the right to decide on the privatization of public firms and it can perform such decision independently.Footnote 1 Also, it might be possible that the decision of a certain local government affects those of the governments in other regions. Then, will it be socially desirable for the central government to uniformly advance privatization from a viewpoint of a nationwide welfare to all public firms? Otherwise, it may be necessary to examine whether it is socially desirable that the local governments advance privatization of public firms of their region independently while competing over privatization of each other. Many researchers and policy makers have paid attention to decentralization for a long period of time. In fact, studies in the field of public finance have insisted on the effectiveness of decentralization, e.g., Oates (1972). While previous literature on decentralization mainly focuses on the provision of public goods or taxation by the governments, it is also meaningful to examine the policy effects of privatization on the context of centralization vs. decentralization, because much of the public firms provide public or quasi-public goods. For this, we introduce the previous mixed oligopoly model, particularly, models of Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2005) and Han and Ogawa (2008), into an economy with two regions, and analyze the privatization policy with the central government and local governments, respectively. Moreover, we attempt to investigate which is socially desirable as the subject of policy among both systems, i.e., the policy by the central government or that by local governments. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic model. In Sect. 3, we investigate the privatization policy by central and local governments. Further, we compare the equilibriums between both systems in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the concluding remarks.",2
2.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,15 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-018-0070-8,A condition for the reduction of urban unemployment in the Harris–Todaro model,April 2018,Masaharu Nagashima,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the publication of two seminal papers, Todaro (1969) and Harris and Todaro (1970), the problem of underemployment and unemployment in the urban sector has long been a major focus in the economic analyses of LDCs. The Harris–Todaro model (hereafter, HT model), proposed in the two papers mentioned above, provides an interesting short-run analysis of labor migration between rural and urban areas and urban unemployment and underemployment in the urban informal sector. In the HT model, workers determine migration between the sectors based on their expected wages. Thus, the workers decide to migrate to the urban sector when their expected wages there are higher than those in the rural sector. It is assumed in the HT model that the urban wage is institutionally and legally fixed, so that as a result of the migration of workers, if there are more workers than the number of new jobs, some workers would necessarily be unemployed. They have to enter the urban informal sector and be unemployed or underemployed there. In general, capital accumulation in the urban sector is indispensable for economic development in LDCs. Although they all might be lumped together as “capital”, there are a lot of types and features. From the micro-perspective of a firm, machinery and equipment for production are one of the capital, capital stock such as internal reserves is also a capital. On the other hand, from the macro-perspective of an economy, social infrastructure such as airports, loading and port facilities, is also included in the capital. In this sense, industrial parks including the special economic zones (hereafter, SEZs) are one of the most important social capital. Accumulated capital, such as the SEZs in the urban industrial parks creates new job opportunities. In particular, construction of the SEZs invites many foreign companies, since in the SEZs the corporation tax is treated well. Therefore, through the exemption or discount from the corporation tax, the companies operating in the SEZs can reduce their operation costs and could become profitable. In the process of economic development in LDCs, it has been repeatedly observed that as foreign capital creates new employment opportunities, there is an increase in worker flow from rural areas to urban areas with a concomitant decrease in per-capita income in the urban area. This phenomenon is generally referred to as the “Todaro paradox” in the field of development economicsFootnote 1 Improvements in social infrastructure, such as airports, loading and port facilities, and industrial parks including the SEZs tend to attract capital from advanced foreign countries. Still, does the improvement of social capital necessarily increase unemployment in urban areas? In other words, does new job creation in urban areas always result in the Todaro paradox? Although much research has been devoted to the Todaro paradox, including Zarembka (1970), Blomqvist (1978), Arellano (1981), Takagi (1984), Nakagome (1989), Stark et al. (1991), Raimondos (1993), Brueckner and Zenou (1999), Brueckner and Kim (2001), most of these studies detail the conditions under which the Todaro paradox occurs. They do not, however, deal with the Todaro paradox in terms of the relation between an institutionally fixed urban wage and agricultural productivity in rural area. If the Todaro paradox occurs, even if the urban development is carried out, per-capita income in the urban area does not increase, and the urban informal sector expands. In the previous studies, there was not an idea to promote an agricultural development for the purpose of controlling the labor migration to the urban area. In this paper, to succeed in developing the urban area without the Todaro paradox, we develop an argument focusing on the relations between the institutional minimum wages in the urban and the agricultural productivity in the rural. We examine this subject using the method of comparative static in the HT model. Based on this analysis, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition which concerns the relation between the urban minimum wage and agricultural productivity in the rural. Another purpose of this paper is to illustrate this condition with a diagram. The condition itself is simple, but it offers significant suggestions for policy design. Section 2 introduces the HT model and a list of theoretical contributions applying the HT model, and Sect. 3 discusses some effects of capital accumulation in the urban sector with the institutional minimum wage (e.g., the legal minimum wages). Finally, a single necessary and sufficient condition is derived from this analysis and illustrated with a diagram.",4

It increased at an average annual rate of 0.39% from 1990 to 2010, which was brought about by moderate economic growth (0.78% per annum). On the other hand, energy intensity, which is defined as units of energy per unit of GDP, has decreased by −0.39% per annum on average.Footnote 1 In particular, energy intensity was greatly reduced in the 2000s compared to the 1990 s. However, there were regional differences in the reduction rate. While energy intensity significantly declined in large metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo, Kansai, and Chubu, the rate of decrease in rural areas was weak; conversely, energy intensity increased in some rural areas, such as Tohoku and Okinawa (Otsuka 2017a). Boosting regional economic growth, while also curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions via improving energy efficiency, is an important policy goal for Japan because most GHG emissions arise from energy use in modern society. The government has investigated the adoption of several policies for reducing GHGs, mainly centered on green innovation and renewable energy expansion. However, the hot-button issue of climate change has recently become too large to handle with only individual technologies. Japan must also pursue the United Nations Global Compact Cities initiative of urban and regional development, which is designed to reduce carbon emissions by adopting urban and regional policies, including new system design, system changes, and regulation or deregulation. Population density is the key to decreasing energy intensity. This is because it is known to suppress energy intensity, as shown in a number of previous studies (Newman and Kenworthy 1989; Mindali et al. 2004; Bento and Cropper 2005; Brownstine and Golob 2009; Karathodorou et al. 2010; Su 2011). In Japan, population density has been known to reduce the energy intensity of the manufacturing and commercial sectors (Morikawa 2012; Otsuka et al. 2014). Boyd and Pang (2000) and Otsuka et al. (2014) empirically showed that productivity improvements themselves cause energy-intensity improvements. In other words, the authors claim that energy intensity serves as an indicator of productivity improvements. However, population density might also affect the energy intensity of the residential and transportation sectors as well as the manufacturing and commercial sectors. To accurately predict the future total energy demand of Japanese regions, it is necessary to analyze the energy intensity of the overall sectors. For this purpose, we focus on the energy intensity of all sectors, rather than individual sectors, in Japanese regions. In particular, to contribute to a review of the country’s Basic Energy Plan, it is essential to quantitatively evaluate the impact of population density on energy intensity. This study aims to provide policy suggestions for the Basic Energy Plan and National Land Planning designed to reduce GHG emissions via improved energy intensity. Using Japanese regional data, we attempt to analyze the effect that population density (the driving force behind sustainable regional economic growth) has on the energy intensity in each regional economy. This study contributes to the existing literature in the following three ways. First, we clarify the effect of population density on energy intensity from both static and dynamic perspectives. Previous studies that examine the relationship between energy intensity and population density used static models of cross-sectional or panel data (Morikawa 2012; Otsuka et al. 2014). However, population density not only affects the regional disparities of energy intensity, but also its temporal dynamic changes. Considering the interregional migration of the population, the influence of population density on energy intensity is thought to have not only an immediate (static) effect, but also a long-term (dynamic) effect. A static panel model does not allow us to conduct an adequate analysis of dynamic effects, whereas a dynamic panel model enables us to analyze both the short-run effects (short-run elasticity) and long-run effects (long-run elasticity) of population density on energy intensity. Second, we clarify the difference of the impact of population density on the energy intensity among regions. Populations and firms are agglomerated in a narrow space in Japan’s large metropolitan areas, and the commercial sectors are relatively concentrated in these areas. Japanese commercial sectors have caused energy efficiency to deteriorate to low levels (Otsuka 2017a); therefore, these areas might have less impact on the energy intensity of population density. On the other hand, rural areas might be efficient compared to large metropolitan areas because the manufacturing sectors are concentrated. Manufacturing sectors, which account for a large proportion of the industrial sector, have a high level of energy efficiency, and this level has improved significantly (Otsuka 2017a). Otsuka et al. (2014) showed that the effect of industrial agglomeration on the improvement of energy intensity was significant in the manufacturing sectors. In rural areas, therefore, the impact of population density on energy intensity might be strong, owing to differences in the impact of industrial agglomerations, when compared to large metropolitan areas. We verify this hypothesis. Third, we focus on the Japanese regional economy with a declining population, which is different from the situations discussed in previous studies. By performing the analysis on Japan, we can provide useful policy implications for energy policymakers in other developed countries that face similar challenges of a potential declining population or falling birth rate. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methods and data for empirical analysis. Section 3 summarizes the results of the empirical analysis. Finally, Sect. 4 presents our conclusions and policy suggestions.",22
2.0,2.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,08 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-017-0048-y,Forecasting extreme seasonal tourism demand: the case of Rishiri Island in Japan,August 2018,Niematallah Elamin,Mototsugu Fukushige,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Tourism has become one of the fastest growing industries in the world, and seasonality has long been recognized as one of the most distinguishing features of tourism. Butler (1998) defines seasonality as “a temporal imbalance in the phenomenon of tourism, which may be expressed in terms of dimensions of such elements as number of visitors, expenditure of visitors, traffic on highways and other forms of transportation, employment, and admission to attractions”. Additionally, seasonality may be an almost universal characteristic of tourism, but it varies considerably from location to location (Baum and Lundtorp 2001). It is reasonable to expect tourism demand to have a higher level of seasonality in a peripheral, cold-climate environment. Butler and Mao (1996) examine these assumptions in the context of tourism in Ontario (Canada) and conclude that seasonality is indeed more extreme in the more remote and peripheral parts of the province. For many remote and peripheral areas, tourism is one of the most important income generating industries. However, in the case of extreme seasonality where off-season tourism is almost zero, there is a severe mismatch between demand and supply. This creates inevitable costs for the tourism industry in these areas. These costs mean that operators are forced to be even more efficient in the high season. A major challenge is constructing a forecasting model for high-season tourism demand. In this paper, we consider the case of Rishiri Island and construct a forecasting model of tourist arrivals. We selected Rishiri for the following reasons: First, Rishiri Island is a remote island, and all tourists arrive at the seaport or airport; therefore, the tourist arrival statistics are reliable. Additionally, this destination does not close in winter, even though the number of tourist arrivals is almost zero; therefore, tourist arrival data are available for both the on-season and the off-season. This is important because if the destination is closed or impossible to reach during winter, there will be no tourist arrivals. In this case, there are only on-season data, with a gap in the data between each on-season. However, for Rishiri, off-season data are available. We, therefore, have the opportunity to construct two types of forecasting model: one is constructed using both the on-season and off-season data, and the other is constructed using only the on-season data. This is an advantage when constructing and comparing forecasting models. For these reasons, we construct forecasting models using data for Rishiri. Rishiri Island is a typical example of extreme seasonal tourism demand in Japan.Footnote 1 Rishiri Island is located in northern Hokkaido, which is the northernmost prefecture in Japan. Its location is latitude 45° 10 min north; longitude 145° 15 min east (Fig. 1). The island had a population of about 5400 in 2015, and its area is 182.11 km2, making it the 18th largest island in Japan excluding the four main islands. Its average maximum monthly temperature in an ordinary year is below 10 °C between November and April, and its minimum temperatures are below 0 °C between December and March. The main industry in Rishiri Island is fishery, and tourism is the second-largest industry. The island consists of two municipalities: Rishiri-cho and Rishiri-Fuji-cho. These two municipalities report tourist numbers separately, but the two data series have been identical since 1997. Therefore, in this paper, we treat the reported number of tourists as the tourist numbers for Rishiri Island. Map of Rishiri Island and Japan According to Getz and Nilsson (2004), while the concept of seasonality is widely recognized, “extreme seasonality remains a somewhat subjective and illusive concept”. Figure 2 shows the time series of monthly tourist arrivals, and Fig. 3 shows the seasonal patterns of the selected years. These figures show that Rishiri Island faces extreme seasonal tourism. This is evident from the monthly shares of tourist arrivals: more than 20% in July, more than 50% in three months of the year (June, July and August), and more than 90% from May to October (see Fig. 4). Monthly tourist arrivals on Rishiri Seasonal structure of tourist arrivals on Rishiri Monthly concentration of tourist arrivals on Rishiri This study constructs a single time series model to forecast tourism demand for Rishiri Island. Models are constructed using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and exponential smoothing via state-space techniques. We refer to the latter class of models as error-trend-seasonal (ETS) models. Although a variety of time-series models are used in the tourism demand forecasting literature, exponential smoothing via state-space models are used in comparatively few studies. However, ETS models include exponential smoothing models such as the Holt–Winters method as a special case. Monthly data from April 2000 to September 2014 are used in this study. Each model’s performance is examined using the estimated and forecasted values between May and October only. The actual and predicted numbers of tourists are then compared using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This analysis examines both within-sample and postsample forecasting performance. There are quite a number of studies that purport to compare the accuracy of different forecasting techniques with regard to tourism data. However, until recently, there were relatively few comparative studies of forecasting accuracy that examined postsample forecasting performance (Witt and Witt 1995). Oh and Morzuch (2005) state that in many tourism demand studies, minimal attention has been devoted to comparing the within-sample performance of competing models as the basis for model selection. Additionally, we examine the role of trend terms in postsample performance using Theil’s (1958) decomposition method for forecasting error variance.",1
2.0,2.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,10 October 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-017-0051-3,Inequality convergence in inefficiency and interprovincial income inequality in Indonesia for 1990–2010,August 2018,Mitsuhiko Kataoka,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economic growth is inevitably uneven in its subnational impact, and thus significantly affects the income gap across subnational regions. Efficiency as well as factor endowment influence regional income. Regional development policy allocates the available resources to enhance regional income and/or to redress the considerable interregional income gap; therefore, measuring the allocation of factor endowments and efficiency in subnational regions is essential for policy makers and planners. Because of its large size, insular geography, sizable population (the world’s fourth largest), and rich resource endowment, Indonesia consists of widely different socioeconomic subnational regions: the nation’s largest urban agglomeration (Jakarta), resource-rich provinces (Ache, Riau, East and South Kalimantan, and Papua), internationally well-known tourist destinations (Bali and Yogyakarta), emerging business cluster provinces (West and East Java), and the labor-intensive agricultural provinces (other provinces) (Kataoka 2010). Given these extraordinary regional diversities, the nation faces serious income inequality and factor endowment imbalances across provinces. To address this issue, the Indonesian government has implemented various policies, including Five-Year Development Plans (REPELITA, Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun), interregional fiscal transfer programs by presidential instruction (IMPRES, Instruksi Presiden), and programs promoting internal migration (Transmigrasi); and has established integrated economic development zones (Kawasan Pengembangan Ekonomi Terpadu) (Kataoka 2012). Furthermore, Indonesia has carried out major changes in its intergovernmental budget allocation system since 1999, adopting a much more decentralized fiscal regime, to reduce the income gap across subnational regions (Kataoka and Wibowo, 2014). However, outcomes are still far below the target levels, such as the serious economic imbalance and the huge income gap between Java and the off-Java provinces (see Table 1). Since Esmara’s (1975) pioneering work, interregional income inequality in Indonesia has frequently been the subject of theoretical discussion and empirical economic research. Several studies examine the factors underlying interregional income inequality, employing various inequality measures and factor decomposition techniques (e.g., Islam and Khan 1986; Akita 1988; Azis 1990; Akita and Lukman 1995; Garcia and Soelistianingsih 1998; Akita et al. 1999; Hill 2000; Tadjoeddin et al. 2001; Akita and Alisjahbana 2002; Hill 2002; Akita 2003; Milanovic 2005; Akita and Miyata 2008; Hill 2008; Akita and Miyata 2010; Kataoka 2010; Akita, et al. 2011; Hayashi et al. 2014). One decomposition technique for income inequality is to analyze the factors affecting gross regional domestic product (GRDP) by sectoral income source and hierarchical regional structure (Akita and Lukman 1995; Tadjoeddin et al. 2001; Akita and Alisjahbana 2002; Akita 2003; Akita and Miyata 2008, 2010; Kataoka 2010; Akita et al. 2011). Another method is to analyze the factors associated with expenditure data by household head subgroup, such as province, location, educational attainment, gender, and age (Akita et al. 1999; Akita and Miyata 2008; Hayashi et al. 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, very few studies have examined the interregional income inequality associated with efficiency factors in Indonesia. We address this gap in regional economic analysis, measuring the efficiency factor contributing to interprovincial income inequality in Indonesia for 1990–2010. To incorporate efficiency factors into inequality decomposition, we utilize data envelopment analysis (hereinafter referred to as DEA). DEA is a non-parametric measurement tool for measuring relative efficiency, introduced by Charnes et al. (1978). Originally, DEA was used in productivity analysis at the micro level, but it has recently become increasingly popular at the macro level as a non-parametric alternative to growth accounting (Enflo and Hjertstrand 2009). Charnes et al. (1989) applied this technique to regional economic performance analysis, evaluating relative efficiency in terms of economic development in 28 Chinese cities. The DEA technique subsequently became a popular tool in regional economic analysis (Stimson et al. 2006; Halkos and Tzeremes 2010; Schaffer et al. 2011). For the interprovincial income inequality decomposition, we refer to Cheng and Li’s (2006) study. They proposed the interpretive additive inequality decomposition of Theil’s second measure by causal factors, where the decomposition variable is expressed multiplicatively. Their method is an improvement over Duro and Esteban’s (1998) technique of Theil’s second measures weighted by the regional population size, in which inequality decomposition terms can take positive or negative values, although a strict Theil measure maintains a non-negative value (see Cheng and Li 2006 for more details). Applying their method to China’s post open door policy period, they found that the impact of inefficiency on interregional inequality shows a declining trend. Applications of Cheng and Li’s (2006) method can be found in several inequality decomposition studies (Alcalde-Unzu et al. 2009; Ezcurra and Iraizoz 2009; Olaskoaga-Larrauri et al. 2011; Li and Zhao 2015; Li and Dewan 2017). Some studies, such as Ezcurra and Iraizoz (2009) and Li and Zhao (2015), incorporate efficiency factors to the inequality decomposition of economic performance. Ezcurra and Iraizoz (2009) applied this approach to 196 sample regions in the European Union for 1986–2004 in a similar way. Li and Zhao (2015) evaluated the relative efficiency of China’s provincial competitiveness and decomposed it into allocative efficiency and technical efficiency for 2005–2008. Other studies extensively apply cross-country inequality decomposition of multiplicative social welfare variables without incorporating efficiency factors. For example, Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2009) decompose cross-country disparities in per capita healthcare expenditure into healthcare expenditure share of GRDP, labor productivity, and labor participation rate in OECD countries for 1975–2003. Olaskoaga-Larrauri et al. (2011) decompose public welfare spending per GRDP into intensity of social welfare spending, the dependent population ratio, and the inverse of per capita income in 21 developed countries for 1980–2004. Ezcurra et al. (2009) suggest a possible extension of Cheng and Li’s (2006) technique to examine regional disparities in efficiency changes over time in European regions; however, they do not explore this empirically in their study. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the method and data used in this study. In Sect. 3, we describe the empirical results, while our conclusions are presented in Sect. 4.",13

There are still many people and many industries which cannot back to normal, though the governments have tried to recover. Restoration measures have taken place with the support of government and civic associations, but many people still live in temporary housing, 5 years after the disaster. Certain industries, such as the fishery and manufacturing sectors, have not managed to reach the same production levels as those of 2010, before the disaster. To build a more resilient country and community, we need to learn from the disaster by analyzing the chronological changes in the regional economy using a quantitative analysis. In particular, we need to compare the benefits and the associated costs of the restoration measures. The regional economy improved a year after the Kobe earthquake in 1995 as a result of the restoration measures, but the recovery of residents’ consumption was further delayed, and the improvements did not last after the restoration support ended (Development Bank of Japan 2011). The coastal area of the Iwate Prefecture, where the tsunami hit, is likely to follow the same economic recovery path. The key factors affecting the changes in the regional economy need to be evaluated. Unfortunately, few statistical data resources are available on monthly changes in production for the disaster area. In analyzing the recovery path of regional economies, economic models, based on micro-economic theorems of consumers’ decisions and producers’ behaviors, are useful. The dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model is a good candidate of tools to analyze a growth pattern of economies. The model can treat an unforeseen disaster, such as an earthquake, as a stochastic shock and investment as an endogenous variable that stimulates future economic growth. A restoration investment mainly accelerates the recovery process for a disaster area, and an increase in investment is deterministic and easily expected by consumers. Such features can be considered in the simulation of DSGE model. Keen and Pakko (2007) developed the DSGE model for natural disasters, and used it to measure the economic impacts of hurricane Katrina. They considered the stochastic shock caused by the hurricane in the total factor productivity (TFP) of the production function, and quantified the effects of the subsequent monetary policy. In general, the recovery from the east Japan earthquake and tsunami is managed using recovery investment or rebuilding subsidy to reconstruct public facilities using funds from other regions. Thus, we need to evaluate this fiscal policy (i.e., public investment and subsidy) and the monetary policy. However, few studies have used a DSGE model to analyze the east Japan earthquake. This study aims to analyze the chronological changes in the regional economy of the Iwate coastal areas after the earthquake, and to evaluate the efficiency of the restoration policy measures. The impacts of the stochastic shocks from the earthquake and the deterministic shock from the restoration investment are simulated using a DSGE model. In addition, the impulse response curves of key variables are compared to the chronological changes in macroeconomic indices based on published statistics such as gross regional production and the 2005 and 2011 I/O tables. The I/O table of disaster-stricken area is quite few, so the objective area (the Iwate coastal area) is the good example to validate simulation results of the model with actual data. The cost–benefit ratio of the restoration investment with fund transfer and rebuilding subsidy is calculated to show the efficiency of the restoration policy measures. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous related studies. The proposed model and the data are explained in Sect. 3, and the simulation results of the model are discussed in Sect. 4. The last section concludes the paper by summarizing the results and providing possible policy implications of our findings.",6

Fullerton Jr.,Arturo Bujanda,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Investments in public infrastructure such as highways, airports, and mass transit facilities tend to improve productivity. Not surprisingly, these types of investments can increase adjacent property values, generating value premia for private developers and adjacent property owners. A portion of this value can be “captured” as public revenue via property taxes to assist financing such improvements. States and local governments generally attempt to anticipate and capture the economic value created by transportation accessibility as a means for funding capacity expansions. Value capture (VC) on real properties from investments in public infrastructure has historically been achieved via the tax mechanism. In the United States, regional infrastructure expenditures are financed using three basic sources: (1) local government revenues (tax and non-tax), (2) borrowing, and (3) funding from higher levels of government. As more fuel-efficient vehicles such as gasoline–electric hybrids enter public and private fleets, fuel tax revenues and the Federal Highway Trust Fund will continue to decline, reducing funding amounts provided to each state. Texas is no exception. Historically, Texas has been a “donor” state, a state that receives less revenue than what it pays to the Highway Trust Fund. Reduced funds are expected through 2050 (Hall 2012). If the trends for declining fuel tax revenues, increasing transportation needs, and higher infrastructure costs continue, the funding required to address mobility needs is clearly beyond what traditional sources, like the dated fuel tax, can supply. Because of the aforementioned revenue pressures, accurate valuation of taxable properties is important. Most of the non-roadway mechanisms for capturing value premia are used by local governments, with a few being employed by state departments of transportation (DOT). While VC represents an opportunity for regional agencies to recapture some transportation infrastructure costs, it is not clear how much value is added by infrastructure projects in a particular region. This study applies geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to quantify the impacts of transportation infrastructure proximity and accessibility on commercial real property values in El Paso, Texas. The analysis takes advantage of a sample that contains data on 105,611 commercial property parcels in El Paso, Texas. It is an example of the types of data sets that are quickly becoming more prevalent in transportation and real estate settings (Sánchez-Martínez and Munizaga 2016). The hypothesis tested is that transportation infrastructure proximity and accessibility impact commercial property values in El Paso. The next section provides a review of related literature. After that, a discussion of the data and methodology is presented. The fifth section reports empirical results. The paper concludes with key findings and suggestions for future research.",1

The present study is intended to extend this framework in such a way as to incorporate substitution between domestic and imported commodities (i.e., Armington elasticity) and to endogenize the international trades for all commodities traded between two countries, namely, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Armington elasticity is an essential component in trade policy analyses. The previous work concerning economic assessment of trade liberalization schemes (e.g., Harrison et al 1997; Nakajima 2002; Urata and Kiyota 2003; Park 2004) has used computable general equilibrium (CGE) models based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database. While these models make use of empirically estimated elasticities, the estimates of the elasticities between the aggregated factors, which are essentially based upon time series analyses, tend to show smaller elasticities than anticipated (McDaniel and Balistreri 2003). Notwithstanding, Armington elasticities can be large in light of the indifferences between goods of the same classification but from different countries. Moreover, the previous CGE models are calibrated at a single state (i.e., one-point calibration) to incorporate regionalities, except for the elasticity parameters, which are usually given a priori. From another perspective, Saito (2004) was concerned with the separability of foreign commodities, i.e., the distinction between inter- and intra-group Armington elasticities. The inter-group elasticity is the elasticity of substitution between a basket of domestic commodities and that of imports as a whole, whereas the intra-group elasticity is the elasticity of substitution between a basket of imports from one foreign country and that from another. The estimates of inter-group elasticities were larger for intermediate input sectors, whereas the intra-group elasticities were significantly lower. In the same vein, Feenstra et al (2014) studied the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods (i.e., macroelasticity), and between varieties of foreign goods (i.e., microelasticity) and essentially found the opposite: the microelasticity was significantly larger than the macroelasticity. Our approach differs from those of the previous studies in two aspects. First, all elasticities are measured based upon published statistics, i.e., linked input–output tables for Japan and for Korea and the UN Comtrade database, and are not adopted from elsewhere. Second, we construct a model that completely replicates two temporally distant state observations rather than conducting a time series analysis to measure elasticities between aggregated factor inputs, as we are interested in a shorter term and a sector-wide policy implication such as regarding tariff liberalization. The state-replicating Armington elasticities are measured by two-point calibration. That is, we measure elasticity that agrees with the two observed domestic–foreign shares in both physical and monetary terms. Moreover, the elasticities are measured in a two-stage nested structure, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Nested structure of macro and microArmington elasticities. A foreign commodity price is given by aggregating the partner country’s and the rest of the world’s (ROW’s) commodity prices. The compound commodity price is given by aggregating the domestic and foreign commodities’ prices. Finally, the domestic price is given by a multifactor CES aggregator (i.e., unit cost function) Specifically, we evaluate the compound price of each factor input \(w_{i}^C\), in terms of domestic and foreign factor input prices (\(w_{i}^D\), \(w_{i}^F\)) that are observable, via CES aggregation whose macroelasticity replicates the observed domestic–foreign market shares. We then calibrate the microelasticity using \(w_{i}^F\) and the partner country’s domestic price \(w_{i}^{D\prime }\) in order that the observed partner—ROW market shares are replicated. In this way and based upon 2000–2005 linked input–output tables for Japan and Korea, we construct a multisectoral (395 for Japan and 350 for Korea) general equilibrium model with endogenized bilateral trades, in contrast to the previous studies with limited variety of industrial sectors. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the basics of the two-point calibration of the CES elasticity parameters, i.e., macro and microArmington elasticities, and the multifactor CES elasticity estimation by regression. In Section 3, we apply these protocols using linked input–output tables for Japan and for Korea and the UN Comtrade database. In Sect. 4, we integrate domestic and trade models to construct a bilateral general equilibrium model for the welfare analysis of trade liberalization. Section 5 provides concluding remarks.",

Batabyal,Hamid Beladi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Remanufacturing is the name given to an industrial process in which worn-out products are eventually restored to a like-new condition. As pointed out by Lund (1984) and Batabyal and Beladi (2016a, 2018), the remanufacturing process first involves the full disassembly of a discarded product. Next, usable parts are cleaned, refurbished, and then put into inventory. The product is then reassembled from the old parts—and occasionally with new parts as well—to manufacture a unit that is fully equivalent and sometimes superior in performance and expected lifetime to the original new product. There is no gainsaying the fact that remanufacturing is now growing in popularity in many nations of the world. In this regard, it is worth noting that remanufacturing has become important in the United States mainly because of two reasons. First, inter alia, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented the so-called “Comprehensive Procurement Guideline” in 1995. This guideline attempted to cut waste and promote resource conservation by ensuring that materials collected by recycling programs are utilized again to manufacture new products.Footnote 1 Second, several firms have now seen actual cost savings as a result of their remanufacturing activities. To see the source and the magnitude of the above-mentioned actual cost savings, consider the following three examples from Mitra and Webster (2008). These researchers explain that in 1996, Ford was able to avoid the disposal of more than 67,700 lb of toner cartridges and, as a result, saved $180,000 in disposal costs. Second, between 1991 and 1997, Ford collected more than 332,000 lb of toner cartridges and therefore was able to save $1.2 million. Finally, in 1995, Union Carbide saved $75,000 by sidestepping disposal costs. Given the growing significance of remanufacturing from both an environmental and a practical perspective, a burgeoning literature has now begun to analyze the usefulness of this industrial process from a variety of vantage points. We now briefly survey this literature. A number of researchers have studied the process of remanufacturing from the standpoint of firms. Lebreton and Tuma (2006) survey the factors that are most likely to raise remanufacturing rates in their study of the disposal of 600,000 tons of used tires in Germany. Ferrer and Swaminathan (2006) analyze a multi-period model of competition between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and an independent operator (IO). They first demonstrate that the IO may intercept the cores of products made by the OEM to sell remanufactured products in future time periods. Next, they show that when the threat of competition rises, the OEM is more likely to fully utilize all available cores and offer the remanufactured product itself but at a lower price. Might it be possible for remanufactured products to cannibalize new product sales? This important question has been studied by Atasu et al. (2010) who show that a product portfolio that includes both new and remanufactured products can make it likely for a firm to get to additional market segments and thereby block competition from low-end products or third-party manufacturers. Shi et al. (2015) examine the stability of the Nash equilibrium arising in the game between an OEM and a remanufacturer. They demonstrate that a higher willingness-to-pay (WTP) on the part of consumers can either reinforce or diminish the stability of the pertinent Nash equilibrium. The competitive interaction between an OEM and a remanufacturer has recently been analyzed in a strategic or game-theoretic setting by Batabyal and Beladi (2016a). In the model utilized by these two researchers, the objective of both firms is to use product development expenditures to capture a dominant share of the market in which they are operating. Similarly, Batabyal and Beladi (2016b) also use a game-theoretic setting to show how consumers can pursue an environmental or green agenda versus a non-environmental or brown agenda through their product purchase decisions. Finally, Batabyal and Beladi (2018) study how the ability to advertise influences the market share enhancing strategies pursued by an OEM and a remanufacturer. In the foregoing three paragraphs, we have discussed studies that have enhanced our understanding of the nature and the consequences of remanufacturing in a variety of different settings. This notwithstanding, our primary claim in this paper is that there are no studies in the existing regional science literature that have analyzed how spatial considerations influence the decision by consumers to purchase either a new or a remanufactured good. Second, we are also unaware of any studies in regional science that examine the ways in which transport costs incurred by potentially green or environmentally friendly consumers affect the decision to purchase either a new or a remanufactured good.Footnote 2
 Given the lacuna in the literature that we have just mentioned, we adapt and apply Hotelling’s (1929) well-known price competition model to the problem of studying the strategic interaction between a continuum of potentially green consumers and two firms. The specific model we utilize is a static Bertrand model and, in game-theoretic parlance, we are analyzing a static game of complete information.Footnote 3 Section 2 describes the model in which firm 1 sells new toner cartridges and firm 2 sells substantially similar but remanufactured toner cartridges.Footnote 4 Each firm selects its own price and a consumer purchases a toner cartridge from the firm that offers her the highest utility. Utility is given by the difference between a surplus measure and the sum of the price and the transport cost borne by a consumer to travel to the relevant toner cartridge selling firm’s location. Section 3 derives the best response functions of the two firms. Section 4 stipulates a numerical value for the surplus measure and then studies whether the resulting Nash equilibrium is unique. Section 5 introduces a linear transport cost function with a constant coefficient into the analysis and then solves for the Nash equilibrium. Section 6 introduces a linear transport cost function with a variable coefficient into the analysis and then demonstrates what happens to the ensuing Nash equilibrium when the variable coefficient becomes very small. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes and then discusses three ways in which the research delineated in this paper might be extended in the future. We contend that our paper makes progress in the regional science literature because it is the first to show how the Hotelling (1929) model, which is well known in the industrial organization literature, can be used to shed light on the ways in which transport costs affect the decision to purchase either a new or a remanufactured toner cartridge. More generally and moving beyond new and remanufactured toner cartridges, the way in which goods are shipped and the resulting transport costs can have an impact on the purchase decisions of environmentally conscious consumers for a whole host of goods including, but not limited to, fresh food and beverages. In other words, the purchase decisions of green consumers that are based at least in part on transport costs have implications for the environmental sustainability of alternate production processes and transport systems. We now briefly summarize our main findings and then proceed to Sect. 2. First, for each of the two firms, the firm’s own price is an increasing function of the price charged by its rival. Second, if the two toner cartridge producing firms select their “monopoly” prices (on which more in Sect. 4), then this state of affairs leads to a unique Nash equilibrium of the game in which the participants are the consumers and the two firms. Third, the cheaper (costlier) it is for consumers to get to the locations of the two firms, the lower (higher) is the price charged by the two firms. Finally, the higher the transport cost of reaching one or the other firm, in the minds of the consumers, the greater is the differentiation between the two types of toner cartridges.",

The average solid waste generation rate in 23 developing countries is 0.77 kg/person/day (Troschintez and Mihelcic 2009). Worldwide municipal solid waste generation is approximately 2 billion tons per year and is predicted to increase to 3 billion tons annually by 2025 (Charles et al. 2009). The production of organic waste such as fruit and vegetables waste is also very high and is becoming a good source for municipal landfills due to its high biodegradability (Bouallagui et al. 2003). In many cases, municipal wastes are not well managed, especially in developing countries, because cities and municipalities cannot cope with the fast rate of waste production. Developing countries in Asia have similar conditions. The solid waste generation is high, because of the large population and the main component of solid waste is decomposable organic. For example, the decomposable organic waste was 61.5% in Malaysia, 68.12–72.41% in Indonesia and 72–80% in Bangladesh. But only the solution to collect the waste cannot handle the large amount of waste, some other innovative approach is also necessary. This disposal method causes environmental pollution, such as soil pollution, surface pollution and groundwater pollution, due to by leachate and GHGs emission through the waste decomposition process (Dhokhikah and Trihadiningrum 2012). In Dhaka City, the waste generation rate is approximately 1.65 million metric tons annually. Per capita waste generation is estimated to be 0.29–0.60 kg/per/day, depending on individual income level (Chowdhury et al. 2014). This increase in waste is approaching the limitations for proper management and disposal of MSW. Since the 1960s, many studies have reported concerns associated with MSW. Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has a significant contribution to the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions; especially, the disposal of waste in landfills creates methane (CH4), which has high global warming potential. Waste management disposal activities in landfills contribute 4% of GHG emissions globally (Bogner 2007). In Dhaka, waste generation has increased rapidly by increasing population and rapid urbanization. Other factors affecting waste generation are migration, socioeconomic factors, inadequate waste management practice, and lack of awareness. Searching of land for providing the place for waste dumping is a concern for Dhaka. There are few available large size lands, and also solid waste disposal poses a greater problem because it leads to land pollution if openly dumped, water pollution if dumped in low lands and air pollution if burned. Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) is facing serious problems in providing satisfactory service for sanitary landfilling, as it requires a very large space and management is also difficult with limited resources, budget and a poor manual management plan. However, there is also good potential for recycling of organic waste for resource recovery with a very small space and resources through zone-wise management. Biogas is an environmentally friendly tool for reducing huge generated waste and reduces the greenhouse gas emissions. It is a very effective means of addressing issues such as indoor air pollution, deforestation and reducing greenhouse gas emission through manure and solid waste as feedstock for biogas production (Arthur et al. 2011). In the 1990s, when MSW management models were introduced, some multi-criteria (MCA) applications were proposed. These models considered waste management practice systems based on site-specific environmental and economic considerations. MCA-based GIS models available to address MSW problems include AHP, ANP, and fuzzy (Dey and Ramcharan 2008, Khalil et al. 2004; Queiruga et al. 2008; Khan and Faisal 2008; Siddiqui et al. 1996; Erkut and Moran 1991; Charnpartheep et al. 1997; Gebhardt and Jankowski 1987; Swallow et al. 1992; Sasao 2004; Chang et al. 2008). This approach takes advantage of the capabilities of both GIS and AHP to manage and process spatial information for multi-criteria analysis to combine information such as slope and infrastructure with value-based information, expert opinion, and participatory surveys (Geneletti 2010). Hasan et al. (2009) assessed the landfill demand for disposal of MSW of Dhaka. In this paper, landfill demand and allocation of municipal solid waste in Dhaka City were described. Population projection and waste generation were done for the periods 2007–2025. For finding suitable landfill sites, in the study they analyzed a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) on various raster map layers in the GIS environment. At the final stage of the study, a final suitability map was produced through the WLC method according to the setup of exclusionary criteria, decision factors, standardization of factors, and weighting of factors with MCE for land suitability analysis. However, all the suitable areas found from this study can be used for landfill development, but transport cost for waste disposal from distant parts of the city would be higher for waste management. Therefore, a GIS-based multi-criteria approach in combination with AHP to locate a site for generating heat and gas from the waste of Dhaka City could provide part of the solution for MSW management. This option could help eliminate 65–72% of the organic waste of Dhaka City generated from households, supermarkets markets, and restaurants. Presently, Dhaka City Corporation handles waste through disposal at two landfills. The waste-handling capacities of these two landfills are not sufficient to accommodate the huge waste load of Dhaka. The city management has been unable to accommodate the waste using these limited landfill areas. Biogas is the only viable option for reducing the volume of waste while also converting waste to energy for electricity and gas consumption. The installation of a biogas plant to reduce municipal waste and allow energy generation has become urgent, as the increasing solid waste is a concern to the population of Dhaka. Several researches were conducted to solve the local, regional, and global problems due to the improper disposal of MSW. Most of these researches showed a positive attitude on renewable energy for sustainable development; renewable energy can help to meet the daily energy needs through waste to energy routes and reduce the negative environmental and social impacts (Rao et al. 2010). However, the location of an optimal site for a biogas plant that has the potential to generate power also involves environmental, economic, and social constraints and factors. For example, residences, sensitive buildings such as schools, colleges, hospitals, and public places such as shopping malls or commercial buildings consistently prefer that facilities such as waste-handling plants or power plant be located a certain distance away. In this case, the combination of GIS and MCDA is a powerful tool for land suitability assessments to locate a suitable site (Malczewski 2006). Therefore, the objective of this research is to locate suitable sites for a biodigester plant and determine the biogas potential for energy from locally generated waste.

Urban–rural relations exist due to a difference in their strengths and vulnerabilities, and the main components of these relations include natural resources, demographic resources, economic resources, knowledge, and waste. The relations evolve based on the local strengths, weaknesses, and also the history of development in the region. Planning policies, focusing separately on urban and rural areas, fail to acknowledge the interdependencies between them and cause a wide gap between socio-economic opportunities, infrastructure, and service provisions in urban and rural areas, respectively. Rural areas are well served in terms of accessibility to land and other natural resources, whereas urban areas typically have an advantage in access to infrastructure and institutional facilities. A report by the Overseas Development Institute (Hyden et al. 2003) elaborates a study carried out to assess the structure of policy implementation; one of the conclusions of the study pertained to the urban–rural differences in access to government services and other related provisions. Urban–rural linkages are directly influenced by the governance and public policies of the region in which they are located, and hence, they have to be addressed in a context-specific manner (Sheng 2002). Balanced regional development results primarily from well-coordinated and integrated planning policies (Kim 2015) which are beneficial for both urban and rural areas, and an effective governance system is necessary for setting up such an approach (Clark 2012). Thus, the concept of urban–rural linkages reinforces the concept of integrated governance in metropolitan regions which consist of both urban and rural areas. Oliveira (2017) in his paper analyses the European perspective on emergence of new forms of flexible governance and states with reference to Jessop (1998) that ‘governance’ includes the act of coordination of inter-dependent activities, organizational hierarchy of institutions and agents responsible for governing, and governing the act of governance itself. Kohler-Koch and Eising (1999, pp. 13) define governance as the ‘ways and means in which the divergent preferences of citizens are translated into effective policy choices and how the multitude of interests of society are transformed into unitary action and the compliance of all social actors is achieved’. There has also been a lot of research on how governance and growth are linked. As Khan and Mushtaq (2010) postulates, recognising the importance of government implies that the capabilities of the government are significant determinants of economic and social performance in developing countries. The level of institutional development and its flexibility has an impact on the development of economy (Dayneko and Dayneko 2017). The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2009, pp. 21–32) by the Government of India highlights case studies of application of new forms of public management to make governance more efficient and citizen-friendly. The component of spatial planning is especially impacted by national and state-level government policies on land use, urbanization, rural development, industrialization, housing, transportation, economic development, environment, and other related schemes. The main issues with regional level of planning are financial constraints on the constituent bodies, separation of plan formulation and implementation process, and differing economic and social goals of government bodies (Wapwera et al. 2015). Issues with regional planning in India include inadequate capacities of municipal bodies, lack of integration between regional plans and area plans and strong state government interventions (Working Group on Environmental Sustainability of Indian Cities 2014). India has a very large share of rural population, with approximately 68.84% people living in rural areas in 2011 (Census of India 2011) and 67% in 2015 (The World Bank Group 2015). However, India is urbanising at a very fast rate, and in the period of 2015–2031, the urbanization rate is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.1% annually (Kumar 2016). In case of a developing country like India, there are issues of high population density, mushrooming slums, urban poverty and homelessness, fiscal limits, deficit of essential infrastructure, rapid industrial development even at high environmental costs, and growing pollution in urban areas (Sivaramakrishnan 2011). The peri-urban and rural areas around the urban centres are especially undergoing haphazard development due to fast and unplanned urbanization. They absorb tremendous development strain due to their adjacency to urban areas and there is a lack of sufficient institutional structure to resolve the associated problems in peri-urban villages (Saxena and Sharma 2015). This makes it crucial for the government to strengthen the regional planning system by formulating an integrated rural–urban development framework and the first step for developing such an efficient system is to understand the governance structure and the institutional networks. Maharashtra is the third most urbanised state in India after Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in terms of numbers, it has the largest urban population in the country (MMRDA 2016, pp. 10). Approximately 45% of the urban population of Maharashtra lives within Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) resulting in many concentrated pockets of development within the region. Development planning of MMR is important because of its significant contribution to the economy of the state and country on one hand (MMRDA 2016, pp. 19), and on the other, the governance deficiencies in the sporadic peri-urban growth which has taken place (Adusumilli 2016b). This study investigates the issues with the existing institutional network of MMR with a focus on two areas, Kalyan and Bhiwandi, which lie outside Greater Mumbai but within the MMR. Kalyan and Bhiwandi are urban centres and the villages around them can be categorised as peri-urban rural areas. These two centres have one of the highest gross densities of population amongst all the urban areas in MMR. Kalyan block also has the largest percentage of rural population in the entire MMR followed by Bhiwandi (MMRDA 2016), thus making both these areas critical cases for an integrated urban–rural development approach. In this study, the approach of institutional mapping, along with governance assessment, helps explore the complexity within the institutional framework. The issues brought forth are important considerations to develop an integrated development planning approach across a region. The conclusions of this study contribute to the discussion on the governance challenges faced in the integrated functioning of numerous planning bodies within a metropolitan region. The significance of institutional mapping as a tool for exploring organizational reforms also gets highlighted, because it is a visual aid to explore functional relationships between the key actors.",4

Among these, freshwater resources have been mainly treated as a regional issue until recently; however, they are increasingly being recognized as a global issue. Similar to other natural resources, the shortage of freshwater resources has become one of the most urgent environmental problems (Bouwer 2000) and it will attract greater attention towards the end of this century. Water use in agricultural production is approximately 70% of total global water use (Shiklomanov 1997). In particular, one-fourth of agricultural water is used in paddy rice cultivation (Chapagain and Hoekstra 2010); agricultural water consumption in paddy rice production has a significant impact on freshwater resources leading up to other environmental problems. Japan is one of the countries that heavily rely on rice as a food source. In spite of high-precipitation, Japan’s freshwater resources per capita are less than half of the global mean value (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 2003). In addition, the geography and climate patterns vary from region to region; thus, freshwater resources depend largely on the seasonal variations and regional characteristics. Paddy rice is cultivated in most regions in Japan and farmers manage the irrigation properly. Water consumption changes daily in each paddy field; intermittent irrigation is employed in many regions where water is introduced once every few days (Kudo et al. 2014). Consequently, the balance of water demand and supply in paddy rice cultivation changes significantly over time and from one region to another. Therefore, the evaluation of the impact of water use in paddy rice production is significant for water resources management in Japan. Many studies have analyzed agricultural water use in rice cultivation to evaluate its impact on water resources (Wopereis et al. 1994, Borrel et al. 1997, Thanawong et al. 2014) using the mass of water as the analysis unit. Furthermore, the water footprint (WF) and virtual water have been introduced as indicators of the impact of water use on water resources. These indicators represent the integrated amounts of water that are input to processes related to certain products and are applied to the analysis of agricultural production (Marano and Filippi 2015, Lovarelli et al. 2016, Cao et al. 2018). However, there are two problems associated with these approaches because they are based on mass analysis. The first is that freshwater resources are most appropriately discussed on the basis of flow rate because water is different from other natural resources in many aspects. First, it is difficult to control the usable amount of water; the supply rate of freshwater depends mainly on uncontrollable precipitation or rivers. Second, water is very cheap with respect to its mass; therefore, economic transportation of water is difficult, except for some drinking water with high added value. Third, water resources are continually regenerated; a large amount of freshwater is circulated in the hydrological cycle through the processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff to the oceans. These characteristics of freshwater lead to regional and temporal shortages or excesses of water. Therefore, the recharge of freshwater resources depends not only on the total mass, but also on the flow rate at certain locations and times (Oki and Kanae 2007). In general, the scarcity of natural resources is represented by the mass concept as the ratio of the amount used to the amount available. However, it is reasonable to present the availability of water resources as the ratio of the usage flow to the usable supply flow. The second problem lies in the comparison of mass-based analysis of water use with total available resource, which is generally discussed as scarcity. Some studies developed various modifications of WF, in which scarcity and flow-based analyses were considered by the regional variability in the accessibility of water resources (Hess et al. 2016, Cao et al. 2017). In particular, the water supply footprint (WSF), proposed by Stoeglehner et al. (2011), is used to compare water usage to the total available amount (carrying capacity) by converting it to the area from which the corresponding water resources can be obtained by precipitation. The converted area is then compared with the total area of land or ocean as the carrying capacity and treated as the impact category for land use in life-cycle assessment (LCA), by converting water use to the area. This indicator is consistent with the term “footprint” that is related to the ecological footprint (EF). Stoeglehner et al. (2011) targeted a wide range of industries but did not focus on agricultural production. Conditions of water resources continuously vary through time and space. In particular, a rapid change in conditions might lead to a significant change in the impact of water use on water resources. Therefore, comparisons between usage flow and supply flow at any given instant are necessary for the precise analysis and evaluation of the impact of water use, including temporal water shortages. WF and WSF are flow-based indicators because they include the time concept and can be analyzed at a certain time period, such as month and year. However, these indicators are also mass-based values because they do not define the momentary flow rate of water use; thus, no comparison is available at any given instant between water use flow and the water supply flow. Consequently, shorter periods such as 1 day have not been employed as the unit of analysis in previous studies (Lovarelli et al. 2016, Casolani et al. 2016). In those studies, water use flow has not been considered explicitly because the flow of actual water use is not essential and does not have any significance. In other words, each water use has time tolerance within which the timing of water use can be changed. Uchida and Hayashi (2014) offered a new definition of water use flow by introducing the concept of acceptable delay defined as the period for which water usage can be delayed. They also defined differential water footprint (DWF) and integral water footprint (IWF) as new indicators of the impact of water use on freshwater resources by introducing the concept of acceptable delay. In particular, DWF indicates continuous water footprint. In practice, water footprint is represented by line graphs, although previous indicators have been represented only by bar graphs. In terms of Japanese rice production, most previous studies focused on the hydrological aspects of water resources. Very few studies have reported water use in rice cultivation (Kato et al. 2009, Kudo et al. 2014, Maruyama et al. 1985) and no study in Japan has discussed water use based on flow and in relation to water resource scarcity. As described above, the continuous analysis of water use in paddy rice cultivation, which is comparable to total usable water flow resources, is significant for maintaining regional water balance. DWF and IWF are suitable indicators for solving these problems; however, they have not been applied to rice production. This study aims to evaluate the impact of water use on water resources in paddy rice cultivation, focusing on unsteadiness, instantaneous high impacts, and regional differences, using DWF and IWF as appropriate indicators to analyze WF continuously.",3

Most analyses, allowing for changes in the original parameters from estimating the regression equation, applied a linearized version of Smeed’s law to several countries; e.g., Smith (1999) to OECD country data. Recently, many studies have applied the law to the data of developing countries, including Emenalo et al. (1977) to Zambia; Al-Matawah and Jadaan (2010) and Bener et al. (2010) to the UAE, Jordan, and Qatar, and Ponnaluri (2012) and Valli (2005) to India. Some have found that this law has poor explanatory power and have investigated the changes from year to year by estimating cross-sectional data, such as Ponnaluri (2012) or Smith (1999). Others have attempted to extend this law to more complex functional forms; e.g., Koren and Borsos (2010) and Hesse et al. (2016). As for Japan, Tamura (2013) has found that this relationship, now known as Smeed’s law, is not stable over time in Japan. This line of inquiry attempts to explain the relationships between three variables: the number of fatalities, the number of vehicles, and the population. Of course, several models also used to explain the number of fatalities in traffic accidents do not refer to Smeed’s law. For example, Grimm and Treibich (2013) investigated the determinants of fatalities in various kinds of traffic accidents and found that income explained any differences. One question about the stability of Smeed’s law is that it does not incorporate safety improvements in the automobiles involved in traffic accidents or any advances in medical technology. For example, in one of the earliest studies, Pantridge and Geddes (1967) included cardiology units and found that the time to hospital was one of the most crucial factors affecting patient survival. Jones and Bentham (1995) also investigated the effect of time to hospital. Technological advances in automobile safety and emergency rescue at traffic accidents can also affect survival. For example, since the implementation of laws requiring the installation of airbags and the provision of quicker transportation to hospital, the rate of survival of even seriously injured patients has increased. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that Smeed’s law holds in Japan and whether there is a stable relationship between the per capita number of fatalities and per capita registered vehicles using prefecture-level data between 1988 and 2016. We consider the possible structural changes in the parameters associated with Smeed’s law by specifying time and prefectural dummy variables and a time trend. Subsequently, after extending the original Smeed’s law model to incorporate technical advances, we reformulate it to estimate whether the distance to hospital serves as an explanatory variable. As an extension, and to understand better the results of the estimated coefficients, we then decompose the fatalities per capita into the number of fatalities per accident and traffic accidents per capita. However, as the results for the decomposed dependent variables can be difficult to understand, we consider possible reverse causality between the distance to hospital and the number of traffic accidents. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reformulates and decomposes Smeed’s law and gives an extension including the distance to hospital. Section 3 decomposes fatalities per capita into two parts and estimates the relationships between these related variables. We conclude by discussing the empirical implications of the relationship between a stable Smeed’s law and the role of hospitals.",

This is partly due to various policy instruments, chiefly Feed-In Tariffs (FIT) and Renewable Portfolio Standards that give preferential treatments to renewables over conventional power plants (Carley et al. 2016). In Japan, the FIT scheme for renewable electricity was introduced in July 2012 with considerable effects on increases in renewable capacities across the country. Such growth of renewables in OECD (the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries has been dominated by solar PV (photovoltaics) and wind power, while hydropower remains mostly stagnant because hydropower has reached its capacity limits in most OECD countries (IEA 2017). Japan’s FIT scheme has also brought about a predominant growth in solar PV, with a cumulative electricity generation under FIT of 91,287 GWh (68% of FIT total, as of November 2016) compared to small-scale hydropowerFootnote 1 generations of 4994 GWh (3.7% of total). Consequently, to moderate such a rapid growth in solar PV and alleviate financial burdens on consumers, sale prices for solar PV have been successively cut from 32 to 40 Yen/kWh (depending on the power scale) in 2012 to 21–24 Yen/kWh in 2019, whereas small-scale hydropower has remained at 24–34 Yen/kWh.Footnote 2 The low growth of hydropower in Japan can mainly be attributed to the capacity limits similar to other OECD countries. Nonetheless, potential sites for small hydropower are considered still numerous even though total capacities are limited. For instance, NEF (2009) showed approximately 1600 such sites with a total capacity of 644 MW (2683 GWh/yearFootnote 3), while another survey by the Ministry of the Environment (MOE 2011), which used a different methodology from NEF, estimated vastly larger potentials of 14,440 MW for small hydropower in rivers and canals. Therefore, the slow dissemination of hydropower must also have some other causes. For instance, new installation of a hydropower plant normally requires statutory permissions from regulatory bodies for a new water use. This judgement process is rigorous and time consuming because careful coordination is necessary with often intensive and competing water uses by existing stakeholders. In addition, the lack of specialists to operate a hydropower plant sometimes hinders small stakeholders such as local municipalities or irrigation water-users’ associations from introducing hydropower (Goto et al. 2012). Despite these concerns, a number of successful projects for running small hydropower plants across Japan have demonstrated positive effects in uniting and revitalizing local communities and economies. One example is a project in Itoshiro village, Gifu Prefecture in Central Japan, where local community members are involved in running waterwheels and using generated electricity for their community-building facilities, such as a café and a food-processing plant, which attract numerous visitors for eco-tours (Goto et al. 2014). This suggests the need to investigate the effects of conducting small hydropower projects on local economies. Therefore, this is the first objective of the present study. In addition, as countries face the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the future, promoting renewable energy is also motivated by carbon-free efforts. Likewise, hydropower is driven by the potential energy of water, which in turn originates from hydrological cycles powered by solar energy and, therefore, requires little fossil fuel for operation. Furthermore, implementing renewable energy projects can create economic benefits for the respective local communities through reducing the import of energy for consumption, as well as allowing them to sell carbon credits to potential customers in large cities (Nakamura et al. 2012). These arguments motivate detailed investigations into the life-cycle GHG emissions that specifically target small-scale hydropower. Therefore, this is the second objective of our study. One approach to investigate life-cycle GHG emissions is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and a number of studies have applied this method to small hydropower projects (e.g. Gallagher et al. 2015; Hanafi and Riman 2015). Whereas LCA can take engineering details into consideration, evaluations of environmental impacts such as GHG emissions usually rely on databases installed in LCA software with data often drawn from European or North American sources. On the other hand, another approach is an input–output (IO) analysis that reflects regional characteristics by employing an IO table of the respective regions. For example, Moriizumi et al. (2015) and Nakano et al. (2016) investigated life-cycle GHG emissions of small hydropower using the Japan’s National IO table. Their studies also implemented detailed surveys of hydropower operators and revealed the economic effects and GHG emissions characteristic of small hydropower. In contrast, an alternative approach of the present study is to draw information from statistical databases of many small-scale hydropower plants across Japan, estimate cost profiles of each plant by standardized assumptions, aggregate them into two power-scale categories in each region to form input coefficient vectors, and then evaluate the economic effects and GHG emissions using an interregional input–output (IRIO) analysis. This approach may have some shortcomings in reflecting detailed input structures of small hydropower when compared to the survey-based studies mentioned above, but it will nevertheless enable evaluations of GHG emissions according to power scales (small versus micro-hydropower) in each region. Furthermore, it will simultaneously enable investigations into the impacts of small-scale hydropower projects on regional economies, which is the first objective mentioned above. In summary, this study aims to investigate the economic effects and GHG emissions of small-scale hydropower at a regional scale through an integrated approach of IRIO analyses. In doing so, we opt to employ an IRIO table at the prefectural level, which could investigate inter-prefectural transactions spanning across Japan (i.e. inter-prefectural spillover effects). This feature is beneficial because our target, small-scale hydropower, actually includes hydropower plants of up to several thousand kW, whose construction and operation often involve specialized materials (such as turbines) and services (such as repair works) that are often imported from other industrialized prefectures. Furthermore, we examine not only the usual backward linkage effects (multiplier effects through productions of raw materials and services), but also the income linkage effects (those through increases in incomes and consumptions of households), for which the inter-prefectural spillover effects are expected to be more significant still.",2
3.0,2.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,29 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-018-0099-8,"Export diversification, CO2 emissions and EKC: panel data analysis of 125 countries",June 2019,Hongbo Liu,Hanho Kim,Justin Choe,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Global warming and climate change exert great challenges to world environment in the twenty-first century (Saboori et al. 2016). The 2015 Paris conference on climate change acted as a threshold to encourage reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to deal with deteriorating global warming circumstances. International Panel Conference on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report pointed out that human activities exert great influence on climate system obviously (Özokcu and Özdemir 2017). Besides being a natural phenomenon, climate change is claimed to relate to human activity and economic development. CO2 emissions are commonly regarded as one of the major sources of global warming, due to the large amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere that came from fossil energy consumption (Friedl and Getzner 2003). Potential threats deriving from climate change has created a debate on how to balance the expenditure and benefit of controlling anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Holtz-Eakin and Selden 1995). In order to prohibit further destabilization of biosphere, CO2 emissions should be under urgent and serious control (Jayanthakumaran et al. 2012). In order to balance the relationship between the speed of economic advancement and environmental degradation, especially greenhouse gas emissions, we are in need of innovative mechanism to observe possible correlations between two factors. This current study proposed to use EKC analysis, which adopted panel database to analyze a reduced-form relationship between per capita GDP, export diversification and CO2 emissions. Environment Kuznets curve (hereafter EKC) is one of the most influential models for analyzing the relationship between environmental condition and economic development. EKC simulates a hypothesized inverted U-shaped correlation between diversified indices of environmental degradation and social economic development: pollution emission at first rises with economic growth, after going through a certain turning point, the trend reverses, with further economic development, environment condition gets improved. The correlation between pollution and trade could be explained by the renowned three effects theory: scale effect, composition effect and technique effect. “Scale effect” has the definition as an increase in a certain type of pollution emissions is supposed to relate to a higher income level, under the background of holding other factors constant. In detail, scale effect measures the degree of an increase of economic size on pollution. “Technique effect” is characterized as the transformation in emission intensity due to adaptation of advanced technologies, for example clean production mechanism. “Composition effect” is designated as a change in pollution emission, due to the adjustment in the percentage of pollution intensive production in GDP. Composition effect functions as a measure to test the influence of a transformation in industrial composition (Cole 2004; Copeland and Taylor 1995). Among empirical tests of EKC, two groups of variables are needed, pollution indices and economic development ones. Pollution itself is a conceptually simple idea, however, the choice of pollutants could be perplexed due to its wide scope and uncertain adaptation to economic analysis (Brajer et al. 2011). EKC concludes what is well understood and applied as the inverted U-shaped relationship between pollution and economic development: environmental deterioration first increases as a country’s economic development increases, then after reaching a turning point, environment situation starts to improve. This study proposed to use an intermediate approach, which adopted panel database to analyze a reduce-form relationship between per capita GDP, export diversification and CO2 emissions. The employment of export diversification into the existing vast majority of explorations of EKC studies permits the testification of possible relationship between trade structure and pollution, especially under the background that most former researches focusing on economic volumes (GDP, trade volume) as main indicators for economic development. Export diversification is an important reflection of the structure of trade and economic development, therefore in a research concerning analyzing the relationship between economic development and pollution, export diversification should not be neglected. Apart from theoretical implications, estimating the correlation between diversification and pollution is supposed to remind policy makers to diverse part of their attention on the quantity of trade and GDP to the structure perspective when dealing with pollution related issues. The results of this research demonstrate that CO2 emission and GDP constitute an inverted U-shaped curve, while CO2 were positively related with export diversification in the 125 panel country analysis. In order to further enrich the research of EKC, especially in trade discipline, the present work is proposed to incorporate export product diversification and market diversification into existing EKC model. Put it another way, understanding whether trade structure and pollution are correlated within EKC hypothesis both theoretically and empirically will be one of the themes of this research. Distinctive to structural models, reduced-form analysis does not require a priori knowledge on parameters that will be adopted (Holtz-Eakin and Selden 1995). This paper contributes to a number of strands in recent literatures concerning sustainable development and trade. First, by collecting and reorganizing a relative complex panel database including economic development proxies, export diversification as well as pollution emission, it enables the possibility of analyzing the complicated relationship between export diversification and sustainable development. Second, by taking advantage of a reduced-form EKC model, the current study does not rely on strong theoretical assumptions that are indispensible in models that use the structural form. Third, by adopting interaction terms, it is possible to increase estimation robustness and model efficiency, besides, it enables the comparison among country groups based on income descrepancy. Lastly, this present research is supposed to function as a reminding to policy makers: when it comes to sustainable development, compared to economy volumes which have long been the focus, economic structure such as export diversification needs better attention. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 displays literature review concerning former studies of EKC theory and related econometric technology.

Using plant-level panel data, we focus on the silk-reeling industry with modified technology in Hida and Mino in Gifu prefecture, Japan in the early Meiji period to measure total factor productivity (TFP) growth and estimate the production function.Footnote 1 From the estimation results, we obtain explanatory factors of TFP and each area’s technical efficiency (TE) measured by the stochastic frontier model (SFM). Through the empirical analysis, we examine common driving factors for industrialization in the least developed countries, such as Japan, in late nineteenth century. Further, from a regional and historical perspective, we explore the reasons that allowed Japan to modernize, that is, exhibit modern economic growth (MEG) the earliest among Asian countries. During Japan’s MEG, the silk-reeling industry played a significant role in generating both foreign currency and domestic job opportunities. According to Yamazawa (1984), the share of raw silk by export value was 37.7% on average in 1874–1883, and the largest share in industrial products—20.5%—was retained even in 1927–1936.Footnote 2 In silk reeling, domestic farming provides the cocoon, which is an intermediate input, and capital inputs used in the production line are domestically produced as well. Japan’s early MEG required substantial amounts of foreign currency, and silk reeling seems to have been one of the few industries that contributed to the improvement of its current account. This industry also created abundant employment for women, who were often in the weakest position to develop economically. The number of female operators in machine-reeling factories increased from 17,000 in 1879 to 117,000 in 1896.Footnote 3 As the employment share of machine-reeling factories in 1896 was approximately 16% of the entire manufacturing sector, the industry played an important role in creating employment for women in this period.Footnote 4 The key to obtaining foreign currency and creating employment for unskilled workers involved the continued long-term expansion of production. The continuous enhancement of TFP was, thus, crucial to avoid diminishing returns. Yamazawa (1984) describes the export-led development of raw silk as similar to the export-oriented industrialization commonly observed in East Asian countries after World War II, rather than the staples thesis, which attributes development to rapid technological progress and the rise of productivity realized in the process.Footnote 5 As Table 1 illustrates, more rapid expansion of silk output and employment is observed as a nationwide phenomenon in 1879–1896 than in other periods. Gifu and Nagano prefectures, as Table 1 indicates, were regions that saw the earliest spread and settlement of machine-reeling technology for silk production. In 1879, there were 158 and 354 machine-reeling factories in Gifu and Nagano prefectures, respectively, among the 666 factories nationwide.Footnote 6 The silk mills of the Maebashi clan, Ono-gumi and Ministry of Engineering, which had the most advanced machine-reeling technology imported from Italy and France, were found over 1870–1872. Subsequently, machine-reeling technology was rapidly diffused in both prefectures in the late 1870s. Kiyokawa (2009) insists a relatively small technical gap existed between elements in the silk-reeling industry inherent to Japan and those imported from Europe. Technologies transferred from developed countries could be efficiently and economically modified, thereby spreading more rapidly. Kiyokawa (2009) states that the pot used to simmer the cocoons is ceramic, rather than metal; the machine is made from a mixture of wood and iron, instead of only iron; and the waterwheel is the power source, instead of steam.Footnote 7 Machine-reeling factories with modified technologies in Gifu and Nagano prefectures greatly expanded their raw silk production in the 1870s–1880s. Kato (1976) presents seven factories with French technologies, seven with Italian technologies, and 13 factories with a mixed French–Italian style in Nagano prefecture in the 1870s (see Kato 1976, p. 105–107). Although only two factories in Gifu prefecture were found in the Italian style in the 1870s, many machine-reeling techniques seem to have originated from Nagano prefecture, which is adjacent to Gifu prefecture.Footnote 8 The rapid expansion of the silk industry was stimulated by the increase of exports to Europe and the United States. Shipment volumes of raw silk to Yokohama from Shinano doubled, while shipments from Mino and Hida increased by 2.5 times and 1.1 times, respectively, between 1976 and 1983.Footnote 9 In 1886, the ratio of export volume to raw silk production in Nagano and Gifu prefectures was 97% and 102%, respectively (City of Yokohama 1961, p. 492). In both prefectures, the growth of output, labor, and labor productivity are concurrently observed in 1879–1896 in Table 1, which suggests that, not only quantity expansion, but also efficiency improvement occurred using increased international exports as a trigger. Several studies measure the performance of the silk-reeling industry with modified technologies. Otsuka (1990) compares the return on capital between the machine-reeling and Zakuri (sedentary-reeling) segments in the silk-reeling industry in 1879 and 1888 in Nagano and Gunma prefectures, confirming that the ratio in the Zakuri segment is larger than in machine-reeling in 1879. However, in 1888, the former is smaller than the latter.Footnote 10 The machine-reeling segment became more competitive than the Zakuri segment by the middle of the Meiji era. Otsuka (1990) calculates the growth rate of TFP for the machine-reeling segment in Hirano village in Nagano prefecture in 1878–1911 using the growth accounting method, concluding that the growth rate in 1878–1886 was the highest. Shintani (1976) estimates the Cobb–Douglas type of production function using plant-level cross-sectional data covering 1888–1930 in silk-reeling plants in Nagano prefecture. The author uses a production function that considers the amount of raw silk production as the output, and the number of cocoons, the number of basins, and total working days as production factors for his estimation. The measured results of growth accounting using the estimated parameters indicate that the contribution of the number of cocoons to the output growth was the largest production factor in 1904–1924. Meanwhile, the contribution of TFP began to rise after 1917, and occupied the greatest share in 1924–1930. Minami and Makino (1995) measure the expected profit–capital ratio (EPCR) in the Zakuri, ordinary-reeling, and multiple-reeling machine segments in 1888–1934 by assuming typical model factories.Footnote 11 Although the real EPCRs of Zakuri and ordinary-reeling machines were nearly equal in 1888, in 1908, the ratio of the latter clearly exceeded the ratio of the former because of technological improvements. This phenomenon could be explained as the progress made in production of readily available cocoons, an increase in the number of spools per operator, the development of wooden iron-reeling machines, and improvement in engines.Footnote 12 The real EPCR of ordinary-reeling machines declined in 1888–1928. However, the EPCR of multiple-reeling machines was more than four times that of ordinary-reeling machines because of improvements in raw silk quality in 1934. Ono (1986) highlights the importance of small-scale innovation for the development of the silk-reeling industry as the source of rising labor productivity during the prewar period. Such innovation occurred in the process of modifying borrowing technology from developed countries to suit factor endowment in Japan. Ono (1986) calculates the growth rate of TFP in machine filatures in 1901–1935 using the growth accounting method, confirming that the TFP growth rate could explain the majority of the labor productivity growth rates in 1901–1905, 1926–1930, and 1931–1935.Footnote 13 Meanwhile, these works measure and compare only the aggregated profit rate or the TFP growth rate in traditional, modified, or imported technology segments, or decompose some measured indexes to individual factors. In the process of modifying the imported technology, numerous technologies and institutions are continuously chosen for support. However, those studies do not clearly examine the causal relationship between performance and continuous technological choices in the silk-reeling industry. Additionally, previous studies, except for Otsuka’s (1990), do not cover the late 1870s to early 1880s, when rapid diffusion of technology imported from developed countries has been realized in the machine-reeling segment. This period corresponds to the time just before the start of the MEG, which makes it worthwhile to consider the ability to absorb international currency in the silk-reeling industry by empirically estimating the development factors.Footnote 14 Although Arimoto et al. (2014) use plant-level data in the machine-reeling segment to estimate the Cobb–Douglas production function, and confirm that agglomeration and selection impact labor productivity and TFP, their study is limited to 1908–1915. For this study, we construct plant-level panel data for Gifu prefecture in 1878–1883. Our panel data set includes various types of plant-level information, including the power source, ways of boiling cocoons, the number of male and female operators, the county and village where the plants were founded, and the plant’s shareholding structure, as well as information on output and production factors. One of the most important contributions for our study is to estimate production function using plant-level panel data during early Meiji era, which is prepared in a format available for econometric analysis. First, we measure the machine-reeling segment’s TFP growth rate during the Meiji era (1878–1911) in Gifu prefecture by combining our panel dataset with the Department of Agriculture in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce’s census dataset. Few studies address the early Meiji era in the periods examined. According to Yasuba (1967), a relatively large measurement error exists in the aggregated production quantity in the early Meiji era’s silk-reeling segment. This is because of underdeveloped data-collecting methods and missing data at the regional level, and thus, it is impossible to obtain reliable macro-level data. Consequently, we use plant-level panel data on Gifu prefecture to avoid aggregation and measurement biases as much as possible. Next, we confirm whether these plant attributes affect TFP by estimating the conventional production function using Blundell and Bond’s (1998) dynamic panel estimation method to avoid the estimation bias caused by endogeneity. As we need to estimate many parameters of the production function using the panel data, Blundell and Bond’s (1998) generalized method of moments (GMM) could provide constituent estimators. Finally, we measure the TE by the SFM using the estimation results of the GMM, and compare the TE between the Mino and Hida in Gifu prefecture. The estimated TE includes factors that influence TFP other than explanatory variables in the production function. It is impossible to estimate parameters by adding regional dummy variables to explanatory variables in the production function because such variables are constant throughout the period examined. To confirm the regional specific factors that impede rapid diffusion, we should compare the TE, which suggests the level of the technological spread, between areas in the period just after Japan’s unification. Precedent works that focus on the machine-reeling segment in the early Meiji era in Gifu prefecture are those by Hayakawa (2002) and Negishi (1988). First, Hayakawa (2002) introduces the contents of the yearbook in the late 1870s and 1880s made by the industry division of the Gifu Prefectural Government Office, and verifies the importance of the yearbook—which includes extensive data and descriptions—for research on the machine-reeling segment in Gifu prefecture in the early Meiji era. Negishi (1988) analyzes the performance of machine-reeling factories in Tanada and Takayama, towns in Hida, using regional data from the 1870s to 1880s. The aggregated profit per 100 kin in machine-reeling factories declined from 300 to 70 yen in 1876–1885, while the profit of factories in constant operation rose from 12 to 87 yen in 1878–1885 (see Negishi 1988, p. 479, 483). The author mentions that, although Takayama’s factories were exposed to tough business conditions in this period, some of them profited by increasing their labor productivity. Although Negishi’s (1988) pioneering work focuses on the machine-reeling segment in Gifu prefecture in the early Meiji era, the research area is limited to Takayama, and this work does not definitively analyze some factors that affect profit and labor productivity. Thus, we expand our research coverage to all areas in Gifu prefecture, and use a panel econometric analysis to empirically confirm explanatory factors for TFP, which are plant attributes, the technological or institutional choice, and location requirement.",1

P. Wong,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Multinational firms are important players in global markets. Multinationals are different from purely national firms because, in general, they are flexible and able to move activities between their plants across countries. The ability of firms with foreign direct investment to arbitrage institutional restrictions such as tax systems, financial regulations and remittance forms, creates economic advantanges which can be transformed into higher global profits. In general, direct foreign investment can be seen as an economic process that determines the volume and direction of resources transferred across borders (see, for example, Bevan and Estrin 2004; Navaretti and Venables 2004; Brakman et al. 2006; Wong 2006; Mackinnon and Cumbers 2007; Broll et al. 2010; Vuksic 2014; Hwang and Lee 2015). International direct capital flows represent a major source of financing of economic activity in less developed countries. Direct investment inflows may bring increased employment, new technologies, more international trade and higher wages in the host country. These effects are especially relevant for countries in transition and for developing economies. This is one reason why countries try to promote inflows for foreign capital.Footnote 1 On the other hand, it is often argued that country risk, weak instituions and imperfect enforcement mechanisms adversely affect direct capital flows (see, for example Lucas 1990; Janeba 2002; Markusen 2002; Acemoglu et al. 2002). International firms often have only limited legal recourse if the host country government chooses to default on a debt contract or to expropriate a real or financial asset. Therefore, in order to evaluate the global business environment, multinational firms must assess the country’s risk profile by studying the linkage between the country’s economic policy and the degree of economic risk. This is especially important for firms investing in developing economies (see, for example, Hayakawa et al. 2013). To cope with country risk, international firms organize and plan foreign investment as a sequential process that determines the direction and the volume of resources transferred to other countries. Our study theoretically analyzes the impact of market transparency on resource allocation and profitability of foreign investment. Transparency is modelled as the provision of a noisy signal conveying information about the institutional and market conditions in the foreign country. The notion of transparency used in our study is adopted from the work by Eckwert and Zilcha (2001, 2003). They characterize market transparency using a criterion which is conceptually related to the literature that emerged from the seminal works by Blackwell (1953); Hirshleifer (1971, 1975) and Schlee (2001); Krebs (2005). The observable signal can be interpreted as being related to the foreign country’s choice of international trade policy, monetary policy, participation in international organizations, an improvement in the index of economic freedom, better quality of country’s institutions or regional trade agreements. The signal thus captures the country’s institutional and market conditions. The foreign country is considered more transparent if the signal conveys more precise information about the country’s economic and political environment. We find that higher transparency may increase or decrease the volume of direct foreign investment. The impact depends on the shape of the total profit function of the multinational firm. However, the total expected firm profits always increase with more transparency. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 delineates the model of a multinational firm under risk. Section 3 introduces the notion of transparency. In Sect. 4, we analyze the link between foreign country transparency and the firm’s international allocation decision.",

As a result of its continuous efforts, the economy has grown rapidly; though there were some fluctuations, the country has achieved an average real GDP growth rate of more than 6% over the last three decades. Per capita GDP was $790 in 1990 at 2010 constant prices; in 2015, it has more than tripled to $2630. This high economic growth was accompanied by a substantial change in the structure of economy. In 1990, the agricultural sector accounted for 34% of total GDP; but the share has decreased gradually to 16% in 2015, though the sector has still dominated in employment by accounting for more than half of total employment due to its labor-intensive nature. Meanwhile, the industry sector, including construction, raised its GDP share from 25 to 40%. However, the manufacturing sector has stagnated as its share has remained almost constant at around 7–9%. The industry sector accounted for 10% of total employment, while the services sector 32% of total employment in 2015. Over the last two decades, Bhutan has made tremendous progress in education. According to the World Development Indicators (World Bank 2018), total government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP has risen from 5.5% in 2000 to 7.4% in 2014. As a result, the number of teachers in primary schools has increased from around 2000 in 2000 to more than 4000 in the 2010s. Net primary school enrollment ratio has increased from 57% in 2000 to 83% in 2015, while net secondary school enrollment ratio has risen prominently from 21 to 63%. This level of enrollment ratio is comparable to other SAARC countries.Footnote 1 As a result, almost 90% of the population aged 15–24 are literate. Over the same period, poverty has declined substantially. According to the 2003 Poverty Analysis Report (National Statistics Bureau 2003), 32% of the population lived under the national poverty line in 2003; but the incidence of poverty has decreased to 12% in 2012 (National Statistics Bureau 2012a). There is, however, a substantial difference in poverty between urban and rural areas; while the poverty incidence was only 2% in urban areas, it was 17% in rural areas. Meanwhile, expenditure inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has declined from 0.42 in 2003 to 0.36 in 2012.Footnote 2 Education is considered to be one of the principal means for reducing poverty and inequality. However, despite substantial progress in education, 17% of rural populations are still under the poverty line and expenditure inequality has remained at a high level. There is also a high educational inequality among people and between urban and rural areas. Against this background, this study examines the roles of education in expenditure inequality in Bhutan using the Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS) in 2007 and 2012, which was conducted by the National Statistical Bureau (NSB). The analysis is performed in an urban and rural context because there is a large difference between urban and rural areas in living standards and the level of educational attainment. By employing the Theil and the Gini indices, this study first analyzes the level and trend of inequality in per capita expenditure (hereafter, expenditure inequality) between 2007 and 2012.Footnote 3 It then examines the level and trend of inequality in the number of years of education (hereafter, educational inequality) using the Gini index. Next, to see the effect of education on the urban–rural difference in mean per capita expenditure, this study performs a Blinder–Oaxaca composition analysis. Finally, it examines, in a location-education hierarchical framework, the role of education in expenditure inequality by the hierarchical decomposition method developed by Akita and Miyata (2013). To measure educational inequality, the study employs the Gini index because a household with no education is given 0 year of education and thus, the Theil indices cannot be calculated. The Theil and the Gini indices satisfy several desirable properties as a measure of inequality such as anonymity principle, income homogeneity, population homogeneity and the Pigou–Dalton principle of transfers (Anand 1983). In addition to these properties, the Theil indices can be decomposed additively by population subgroups, that is, overall inequality as measured by the Theil indices can be given by the sum of the within- and between-group components (Bourguignon 1979; Shorrocks 1980). However, the Gini index cannot be decomposed in this way, as the residual component emerges when the distributions of population subgroups overlap. Since we are unable to access income data, this study uses expenditure data. Expenditure data are usually more reliable than income data in developing countries since households in higher income groups tend to underreport their incomes.",

Metropolitan governance in India presents a unique planning model with two different hierarchical authorities—a metropolitan organisation and the independent local governments. This study highlights the unique functioning of this system as against many available global examples. It delves into relevant literature (master plan, development plan, government reports, etc.) with related national and state legislation to present its arguments. The number of metropolitan cities has increased sharply from 35 in 2001 to 53 in 2011. Presently, the metropolitan cities account for almost 42.6% of the total urban population. The increase in metropolitan cities has created substantial economic opportunities while raising greater environmental threats and social degeneration. These risks affect negatively to accessing education and affordable health care, freedom of expression, the rule of law, respect for diversity, protection from violence, and preservation of the environment as essential dimensions of human development and well being (Dias and Sudarshan 2007). The resulting issues are complex and multivariate and require multiple agencies and institutions to manage and oversee the entire process. As such, no single discipline allows an integrated view of a useful understanding of this complex institutional function (Jans 2007). The inferences of governance may contribute in this understanding. The definition of governance is varied, but there are some common constituent components. In general, these include rule of law, democratisation, human rights, sound legal and judicial system, public administration reform, public financial management, decentralisation, enhancement of civil society, anticorruption, transparency, and accountability (Biswas and Maurya 2018). Proper governance involves in articulating rules of behaviour with respect to the collective affairs of a political community and allocating resources among community members (Healey 1997). Governance can also be viewed as the inter-organisational networks, in the institutional framework. It may be understood as the processes that regulate the flow of feedback to and within the social system (Koliba et al. 2011). In India, independent governing institutions administer all cities within a metropolitan region. The challenge for India is to create collaboration among these institutions and ensure the holistic development of the region. Governance of large cities involves diverse institutional actors, both public (Municipal Corporations, Parastatal agencies, State and Central governments, and the judiciary) and private institutions (corporate, the private company, and organised civil society). Some of the responsibilities assigned to public actors overlap among each other, which defy citizens to access urban service and address their grievance (Zerah et al. 2011). It is certainly not easy to achieve a regulatory framework of independent metropolitan governance with autonomous local administration, particularly when governance in Indian cities is muddled with the ineffective institutional capability and inefficient governance procedures (The Mckinsey Global Institute 2010; Coleman 2018). The questions underpinning this paper are: What is the background of the evolution of metropolitan governance? What are the roles and responsibilities of the metropolitan governing organisation? What are the administrative and institutional relationships between the metropolitan and local governance in India? The research uses case study approach to substantiate its arguments, institutional mapping to understand the relationship between governance and power structure, and historical institutional and governance analysis to determine the reasons and circumstances affecting decision-making processes. Discussions on two case studies enlighten on the efficiency of governance and explain the successes and failures of the chosen systems. The paper has considered all six major metropolitan regions in India and identified Chennai and Kolkata from the state of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal for detailed analysis and critical evaluation. The reasons for selecting these two regions are various; first, Chennai and Kolkata share the traditional legacy of colonial city regions. These two city regions are also recognised as two of the four indigenous metropolitan cities in India. Both the cities have rich educational, cultural and traditional history. Second, varying degree of politico-administrative structure exists in these two states. West Bengal had been under the communist government for over 3 decades. The party lost the assembly election to a regional party in the year 2011, while Tamil Nadu switched its ruling party often between its two regional strong political alternatives who follows similar political ideology of social liberalism. The different political atmosphere contributed varied administration and governance framework. Third, both regions exhibit diverse socio-economic and development achievements. For example, Chennai ranked with high Human Development Index (HDI) indicators, while Kolkata ranked with medium HDI indicators (State Planning Commission 2018). Fourth is the difficulty of analysing much bigger and intricate cities like Mumbai and Delhi. The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) oversees an area of 4355 km2. Delhi being the national capital, experience enhanced influence of the national government, whereas the national government directly undertakes planning activities through the institutional process. Fifth, Chennai and Kolkata have less bureaucratic complications than the cities of Delhi and Mumbai, which makes it easier for data acquisition. The research contributes to presenting a critical argument on metropolitan governance and the Urban Local Body’s (ULB’s) decentralisation through the cases of Chennai and Kolkata. The emphasis of the research is on the synthesis and “big picture” analysis through legislative discussions, case studies, logical flow and an assertive set of conclusions. The paper highlights the relevant sections of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992’s (74th CAA)Footnote 1 and its contribution in shaping metropolitan governance structure in India. Researchers in contemporary literature often ignore this very important contribution of the 74th CAA. The paper provides a “fresh” thought on it through a discussion of the existing situations.",4

Several models have developed multi-criteria techniques called as land suitability evaluation (LSE) for integrated land evaluation objectives such as agricultural management (Hayashi 2000), environmental management (Hill et al. 2005; Crossman et al. 2007), forestry planning (Bettinger et al. 2005), land use change (Chanhda et al. 2010), sustainable development (Chandio et al. 2015), urban disasters (Wang et al. 2008), and urban vulnerability (Zhang et al. 2015). Spatial multi-criteria methods have also become the most useful methods for land use and environmental planning (Chen et al. 2010). Spatial techniques and quantitative models integrate the concept of ranking and weighting the suitability classes during multi-criteria evaluation. Multi-criteria evaluation methods employ a number of qualitative or statistical methods, such as analytical hierarchy process (AHP), analytical network process (ANP), logistic regression (LR), multivariate statistical approach (MSA), weighted linear combination (WLC), and ordered weighted average (OWA) (Gong et al. 2012; Ferretti and Pomarico 2013a; Mansouri Daneshvar et al. 2017a). A well-known quantitative method of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) includes the hierarchical structure of decision factors and making comparisons between possible pairs in a matrix to give a weight for each factor and a consistency ratio (Mansouri Daneshvar 2014a). This method, first developed by Saaty (1980), provides a flexible and easily understood way of analyzing complex problems. The AHP method provides a multi-attribute technique that can be applied to land evaluation techniques (Ennaji et al. 2018). The integration of the AHP method and a data combination technique allows the user to make the land suitability evaluation for a specific site selection by overlaying the weighting values calculated for each factor (e.g., Thapa and Murayama 2008; Şener et al. 2010; Uyan 2013; Ennaji et al. 2018). Malczewski (2006) has declared that the combination of multi-criteria analysis and geographical information system (GIS) is a powerful tool for land suitability assessments to locate suitable sites. GIS is a robust technique to combine data and make land suitability evaluation (LSE) certifying the sustainability of decision alternatives (Boroushaki and Malczewski 2010). Sustainable decision alternatives should respect spatially to all ecological capabilities in each area. In this regard, physio-ecological and spatiotemporal characteristics of each suitable area concerning carrying capacity concept may provide a sustainability tool by recognizing a sustainable threshold of development (Graymore et al. 2008). According to Prato (2009), ecological carrying capacity (Eco.CC) is the maximum population of an area that can be supported by users without damaging its function or reducing its capacity. The Eco.CC as the maximum level or threshold limit of visiting was developed by Cifuentes (1992) and further explained and applied by extensive researches (Zacarias et al. 2011). Concerning the aforementioned models and methods, this paper aims to present an integrated multi-factor procedure, including AHP and GIS, to make the layouts of LSE and Eco.CC in a touristic region, northeastern Iran. The similar integrated multi-factor procedure has been examined in some recent studies. For instance, Muhsin et al. (2018) have used GIS-based multi-criteria analysis and AHP to perform industrial site selection and agricultural land suitability evaluation in Bangladesh. Purnamasari et al. (2019) have assessed land suitability for specific crop production using an integrated multi-criteria approach comprised of remotely sensed (RS) data, GIS, and AHP in Indonesia. Accordingly, Akther et al. (2019) have used a GIS-based multi-criteria approach in combination with AHP to select suitable sites for a biogas plant to generate energy from municipal waste in Dhaka City. Regarding tourism assessment, Gumusay et al. (2016) have made a study to determine suitable areas for developing tourism along the shoreline of Istanbul using AHP and GIS integration. Furthermore, Masih et al. (2018) have evaluated the ecological capability and tourism development of a mountainous zone of Iran using multi-criteria assessment and integration of AHP and GIS. In this research, the LSE map relates to the spatial suitability of the region for all touristic and recreational levels. According to Makhdoum (2008), recreational levels in Iran depended on aggressive or conservative uses of a touristic region, which describes locally extensive or intensive suitability of touristic activities. To reach an integrated analysis of layers, we utilize ArcGIS software. Meanwhile, to weigh the layers, we use the systematic method of AHP. By making LSE map, we can detect the spatial suitability zones for tourism and recreation. Then to present a novel idea, a statistical procedure called as ecological carrying capacity (Eco.CC) is carried out to estimate the ecological capacity of each suitable zone to reveal the optimum ability of the zones to absorb tourists and develop recreational activities. Without the appraisal of spatial and statistical characterization of ecological resources, touristic development could not be assumed as a logic way, especially in developing countries. We think that this ecological research procedure can be developed logically for rapid evaluation of tourism in the less known and inaccessible regions of non-western developing countries such as Iran.",17

Batabyal,Peter Nijkamp,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economists and regional scientists have both demonstrated that irrespective of whether one looks at a developed or a developing country, there are a number of inequalities between the various regions that make up the country under consideration. This understanding has given rise to great interest in analyzing the attributes of so-called lagging and leading regions. As noted by Batabyal and Nijkamp (2014a), in this dichotomy, lagging regions are generally not dynamic, they are often rural or peripheral, they are technologically backward, and they display slow rates of economic growth. In contrast, leading regions are typically dynamic, they are often urban, they are technologically more advanced, and they display relatively rapid rates of economic growth. The work of Baumol (1986), Lucas (1988), Kochendorfer-Lucius and Pleskovic (2009) and Alexiades (2013) tells us that the subject of lagging and leading regions is actually part of a broader literature on spatial disparities. A general theme emphasized by this literature is the variability or divergence in regional economic performance. In addition, this literature has also stressed the causal mechanisms that are responsible for persistent inequality between regions and the policy instruments one might use to ameliorate this inequitable state of affairs. A perusal of the literature on spatial disparities makes it clear that if we are to shed meaningful light on regional differences then we need to first comprehend economic and geographical factors such as initial conditions, labor market inefficiencies, the availability of public services, labor mobility across regions, and technological change. As such, in this paper, we study how relatively small initial differences (at time t = 0) in the physical capital and the research and development (R&D) stocks between stylized lagging and leading regions lead to substantially magnified differences on the balanced growth path (BGP) for these two regions. Put differently, we demonstrate the extent to which the lagging region’s initial economic disadvantages are magnified on the BGP. However, before we do this, let us first briefly review the pertinent literature. Desmet (2000) studies a perfect foresight model of an economy consisting of a lagging and an advanced region. In his model, externalities in the acquisition of skills cause specialization and uneven regional development. The upshot of this model feature is that when a new technology is introduced, this introduction can either reinforce or reverse the observed uneven regional development. Kalirajan (2004) focuses on India and notes that if one is to boost economic growth and promote growth spillovers from the leading to the lagging states, then it is necessary to pay attention to the quality of human capital in the various states. Nocco (2005) studies lagging and leading regions in terms of their initial technological gap and differences in what she calls trade costs. She studies conditions for the existence of interregional knowledge spillovers and notes that high trade costs result in the agglomeration of the modern sector in the leading region. Desmet and Ortin (2007) examine uneven development in a model with two regions and two sectors. In their model, whether the lagging or the leading region benefits from technological change is uncertain. Because of the presence of this kind of uncertainty, these researchers show that it may make sense for the lagging region to remain underdeveloped. Becker et al. (2013) focus on the chronic shortages of labor in the lagging or remote regions of Queensland in Australia. They point out that because it is difficult to attract and retain labor in these remote regions, it is essential that communities and businesses work together to overcome these acute labor shortages. How might one promote economic development in the lagging regions of Germany? This question is studied by Alecke et al. (2013). On the basis of their empirical analysis, these authors contend that regional policy that concentrates on improving the productivity of the available labor ends up promoting economic development. Dawid et al. (2014) analyze the impact that policies designed to foster technology adoption and improve the human capital stock have on the economic performance of what they call stronger and weaker regions. They show that the impact of such policies depends greatly on the extent to which the labor markets in the two regions are integrated. Specifically, when the two labor markets are fully integrated, human capital stock improvement policies have positive (negative) effects on the stronger (weaker) region. Batabyal and Nijkamp (2014b) analyze the economic performance of lagging and leading regions when there is a technology gap between these two regions. Their analysis demonstrates that despite the existence of the technology gap, on the BGP, the physical to effective human capital ratio is identical in both regions. Finally, Mitze et al. (2015) use German data to examine the link between collaborative R&D strategies and the innovation performance of small and medium firms in peripheral regions. Their empirical analysis shows that collaboration is important and that pursuing R&D collaboratively leads to higher outcome levels for metrics such as R&D and patent intensity. We would now like to emphasize three points. First, the many studies discussed in this section have certainly advanced aspects of our understanding of the working of lagging and leading regions in different parts of the world. Second, many of these studies have pointed to the significance of R&D in particular and to innovation more generally in augmenting the economic prospects of the lagging regions being studied. Finally, the above two points notwithstanding, to the best of our knowledge, there are no theoretical studies that have analyzed how relatively small initial differences in the physical capital and the R&D stocks between stylized lagging and leading regions lead to substantially magnified differences on the balanced growth path (BGP) for these two regions. The reader should note that this is the lacuna in the extant literature that we seek to fill with our analysis in the present paper.Footnote 1 We now proceed to discuss the specific contributions of our paper. Given the gap in the literature that we have just identified, the general objective of our paper is to use an intertemporal model adapted from Batabyal and Nijkamp (2019) to analyze aspects of long-run economic growth in stylized lagging and leading regions. To this end, Sect. 2 delineates our model of an aggregate economy that consists of a lagging and a leading region. Both regions use physical capital, R&D, and knowledgeable labor to produce a final consumption good. The lagging region faces two key economic disadvantages. Specifically, the constant fractions of the output of the final consumption good that are saved to augment (1) the stock of physical capital and (2) the stock of R&D are twice as large in the leading region, as they are in the lagging region. In other words, the leading region augments its physical capital and R&D stocks by investing twice as much as the lagging region. That said, it is important to comprehend the following four points. First, our central task in this paper is to formally demonstrate the implications of a certain set of initial conditions for economic growth on the BGP. These initial conditions concerning the stock of physical capital and the stock of R&D in the lagging and in the leading regions are exogenous to the analysis. As such, it is important to recognize that our objective here is not to alter these initial conditions or to study how these initial differences can be made to disappear over time. Second, in principle, one implication of our analysis could be that the initial conditions—or history—do not matter in terms of the BGP outcomes but this is not what we find. As we show in the remainder of this paper, the initial conditions have a dramatic and magnified impact on the BGP. Third, multiple equilibria are not an issue in the model that we analyze in this paper. Finally, note that we are not simply saying that “lower savings rates lead to lower gdp per capita”. Instead, what we are doing is quantifying exactly how differences in initial conditions between the lagging and the leading regions lead to magnified effects on the BGP and hence to divergence. This notion of divergence is not just a theoretical curiosum but instead a practical policy concern. To see this, consider a finding of a recent World Bank report—see Farole et al. (2018, p. 38, emphases added)—that focuses on lagging regions in Europe. This report clearly says that “[t]he recent experience of regional divergence is not strictly a cyclical phenomenon. There are structural forces at play which are likely to push toward further divergence in the coming years…Among the most powerful of these divergent forces are technology and demography”. Section 3.1 in our paper computes the ratio of the BGP value of output per knowledgeable worker in the leading region to its value in the lagging region. Section 3.2 ascertains the ratio of the BGP value of R&D per knowledgeable worker in the leading region to its value in the lagging region. Section 4 first comments on the extent to which the lagging region’s initial economic disadvantages are magnified on the BGP, and then, it discuss the policy implications of our research. Section 5 concludes and then discusses three ways in which the research delineated in this paper might be extended.",2

Recently, however, China has moved towards purposeful urbanisation, which appeared to be delayed in comparison with its level of economic development, due to the artificial restriction of the enlargement of cities over the last half century. Since the turn of the century, China has begun to focus on urbanisation to be a possible driver of further economic growth and to overcome the anxiety of the so-called ‘middle-income trap’.Footnote 1 This paper investigates urbanisation in China in depth, which has been conducted as a national critical development plan, and discusses the characteristics of Chinese urbanisation by clarifying its history and current policy. Consequently, the paper analyses the process of urbanisation, which has spatial and institutional components, the latter of which matters for further economic growth in China (Okamoto 2017). The paper consists of four parts: first, the concepts of ‘spatial’ and ‘institutional’ urbanisation will be introduced based on a discussion of previous research. Second, the historical aspects of the dual system of urban–rural development will be shown. Third, the urbanisation policy will be investigated according to the simulation model of input–output analysis, and the implications will be discussed. Finally, the characteristics of Chinese urbanisation will be described, and the paper will conclude by providing an evaluation of Chinese urbanisation.",3

On average, the annual rates of increase (3.7% in the 1990s and 1.8% in the 2000s) were relatively high compared to the economic growth rates of 1.0% and 0.7%, respectively. However, after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, electricity sales exhibited a negative trend, triggered by the increase in electricity rates all over the country. This increase, after 25 years of consistently declining rates, was mainly due to the re-examination of Japan’s energy policy after the earthquake. Since the Fukushima accident associated with the Great East Japan Earthquake, almost all nuclear power plants in the country have suspended operations to ensure safety. As a result, a greater proportion of energy now comes from power plants that rely on fossil fuels, the increasing costs of which exert pressure on electricity rates. Given the sector’s importance, clarifying how an anticipated increase in electricity rates will affect future residential electricity demand has become crucial. The Great East Japan Earthquake holds a lesson for policy makers—that natural disasters possibly change the power configuration. This changes not only the management strategy of electric power companies but also people’s electricity consumption behaviors. Specifically, a sharp rise in the electricity rate conceivably motivates electricity saving. As long as the electricity rate keeps declining, consumers have considerable leeway in determining the use of electricity. However, a sharp rise in the electricity rate rapidly increases the burden on consumers, greatly reducing the use of electricity. Considering the change in the demand curve, the price elasticity does not change between the rising and falling phases of the price. However, the Japanese government called for power-saving efforts by the people in the face of a power supply crisis after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Therefore, the rise in electricity rates due to the earthquake may have caused a major change in people’s electricity consumption habits. That is, price elasticity possibly increased in the price hike stage after the earthquake. This paper examines whether price elasticity increased during the period of rising prices. By clarifying this, it will be possible to predict the reaction of consumers’ electricity demand when electricity rates change due to natural disasters. Furthermore, we can also predict the impact of electricity rate hikes due to the expansion of renewable energy on electricity demand. To clarify these findings, we need to estimate the electricity demand function. Recent studies estimating the electricity demand function mainly use partial adjustment models that assume adaptive expectations on electricity demand (Bernstein and Griffin 2005; Blázquez et al. 2013; Kamerschen and Porter 2004; Okajima and Okajima 2013; Otsuka and Haruna 2016; Paul et al. 2009). This method has been shown to be effective in the case of panel data with many cross sections over a short period of time. As our data set reflects these characteristics, we employ the partial adjustment model to empirically analyze residential electricity demand in Japan. Our data set has three novelties. First, we investigate the influence of electricity rates on electricity demand before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have employed electricity demand data of the post-disaster period. This data set allows us to estimate the price elasticity difference between the period of declining prices and the current phase of rising prices. Second, we handle regional data, which exhibit great heterogeneity across different electrical power jurisdictions in terms of both lifestyle and climate. Considering such regional disparities is important for improving estimation accuracy in analyzing residential electricity demand. Third, we use raw sales data that each electric power company aggregates and makes public. Okajima and Okajima (2013) and Otsuka and Haruna (2016) employ “Energy Consumption Statistics by Prefecture,” published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. These are processed data and thus might suffer from biases in the data-making process. As we use raw data, we are able to obtain more accurate estimates that might better inform policy makers. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the electricity crisis caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and presents the research hypothesis of this paper. Section 3 reviews the existing research on residential electricity demand focusing on the magnitude of price elasticities calculated in previous works. Section 4 presents the empirical model and describes the data and the estimation method used in the analysis. Section 5 illustrates the estimation results and discusses the influence of electricity price on electricity demand. Section 6 concludes the paper, highlighting policy implications and future issues.",16

On one hand, Japanese companies in the global-type electrical/electronics industry in particular have continued to locate in ASEAN and other countries instead of China from the 1990s up until 2009. However, the proportion located in ASEAN and other countries declined, so that the number of locations in China and in ASEAN and other countries was about equal, as of 2009. On the other hand, Japanese companies in the transportation equipment industry, which has a pyramid-like configuration, set up more locations in ASEAN and other countries than in China from the 1990s until 2009. Although this sector’s expansion proceeded at about the same rate in both China and ASEAN and other countries, the number of locations in China has grown rapidly since the mid-2000s. To this end, this paper first surveys the trends of overseas locations
 of final and intermediate goods production sites for relevant Japanese multinational firms (MNFs) in East Asia, focusing on the global-type electrical/electronics industry and the pyramid-type automotive industry. Second, it conducts an empirical analysis of the factors involved in choosing overseas locations for the relevant MNFs’ production sites for both final and intermediate goods by looking at these companies’ final and intermediate production sites separately because of the important role played by the intermediate goods sector as asserted by Venables (1996) and Fujita and Thisse (2013).Footnote 1 That is, we examine the main three hypotheses; the first hypothesis that the agglomeration of the final (intermediate) goods production sites for Japanese MNFs in a particular country can occur because of the concentration of the intermediate (final) goods production sites for Japanese MNFs in that countries; the second hypothesis that the agglomeration of the final (intermediate) goods production sites for Japanese MNFs in a particular country can occur because of the market potential of the final (intermediate) goods production sites in that countries or neighboring countries; and the third hypothesis that the agglomeration of the final (intermediate) goods production sites for Japanese MNFs in a particular country can occur because of the supplier access of the intermediate goods production sites in that countries or neighboring countries. The paper is structured as follows. Focusing on the global-type electrical/electronics industry and the pyramid-type automotive industry in East Asia, Sect. 2 reviews the trend toward supply chain globalization at the relevant Japanese MNFs in East Asia, particularly the trend of setting up production sites for final and intermediate goods production in overseas locations. Section 3 follows with an analysis of the factors that Japanese MNFs consider when choosing overseas locations for such sites and provides an overseas location choice model. Section 4 reveals the data sources and model specification. Specifically, we conduct our analysis using an overseas location choice model based on the new economic geography (NEG) model and focusing on market potential, supply access, and vertical agglomeration of industry as factors involved in Japanese MNFs’ choice of overseas locations. In Sect. 5, we show estimation results from a conditional logit model. The final section presents our conclusions and gives some policy implications.",3

In the area of regional science, population agglomeration and interregional networks are known to have a positive impact on productivity and productive efficiency in the context of agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies are cost saving, and the productivity gains from the spatial agglomeration of production are significant (Marshall 1890). Several empirical studies have shown that agglomeration is responsible for enhancing regional economic productivity and international competitiveness (Combes and Gobillon 2015; Rosenthal and Strange 2004). More recent studies have also shown that improved traffic access expands the range of agglomeration economies and improves regional productivity (Graham 2007; Holl 2012; Lall et al. 2004; Melo et al. 2016; Montolio and Solé-Ollé 2009; Rice et al. 2006; Stelder 2016). This is called the “borrowed size” effect and has been discussed in the context of urban network externality (Boix and Trullen 2007; Camagni 1993; Camagni and Capello 2004; Capello 2000; Otsuka 2018a). According to Porter and van der Linde (1995), the enhancement in productivity is compatible with an increase in energy efficiency. The authors point out that efforts to improve the productivity of the entire production process under appropriate environmental regulations will result in a significant reduction of energy use, which, in turn, will lead to increased productivity. Boyd and Pang (2000) argue that energy efficiency is essential for enhancing productivity, and productivity improves energy efficiency. Otsuka et al. (2014) demonstrated the compatibility between productivity gains and energy-efficiency improvements in the Japanese manufacturing sector. They suggest that population agglomeration—the driving force behind productivity gains—plays a vital role in improving energy efficiency. Productivity gains are the foundation of sufficient investment for energy conservation. In the manufacturing industry, agglomeration of manufacturing plants allows for easy introduction of cogeneration systems that can be more energy efficient. Agglomeration of factories also has the potential to effectively utilize the waste heat from those factories. That is, agglomeration in the manufacturing industry creates an environment of high energy efficiency. However, for commercial buildings, high energy efficiency can be achieved through the introduction of energy systems called building and energy management systems; that is, energy efficiency can be increased through electrification. Otsuka (2018a) revealed that electrification in the industrial and commercial sector increases energy efficiency with increasing productivity. In other words, the promotion of electrification in the office is key to increasing energy efficiency. One factor that promotes electrification is the rise in a producer’s productivity due to population agglomeration. The previous analyses primarily focused on these positive external effects of population agglomeration. However, population agglomeration is often associated with external diseconomies such as congestion and heat islands. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies addressed the presence and magnitude of these effects (Hirano and Fujita 2012; Ihara et al. 2008). Most studies have not considered the nonlinear effects of population agglomeration. Furthermore, the impact of interregional networks on energy efficiency has not been investigated thoroughly yet. If public transportation networks are designed well, people can avoid using private vehicles, thus saving transportation energy. This is because the energy efficiency of passenger cars is worse than that of public transportation such as railroads (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 2006). For industrial and commercial activities, time in the office can be reduced drastically utilizing business trips and mobile teleworking. This will make the energy consumption of commercial buildings more efficient. Furthermore, if interregional travel time is reduced, productivity can be increased through interregional network effects, that is, the effects of “borrowed size” (Boix and Trullen 2007; Camagni 1993; Camagni and Capello 2004; Capello 2000; Otsuka 2018a). Thus, companies that have increased productivity can turn gains into energy conservation investment. In the economy under the environment constraint, the increase in productivity is compatible with an improvement in energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has addressed these effects. Therefore, this study aims to provide new insights into these relationships. The novelty of this study can be summarized in the following two points. The first is that it clarifies the impact of population agglomeration on energy efficiency. While the previous studies have focused on the impact of population agglomeration on production activities, its impact on energy efficiency has not been fully evaluated. The second is that it clarifies the effect of interregional networks on energy efficiency, which has also not been clarified to the best of our knowledge. By clarifying the above two points, it is possible to offer a new definition of the roles of population agglomeration and interregional networks in the regional economy from the viewpoint of energy efficiency. The lack of analysis is partly due to the unavailability of adequate statistics on energy use in cities and other regions. Another reason is the lack of methods for accurately measuring energy efficiency. However, in recent years, new statistics regarding energy use and the environment have been developed, which reflects the growing global environmental concern. In Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry publishes the “Energy Consumption Statistics by Prefecture,” which allows easy access to energy statistics at the regional level. However, there exists a lack of consensus among researchers regarding how to measure energy efficiency. As discussed in Sect. 2.3, energy efficiency has been measured by many researchers based on the energy efficiency indicators (Murillo-Zamorano 2004; Shui et al. 2015). These are mainly based on the two approaches: data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). SFA is used to analyze production efficiency and is superior to DEA in its capacity to address statistical noise. Therefore, in this study, we utilize SFA to address the impacts of population agglomeration and interregional networks on energy efficiency. Several studies have examined sectoral energy efficiency using the SFA approach (Boyd 2008; Du and Lin 2017; Feijoo et al. 2002; Filippini and Hunt 2011, 2012; Filippini and Lin 2016; Lin and Du 2013, 2014, 2015; Lin and Wang 2014; Lin and Yang 2013; Otsuka and Goto 2015). We apply this approach to assess the impacts of interregional networks on energy efficiency. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews studies that focused on the relation between agglomeration and production efficiency and energy efficiency, respectively. Section 3 presents a framework for empirical analysis and describes the data used in this study. Section 4 describes and discusses the results of the empirical analysis.

Agriculture requires fossil-energy for direct uses such as driving various machinery and air-conditioning, and indirect uses for producing goods (like chemical fertilizer) and services (like transportation) necessary for operating farming and food supply chains. Such a dependence of agriculture on fossil-energy naturally calls for a study on price linkages between the two sectors, because stable food supplies at affordable prices must be a goal for countries around the world. As food is essential to human lives, a number of previous studies have tried to explain the causes of food price changes.Footnote 2 In particular, there have been renewed interests in food prices because volatility has increased in the world food prices since 2008. To begin with, food prices can be influenced by a variety of factors beyond energy prices. Abbott et al. (2011) reviewed and summarized the causes of US food price increases since 2008 as: the supply shocks due to weather and grain stocks; the demand increases for biofuel feedstocks in US and soybeans in China; and the market factors such as market inelasticity and exchange rates. Headey and Fan (2008) also pointed out other potential factors including: rising oil prices, financial market speculations, policy factors such as export restrictions, and productivity slowdown. In what follows, we will focus our discussions on the effects of energy price changes on food prices. Fossil-energy (particularly oil) prices are considered to affect food prices in two ways (Gilbert 2010; Reboredo 2012). The first route is from the supply side, because oil is extensively used as inputs for agricultural production, as discussed above. Therefore, oil price hikes can raise input costs for agriculture. The second route is through new demands for biofuels, because higher oil prices may induce more biofuel production as a substitute, thereby raising food prices concurrently used for biofuel feedstocks such as sugarcane and corn (Mitchell 2008), although this connection remains controversial. Gilbert (2010), for instance, suggested that the correlation between the oil and food prices is the result of common causation and not of a direct causal link. Whereas most studies on this topic have employed computable general equilibrium (CGE) models or econometric (statistical) models, there is yet an alternative approach for studying food-energy price linkages with an input–output (IO) price model (Miller and Blair 2009; Oosterhaven 1996). Unlike the CGE, the IO price model assumes Leontief-type supply and demand curves, that is, a vertical demand curve and a horizontal supply curve. It then describes a cost-push (or supply driven) inflationary processes in which an exogenous price increase in the primary inputs (e.g., labor costs) of a sector (say, oil) is passed onto other sectors using oil as an intermediate input, thereby raising their output prices as well. Similar processes are repeated until price equilibrium is reached across an economy. Throughout these processes, demands are assumed to be perfectly price inelastic (i.e., demanded quantity is not affected at all by a price change). This point is often criticized as unrealistic, in comparison to the CGE model that features normally sloped supply/demand curves (Oosterhaven 1996). In addition, this assumption of the IO price model makes it unable to simulate any substitution effects among goods or regions (Polenske 1979). Furthermore, in contrast to econometric models, the IO model is unable to deal with short-term (weeks or months) price fluctuations and delineate any causal relationships between factors. This is because the IO model is basically a snap-shot model based on an IO table compiled over a 1-year period. Despite these shortcomings, the IO price model has advantages. First, for econometric models, the model structure is often constrained by the problem of multicollinearity, i.e., the necessity to adopt independent explanatory variables. In addition, the classic linear regression model is designed to evaluate relationships between a dependent variable and some explanatory variables and is not suitable for simulating serial chains of economic transactions occurring within an economy. In contrast, the IO price model (also the CGE model in this regard) is generally free from these constraints and able to simulate chains of transactions. For this reason, the IO model has an advantage in examining economic ripple effects via serial transaction linkages. Second, in the CGE model, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a correct solution as the number of sectors and regions increases. Besides, when a solution is found, it is sometimes difficult to give a simple interpretation, because it may be affected by many economic parameters incorporated in the model. In contrast, the IO model is based on simple linear mathematical formulae, so a solution is easily attainable even with many sectors and regions, and the interpretation of the results is relatively straightforward. Therefore, the IO model can provide useful insights in a multi-regional setting with many segregated sectors, provided the limitations are also considered. Accordingly, there have been previous studies that apply the IO price model to the food-energy price linkage issues. In the United States during the oil price shocks in the 1970s, Miernyk (1976) and Polenske (1979) led early attempts to investigate price effects of energy-price hikes on regional economies across the US. Hanson et al. (1993) employed the IO price model in the US to show that crops using more energy-intensive nitrogen fertilizers, like feed crops and cotton, tended to be affected more by oil price increases than other crops. In Japan, Yakushiji and Sato (2000) used Japan’s national input–output table in 1980 to 1995 and concluded that import prices of crude oil and gas, oil products, agrichemicals and fertilizers had the greatest impacts on domestic agricultural costs. Similarly, Fukuda and Kondo (2009) revealed that an increase in the imported oil price caused the highest price hike on fisheries among the agricultural sectors. However, those studies were based on the national or sub-national IO table, so they did not reflect details of international trade linkages. To take international trades into account, it is necessary to call for international interregional IO (IRIO) analyses. Tamamura (2014) analyzed the effects of crude-oil price increases in Indonesia and Malaysia on Japanese commodity prices using the 2005 Asian International IO Table. However, his study did not sufficiently cover oil suppliers outside Asia, or the effects on agricultural sectors showing smaller price effects than major oil users like chemical industries. The World Input–Output Database Project (Timmer et al. 2015) may offer a tool to extend analysis beyond Asia. However, this table treated agriculture as one sector and largely aggregated developing countries outside Europe as the “rest of the world”. Therefore, it is not suitable for thoroughly examining agricultural sub-sectors in major food/fossil-fuel producing countries, which includes many developing countries. To overcome these flaws, the present study employs the global trade analysis project (GTAP) database developed at Purdue University (Hertel 1997). Notable features of the GTAP relating to this study are (Aguiar et al. 2016): (1) industries are divided into 57 sectors including 14 agricultural sub-sectors; and (2) 140 countries/regions are segregated including food/energy-producing developing countries across the world. Therefore, the GTAP is suitable for studying food–energy price linkages across countries in detail. Following the above arguments, the objective of this study is to compile an IRIO table from the GTAP database following the methodology of Peters et al. (2011) and analyze the effect of fossil-energy price changes on food prices across the world through transaction linkages of intermediate goods, using the IO price model. We, therefore, concentrate on the price effects via intermediate cost changes (i.e., supply side shocks) and do not explicitly deal with induced demand changes for biofuels. The article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes methodologies for compiling the international IRIO table and the IO price analysis. Section 3.1 overviews food-energy price linkages across the world revealed by the IO price model. Section 3.2 then undertakes a brief case study on the US wheat price changes to compare the results of the IO model with empirical observations. Section 4 concludes.",4

Case study about survey of consciousness about career choice of young generation in Bali, Indonesia",February 2020,Yoko Mayuzumi,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In world leading tourism islands of developing countries, there are problems between “development of tourism industry which grew up starting with national policy” and “decline of self-sufficiency agriculture supporting local residents’ lives”. The development for world leading tourism islands in developing countries is often promoted by the government as a foreign currency acquisition strategy for economic development. However, in that country there is another major industry that supports residents’ lives before developing the tourism industry, which is often the primary industry. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, residents engaged in primary industry, represented by agriculture, are ranked third in the world following India and China (ILO: International Labor Organization 2018) (Global Note 2018), with about 38 million people, one-sixth of the population. With the progress of the tourism industry led by the government of Indonesia, the population of Bali province increased from 2,554,479 in 1985–3,179,918 in 2004, 1.24 times in 20 years. In summary of the land use change in Bali province, between 1985 and 2004, the paddy field has been consistently decreasing from 98,830 hectares to 82,053 hectares, and the fields are also 147,185 hectares To 129,124 hectares, and it decreased by 18061 hectares (Yukiko 2007). Such changes in land use can be understood in connection with the increase in the population and the number of households accompanying tourism (Isao 2015; Koichi 2015). Furthermore, according to the Occupational Census results of 2014, agriculture, forestry and fishery workers are 12% of the Bali island population, but they are decreasing year by year. Data from the agricultural census also indicate that the number of Balinese agricultural households has dropped significantly. That is, 492,394 households were recorded in the 2003 Agricultural Census and 408,233 households were recorded in the 2013 Agricultural Census (Statistics of Bali Province 2003–2013; Bali Post 2019). It decreased 17.09% in 10 years. In other words, this means that 83,161 households quit agriculture per a year. This also can be confirmed that Bali’s farmers are losing their enthusiasm for agriculture. In addition, residents of areas outside the tourism area that benefit from the tourism industry can not attract tourism income. In such places, the main industry is agriculture. Because of the unequal commandment of the village chief, government subsidies for agriculture are not spread equally to all farmers there. In addition, support for rise in the wholesale price of agricultural crops has not been made by the local administration. Under the administration with remaining unchanged, the local residents are suffering from low incomes. The agricultural population declines, and it is not possible to find hope to engage in agriculture as a profession. As a result, the young generation who chooses occupation may move to the tourism industry that is economically favorable. However, the actual situation regarding the career choice of this local residents to the tourism industry has not been clarified. Therefore, by analyzing this fact quantitatively and showing the result, it is necessary to devise more specific regional measures. To show this fact and consciousness structure makes it possible to report the facts clearly to prefectural administration and province central government. In addition, it can be shown as a research example of social survey that academically presented the results of the consciousness survey quantitatively. This eventually needs to be presented as a methodology for sustainable tourism industry and agricultural development to the world leading tourism islands of developing countries with similar circumstances, and this study intends it. In this research, we focus on the issues of economic development for tourism industry and concentration of labor force in world leading tourism islands of developing countries. And, with the intention of knowing the current situation of local people’s career choice, we conducted a survey of consciousness to know “the way of thinking about work values for future career choice” of university students and high school students who are about to select occupation. We survey “personal circumstances” and especially “about working in tourism industry and agriculture” about occupational value orientation, and clarify what consciousness structure these have. The content that we deal with in this research compound two academic research topics. First of all, we suggest the background of these, and proceed this paper based on that. Regarding the two subjects, the first point is the study background on the undergraduate student’s consciousness of career choice, the second is the study background on the concentration of workers for tourism in Bali, Indonesia. The former is based on previous studies on university students and career choice, the latter is based on the survey results to date of local resident’s career choice of industry in Bali, as a case in developing countries. And finally it will be shown quantitatively the results of the survey including these viewpoints. In this study, we have an awareness of problem about clarifying the actual situation of career choice of young people and its consciousness structure in the world leading tourism islands of the developing country. In response to both situations of “the development of tourism industry which grew and led with the national policy at the world leading tourism islands of the developing country” and “the decline of self-sufficiency agriculture supporting the living of the local residents accordingly”, the purpose of this study is to find a solution to develop sustainable agriculture and tourism for residents by knowing situation of career choice in present young people and recognizing the way of thinking about agriculture and tourism as occupation. Though we are also asking about all occupations in survey area, we are focusing on agriculture and tourism. It will be necessary to concretely take the countermeasure of jobs between agriculture and tourism after quantitatively indicating the way of thinking about career choice. Specifically, we will clarify the following points in this paper. The way of thinking in choice of occupation. Family circumstances affecting choice of occupation. The way of thinking on choosing tourism as occupation. The way of thinking on choosing agriculture as occupation. The way of thinking to agriculture business using tourism industry. And the hypothesis is that “Most local young people living in the world leading tourism islands of the developing country, in choosing occupations, will choose tourism industry which is possible to work in a gorgeous space and has high income”. This hypothesis will be verified by analyzing the results of the consciousness survey. The outcome of this study, from policy points, aims to propose to the prefectural and provincial governments agricultural support measures. Additionally, in the academic sociological point of view, it is intended to become a rare case study of big size local resident consciousness survey in developing country that is difficult to conduct generally. Furthermore, this study will be a case study related to “decline of agriculture and choice of occupation of young people in the world leading tourism islands belonging in the developing country”, similar case is in another developing countries. For this reason, we intend to present the results as a finding for sustainable tourism industry and the development of agriculture in developing countries. The world leading tourist resort islands of developing countries are, for example, Phuket Island in Thailand, Langkawi Island in Malaysia, Cebu Island in the Philippines, etc. It is expected that these places may also be surveyed in the future and the results of the survey need to be reported. But it’s difficult to treat all these at once. For this reason, we plan to compile it as a problem of world leading tourist resort islands in developing countries as a future prospect, and want to show the results of the research step by step. In this research, we focus on Indonesia Bali.",4

Public outrage about air, water, and soil pollution considerably increases political pressure to react (Li et al. 2012). Proponents of the ‘Environmental Kuznets Curve’ (EKC) posit that economic modernization will eventually lead to a better balance between economic and environmental interests (Grossman and Krueger 1991). A row of empirical studies confirms this proposition for the case of China (Brajer et al. 2011; Song et al. 2008; Lee and Dae-Won 2015). Institutional perspectives corroborate the EKC’s predictions. Carter and Arthur (2013), for instance, find China’s environmental governance principles underwent a fundamental transition from a command- and control-based system with fixed targets towards a more open management style that seeks to integrate various stakeholder groups and promote sustainable economic development. Yet implementation on the ground is often weak since many regions rely on tax income from industries incommensurate with Beijing’s top-down sustainability rhetoric (Tan 2014). What is more, there seem to be ambiguous political incentives for local cadres to improve environmental performance within their jurisdictions (Wu et al. 2013; Lo et al. 2012). Despite a lack of strong incentives to prioritize environmental protection over economic growth, local policy innovations in the field of sustainability still can have a significant impact if Beijing recognizes them as examples worth learning from. In fact, since the 1980s, the Chinese Central Government created various incentive schemes with the aim to systematically and concurrently promote innovative approaches for protecting the urban ecological environment (Zhao 2011). In this context, programs such as the ‘civilized city’, ‘environmental protection model city’, ‘garden city’, ’ecological garden city’, or ‘eco-city’ have become an inherent part of China’s urban environmental governance. The role of these policy incentive schemes for promoting best practice, however, is only partially understood. Previous studies have been concerned with model cities as innovative spaces and experimentation zones for best practice. In this context, a normative literature strand evaluates criteria qualifying model cities in relation to the proposed aims (Yu 2014; Chen and Gao 2011; Chen et al. 2010; Li and Higgins 2013). This vein provides recommendations how to better align requirements, selection processes, and monitoring, with the overall policy aim. A second branch deals with political entrepreneurialism as a driving force for municipalities’ environmental commitment. Case studies show that local political leaders mobilize time and resources if they sense political career opportunities or potential economic benefits (Li et al. 2011; Van Rooij et al. 2013). Besides model creation, the politics of modelling is supposed to create externalities such as the emulation of the model, imitation and repetition of the model, and encouragement by the model to try something new (Hoffman 2011). This process of learning from others is often triggered by peer pressure or orders from superiors, which raises the question whether local governments’ practices of imitation are genuine or merely aim at pretending to be committed. There is a void of research analysing model cities’ influence on the diffusion of best practice and as a benchmark for regulatory compliance. In the here-presented study, we seek to address this issue. In Sect. 2, we introduce our empirical case, namely the National Environmental Protection Model Cities Program (NEPMCP), and in Sect. 3 we derive our hypotheses. Section 4 outlines our model and estimation strategy. We then present variables and data in Sect. 5, results in Sect. 6, and conclude with Sect. 7.",8

If the situation is left as it is, local public spending per capita will continue to increase. To achieve efficient public service delivery, municipalities in Japan have the option of exploiting economies of scale through intermunicipal cooperation (IMC). IMC meets the demand for a range of individual public services, suggesting that small-sized municipalities would be capable of reducing their spending by cooperating with other municipalities. To prepare for the impending decline of the working age population, municipalities should strive to reduce their spending by using the IMC framework. IMC offers the possibility of improving the efficiency of municipal service delivery by adjusting the range of public service provision. Available services range from waste treatment to administering social welfare, and while several works in the literature confirm the influence of IMC on public spending (Allers and de Greef 2018; Bel and Costas 2006; Bel et al. 2012; Soukopová and Vaceková 2018), it has not been determined whether the impact is positive or negative. IMC is a common practice in European countries such as Spain (Bel and Costas 2006; Bel and Mur 2009) and France (Frère et al. 2014), as well as in the USA (Warner 2004). A framework for IMC also exists in Japan, because of a policy stipulated in the Local Autonomy Law that permits multiple municipalities to establish a corporate body for IMC. Previous qualitative studies carried out in Japan (Kidokoro et al. 2008; Seta 2017) suggest that IMC reduces municipal spending by increasing the efficiency of public service delivery. However, whether IMC actually reduces municipal spending has not yet been demonstrated in a quantitative analysis. The population in a public service area is associated with the amount of public spending, mainly in terms of the ability to exploit economies of scale (Hirsch 1959). Several studies have observed the effects of IMC on municipalities with different population levels, finding that the marginal effects differ depending on the population (Bel and Mur 2009; Soukopová and Vaceková 2018). However, most previous research has treated the individual municipality as a unit of analysis. The disadvantage of this approach is that the results are biased, because actual service provision areas differ from the area of jurisdiction of a given municipality. Although a few studies have attempted to account for the actual scale of production (e.g., Niaounakis and Blank 2017), they still treat the municipality as the unit of analysis. Our research explores the difference in cost structure when municipalities participate in IMC, and estimates the minimal efficient scale (MES), which is minimization of the per capita service provision cost (Varian 1992) of the public service provision area. We focus on waste treatment as a case of public service delivery, because IMC for waste treatment is common worldwide (Bel and Mar 2009; Dijkgraaf and Gradus 2014; Hirsch 1965; Zafra-Gómez et al. 2013) and accounts for a large portion of IMC expenditure. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background and literature review illustrating the current situation of IMC in Japan and determinants of public service spending. Section 3 specifies the cost function and explains the data. Section 4 provides the results of the parameter estimation and predicts the MES based on the actual public service provision area. In Sect. 5, we conclude by highlighting the limitations of our model and implications for future public policy on efficient public service provision.",3

To limit the warming to under 1.5 °C, CO2 emissions need to be reduced by 45% of the 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050. Renewable energy plays a crucial role in cutting CO2 emissions while maintaining the access to stable and affordable energy to sustain economic growth worldwide. Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, nuclear power has experienced difficulties, forcing several nations to change their policies to meet their CO2 emissions reductions targets. For mature but resource-scarce countries, such as Japan, energy security is a priority issue. After the 2011 Fukushima crisis, energy security has become even more important. The government is aiming to achieve the target of 44% zero-emission sources in the generation mix by 2030, but is facing many challenges. For developing countries, economic growth is often restricted by the accessibility to affordable energy. Their major concern is meeting the growing demand for electricity based on traditional fossil fuels or renewable energies. Among the renewable energies, wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV) are valuable energy sources because of their potential to be substituted for fossil fuels and nuclear power at very low variable costs. As their availability depends on weather conditions, they are types of variable renewable energy (VRE). A decade ago, VRE was so expensive to install that a certain level of subsidy was needed to meet policy targets. Competitive auctions of renewables have accelerated reductions in cost, resulting in record historical low prices for renewables and cost-competitiveness with nuclear power plants (IEA 2017b; Schneider and Froggatt 2018). One difficulty in achieving a high VRE level within the existing system is its variable output. A traditional method of dealing with the variability is to provide backup fossil fuel generators to absorb fluctuations and simply set a limit on the total acceptance of VRE, keeping the expected fluctuation bandwidth within a manageable level. Although Japan proposed a new energy plan in 2018 to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 26% of the 2013 level by 2030, methods to enhance the VRE level have not been clarified (METI 2018). For example, in Kyushu, although many VRE plants were deployed since 2012, many are being curtailed in 2018. A high level of VRE penetration requires “flexibility” in the system (IEA 2014, 2017a, c; Danish Energy Agency 2015; Ea Energy Analyses 2015). The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) (2015) defined “flexibility” as “the ability to cope with variability and uncertainty in both generation and demand while maintaining a satisfactory level of reliability at a reasonable cost, over different time horizons” (DEA 2015). Prior to that, the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2014) elaborated on the concept of flexibility as a solution to problems variability with VRE, defining four categories: (1) grid infrastructure, (2) dispatchable generation, (3) storage, and (4) demand-side integration. Among those four categories, grid infrastructure is thought to be the most effective measure to resolve the problems that Japan is now facing, with which to integrate VRE because it connects distributed resources and distributed demands. Cross-border interconnectors enable VRE generation to be shared among consumers in different locations. The other categories are still in the development stage (e.g., storage), increase CO2 emissions (e.g., dispatchable generation), or are limited in terms of a continuous effect (e.g., demand-side integration) (IEA 2014). Denmark is one of the most successful countries in terms of integrating VRE with its existing system, maximizing the use of interconnectors, and achieving high VRE penetration, although it started at a point similar to Japan decades ago. One typical concern around opening interconnectors to VRE is that it disturbs the established practice of supply–demand planning and electricity flows. The question is what differentiates Japan and Denmark; both countries have mature electricity systems and started with a high dependency on fossil fuels, but there is currently a considerable difference in VRE penetration levels, as shown in Fig. 1. The trends in VRE penetration and the trade intensity are plotted in Fig. 2. The trade intensity is defined as the total of exports and imports divided by the total demand in the area [Antweiler (2016)]. Figures 1 and 2 have uneven timescales, comprising of 1974, 1990, 2000, and 2016, by following the original data source from IEA (2018a). Figures 1 and 2 show clear differences between the two countries. Recently some areas (e.g. Kyushu) in Japan have shown progress in VRE penetration. This study tries to reveal factors that can promote the status of VRE adoption in Japan. Source: IEA (2018a) and own calculation Electricity generation capacities of Japan and Denmark. Source: IEA (2018a) and own calculation Penetration and trading of variable renewable energy in Japan and Denmark. This study focuses on the role of cross-border interconnectors in achieving high VRE penetration. A more specific aim is to find the causality structures for VRE interconnector operation. The following research questions are discussed: What are the components of VRE flexibility in terms of cross-border interconnectors? How do the flexibility components perform when VRE is integrated with the system? To answer these questions, the following two steps were followed: Derive the determinants of VRE interchange operation by comparing Japanese three regions (Tokyo–Tohoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido) and Denmark. Develop a model elaborating the causality structures and verify it using empirical data. By following Steps 1 and 2, the causality structures of region-independent and interregional integrated models were derived and verified with empirical data from Japan and Denmark. The Japanese models consist of 3 regions, Tokyo–Tohoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido. The reason why these 3 regions are selected is that they represent different status in VRE deployment in Japan. First, Kyushu is the most advanced region in VRE deployment in Japan. Second, Tokyo has the largest population and electricity demand. Third, Hokkaido is the most lagging behind in electricity interconnection in Japan. The Kyushu region is expected to show a unique correlation of VRE generation and interconnector flows. The Tokyo–Tohoku region represents a transition from traditional to flexible interconnection. The Hokkaido region shows that the interconnector flow responds only to the internal balance of supply and demand, not to VRE. The Danish case includes 2 periods, 2006 that is before the major electricity-sector reform, and 2018 that is the latest. The Danish model demonstrates a flexible flow that is equally proportional to the VRE, the flexible demands, and the direct current (DC) lines connected to the neighboring areas. Further outcomes are described in later sections. Section 2 is a Literature Review. The key factors differentiating three regions of Japan and Denmark in terms of interchanging VRE are surveyed in Sect. 3. Section 4 outlines the method used to evaluate the effect of factors related to VRE and interchange. Section 5 is the conclusion.",3

A spatial-econometric exploration,February 2020,William Cochrane,Jacques Poot,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As in many other developed countries, New Zealand has seen a substantial increase in the rate of homeownership during the twentieth century. While in a perfectly competitive housing market, the real cost of housing services would be identical for owners and renters, in reality, the housing market is complex and subject to many forms of externalities and imperfections. Living in one’s own home confers significant private and public benefits that have encouraged governments of many countries to adopt pro-ownership policies (e.g., Atterhög and Song 2009), although there are also countries that encourage renting (e.g., Goodman and Mayer 2018). Nonetheless, recent research shows that homeownership increases life satisfaction (Ren et al. 2018). Figure 1 shows that more than half of New Zealand households are owner-occupiers of their dwelling, with the lowest rate (of 50.5%) recorded in the 1936 census, heavily influenced by the Depression years. From 1935 onwards, pro-ownership policies of the First Labour Government kicked off a long-term upward trend in ownership rates. Subsequent governments continued to protect or implement ownership-friendly policies until about three quarters of dwellings were owner-occupied by the second half of the 1980s. Percentage of private dwellings owner-occupied, 1916–2013. Source: Statistics New Zealand (2015) A Century of Censuses. 1916 and 1921 exclude Māori. Cases of tenure not stated have been excluded. 2006 and 2013 include ownership by family trusts Since the late 1980s, a steady decline in homeownership rates commenced, with the 2013 rate being similar to the rate of the early 1950s. The proportion of New Zealand households living in owner-occupied dwellings declined from a little less than 74% in 1986 and 1991, to 70.5% in 1996, 67.8% in 2001, 66.9% in 2006, and 64.8% by 2013. This is also shown in Fig. 1.Footnote 1 Various causes have been posited for the post-1986 decline in New Zealand homeownership (see, e.g., Morrison 2008; Eaqub and Eaqub 2015). First, changing demographics and social dynamics have resulting in more fluid family arrangements that have led to a greater demand for rental accommodation. Second, house prices have been rising faster than household incomes, reinforced by a speculative housing ‘bubble’ up to 2008 and re-occurring in recent years, particularly in the largest city, Auckland (which represents one-third of the country’s population of 4.9 million), driven by existing owner-occupiers and net inward migration but also by residential property investors and by increasing land prices that reflect the benefits of increasing agglomeration. The growth in house prices is a trend that is common to many advanced economies (e.g., Knoll et al. 2017). Rising house prices, together with increasing average personal debt due to much higher enrolments in tertiary education and the resulting student loans, lowered housing affordability of potential first home buyers. Moreover, the supply of homes that first home buyers can afford diminished. This situation was exacerbated by a lack of building of new dwellings at the cheaper end of the market. Finally, increasing levels of consumer debt and the removal of specific assistance for entry into homeownership also lowered households’ ability to own.Footnote 2 The downward trend in the homeownership rate is generally seen as an undesirable trend, for a variety of reasons (see, e.g., Eaqub and Eaqub 2015, for New Zealand-specific arguments). However, renters are geographically more mobile than homeowners (e.g., Poot 1984, in the New Zealand context). The decline in homeownership indeed coincided with an increase in residential mobility in New Zealand, particularly in Auckland where ownership rates have been declining faster than in other regions (e.g., Morton et al. 2014).Footnote 3 Greater residential mobility makes it easier for individuals and families to respond to labour market shocks. Given that homeowners incur much greater costs when changing residence than renters, it might, therefore, be expected that high rates of homeownership impact negatively on labour market flexibility and, consequently, may lead to a higher natural rate of unemployment. This potential link between homeownership rates and unemployment rates was first forcefully argued by Andrew Oswald in a series of working papers and a letter to the Journal of Economic Perspectives (Oswald 1996, 1997, 1999). Following this argument, the decline in homeownership observed in New Zealand since the 1980s would have increased geographic mobility and labour market flexibility, and thereby contributed to the decline in the long-term rate of unemployment. From 1984 onwards, New Zealand started on a path of radical economic liberalisation that led to a significant transformation of the economy. This liberalisation process triggered initially a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate, driven in large part by the destruction of employment in the previously heavily protected manufacturing sector.Footnote 4 As can be seen from Fig. 2, the unemployment rate peaked at close to 12% by 1991, compared with an average rate of 4% a decade earlier.Footnote 5 In 1991, the government at that time extended the economic reforms to the labour market through the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act (ECA) which promoted individual contracts and weakened the scope of collective bargaining and the power of trade unions. Subsequently, unemployment declined markedly and reviews of the reforms such as Evans et al. (1996) attributed this in part to the success of the ECA in enhancing labour market flexibility. New Zealand unemployment rate and homeownership rate 1986–2013. Source: Statistics New Zealand. The homeownership rate has been linearly interpolated between censuses. The source of the unemployment rate is the quarterly Household Labour Force Survey A formal assessment of the impact of labour market reform is actually easier said than done (Gorter and Poot, 1999). Besides the positive impacts highlighted by Evans et al. (1996), the reforms also led to growing inequality, lesser social cohesion, and increasing vulnerability of certain regions and population groups. This triggered a political change of direction following the 1999 election of a Labour government that stepped back from the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s in favour of a more ‘Third Way’ approach to economic management. The trend in the unemployment rate remained actually downward during this time of reintroduction of somewhat greater regulation of the labour market, which coincided with buoyant economic conditions. By December quarter 2007, the unemployment rate was down to 3.3%. The consequences of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 triggered an increase to a peak above 7% by 2012, with the rate then trending downwards again subsequently. Aside from our exploratory work in Cochrane and Poot (2007), on which this paper builds, there has not been any formal assessment in New Zealand of a possible link between unemployment and homeownership, despite Oswald’s hypothesis having generated empirical studies in a number of other countries. Skilling (2004, p 19) refers to this hypothesis in a paper that advocates more widespread asset ownership among the New Zealand population, including of dwellings, but then downplays the possibility of homeownership having what he calls a “dark side” (in terms of generating unemployment) by referring to US evidence by Glaeser and Shapiro (2002) and Australian evidence by Flatau et al. (2002) that does not appear consistent with the Oswald hypothesis. Indirectly, some NZ econometric modelling by Maré and Timmins (2004) also contradicts the Oswald claim. Maré and Timmins estimate the responsiveness of the number of internal migrants to relative employment conditions in origin and destination regions, and then interact this effect with homeownership rates. They find that responsiveness to relative employment performance is greater when more homes are owner-occupied, which is the opposite of what the Oswald hypothesis would suggest. However, their model analyzes the spatial variation in mobility rates rather than unemployment rates per se. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Oswald hypothesis directly using a 1986–2013 panel of observations on New Zealand Labour Market Areas (LMAs). Spatial-econometric models have been used previously in a cross-sectional setting to test the Oswald hypothesis (see Sari 2015), but as far as we know, the present paper provides the first estimates of the relationship in a panel data setting with spatial spillovers. The use of panel data techniques can ameliorate some problems that typically plague purely cross-sectional analyses, such as missing variable bias. Moreover, the use of spatial-econometric panel techniques addresses the often-overlooked problem of spatial spillovers explicitly. The paper is structured as follows: the next section provides a more detailed account of the hypothesis and briefly considers the international literature generated by the hypothesis and its relevance in the New Zealand context. Section 3 outlines the data used in the modelling. Section 4 reviews the various estimation techniques, while Sect. 5 reports the results of the estimations. The final section provides conclusions and offers some ideas regarding further directions to be followed in this area of research.",2

Zia Uddin,Takeshi Mizunoya,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Motorization–development–urbanization is a steadily increasing phenomenon that is observed in many developing countries like Bangladesh. Since there are growing changes in transport sector aiming at enhancing connectivity across countries, the dependence on energy sources based on fossil fuel has increased rapidly in recent years and as a result greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have also increased. On this backdrop, the Government of Bangladesh is pursuing an environment-friendly sustainable transport system to implement National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy, 2013, which clearly spells out, “Future planning or transport sector must, therefore, ensure that the system is sustainable and environment friendly in the long run”. Among the major road corridors in Bangladesh, the Dhaka–Chittagong National Highway (NH1) is one of the most important economic corridors in terms of passenger and freight movement. 92% of country’s total trade (export and import) and 81% of National Ready-Made Garments (RMG) is transported by this highway with very few alternatives available. Besides, the corridor offers great potential for regional connectivity with neighboring countries, India and Myanmar. In spite of improving NH1 to four lanes to meet the forecasted traffic demand, the existing road network is failing to deliver the desired Level of Services (LOS). The number of motorized vehicles is expected to grow to at least 35,000 per day in 2020, 70,000 in 2030, and more than 120,000 in 2040, depending on the section and selected scenario for the traffic forecast (Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2012). This forecast indicates a growing traffic demand for this corridor which is alarming for utilization of this corridor in future. In spite of four lanes, the 230.0-km journey between the capital city Dhaka and the port city Chittagong would take on average 7.0 h because of congestion on the road, resulting from frequent interventions against the traffic flow. Starting from Dhaka, there are more than forty major intersections along the national highway, up to Chittagong. The major traffic hotspots on NH1 are located at Katchpur, Madanpur, Daudkandi, Madhaiya, Comilla Cantonment, Padua Bazar, Biswa Road Intersection (Comilla), Uttar Krishnapur, Feni and Baraiyarhat (Fig. 1). However, a vehicle running on this highway has to come across instances of unauthorized market places and feeder roads, interference of slow-moving vehicles frequently, and hence, finding no other way, the vehicle cuts its speed gradually. (Source: Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges (MoRTB) 2015a) Layout of Dhaka–Chittagong National Highway At every intersection, the vehicle’s speed is steeps and the vehicle remains stopped at the traffic signal till the green sign is turned on. When the vehicle stops at an intersection, the engine runs but the vehicle does not move an inch. The burning of fuel during this time becomes wastage and this emission creates negative impacts afterwards. In case of NH1, due to high traffic density, the vehicular emission of COx, NOx, SOx is comparatively higher within the surrounding areas of the road and beyond the region than the corridors of low traffic density. The proposed Dhaka–Chittagong Expressway is supposed to render an alternative to the existing situation. It promises safer, faster and environment-friendly passenger and freight transportation as well as it wills to foster economic growth of the country. The main purpose of the research is To estimate the amount of time loss and fuel loss for each vehicle at the major intersections on the existing Dhaka–Chittagong National Highway. To estimate the amount of GHG emission reduction and it’s social cost after replacing the major intersections by Dhaka–Chittagong Expressway. To estimate the reduction of accident cost, travel time cost, and vehicle operating cost after replacing the major intersections by Dhaka–Chittagong Expressway. To estimate the amount of toll collection from Dhaka–Chittagong Expressway. To evaluate the economic viability of the proposed Dhaka–Chittagong Expressway in terms of environmental and economic aspect and to evaluate the validity of the expressway construction. Actually, economic effects of the public investment include not only direct effects but also indirect effects. Kohno (2016) defined the categories of “generation-basis” and “incidence-basis” economic effects in addition to the categories of direct and indirect economic effects of the public investment, and shows the necessity of measuring the incidence-basis indirect economic effects of public investment. In that book, the author summarizes economic effects of expressway in detail as shown in Tables 1 and 2. In this study, while recognizing the importance of measuring indirect effects, to simplify the evaluation, we focus only on the direct effects such as fuel savings, GHG emission savings, accident cost savings, vehicle operating cost saving, travel time cost savings and toll collection amount of the government which related to (1), (2) and (6) in Table 1, and (1), (2) and (5) in Table 2. We would like to emphasize that we analyzed the possibility of GHG emission “saving”, not GHG emission “increment” by the highway construction. This is thought to be a unique phenomenon in developing countries where traffic congestion is chronic. We show that highway construction in developing countries can generate a positive impact on the environment rather than a negative one in this research. We will also analyze indirect effect considering “generation-basis” and “incidence-basis” economic effects argued in Kohno (2016) and make a more comprehensive evaluation in near future research. The 217.0-km-long Dhaka–Chittagong Expressway is proposed to have four-lane carriageways with two additional service lanes for non-motorized vehicles. Connecting the capital city Dhaka to the port city Chittagong, the corridor passes through five chief districts Narayangonj, Munshigonj, Comilla, Feni and Noakhali (Fig. 1). The proposed expressway will provide enough additional capacity in this vital corridor to accommodate future traffic growth and will also meet the demand for a safer and more reliable road connection. The port city Chittagong has multi-faceted local and regional potential geo-economic prominence. The Chittagong port will be linked with a number of Government and Private owned under construction and proposed Economic Zones (4 in Chittagong, 1 in Comilla, 1 in Munshigonj, 3 in Narayangonj and 9 in Cox’s Bazar) (Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) 2017). The southern part of Chittagong is being developed into a prospective energy hub and JICA-financed Matarbari deep seaport will be established near Cox’s Bazaar that will engender huge freight movement on this corridor. Beyond local potentiality, the highway is also a vital portion of the Asian Highway (AH41). Again, through proposed Bangladesh, China, India, and Myanmar (BCIM) and Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN) regional connecting routes, Assam, Sikkim, Tripura, Mizoram, and Manipur areas in India together with China, Nepal, and Bhutan have expressed deep and significant interest in using the port of Chittagong. In this regard, an expressway connection between the capital and the port is essential for the future infrastructural development of the country and to tie in with the anticipated international counterparts.",8

Anderson,James R. Schmidt,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"China’s real estate market has experienced booms and busts over the past 2 decades. Widespread economic development and increases in disposable income have fueled increased demand for real estate in general, although the pace of growth has been uneven across regions. Residential units, in particular, have generally experienced unprecedented increases in demand. Real estate prices almost doubled over the 10-year period 2004–2013. According to data from the China Statistical Yearbook, the average real price of real estate units of all types increased from 2778 to 4779 Yuan/m2 in mainland China from 2004 to 2013. Beijing and Shanghai experienced much faster increases in real estate prices than the national average. From 2004 to 2013, prices of real estate units of all types increased from 5053 to 18,544 Yuan/m2 in Beijing and from 5855 to 16,411 Yuan/m2 in Shanghai.Footnote 1 Given the rapidly changing real estate market environment, an important policy tool implemented by the Chinese government to influence the housing market has been changes in deed tax rates. The government has manipulated deed tax rates, to stimulate sales during weak economic times and stabilize prices during periods of fast growth. The changes have also been used differentially across provinces, depending on housing market conditions. The policy intent of increases in the deed tax rate has been to stabilize real estate markets by setting a higher tax rate for buyers of large homes or buyers of more than one home, thereby discouraging speculative demand. Reductions in deed taxes have been intended to boost housing demand during slower economic conditions and regions. Provinces and regions have adopted the following ratesFootnote 2: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang: 3%. Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan: 4%. Heilongjiang, Jilin: 5% for commercial houses; 4% for other items. Liaoning: 4% for commercial houses; 3% for other items. Tibet: This tax is not levied currently. In this paper, we compute average deed tax rates by province and year for all classes of real estate and analyze the effect of those rates on real estate prices in China over the 10-year period 2004–2013. Our analysis indicates that increases in the deed tax rate have a negative effect on pre-tax prices in a stock-flow market framework. By estimating dynamic models and the dynamic spatial models, we find that increases in the deed tax rate have a significant negative effect on prices of the pooled real estate units, residential units, and land use rights. We find that deed tax rates significantly affect prices of residential units, but not prices of office-use and business-use types of real estate. The finding is not surprising since all changes in deed tax rates have been applied exclusively to residential transactions. We also find provincial spillover price effects from deed tax rates in the residential market, with larger effects in the long term. Our findings provide evidence that deed tax policy changes have significantly affected real estate prices, and have done so in the intended direction. High prices in the real estate market, especially in the residential market, have drawn both Chinese authorities’ and individuals’ attention. The residential market is directly related to home-ownership of households and comprises about 80% of the real estate market in China. Figure 1 shows the real national average residential prices for the 30 provinces and direct-controlled municipalities in mainland China between 2004 and 2013.Footnote 3 Residential prices have been persistently increasing in China, on average. Figure 1 shows real average residential prices for the 30 provinces and direct-controlled municipalities in mainland China over the same 10-year period. Price increases were common in all 30 Chinese regions during that period. Interestingly, the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, and province of Zhejiang experienced notable fluctuations during the period of an increasing trend in housing prices. Those are also the regions with higher housing prices. The downturns of 2008 and 2010–2011 may be attributed to the global recession and the economic slowdown in China, respectively. The persistent increases in housing prices show potential autoregressive patterns over time. Source: China Statistical Yearbook Real average prices of residential real estate in mainland China (year: 2004–2013, Unit: Yuan/m2). In addition to economic conditions, housing prices in China are also affected by policy changes that affect the real estate market. Down payment requirements, interest rates, restrictions on foreign ownership, and other government policies also influence prices. For our purposes, a notable example is the change in deed tax policy at the end of 2010, which was intended to discourage speculative demand by increasing tax liabilities for buyers of large homes or multiple home units (i.e., apartments or houses). Figure 2 is a heat map of residential real estate prices in China in 2013. In general, regions on the east coast of China have much higher housing prices than other regions. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai had the highest housing prices among all regions. Tianjin, contiguous to Beijing, also had relatively high housing prices. Shanghai was the central driving force of the high housing prices clustered on the east coast. In Central China, Chongqing is contained in a relatively high housing price cluster compared to the surrounding areas. Simply looking at the heat map, we suspect that there may be spatial correlation in regional housing prices. Source: Created in Google Geocharts. Data are from China Statistical Yearbook Heat map: real average prices of residential real estate in mainland China (Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are listed in the map, but have no prices reported in this map) (year: 2013, Unit: Yuan/m2). The Chinese central government has attempted to stabilize real estate markets, especially housing prices. The government has manipulated interest rates, down payment requirements, and tax policy, has imposed purchase restrictions, and constructed economically affordable housing to make residential units affordable for low-income individuals.Footnote 4 These attempts have met with mixed success. In the following paragraphs, we provide an overview of the various policy tools that have been used to manipulate the real estate market. We also provide a description of the several forms of real estate taxes in China. The Chinese central government has used both monetary policy and fiscal policy to help stabilize real estate prices. Our focus is on fiscal policy, and specifically tax policy in the form of the deed tax. This approach has the advantage that tax policy is flexible in the sense that it can vary across regions or individuals under different circumstances. Implementing different tax rates can alter household demand and producer supply in different ways across regions. In addition, tax revenue is an important source of government revenue that can be used to construct economically affordable housing for the low-income households or provide other public services. Real estate taxes in China are applied in the broad categories of development, transactions, and ownership of the real estate units. Specific taxes include the urban and township land use tax, farm land occupation tax, land appreciation tax, deed tax, and property tax. The urban and township land use tax is imposed on all enterprises, units, individual household businesses and other individuals who use urban and township land for any economic activity. The farm land occupation tax is imposed on all enterprises, units, individual household businesses and other individuals who occupy farm land for building construction or for other non-farm purposes. The land appreciation tax is imposed on income from a disposal or other means of transfer of state-owned land use rights, buildings on the land and their attached facilities. The deed tax is an ad valorem tax paid by the person or organization who receives land or any type of real estate units within the territory of China. The property tax is imposed on owners of property, operational and managerial units of house property, mortgages, custodians and users of house property. Most residential properties owned by individuals for non-business use are exempt from property tax. The deed tax is not the only tool used by the Chinese government to stabilize real estate markets; other tools include manipulation of down payments, limiting purchases by families, and property tax reforms. The down payment for a home mortgage is 30% for the family’s first purchase and 60% for the second purchase. This down payment policy is intended to discourage speculative demand for residential housing. The other purpose is to avoid underwater mortgage finance positions of households, a problem familiar from the 2008–2010 financial crisis in the United States. Fears that the same thing could happen in the Chinese real estate market if housing values depreciated more than 30% for the first-home purchases or 60% for investment purchases of residential property motivated policy changes. Another policy attempt to stabilize the housing market is the limited purchase policy which was adopted by 46 cities in China by 2011 but was dropped by many cities during 2014. During September 30–October 5, 2016, some cities restarted the limited purchase policy to discourage speculative housing demand. Under the limited purchase policy, each family is restricted to only purchase a certain maximum amount of residential property within the city where their residential status is located. The specific maximum amount varies among cities. Individuals who do not hold regional residential status own less residential property.Footnote 5 The recent policy goal of the Chinese government has been to stabilize real estate markets by setting a higher deed tax rate for buyers of large homes or buyers of more than one home, thereby discouraging speculative demand. For example, a change in the deed tax at the end of 2010 was followed by declines in housing prices in some Chinese regions. We examine the effects of the deed tax rate on real estate prices in China over the 10-year period of 2004–2013. The deed tax is legislated through the Provisional Regulations Governing Deed Tax Detailed Rules for Its Implementation. This tax code was issued on July 7, 1997 by the State Council of China and came into effect on October 1, 1997. The tax is essentially a tax levied on the transfers of land use rights or all kinds of real estate property and is paid by the person or organization receiving the land or real estate. The tax rate ranges from 3 to 5% for land and real estate transfers. Tax rates differ between regions and are determined at the provincial level by the People’s Government within the stipulated range taking into consideration local conditions. Tax rates adopted at the provincial level are then filed with the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation (SAT).Footnote 6 For purchases of real estate units or use rights of state-owned land, the tax liability is a fixed proportion of the transaction price. For transfers of land use rights or residential units as gifts, the tax liability is a proportion of the assessed value as determined by tax collection offices based on the market prices. For exchanges of land use rights or real estate units, the tax liability is a proportion of the difference of the land use rights prices or the real estate prices. Since the tax was established in 1997, changes in deed tax policy have affected transfers of residential units only. Table 1 lists the changes to the residential deed tax rate since its inception. The time span considered in our analysis is 2004–2013, a span that includes two of the rate changes listed in that table. The changes in deed tax rates affected residential properties in particular; so, we estimate the effects on residential property prices. We also estimate the effects on other classes of real estate which are unaffected by deed tax changes to assure that we are capturing the effects appropriately, expecting no impact in non-residential markets. We measure aggregate deed tax rates at the provincial level by computing total deed tax revenue relative to the total value of real estate units sold by development companies, thereby generating an average effective deed tax rate in each province-year. Consequently, we are not conducting an event study following specific rate changes, but rather we are estimating the effects of average deed tax rates on prices of residential units, office-use units, business-use units, and land use rights.Footnote 7 The empirical frameworks used in this study are dynamic models and dynamic spatial models that are estimated in panel data environments. The latter type of model allows us to investigate spatial correlation in real estate prices across Chinese provinces, as well as spatial spillover effects of economic factors including deed tax rates. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related studies. Section 3 provides a theoretical framework of the deed tax effect on real estate prices in general in a stock-flow model framework. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy and reports the results. Section 5 concludes and provides policy implications.",3

Worldwide, macroeconomists are dissecting aggregate productivity growth into its micro-components to better understand the sources of growth. This has shaped research agenda on productivity and economic growth and many productivity studies now focus on plant/firm-level analyses to better understand the efficiency of resource allocation (Syverson 2011). Like many industrial economies, there is a fair share of literature on productivity and factor determinant of productivity in Japanese manufacturing industries. Tomiura (1997) described productivity improvement in Iron and Steel industries in Japan and concluded that the infusion of Art, Science and Engineering produced new technology (knowledge) that gave rise to productivity. Kwon and Inui (2003) showed that Research and Development (R&D) expenditure largely explain productivity growth in Japanese manufacturing industries between 1995 and 1998, and that firm size and technology characteristic also seem to play a role in productivity differentials among firms. Okada (2005) examined the determinant of productivity in Japanese manufacturing industries through the analysis of the impact of product market competition and found that “competition, as measured by a lower level of industrial price–cost margin enhances productivity growth. Kawakami et al. (2011) re-examined productivity through the reallocation mechanism and firm turnover based on physical TFP constructed from manufacturers’ survey. They found that productivity measure using physical TFP is greater compared with traditional methods and that low productivity firm exit the market, contrary to earlier opinion held by other researchers that high productivity firm exit the market (Fukao and Kwon 2006). Using dynamic assignment model with unobserved organization capital, Takii (2011) shows that persistent productivity differentials in firms stem from an accumulation of organization capital (in the form of skilled workers) whose by-product is a good performance. More recently, Kim (2016) investigated ‘factor determinants of TFP growth for the Japanese manufacturing industry’ and found that there exist ‘considerable embodied technical progress and that externalities of capital investment are responsible for productivity growth. In the manufacturing, productivity improvement stems from creating the required knowledge of technology and integrating same with existing knowledge, and the result is a new process innovation or technology that can make right, quality-oriented product desirable to market and at a lower cost (Tomiura 1997). This source further argued that technology (know-how to produce) alone is not enough to improve productivity in the manufacturing settings, unless it combined with embodied human capital, i.e., the know-what to produce. The latter involves organizational changes (learning) in response to technological progress and capital-skill complementarity. Elsewhere, experience has been directly linked to productivity increase since it allows producers to identify process improvement (Syverson 2011). This experience (called learning-by-doing in literature) is gained through continuous familiarization and routinization of production activities and are manifested either through workers-level, plant-level, organizational-level or industry-level and is also thought to explain productivity differentials in industries. This experience has been extensively studied and quantified in manufacturing industries through the application of the learning curve theory. Empirical studies with the application of the learning curve theory have shown that unit labor requirement/cost decreases as experience doubles (Arrow 1962; Jackson 1998; Karaoz and Mesut 2005). It then follows that learning reduced production cost and improve productivity at plant-levels. While the subject of productivity measure in Japanese manufacturing industries is not new, surprisingly we did not find any research article which empirically studies the role of learning in productivity differentials in Japanese manufacturing industries. There was no study which empirically measured the learning rates and progress ratios of individual manufacturing industries or across industrial technology groups. This study is an attempt to fill this gap. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to evaluate the Japanese manufacturing industries’ productivity through the analysis of learning rates. We used the production function imputed in the log-linear model and empirically estimated the dynamic learning rates (annual progress ratios) of the entire Japanese manufacturing industries. The novelty of our research is the application of the learning curve theory to understand ‘technological learning’ between industries, explained by a reduction in unit labor cost as experience in production is gained in the Japanese manufacturing sector. We argue that this is an important component of productivity dynamics in the Japanese manufacturing industry. The next four sections of this study are outlined as follows; section two gives a brief overview of productivity and relevant literature survey on learning, section three describes the methodology, section four present the results, section five presents the discussion, and section six gives the conclusion and policy implication.",5

Large regional income differences seem to persist despite considerable policy efforts that aimed to promote a more balanced growth path. Although a series of 5-year development plans, fiscal transfer programs, internal migration policies, and integrated economic zones initiatives aimed to reduce regional disparities, the outcomes still remain below their original targets (Akita 1988; Garcia and Soelistianingsih 1998; Kataoka 2012). In the economic growth literature, per-capita income differences are commonly accounted for by two proximate sources: the accumulation of factor inputs and the efficiency with which those inputs are used (Caselli 2005). Factor inputs typically include measures of both physical capital and human capital. Efficiency, on the other hand, can be further decomposed into different types based on alternative measurement frameworks. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework of Charnes et al. (1978), for instance, decomposes overall efficiency into pure (technical) efficiency and scale efficiency.Footnote 1 Both the accumulation of factor inputs and the efficiency with which they are used are key (proximate) sources for understanding large income differences across the Indonesian provinces.Footnote 2 However, as noted by Kataoka (2018), relatively few studies have examined the provincial dynamics of efficiency in Indonesia. Among the studies that use the DEA framework to measure efficiency, Mokoginta and Wijaya (2015, 2016) find that the average level of provincial efficiency has been low and declining over the 2006–2011 period. In contrast, when considering a longer time frame and different factor inputs, Kataoka (2018) finds that efficiency differences across provinces have decreased during the 1990–2010 period.Footnote 3 In an attempt to extend the findings of Kataoka (2018), this article studies the dynamics of efficiency convergence across 26 Indonesian provinces over the 1990–2010 period.Footnote 4 By taking the three (DEA-based) efficiency scores computed by Kataoka (2018) as data for further analysis, this article (re)evaluates the regional convergence hypothesis (Barro and Sala-I-Martin 1991; Sala-I-Martin 1996; Magrini 2004; Young et al. 2008) in the context of Indonesia. More specifically, through the lens of both the classical convergence approach of Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1992a) and the distributional convergence approach of Quah (1997), the convergence dynamics of overall efficiency, pure efficiency, and scale efficiency are contrasted. Results from the classical convergence approach suggest that—on average—there is regional convergence in the three measures of efficiency of the DEA framework. However, results from the distributional approach, which emphasizes tendencies —beyond average— behaviour, suggest that there are two separate clusters of convergence in both overall efficiency and in pure efficiency. Scale efficiency is the only variable where the Indonesian provinces appear to be converging to a unique equilibrium. These results imply that the overall dynamics of efficiency are most likely driven by the dynamics of pure efficiency and not necessarily scale efficiency. This article contributes to the literature of regional development in Indonesia in three fronts. First, there is a growing literature that applies the DEA framework to evaluate the efficiency performance of the Indonesian regions (Kataoka 2018; Mokoginta and Wijaya 2016; Tirtosuharto 2010). To this literature, the distributional convergence framework presented in this article can be used as a means to identify heterogeneous behaviour, potential multiple equilibria (convergence clusters) and non-linear dynamics that could be hidden behind the evolution of regional efficiency differences. Second, there is a more established literature that focuses on testing the classical income convergence hypothesis in the Indonesian context (Garcia and Soelistianingsih 1998; Kharisma and Saleh 2013; Resosudarmo and Vidyattama 2006). To this literature, this article contributes a detailed evaluation of one of the key determinants of income convergence, which is efficiency convergence. Lastly, there is an emerging literature that studies regional income convergence in Indonesia from a convergence club perspective (Kurniawan et al. 2019; Gunawan et al. 2019; Sakamoto 2007). To this literature the contribution is more methodological. Specifically, it extends the original distributional convergence framework of Quah (1997) by integrating the distribution-based clustering algorithm of Menardi and Azzalini (2014). Then, it applies the conditional density estimator of Hyndman et al. (1996), which is shown to have better statistical properties than the original estimator of Quah (1997). The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data and the empirical frameworks. Section 3 presents and discusses the results of both classical and distributional convergence analyses. Finally, Section 4 offers some concluding remarks and points out some avenues for further research.",14

Hafner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the decades following World War II, economic development paths among Asian countries have diverged widely. Some were able to raise their economic potential and significantly increase growth rates, closing the gap against high-income countries, while others remained stuck with relatively low economic growth rates. In recent years, economic growth rates for Asia in general, and for many of its countries in particular, have become increasingly volatile. To raise the region’s economic potential and begin an overall economic catching-up process, economists and politicians began to promote a closer (regional) Asian integration. While the economies of dominant regional countries such as Japan, South Korea and, more recently, China (PRC and Hong Kong), for example, are concentrated mainly in production-based trading and service industries, industry portfolios among less economically powerful countries are more diversified across industries, and include significant shares from agriculture. As economic integration and global competition foster specialization in certain goods and services, countries and their regions begin to react increasingly differently to asymmetric shocks—despite the intuitive inference that industrial diversification should raise the region’s income and stabilization potential by improving the mix of gross value added (GVA) shares. Consequently, the relationship between industrial diversity and economic stability becomes crucial for understanding how firms’ choice of location relates to the economic environment of heterogeneous regions and how (the rise and fall of) industries shape regional development paths. The paper follows the approach of Hafner (2016, 2019) and uses the risk-return characteristics of regional economic activities to define and analyze Asian industry portfolios. We conduct a case study using the methodology of Hafner (2019) and apply both modern portfolio theory (MPT) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to GVA growth rates in Asian countries, seeking empirical evidence of convex growth-instability frontiers and efficiency gains related to industrial diversification. The MPT was developed by Markowitz (1952), who proposes that efficient portfolios usually result from a strategic selection of different types of assets. To qualify as efficient, portfolios show returns equal to or above those of the minimum variance portfolio—the parabolic efficient frontier. Portfolios with returns below the efficient frontier can be reorganized to attain more efficient positions with lower risks and/or higher yields. Any deviations from the efficient frontier are explained by the existence of (exogenous) technical inefficiencies, as firms systematically fail to exceed the “ideal” frontier when determining their output or cost frontiers, and empirically accounted for by SFA—first introduced by Aigner et al. (1977 and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977). Combining these two methodologies enables us to confirm convex growth-instability frontiers. By defining an economy as a portfolio of differently linked industries, both methodologies incorporate the idea of efficiency as reflected in the risk-return balance of its component activities. SFA is the established econometric choice in much of the literature on this subject (Chandra (2002, 2003), Kluge (2018)), but the use of the MPT to numerically simulate optimal industry portfolios is not as common. While it is not the intent of this paper to offer policy recommendations on how to adjust economic activities, we show how optimal industry portfolios are structured, and how efficiency may be gained in this process. Based on the example of GVA growth in Asian countries in the period 1992–2016 and their regional affiliations, the contribution of this paper is to show (i) how optimal combinations of economic activities can lead to efficiency gains; (ii) the structure of optimal industry portfolios; and (iii) how the resolution of technical inefficiency explains efficiency gains across countries and sectors. The paper also addresses the question of (iv) whether efficiency gains (and, therefore, greater efficiency) result from a combination of country- and sector-specific characteristics. Reported results are shown to be robust to model specifications and data restrictions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the regional growth-instability frontier and industrial diversification. Section 3 introduces the theoretical framework of MPT and SFA, presents the data and gives a descriptive overview of Asian countries’ GVA. The numerical findings on optimal industry portfolios and empirical estimations of technical inefficiencies are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents conclusions.",2

During the industrial revolution era, mining cities often functioned as source of economic growth and center of welfare. At that time, steam engine technology was employed for various industrial projects, resulting in an enormous demand for energy production. The primary available energy resources came from non-renewable materials, such as coal. Nevertheless, as a result of global energy market changes, clean and low carbon energy policy, and industrial technological changes, many mining cities experienced complete mineral production shutdowns. Additionally, the cities faced economic, social, and environmental problems including loss of revenue, unemployment, outmigration, and environmental degradation (Müller et al. 2005; Wirth et al. 2012). Determining urban regeneration policies for former mining cities has become a crucial issue since most of these locations lack economic alternatives for new development. One of the most common preferences in the post-mining era is the repurposing of mining-related materials for touristic attractions. The rationale is to offer their unique mining history and tangible heritage as the main tourism product to the visitors. However, the “tourism after mining” strategy does not always end with success. In 2007, Iwami Ginzan, a former silver mine city in northwest Japan, was registered as the first UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS) in Asia for the post-mining city category (UNESCO 2007). At the same time, Yubari City in Hokkaido suffered bankruptcy, the first and the only case in Japan—even though the city’s government heavily invested in converting the mining town to be a tourist center (Hattori et al. 2017). These two contradictory outcomes proved that post-mining cities should have sustainable tourism development strategies to enhance their competitive advantages in the tourism arena. Transforming post-mining city into tourism would require full commitment and participation from all the stakeholders in preserving their mining heritage value and providing exceptional service for the visitors. Moreover, the strategic tourism development plan entails extra efforts in changing visitor’s minds towards “black image” of post-mining sites. Recognizing visitors’ perceptions is one of the dimensions in destination attractiveness and competitiveness. The number of visits will depend on the match between tourist preferences and the perceived products or offered services (Dwyer and Kim 2003). This study aims to analyze the appeal of tourism resources in a former coal mining city in Indonesia, namely Sawahlunto. To achieve this objective, this research measures the significance of eleven groups of core resources and attractors, including natural beauty, cultural heritage, tourism infrastructure, special events, the ranges of activities, entertainment, shopping, general infrastructure, quality of services, accessibility, and hospitality in generating visits. Considering visitors’ preferences towards these resources is important for the development of tourism products and services. On the one hand, some traditional features offered by post-mining cities may attract visitors, but tourist preferences could also work in reverse and actually influence the types of products and services a city may choose to develop.",15

However, the environment that people find themselves in is not always uniform, even when living in the same city. In general, the poor tend to be exposed to more air pollution and tend to drink contaminated water due to living in inadequate dwellings and so forth, which has a negative effect on their health.Footnote 1 The disparity in the environment surrounding residents can be significant especially in developing countries, because pollution is not sufficiently abated. Unemployment is also a concern in developing countries. One celebrated theoretical study of rural–urban migration and urban unemployment in developing countries is Harris and Todaro (1970). It has been extended by many theorists (Corden and Findlay 1975; Neary 1981; and so forthFootnote 2). Moreover, several studies have dealt with environmental problems by extending the Harris–Todaro (HT) model (Chao et al. 2000; Daitoh 2003; Tawada and Nakamura 2009; Nakamura 2013; Yabuuchi 2013; Pan and Zhou 2013; Li et al. 2014; Tawada and Sun 2010; Nakamura 2018). Most of these studies assume that rural–urban migration occurs due to rural–urban differences in expected wages. However, Tawada and Sun (2010) and Nakamura (2018) assume that rural–urban migration occurs due to rural–urban differences in utility, which is affected by the environment. In the aforementioned studies that consider the negative externality of pollution on utility, residents in an urban area are exposed to the same environment, but the disparity in the environments of residents in the same urban area is not considered. The motivation of this study, therefore, is to focus on this aspect. It assumes that, in an urban area, the unemployed are more susceptible to pollution, and thus, their living environment is worse than the employed.Footnote 3 In previous studies, because the environment for all urban residents is assumed to be the same, an improvement in the environment has, as a natural consequence, the same effect on the utilities of all residents in that area. In this study, on the other hand, within an urban area, an environmental improvement for some residents would improve their utilities; however, it may not improve the utilities of the rest. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to separately consider the change in utilities for employed and unemployed workers. Moreover, this study assumes that rural–urban migration occurs due to rural–urban differences in expected utilities. This study also presumes that unemployment exists only in the urban area. Namely, this study focuses on urban problems because of the following: The percentage of population residing in urban areas in Asia Pacific region is 45.0 in 2010 and is projected to be 63.9 in 2050. Regarding the urban population in this region, it is almost 1.9 billion in 2010 and is projected to be 3.2 billion in 2050 (United nations human settlements programme (UN-Habitat) 2015, pp. 191,192). Thus, urban problems may become more serious. The major results of this study are that, in an urban area, a decrease in the effect of pollution on employed (unemployed) workers raises the utility of an employed (unemployed) worker, but decreases the utility of an unemployed (employed) worker. Both the level and ratio of unemployment increase due to a decrease in the effect of pollution on employed workers or the unemployed.",1
4.0,2.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,13 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-020-00155-7,A paradoxical immigration restriction policy for unskilled illegal immigrants,June 2020,Kenji Kondoh,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is widely known that the gains from international factor mobility are generally sufficiently large to compensate losers.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, most developed countries do not always pursue foreign workers aggressively. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Donald Trump called for the construction of a much larger, fortified border wall to prevent illegal labor inflow from Mexico. Confronted with the large number of refugees and illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa after 2015, EU countries have abandoned their original generous immigration policies and introduced tighter border controls. These strategies are based on the same idea, that is, these developed countries generally do not welcome the inflow of unskilled or lower quality workers any longer. Japan has also shared this ideology and the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act advocates that immigration to Japan be strictly restricted. Similar to the U.S. and the EU, Japan also welcomes the inflow of high-skilled labor, while unskilled foreigners are not officially permitted to work in the country. The number of unskilled foreign workers in Japan is, therefore, limited and can be categorized as the following four types: first, students with part-time jobs, who are permitted to be employed a maximum of 28 h per week; second, technical interns or trainees who are allowed a maximum of 5 years of temporary work to gain skills on the job; third, foreign residents permitted by the Ministry of Justice, such as second- or third-generation Japanese–Brazilians; fourth, illegal workers. However, due to the accelerating population decline and the economic boom effected by the Shizo Abe Cabinet, labor shortage has become quite serious in the last 5–6 years, especially in nursing care, transport, construction, and guarding. In this context, Japan decided to introduce a new residential status in 2018. Two new categories were introduced to acquire foreign workers for industries with labor shortage. The first is Specific Skills #1. Although it is named skill, this category is meant mainly for unskilled workers who have completed technical training via internship as, contrary to the original purpose of the category, interns do not always obtain sufficient industrial technique or skill during their stay and some of them are only treated as unskilled low-cost workers. The Japanese government thus intends to obtain a sufficient number of workers for industries with temporary labor shortage, for whom skilled workers are not necessary. The term “specific skill” seems to be aimed at maintaining an illusion of consistency with the historical Japanese immigration policies, which have never officially permitted the introduction of unskilled workers. Moreover, workers of this category can extend their stay by a maximum of 5 years but are strictly prohibited from bringing their family into the country. The second new category is Specific Skills #2. This category is meant for medium-level skilled workers. Their period of stay can be extended, and they are assumed to be permanent residents with their families. In 2018, during parliamentary discussions, Japan’s Cabinet presented the estimated number of immigrants under each new category. They estimated that in the year 2019 (April 2019–March 2020), the number of immigrants would be 33,000 ~ 47,000, which does not cover the shortage of workers, estimated to be more than 600,000. Therefore, apart from the originally legal high-skilled workers such as medical doctors, lawyers, and so on, those without such skills would now legally find job opportunities in Japan. This change is quite drastic and contrasts with the U.S.’s exclusive immigration policies. Moreover, according to the Ministry of Justice, the number of illegal residents in Japan is about 63,000 as of January 1, 2016.Footnote 2 Around two-thirds of those residents are those who entered Japan as short-term visitors such as tourists, who then overstayed. Ten percent of them entered as technical interns and 5.5% of them are non-Japanese spouses of Japanese nationals. Although cross-national marriage is a legal means to obtain residence status, some foreigners enter Japan by means of a fake marriage. In addition, around 5.5% of illegal residents entered Japan as students, then discontinued their studies and engaged in part-time jobs beyond the permitted number of hours, and continued to stay in Japan illegally after their visas expired.Footnote 3 Following Kondoh (2018), we classify illegal residents in developed countries into two categories. Based on the expected lifetime income, some illegal immigrants to developed countries prefer a high-risk and high-cost entrance with a low risk of detection during their stay. Immigrants by fake marriage or disguised political refugees are included in this category. They spend a considerable amount of money to obtain fake documents that must be submitted at the border to the immigration bureau. Even when the quality of fake documentation is high, some of them are detected by border control, and in those cases, they need not pay penalty charges but must return to their home country immediately. However, if they successfully pass border control and enter as legal permanent residents, their risk of being detected during their stay is quite low, since opportunities to re-evaluate their status are quite limited. Contrastingly, some illegal immigrants prefer a low-risk and low-cost entrance with a high risk of detection during their stay. Most overstaying residents are included in this category. As tourists, technical interns or students, their entrance is costless and completely legal, but after their visas expire, they face the risk of detection by internal investigation actions taken by the host country’s government. There are numerous studies on illegal immigration. Ethier (1986) was the pioneering theoretical study that introduced two common restriction policies to address illegal immigration, border control (border enforcement), and internal investigation (internal enforcement).Footnote 4 The author suggests that the combination of the two policies could reduce the cost of restriction. Ethier refers to two different types of restriction policies but does not distinguish between different groups of immigrants who are targeted by these two policies. Different policies are considered to be effective for all illegal immigrants.Footnote 5 We also note that previous studies sometimes assume that the host country’s government adopts only one of the restriction policies. For example, Bond and Chen (1987) and Yoshida (1993) take only the internal investigation policy into consideration and focus on its effect on the economy of the host country and the global economy. Using an efficiency model, Carter (1999) also studies the economic effects of illegal immigration referring only to the internal investigation policy. Djajic (1987) presents an extended dynamic model based on Harris and Todaro (1970), and also implicitly considers the existence of internal enforcement.Footnote 6 Djajic and Michael (2014) study illegal immigration control on the scope of cooperation with a transit country. As an example of a theoretical analysis of the border control policy, we refer to Yoshida (1998), who re-examines the Bond and Chen (1987) model using a different immigration policy.Footnote 7 However, these studies ignore an important concern that different policies may be more effective for different types of illegal immigrants. Border control may reduce only certain types of illegal immigrants such as those with fake visas, and internal investigation mainly detects illegal immigrants in another category, such as overstaying residents. Kondoh (2018) focuses on this aspect and investigates the best policies for the host country to combat both types of illegal immigration and to enhance the average quality of immigrants and/or exclude relatively lower quality immigrants.Footnote 8 Kondoh (2000) analyzes the worker’s optimal choice of whether to be a legal migrant, an illegal migrant, or to continue to stay at home (in a developing country) considering the difference in the potential ability of each worker and the skill formation period required to be a legal skill holder, as seen in Djajic (1989). Additionally, Kondoh (2018) studies a potential illegal migrant’s choice between high-risk and high-cost entry but low-risk stay, or low-risk and low-cost entry but high-risk stay. The most effective restriction policy for the former type would be border control, while for the latter, border control is meaningless, but internal investigation could more successfully contribute to their detection. Each of the above studies capture the current situation of Japan in a sense, although the effectiveness of restriction policies under the new circumstances, with various types of illegal and legal immigrants co-existing, still remain to be studied. Particularly, not only should the level of skill required to be legal immigrants be considered as in Kondoh (2000), but lifelong income should also be the key factor of decision-making for potential immigrants. In the case that several types of legal and illegal immigrants exist as a result of each individual choice, we must consider the indirect effects of immigration policies for restricting entry of one type of illegal immigrants on the optimal behavior of another type of illegal immigrants as well as legal immigrants. For example, relatively high-productivity job-holders who formerly stayed in their home country may choose legal migration due to the increased lifelong income in the host country. The change in average quality of foreign workers which is strongly attracted by domestic residents in the host country should be calculated under the consideration of above effects on the number and quality of foreign workers. We focus on this novel perspective in this study. Following Kondoh (2018), we attribute the reason for the varied behavior of illegal immigrants to individuals’ skill diversification; further, considering the new immigration policies adopted by Japan, we introduce the possibility of unskilled workers’ legal migration under Specific Skills #1 and #2 depending on their inborn ability. We focus on the economy of the host country and analyze optimal policies to enhance both the income of domestic residents and the average quality of immigrants. Paradoxically, under certain reasonable conditions, we found that policies encouraging the introduction of illegal immigrants with fake visa would be the optimal policy for the host country that seeks to improve both foreign workers’ quality and the economic welfare of domestic residents. Several studies have been concerned with allowing the illegal entry of certain types of workers. Hillman and Weiss (1999) explain theoretically the reasons that illegal immigrants are concentrated in a particular sector when their status is not enforced but given no amnesty. Carter (2005) also studies the case that undocumented workers are endogenously sorted into secondary labor markets. He concluded that undocumented immigration is Pareto-improving when enforcement reserves primary-sector jobs for legal workers. We must note that these studies consider multiple sectors of the labor market. On the other hand, applying one sector labor market model, we similarly obtained a result that allowing certain kind of illegal immigrants may improve the economic welfare of domestic residents. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present our model. Section 3 is devoted to the analysis, and concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 4.",

In Japan, agricultural settlements or villages (in this paper, we call agricultural settlements “rural communities”) play a major role in farmland conservation. Almost all of the rural communities were developed by maintaining the agricultural production condition and the living environment in view of the collective use of water, roads, forests etc. Revitalizing the rural community is important not only from the aspect of rural economy but also for environmental conservation (Taniyama 2001). As a policy plan, a direct payment policy to hilly and mountainous areas was introduced. Under this policy, although many rural communities have entered into agreements for farmland conservation since FY2000, the decreasing number and aging of farmers in recent years have made such agreements difficult. It has thus become necessary to consider the potential of rural social and economic vitalization in these rural communities. Turning our attention to the current situations in Japan’s rural areas, collective actions for rural vitalization can be seen in various forms. In the case of a district located in the mountainous area of Gotsu City in the west of Shimane Prefecture, farmers mow the waterways with non-farmers while rice terraces have been restored by an organization of five rural communities (that is five residents’ associations). In the case of community-based tourism in Shobara City in Hiroshima Prefecture, residents’ organization conducted urban and rural exchange activities through rice farming experience using duck (aigamo in Japanese) farming. The case of a district in Tsuwano town, Shimane Prefecture is based on the collaboration of various actors. Residents planted 10,000 azaleas on the slope of terraced paddy fields to reduce the mowing burden and to improve the landscape. Moreover the residents conducted an Azalea festival in cooperation with the residents’ association, tourist association, and town officials. In a district of Bizen city in Okayama Prefecture, unused farmlands are utilized to provide farming experiences for children and to conduct rice cake pounding events to deepen exchange among residents in cooperation with five rural communities. In some regions, broad-based community districts, across multiple rural communities, have been newly organized as a community hub to increase residents’ welfare. In a district of Kano region, Shunan city in Yamaguchi prefecture, residents are working on interaction with urban residents and manufacturing processed goods such as konjac food in collaboration with three rural communities. The association of residents also makes bento-style boxed meals and delivers the boxed meals to elderly residents living alone with confirmation of their safety. Earlier studies such as Yamaura (2007), Takagishi and Hashizume (2010), Yonezawa and Takeuchi (2006), and Yasunaga (2016, 2018) have attempted to capture conservation patterns in terms of the actual conditions and effects of broad-based agreements. These studies examined the actual conditions of agreements entered into under the direct payment policy, the pattern of broad-based agreements, and the effect of integration of the agreement. On the other hand, Hoshino (1996) and Hashizume (2005) examined the type of regional vitalization from the indicators (principal component) related to the vitalization of hilly and mountainous areas using the municipality data of the whole country and the data obtained from a questionnaire to the officials in the municipalities. Hashizume (2005) examined the survival factors of rural communities (agricultural settlements). Kunimitsu et al. (2006) examined the indicators of vitalization using the data on the achievement of regional planning activities obtained from the questionnaire to the municipal personnel in Shizuoka Prefecture. You (2003) and You and Senga (2004) examined the type of vitalization of hilly and mountainous areas using the municipality data or the data obtained from residents’ awareness questionnaire survey in Ogawa Village of Nagano Prefecture. Similarly, Shiraishi et al. (2004) examined the requirement of vitalization in hilly and mountainous settlements through research for each generation in the Sado region of Niigata Prefecture. Although there are studies examined by many approaches, these studies did not sufficiently clarify the recent collective actions for rural vitalization and the factors affecting the differences among the forms classified in view of farm diversification at the rural community level, nor their geographical condition or the effect of the policy. In addition, little research has been conducted to quantitatively examine the vitalization patterns of rural communities or the relationship between the policy of direct payments to hilly and mountainous areas and the sustainability of rural communities, although Kashiwagi (1997) pointed out that regional agricultural characteristics of hilly and mountainous areas should be considered based on farm management research in Hiroshima Prefecture. It is important nevertheless to capture the characteristics of rural communities in terms of rural vitalization in order to ensure the maintenance of resources that exist in such communities. There has also been research that quantitatively explored the vitalization types of rural communities and the factors affecting such vitalization types under the direct payment policy in hilly and mountainous areas. This study quantitatively examines the typologically active and inactive forms of collective action for rural community vitalization to cope with a new problem for the residents in hilly and mountainous areas that faces difficult situations in resource management under population decline and aging. In particular, we examined the rural communities in the Chugoku region (Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi), which contains many hilly and mountainous areas. It should be noted that we focus on rural communities, which are called “shuraku” in Japan. In this study, shuraku refers to a spontaneous and minimal community formed for agricultural land, water, and forest use on the part of municipalities. We also call such communities agricultural settlements. In Japan, a variety of groups and social relationships are formed at the community level. Even today, social relationships remain in many rural communities.",1

Two reasons are interregional migration from cities/regions, transforming their industrial structures and/or political systems (Haase et al. 2016; Wiechmann and Pallagst 2012), and the “structural” problem of the fertility rate being reduced by urbanization (Sato and Yamamoto 2005). Given that urbanization represents a growing phenomenon globally, in the future, countries/regions are increasingly expected to face nationwide population shrinkages (United Nations 2017). This means that the shrinking society issue will constitute a worldwide phenomenon in the near future. In shrinking societies like Japan, where the nationwide population has already started to shrink (e.g., Hirayama and Izuhara 2018),Footnote 1 the housing supply does not adjust proportionally to the shrinking demand, due to houses’ “durability” (Glaeser and Gyourko 2005). The excess supply of houses causes some to become vacant in the long term and ultimately to be withdrawn from the market. Indeed, Fig. 1 shows the vacancy rate and the withdrawal rate of housing stock in Japan. First, the “vacancy rate” is the ratio of the number of “vacant properties” (i.e., properties currently without any residents) to the number of “all the existing properties” (i.e., properties currently without any residents and those with some residents). The nationwide vacancy rate increases over time, although this occurs more rapidly in rural areas compared to in urban areas. This suggests that in shrinking societies, significant numbers of vacant houses emerge, some of which remain vacant over the long term. Second, the “withdrawal rate” is the ratio of the number of vacant dwellings that are not being utilized in any way (i.e., not in use as second dwellings, for rent, or for sale) to the number of “vacant properties” (i.e., properties currently without any residents). The nationwide withdrawal rate increases over time, and recently, the trend has been more pronounced in rural areas. This implies that the withdrawal of houses from the housing market is becoming common in shrinking societies. Source: Housing and Land Survey in 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013 (Statistics Bureau of Japan) Increasing vacancy rate and withdrawal rate of housing stock in Japan. The horizontal axis is the time horizon. The left-hand side of the vertical axis is the vacancy rate (gray bars), and the right-hand side of the vertical axis is the withdrawal rate (black lines). Panel a shows the figures for the whole of Japan; panel b is for urban areas, more specifically, a “Densely Inhabited District” as defined by the Statistics Bureau of Japan [for details, see https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/chiri/did/1-1.html (accessed April 13, 2019)]; and panel c is for rural areas, excluding the “Densely Inhabited District” of Japan as a whole.  The distinction of “vacancy” inside and outside the housing market, and the relationship between the two vacant statuses are crucial to understand housing market structure in shrinking societies, as well as their housing policies. Nevertheless, most of the previous literature has discussed independently (1) the temporary demand-shrinking process within the housing market and (2) the ownership abandonment of houses that have already been withdrawn from the housing market, or it has failed to clearly distinguish between these two types of vacant statuses. The first line of the literature investigates changes in liquidity under the temporal decline in demand within a search and matching framework (seasonality and/or long-run market cycle) and falling housing prices under excess supply, restricting samples to those participating in the market. In this context, “vacancy” implies a temporal friction within the market, which steadily becomes illiquid (with lower prices) as demand declines. The second line of the literature examines the ownership abandonment process within shrinking cities in the US and other Western countries, characterized by the geographical segregation of residents and the filtering of houses. Low-income households occupy old houses of poor quality in districts developed long ago, and such owners are likely to abandon their ownership rights from their financial distress. In this context, “vacancy” has served as an indicator of neighborhood distress. Although these houses just before ownership abandonment have already been withdrawn from the housing market, the literature rarely distinguishes clearly between vacancy inside and outside the market. This paper proposes a conceptual framework regarding the shrinking process of housing markets. During the initial stage of the shrinkage, long-term vacancy emerges, which lasts for unusually long periods beyond the “natural” level of vacancy (i.e., vacancy arising from the friction within the market). Subsequently, some properties start to be withdrawn from the market, and some are ultimately abandoned their ownership rights. The distinction between these “vacant” statuses inside and outside the housing market as well as the relationship between them strengthens the linkage of the above literature, in contrast to previous attempts to connect the housing market with long-term vacancy (Molloy 2016), or to relate it to housing abandonment (Goodman 2013). Similar to the labor market, which includes people who are not in the labor force, the housing market includes properties that have been withdrawn from the market, an issue that has been largely ignored in the existing literature. Given the strong heterogeneity among potential sellers in shrinking societies, our model also highlights the possibility that the market seems “liquid” even though the demand is actually small. That is, only forced sellers who need to quickly dispose of their properties try to sell with low prices; whereas, the buyer–seller ratio in the market becomes sizable in equilibrium. This implies that the existence of withdrawn houses outside the market affects the housing market structure, specifically concerning the liquidity of properties. Note that this is a different channel from the “negative externality” arising from a distressed neighboring environment that reduces nearby house prices (e.g., Gerardi et al. 2015). In other words, the withdrawal rate has important implications, and should be used as a third index of the housing market condition, besides price and time on the market (TOM). If the withdrawal rate is overlooked, we may fail to attain a full picture of the housing market condition, and even reach misleading conclusions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the previous literature, which motivates the unified framework connecting inside and outside the housing market (Sect. 3). To better understand the connection, especially from the liquidity angle, Sect. 4 develops a model of the distressed housing market. The implications are discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.",3

With the development on social and economic fronts during the post-independence period, internal migration has gained significant impetus. As per Davis (1951), the population of the Indian sub-continent was relatively immobile during the early decades of independence. He attributed this to the prevalence of caste system, presence of joint families and practices of early marriage, diversity of language and culture, and predominance of agriculture in the economy. It is expected that the rate of migration increases with urbanisation and improvement in the levels of education, transport, and communication facilities (Kundu and Gupta 1996). There was a significant progress made on these counts in India soon after independence, but despite this, population mobility continued to decline (Kundu and Gupta 1996; Singh and Aggarwal 1998; Srivastava 1998; Bhagat 2009) at least up to 1991. However, it is during this decade of 1990s a reversal in declining trend of mobility was also witnessed (Census Report 2001) after India adopted the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1991. The NEP stressed both, external sector reforms in the exchange rate, trade, and foreign investment policies and internal reforms in areas such as industrial policy, price, and distribution controls and fiscal restructuring in the financial and public sector. As a result of this new policy, manufacturing sector became concentrated in a few developed states and large cities. This invariably accentuated the inter-state and intra-state disparity in industrial development. As a result, interregional inequality in income levels widened which in turn affected the migration process in the country (Bhagat 2009; Hassan and Daspattanayak 2007). It is, therefore, argued that the migration from backward states and from backward regions of a state has undergone an increase during the post-reform period. The underdeveloped districts experienced loss of population through migration in favor of industrialised/urbanised districts of the developed states. Even within an underdeveloped state, inter-district migration is likely to have accelerated during this period in the wake of widening regional inequality within the state. This disparity can be noted in terms of various indicators, e.g., net state domestic product in per capita terms, infrastructural facilities, and basic amenities like power consumption, transport system, health services, etc. Not only in economic arena but also in terms of social dimensions, the disparity has gone up during the post-reform era. These regional disparities have increased despite reasonably high economic growth in the country. Given the spatial heterogeneity in the level of development, it is expected that inter-state migration will vary differently in different states. Studies show that inter-state mobility is generally low in states with high level of poverty, illiteracy, etc. (Kadi and Sivamurthy 1988). In recent years, there has been an increasing outflow of people from the backward statesFootnote 1 of India reflecting migration of unskilled and low educated people. The volume of inter-state net migration shown by Mahapatro (2012), from various National Sample Survey (NSSO) Rounds, has found net migration rate to be positive in developed states of India like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, and Punjab indicating in-flow of people to these states. She explained this in terms of industrialisation, availability of employment, and social development of the states. On the contrary due to large concentration of population, inequality and poverty, unemployment, etc., states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and North Eastern states supplied large numbers of migrants to economically developed states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, and Delhi. Literature on rural studies shows high level of outmigration from poor and drought-prone areas of backward states like Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh to developed states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, or Chandigarh due to opportunities in the informal economy (Dayal and Karan 2003; Deshingkar 2004; Karan 2003; Rao 2001). States and union territories (UTs) of India are shown in Fig. 1. The states of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh were nonexistent till 2001 as they were parts of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh, respectively, at the time of 1991 Census. Hence, the data pertaining to those states are missing till 2001. The current Jammu and Kashmir state bifurcation in 2019, into 2 union territories—Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh—had given rise to two more UTs. Before August 5, 2019, India had 29 states and seven Union Territories (UTs) or 36 administrative divisions. The country now has nine UTs with Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as new entrants, along with 28 states or 37 administrative divisions. Source Maps of India States and union territories of India.  In India where rural-rural movement from poor areas to rich areas has been the dominant form of migration initially, there has been a sharp increase in rural–urban migration in recent years (Dev and Evenson 2003; Srivastava and Bhattacharya 2003), as more young men travel to work in construction and urban services in the expanding informal sector. Rogaly et al., (2001), observe that in excess of 500,000 tribals, Muslims and lower caste people migrate seasonally from five districts in West Bengal to the rice-growing areas of the state. Falling agricultural commodity prices had triggered outmigration from rural areas (Deshingkar 2004). Again, studies in areas of Bihar that have experienced a doubling of outmigration rate since the 1970s show that migration is now mainly to urban areas and not to the traditional destinations in irrigated Punjab where work availability has declined (Karan 2003). Also increasing population pressure and environmental limits have created new exodus of people (often entire families) from drought-prone and environmentally fragile areas that form nearly two-thirds of the country, with the examples of Uttaranchal (Mamgain 2003) and Odisha (Wandschneider and Mishra 2003). Another study of Bolangir in Odisha estimates that nearly 60,000 people migrated during the drought of 2001 from that district alone (Wandschneider and Mishra 2003). Deshingkar and Daniel (2003) found that more than half of the households in four out of six study villages in Madhya Pradesh had migrating members. The proportion was as high as 75% in the most remote and hilly village with infertile soils. In Andhra Pradesh, while average migration rates were lower, the most remote and unirrigated village had 78% of the households with migrating members. Overall, there has been a massive disparity in outmigration status from the pre-economic reform period across states and union territories in India due to the unequal and uneven development strategies followed. Given the background the objectives of the study are the following: Research objectives: Study the variation of outmigration rates across the Sates and Union Territories of India from 1971 to 2011. Study the socio-economic reasons for outmigration rates across the States and Union Territories of India from 1981 to 2011. Find out the nexus underlying socio-economic-development indicators and outmigration behaviours for the time period of 1981–2011. The current paper is structured with the introduction comprised of the background and motivation of the study. It is also supplemented by the literatures surveyed in the related issues along with the objectives of the study. Section 2 of the paper deals with data and methodology used for the analysis; Sect. 3 summarises the results and discusses them. The paper concludes with inferences, along with relevant suggestions in Sect. 4.",1

The economic benefit of tourism to a particular place is from the tourist expenditure on a variety of goods and services (Dritsakis 2004, Icoz and Icoz 2019). The local businessman supplies goods and services for the tourists and the money spent by the tourist generates considerable economic benefit for them (Baaijens et al. 2010). The local people increase their individual income by increasing production of things that are sold according to tourist’s demand (Anup and Parajuli 2014). The economic benefit is usually regarded as the most important positive effect of tourism. It includes increase of employment opportunities, income generation, tax revenues and improvement in living standards (Tsundada and Mendlinger 2009; Icoz and Icoz 2019). Tourism also provides socio-cultural benefits to the local people such as maintenance of traditional culture, increase in intercultural communication and understanding, and improved social welfare, quality of life, shopping and recreational opportunity (Gilbert and Clark 1997). The tourism industry is the third largest economic activity in terms of global earning after chemicals and fuels. The tourism industry is responsible for 7% of global export in goods and services and 1 out of 11 jobs (WTTC 2018). If any area suffers from declining industries or if unemployment rate is high, tourism development can revitalize this area by introducing new employment opportunities (Ashley 2000; Dritsakis 2004; Filiposki et al. 2016; Su et al. 2019) One of the important effects of tourism is its potential to create employment for the local people (Anup and Parajuli 2014; Mbaiwa 2008). The extent of employment creation depends on the degree of linkage between tourism sectors with other sectors of the economy (Mbaiwa 2002). Tourism industry has significantly contributed to the economy and employment of Indian economy. According to the WTTC 2016 (World Travel and Tourism Council), tourism has directly contributed 2% of GDP and travel and tourism together have directly or indirectly contributed more than 6.3% of GDP in India. Travel and tourism generate huge job opportunities directly, which is about 5.5% of the total employment. The tourism industry has created direct and indirect jobs of 8.7%. In India, travel and tourism investment to total capital investment is 6.0% in the Indian economy and it will likely increase annually (WTTC 2016). Thus, the travel and tourism industry is a significant source of income and job not only at the national level, but also contributes to income and employment for the local community. Tourism encourages economic and social progress for the developing countries by increasing government revenue, employment opportunity and acting as a factor for wider economic growth (Lee and Chang 2008; Naidoo and Munhurrun 2019). Pantin (1998) stated that about nine out of ten managerial sector in hotels and lodges are occupied by experienced outsiders and their salary is several time higher than that of unskilled local workers. Thus, if the tourism industry is properly managed and controlled, it may be exploitative for the local community. To meet the needs of the tourist, the production of foods, equipment, furniture as well as construction is usually necessary in the host region (Dickman 1992). Through this route, tourism provides boost for the local manufacturing and other industry as well as agriculture (Mbaiwa 2002, Anup and Parajuli 2014; Dritsakis 2004). This is believed that tourism can promote long-term economic development (Samimi et al. 2011). The local people not always perceive the benefit of tourism. Sometimes, tourism deteriorates the quality of the natural environment and culture that reduces the profitability of the destination (Kokt and Hattingh 2019; Brunt and Courtney 1999). Tourism development can support the livelihood diversification which is important for remote areas (Guha and Ghosh 2008; Park et al. 2015; Nunkoo and Gursoy 2019). Tourism can improve the livelihood condition and fulfil the basic needs, such as shelter, employment and income, and some essential services like water supply system, transportation, and payment for financial expenses (Mbaiwa and Stronza 2010). Farooq et al. (2012) in his study found that per capita household consumption expenditure is more in households which are engaged in tourism-related activities than those who are not engaged in tourism-related activities (Anup and Parajuli 2014). Sustainable tourism development should be seen as an adaptive paradigm borrowed from sustainable development concept (Nunkoo and Gursoy 2019). The three pillars of sustainability are social, economic and environmental. The ‘social’ perspective is concerned with the satisfaction of basic human needs of an individual, the ‘ecological’ is mainly focused on continued productivity and functioning of ecosystems, protection and conservation of recourse and biological diversity, and the ‘economic’ is focused on equal economic opportunity (Brown et al. 1987; Purvis et al. 2018). The sustainable livelihood refers to a adequate flow of cash and food to fulfil their basic needs in the long-term basis (Chambers and Conway 1991). Here, this paper tries to understand the tourism effects on livelihood, living standard and local people’s perception about tourism development.",3

Under uniform pricing, the international hub airport (hereafter, “hub airport” for simplicity) charges the same airport fee for both domestic and international flights, whereas under discriminatory pricing, the hub airport charges a different airport fee. In Japan, Central Japan International Airport Co., Ltd adopts uniform pricing, whereas Narita International Airport and Kansai International Airport adopt discriminatory pricing. Elsewhere, some hub airports (e.g., TPE, BKK) adopt discriminatory pricing and others (e.g., HKG, KUL) adopt uniform pricing. Discriminatory pricing is an example of third-degree price discrimination, which many studies discuss in terms of its impact on social welfare and firms’ profit (see the Sect. 1.1 for more details). However, the findings of previous studies cannot be applied to examine the airport pricing of domestic and international flights for the following reasons. First, studies have not introduced dependence between markets. In airport markets, even when the hub airport discriminates its fee between domestic and international flights, these two airport fees depend on each other when passengers use both the domestic local airport and the international hub airport. Second, the type of competition is different than that in previous studies. In the airport market, hub airports compete with each other to set a high airport fee. Although each hub airport has an incentive to set a high airport fee, if both hub airports (i.e., the airport for departure and airport for arrival) set a high airport fee, carriers decrease the supply of their services and airport profit decreases. Consequently, no hub airport sets a high airport fee, as in a prisoner’s dilemma game. Therefore, hub airports are strategic substitutes. Third, while previous studies simply compare profits under discriminatory and uniform pricing, we examine which pricing strategy is adopted by hub airports. Thus, this study uses a two-country model and focuses on the existence of local cities (local airports), especially the number of local cities, as this may affect the airport pricing strategies of the hub airport and thus the market equilibria, which has not been highlighted in related research. In this study, there are two carriers in each country, a major and a local carrier. Further, there is one hub airport and several domestic (or local) airports in each country.Footnote 1 The major carrier flies both between hub airports and between the hub airport and local airports in its country. Here, each carrier operates under Cournot competition. There are three types of passengers in each country: (1) those traveling between hub airports, (2) those traveling between the hub airport in the domestic country and local airports in the foreign country, and (3) those traveling between the domestic hub airport and domestic local airports. We assume that the second type of passenger does not change carriers at the hub airport. Considering the setting above, this study analyzes whether each hub airport adopts uniform pricing or discriminatory pricing. First, we derive the equilibrium airport fees in the following three cases: (1) both hub airports adopt uniform pricing (uniform pricing case), (2) both hub airports adopt discriminatory pricing (discriminatory pricing case), and (3) one hub airport adopts uniform pricing and the other adopts discriminatory pricing (mixed pricing case). Based on these results, we derive the Nash equilibrium of the airport pricing policy. First, we consider the symmetric case (i.e., the number of local cities is the same in both countries). As a result, when the number of local airports is small (large), the uniform pricing case (discriminatory pricing case) emerges in the equilibrium. When the number of local airports is intermediate, multiple equilibria (or the mixed pricing case) occur. Additionally, from the viewpoint of social welfare, uniform pricing is preferable. When considering the asymmetric setting (i.e., the number of local cities is different between the countries due to the geographical configuration), the unique equilibrium of the mixed pricing case at which the hub airport with a small number of local airports adopts uniform pricing and the hub airport with a large number of local airports adopts discriminatory pricing appears. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depending on the number of local airports, the socially preferable pricing policy changes from uniform pricing to discriminatory pricing.Footnote 2 With regard to third-degree price discrimination, Schmalensee (1981) and Varian (1985) discuss whether price discrimination increases profit or social welfare in the monopoly market, finding that if total output under price discrimination is lower than that under uniform pricing, welfare under the former becomes smaller than that under the latter.Footnote 3 Neven and Phlips (1985) conclude that price discrimination worsens social welfare in a duopoly market. On the contrary, Adachi and Matsushima (2014) argue that price discrimination improves social welfare if each firm produces substitute (complementary) goods in the market in which the discriminatory price is high (low).Footnote 4 Holmes (1989) and Dastidar (2006) analyze an oligopolistic setting and show the conditions under which profit with price discrimination is higher than that with uniform pricing. Cheung and Wang (1997) analyze the output effects of price discrimination assuming that firms have different production costs. Corts (1998) analyzes the price differential between uniform pricing and discriminatory pricing. Yoshida (2000) introduces vertical relationships and analyzes whether price discrimination improves social welfare. Armstrong and Vickers (2001) analyze the profit effect of price discrimination using a Hotelling-type model. Adachi (2005) considers the influence of price discrimination on social welfare, introducing a consumption externality. Cowan (2007) assumes a nonlinear demand function and analyzes how third-degree price discrimination influences welfare. Arya and Mittendorf (2010) consider a setting in which input buyers serve multiple product markets. Personalized pricing has become a relevant research topic on price discrimination. For example, Thisse and Vives (1988) analyze the pricing policy of spatial competition for firms and show that discriminatory pricing is a unique equilibrium. Since then, studies have shown that a different pricing policy can be employed (e.g., Shaffer and Zhang 2002; Choudhary et al. 2005; Ghose and Huang 2009; Matsumura and Matsushima 2015; Choe et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2020). Regarding airport pricing, some studies address the airport fee discrimination problem. Haskel et al. (2013) consider the case of two substitute airports and examine whether the discrimination in airport fees between these two airports increases. Czerny and Zhang (2011) investigate the influence of congestion pricing on the absence of passenger type-based price discrimination. Lin and Zhang (2016) consider the pricing policy of a congested airport. Nonetheless, although these studies address price discrimination in the airport market, they do not consider price discrimination between domestic and international flights.Footnote 5 With regard to airport privatization, for example, Mantin (2012) and Matsumura and Matsushima (2012) explain the mechanism under which airport privatization (or profit maximizing) takes place. However, they do not consider the existence of local airports. Lin and Mantin (2015) and Kawasaki (2017) introduce local airports and argue that airport privatization is less likely happen. However, they do not consider the improvement of airport management efficiency by privatization. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model setup in a symmetric setting. Section 3 analyzes the uniform pricing case, Sect. 4 analyzes the discriminatory pricing case, and Sect. 5 analyzes the mixed case. In Sect. 6, we compare the airport fees in each case. Section 7 compares the profits of each case and derives the Nash equilibrium. Section 8 compares the social welfare in each case and discusses the results. In Sect. 9, we extend the symmetric setting to the asymmetric setting and compare the airport fee with some cases. Furthermore, we again derive the Nash equilibrium. In Sect. 10, we conclude and discuss the limitations of this study.",2

As of 2018, total global remittance inflows to developing countries crossed the USD 500 billion mark (World Bank 2019a). This is more than the total global official development assistance to developing countries. Since the early 1980s, remittances have been an important source of foreign currency in Bangladesh. Total remittance inflows to Bangladesh amounted to USD 15.6 billion in 2018, which accounted for 5.7% of GDP and more than three times the combined amount of official development assistance and foreign direct investment (World Bank 2020). This was up from USD 0.78 billion (less than 2.6% of GDP) in 1990. Currently, Bangladesh is one of the top ten remittance-recipient countries in the world (World Bank 2019b). Since 1990, Bangladesh’s economy has seen a concomitant expansion, as GDP per capita was USD 306 in 1990, but increased to just shy of USD 1700 by 2018. Similarly, energy consumption has also increased from 123.5 kg of oil equivalent (koe) in 1990–229.2 koe in 2014 (World Bank 2020). While researchers have extensively studied the remittances’ impact on economic growth and other socioeconomic factors, few have studied the relationship between remittances and energy consumption. Given remittances supplement personal income, it can be theorized that remittances could increase energy consumption directly through the expenditure of remittance income in an effort to improve living standards. Thus,  understanding the relationship between remittance and energy consumption is of some importance. Moreover, remittances could increase the energy consumption indirectly through increased economic activity, through the formation of human capital (Adams and Cuecuecha 2013), or through increased financial capital (Senbeta 2013). In fact, Akçay and Demirtaş (2015) found for Morocco that remittances increased energy consumption, because remittances increased income levels which increased demand for energy. A recent study by Das and McFarlane (2020) examined the relationship between remittances and the consumption of disaggregated non-renewable energy sources (for example, natural gas, coal, and petroleum) in Bangladesh. They found a long-run bidirectional relationship between remittances and natural gas consumption, a unidirectional relationship running from coal consumption to remittances, and a unidirectional relationship from remittances to petroleum consumption. Our paper departs from Das and McFarlane (2020) by examining the association between remittances and renewable energy consumption for Bangladesh. Researchers have long recognized the importance of the use of renewable energy in fighting climate change (Inglesi-Lotz 2016; Kula 2014; Tiwari 2011). According to the World Disasters Report 2018 (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 2018), Bangladesh is the eighth worst affected country in the world in terms of the number of people affected by natural disasters in the last 10 years. Geographical and climate related attributes make Bangladesh vulnerable to natural disasters (Hossain et al. 2020). Only in the last decade, the Government of Bangladesh (2008) adopted the Renewable Energy Policy of Bangladesh to address the declining fossil fuel availability and to mitigate climate change. Since 2003, Bangladesh’s success in building the largest national off-grid electrification program in the world has been unprecedented (Sadeque et al. 2014). Within the next decade, more than 3 million rural homes in Bangladesh were connected with the off-grid solar home systems (Khandker et al. 2014). Although the share of renewable to total energy has shown a steady decline in recent years, modern renewable energy sources, such as solar power, have become more popular in recent years (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2020; Islam 2018). Lack of income is still a challenge; however, Sadeque et al. (2014) argued that the influx of international remittances has made it possible for rural households to adopt solar home systems. Despite some anecdotal evidence that remittances potentially impact renewable energy consumption in Bangladesh, empirical work on this issue is conspicuously absent. The objective of our paper is to identify how remittances and renewable energy consumption are interlinked in Bangladesh. To date, only one paper by Das and McFarlane (2020) examined the relationship between remittances and energy consumption in Bangladesh. No study has yet established the potential link between renewable energy consumption and remittances. We aim to fill this void in the literature by answering this question: What are the causal relations between remittances per capita and renewable energy consumption allowing for changes in macroeconomic conditions as reflected in changes in GDP per capita? To answer this question, we use annual Bangladeshi data that span the period 1980–2017. We employ the break-point unit root tests, vector autoregression (VAR)-based Toda-Yamamoto causality test, Johansen cointegration test, and Granger causality test from a vector error correction modeling (VECM) framework. These techniques were widely used by several authors to examine the relationships between energy consumption and other macroeconomic variables (Benali and Feki2020; Rehman et al. 2019; Iyke 2015; Shahbaz and Lean 2012; Wang et al. 2011; Oh and Lee 2004a, b). Our paper is novel for three reasons. First, to our knowledge, this is the only paper that makes an attempt to understand how remittances and renewable energy consumption interact in one of the highest remittance-recipient economies in the world. Second, we examine both short-run and long-run dynamics between these variables while controlling for changes in economic conditions. Third, our results will have several policy recommendations that are not only important for Bangladesh but also for other remittance-recipient developing countries. To preview, we find three important results. First, the Toda-Yamamoto causality test indicates a unidirectional causality from the level of remittances per capita to the level of renewable energy consumption. Second, from the Johansen cointegration test, there is a cointegrating equilibrium relationship among the variables. And third, from the VECM, we find evidence of a bidirectional short-run causality between remittances per capita and renewable energy consumption. We organize the rest of the paper in the following manner. Section 2 provides the literature review. Section 3 presents the data and econometric methods. Section 4 presents the empirical findings. Section 5 provides concluding remarks, offers policy recommendations, and the scope for future research.",17

Bangladesh has set this goal at a 5% reduction of GHG by the end of 2030, compared with business as usual (BAU) in 2011 [Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) 2015]. “Corrective tax” is a term used in many studies, such as Buchanan (1969), Haughton and Sarkar (1996), and Jacobs and De Mooij (2015), also known as the “Pigouvian tax.” As mentioned in Smith (2017), the tax can be used to correct for externalities or “internalities” in a market. In this study, we analyze the road transport market, known as a major contributor to GHG emissions. The use of gasoline and diesel fuel causes emissions in two ways. First, emissions occur during the combustion of fuel, which is the main source of road transport emissions. Second, evaporation occurs from volatile fuels and lubricants. In this study, we focus on emissions due to combustion. However, the use of motor vehicles generates many negative externalities, including accidents, road damage, air pollution, congestion, and oil dependence (Maibach et al. 2007; Newbery 1990; Parry et al. 2007; Santos et al. 2010). Uddin and Mizunoya (2019) revealed that the construction of expressways can be effective in reducing such external diseconomies. To develop sustainable transport policies, all these external costs need to be measured correctly. Most fuel tax studies have been done in developed countries. Newbery (2001), Parry and Small (2005), and Sterner (2007) recognized the fuel tax as an ideal instrument to address global warming. Parry and Small (2005) found some people responded to the distance-based externalities of the fuel tax by purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles, rather than driving less. Addressing these two issues, they derived a formula for an optimum fuel tax based on fuel consumption. Their findings suggest congestion externalities represent the largest component in fuel taxes in the USA and the UK. Antón-Sarabia and Hernández-Trillo (2014) calculated an optimum gasoline tax for Mexico, using five important parameter values, including price elasticity, from Parry and Small (2005). They found accident externality to be the largest component of the fuel tax, followed by distance-related damage, and congestion. Parry and Strand (2012) developed a general approach for estimating motor vehicle externalities; they calculated corrective taxes on gasoline and diesel for Chile, considering only two types of vehicles, namely, cars and trucks. They also used important elasticity values from the USA literature. Moreover, they assumed vehicles’ fuel efficiency might influence the optimum fuel tax calculation. Their model suggests that accident and congestion externalities are the main components of the fuel tax in Chile. All the above mentioned studies are empirical, and use important elasticity parameters in different geographical locations. Therefore, despite their claims, these models can only partially capture the response to optimum fuel taxes. Additionally, these studies do not address the fuel tax amount that would reduce global pollution to a certain level. To estimate a reduction in global pollution, country-specific emissions regulations, vehicle class, speed, and driving modes need to be considered. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no study on corrective fuel tax has been done in Bangladesh. To address these gaps in the literature, this study sets forth the following four objectives: (i) to estimate the fuel taxes for both gasoline and diesel that would internalize negative road transport externalities considering the current vehicle fleet, emission standards, and driving conditions in Bangladesh; (ii) to estimate the impacts of corrective taxes on welfare gain, revenue collection, fuel consumption, and fuel efficiency; (iii) to estimate the reduction in emissions from on-road vehicles due to corrective fuel taxes; and (iv) to find a set of fuel taxes to achieve the INDC goal. Using a dataset from Bangladesh, this study estimates corrective fuel taxes that internalize the negative externalities of road vehicles, then correlates such fuel taxes with climate change policy. We use the Parry and Strand (2012) model to derive the corrective fuel tax, and the Microsoft Windows software program COPERT IV to calculate emissions from road transport in Bangladesh, to achieve our objectives. We fully acknowledge that this study neither investigates the impacts of fuel taxes on the fiscal system, nor the interactions between fuel taxes and other taxes. We also restrict our analysis to diesel and gas, since these are the two main fuels used for road transport in Bangladesh. The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our analytical framework, including our main models and parameter assessment. Section 3 provides our calculations, results, and a discussion comparing these with previous studies. Section 4 concludes.",3

GIAHSs are considered integrated regional systems for the protection of biodiversity through land use, rural culture, and landscapes, as well as traditional agriculture and farming methods. In June 2011, the Noto Peninsula, in Ishikawa Prefecture, and Sado Island, in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, both in the largely rural Hokuriku region on the Sea of Japan, became the first sites to be certified as GIAHSs in a developed country. The Noto region in Ishikawa Prefecture was selected as a case study for this research, to discuss the conservation and succession of a local festival. Among the various agricultural and cultural systems and traditions in the Noto region, this study deals with the Kumakabuto-Hatsuka-Matsuri festival (hereafter “KH-Fest”), which is held in the city of Nanao. KH-fest is one of the numerous indigenous traditional festivals in the Noto region, and also one of several under threat of being discontinued because of population decline. This festival serves as an appropriate case study, because it is held in an area with a declining population (Fig. 1) and cannot continue in the future without the cooperation of non-locals. KH-fest was designated as an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property in January 1981 under the Japanese Cultural Heritage Protection Act. Trends in population relative to 1990 (All of Japan, Ishikawa Prefecture, Nanao City). Source: Authors’ chart based on data from statistics based on the national census conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan The genealogy of the research on the inheritance problem of traditional festivals in Japan is systematically arranged in the preceding research, which has a different analytical framework from the current study (Yamashita and Iwasa 2019). Globally, festival studies are investigations of festival tourism, festival management, and the meaning and impact of festivals in society and culture (Getz 2010). Some studies aim to achieve sustainable regional development using festival tourism as a driving force (Juma and Khademi-Vidra 2019; Okech 2011; O’Sullivan and Jackson 2002). Recent research addressing Japanese festivals as a source of tourism has also often examined the increase in number of tourists and the economic effects which these festivals bring (Akiyoshi 2016), and it has been demonstrated that the festival’s content and context or environment strongly influence visitors’ satisfaction (Kim et al. 2010; Tanford and Jung 2017). The festival examined in this study has fixed dates every year; that is, it does not aim to increase economic profit by attracting customers through a convenient schedule, but explores the possibility of the participation of various people based on their beliefs about the value of tradition. This is consistent with the principle of neo-endogenous development, which is to “recognize the importance of extra-local influences while making use of local resources, including human and social capital” (Atterton et al. 2011). Neo-endogenous development is an innovative way of thinking that leads to success in rural development through a hybrid collection of external resources of different types of endemism and nature from local resources (Bosworth et al. 2020); many successful cases can be seen in European local businesses (Adamski and  Gorlach 2007; Bosworth 2008). One example from the United Kingdom, where university researchers realized regional activation by utilizing their expertise for rural development, is well known (Attanasi and Thompson 2010). In Japan, one national strategy is to create local communities by matching the younger generation with local communities (Shimada 2019). Therefore, this study considers barriers to cooperation with outsiders stemming from a commitment to tradition and understanding of mutual intentions. Previous studies have found that those who participate in multicultural festivals increase their understanding of the relevant foreign cultures considerably (Lee et al. 2012). Observations of the diverse stakeholders involved in a festival in Ghana indicate that heterogenous trust relationships are built among stakeholders through the festival (Adongo et al. 2018). Several empirical studies have demonstrated how festivals can influence society and culture by strengthening their participants’ social capital (Arcodia and Whitford 2006;  Attanasi et al. 2013 ; Moscardo et al. 2017) and regional resilience (Ballesteros 2011). In addition, various benefits produced by participation in local festivals have been reported from the outsider’s point of view (Li et al. 2009). If visitors who participate in local festivals assume similar roles as those held by regional residents, not as temporal volunteer staff (Kwak and Kim 2009), the problem of declining numbers of local participants can be resolved. However, the process is complicated. Although positive results are likely considering these reports, the actual attitude of local residents toward tourism is not necessarily welcoming (Akis et al. 1996; Ribeiro et al. 2013). It has also been suggested that the extraordinary congestion at festivals and the unruly manners of non-locals can cause local people to develop a negative attitude toward these events (Haga 2016), or can significantly reduce participants’ subjective happiness in some specific cases (Yolal et al. 2016 ). And if local residents insist on the participation of non-locals, other problems could arise such as the exploitation of participants (Sin and Minca 2014). Despite evidence of disruption caused by large numbers of visitors, insufficient research has been conducted on locals’ happiness and satisfaction (Akhoondnejad 2016; Matheson et al. 2014), as they are on the receiving end of the influx of visitors. It has also been found that the risk of injuries sustained at festivals impedes cooperation with external visitors (Wood 2019). Therefore, favorable conditions for cooperation with external visitors and the characteristics of local residents’ intolerance (such as xenophobia) must be investigated to prevent needless conflict between local residents and visitors. That is to say, the participation of non-locals in the traditional local festivals should be carefully considered. It is important to then cautiously ascertain which roles non-locals will fill to identify key people and assimilate them as members of the region. Although the previous studies have focused on the motivation of external visitors participating in rural festivals (Frisby and Getz 1989; Kim et al. 2001), there has been no rigorous analysis of locals’ open or closed opinions regarding non-locals’ participation. Discussions on the solutions to these problems have not been sufficient because of a lack of case studies that consider both of these responses from local residents. In other words, there is little scientific evidence on the unique problem of how Japanese people show cooperative or exclusive attitudes regarding the acceptance of outsiders to maintain tradition during a declining population phase. Based on the above considerations, the purpose of this study is to examine how KH-FEST should be managed in cooperation with external parties. To differentiate KH-Fest from conventional research, various opinions concerning the KH-Fest were comprehensively collected and intensively analyzed. The theoretical framework of this study is explained using the concept of social capital. The general concept and relations among the three types of social capital mentioned above are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is known that social capital is accumulated by the participation of many citizens in society and that the accumulation of social capital improves the performance of cooperative activities by encouraging the construction of good relationships within a citizen group (Durston 1999; Antoci et al. 2007). These functions have a visible effect on the real world, such as by promoting recovery after a severe disaster and improving the health condition of a region (Kim et al. 2006; Hawkins and Maurer 2010). In addition, the similarities, differences, complementarity, and synergistic effects of the three representative types of social capital (bonding, bridging, and linking) shown in Fig. 2 have also been investigated through case studies (Leonard 2004; Agnitsch et al. 2006; Patulny and Svendsen 2007). From these previous studies, it is inferred that the cooperation between outsiders and residents in managing the festival may enhance social capital, specifically the development from bridging to bonding social capital of the region. The concept and relationship between the three forms of social capital. Source: Pellini and Ayres (2005) For the hypothesis that these factors will influence attitude formation, the influence cannot be identified theoretically. For example, social capital can either promote integration with outsiders or form an exclusive attitude. It is also difficult to infer from past studies whether it is a virtue for them to inherit the festival even with the help of others or the opposite. Therefore, in addition to factors considered as bonding social capital in the region, new factors such as unconscious conservatism, which is sometimes observed in natural traditions in Japan, as well as self-consciousness, which involves not revealing one’s defects to others, were still exploratory. Based on this assumption, the framework of this study is to seek the factors that influence opinions of whether the management should be open or closed for cooperation with outsiders, considering the social capital of the existing region as a factor. That is, the research question of this study seeks to clarify the psychological aspect of this process. This study is the first to analyze how local social capital and other factors form the opinions of residents, taking closed feelings against outsiders’ participation in the traditional Japanese festivals into consideration. This study approaches to this research question by focusing on the participation of non-local youth in one rural Japanese festival. As the attributes of young people from other areas are diverse, for the sake of simplicity, we will refer to them as university students in Ishikawa Prefecture (hereafter “USs”). The reason for these limited conditions is that the festival is defined by its unique locality, and the above hypothesis is verified through this research based on limited case studies.",1

Mulligan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Location theory, which demonstrates how space affects the behavior of economic agents and the organization of economic activities, continues to provide one of the analytical foundations of regional science (Isard 1956; Beckmann 1968; Lloyd and Dicken 1977). However, the mainstream theory has not evolved to address a variety of issues that have become important in highly urbanized societies. First, location theory has failed to address how variations in customer density affect the price and output decisions of spatial firms—either in a monopolistic or a competitive setting. Second, location theory has given little attention to the issue of customer heterogeneity, and rarely considers that customers (consumers, households) can have different ages, incomes and tastes. And, third, the perspective of location theory is usually static, so the dimension of time, which creates complications in the form of revenue (profit) discounting, is conveniently avoided; here, the work of Isard and Liossatos (1979) is an important exception. These and other omissions present a serious problem to contemporary regional science, because many of today’s spatial markets exhibit neither stability nor uniformity—in fact, many retailing markets in high-density urban settings seem to be in a state of perpetual flux. Consider, for example, firms entering spatial markets with customers that are more heterogeneous than they are accustomed to. Should these firms charge lower or higher prices in these unfamiliar markets? If so, how should they reach that decision? Consider, alternatively, firms expecting steady shifts in the spatial reach of their markets, as in a frontier economy. To what extent should these firms charge lower or higher prices as those markets progressively expand (or contract) in geographic size? Again, how might the ever-changing nature of location-specific demand determine that decision? Clearly, realistic features like these must be addressed to make location theory more relevant to contemporary regional science. Only with improvements made to the fundamental aspects of location theory can new models provide insights into the decisions and behaviors of today’s spatial firms, which often face complex, heterogenous markets, and highly disruptive technologies. Furthermore, these improvements might inform other models in regional science that recognize the key role of space or location in subnational growth and development (Capello 2019). This paper begins by reviewing the well-known problem of the monopolist operating in a uniform spatial market. This optimizing model is most applicable to low-order retail goods, such as gas and groceries, where product differentiation and brand recognition are not that prevalent. However, standard location theory only provides solutions for price, output, and profit when the firm sells in the largest possible spatial market. However, for various reasons, firms do not always sell in markets that are of maximum size. Therefore, in the interests of generalization, the first part of this paper specifies those various solutions for the maximal and non-maximal cases, where both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (areal) spatial markets are considered. The analysis goes well beyond the usual case where the firm’s price is minimized and its market reach (range, radius) is maximized. The paper next introduces a linear gradient to represent the uneven spatial distribution of the firm’s customers. The monopolist must now adapt its pricing behavior to the height and steepness (or extent) of this downward-sloping customer gradient. Here, the analysis recognizes that the firm’s maximum possible reach can be determined either by demographic factors (where household density is zero) or by economic factors (where household demand is zero). A firm will set its price in the usual way, but now, when the steepness of the exogenous customer gradient increases—and the effects of distant customers become less important—the monopolist raises its price upwards to maximize profit. Of course, this price shift has implications for the output (or aggregate demand) and the profit of the spatial monopolist.",

For example, the geographical division of the space-economy into urban and rural areas is not purely a natural phenomenon, but is functionally co-determined by demographic developments, technological progress, smart specialisation, and economic scale advantages. This division into ‘urbi et orbi’ is not a strict and fixed geographical division that is crafted in stone, but shows a time-varying development pattern determined by human choices. This is clearly reflected in the changes in degrees of urbanisation in various countries over the past centuries, which show a great diversity in outcomes in different countries or continents and in different time periods (Nijkamp et al. 2020). Nowadays we live, according to United Nations (UN), in the ‘urban century’. This means that our world is becoming increasingly urbanised, with more people living in urban areas (including suburbs and metropolitan areas) than in rural areas. Not only are the shares of urban vs. rural inhabitants changing, but also the socio-geographic composition within these two groups of people. For example, several villages in rural areas are at present reinforcing their economic position by attracting highly educated residents, while many large cities and urban areas are moving up into the class of mega-cities with mass labour pools. This profound dynamism between urbanity and rurality is called by Kourtit (2019) the ‘New Urban World’. This ‘New Urban World’ manifests itself as an unprecedented reinforcement of large urban agglomerations. These ‘big cities’ are becoming the new powerhouses in our world and, in a recent publication, have even been called ‘urban empires’ (see Glaeser et al. 2020). But the pressing question is: What makes these urban agglomerations powerful? What are the critical success factors for the enhancement of these cities’ socio-economic performance or for their creation of world-class value by these cities? What are the consequences of drastic changes in the ‘urbi et orbi’ patterns in our world? And how should urban governance be organized so as to ensure an urban planet that meets the well-known UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)? There is no doubt that big cities and urban agglomerations act as powerful magnets for human activity, as a result of possessing a great variety of urbanisation advantages. But not all urban areas share the benefits of city formation and expansion to the same extent. Several cities (e.g., New Delhi, Beijing, Djakarta, Lagos, Sao Paulo) are even suffering from severe negative scale externalities caused by pollution, congestion, or crime. In addition to the global urbanisation trend, there is another powerful megatrend, viz. the rise of information and communication technology (or digital technology). This revolutionary change in information handling technology has already had far-reaching implications for urban planning (see e.g. Kourtit 2020), and will drastically change the practice of smart urban planning in the future. The present study seeks aims to develop and present the cornerstones and contours of an appropriate methodological and conceptual framework for smart city governance in a data-rich urban environment. It also seeks to identify the critical success factors that are necessary to build intelligent urban management and strategic policy directions for large cities, so that they can play a significant role at the national or even worldwide platform of urban competitiveness, against the background of unprecedented advances in digital technology. In our contribution, we argue that—even though a digital orientation or revolution in cities and their institutional fabric may be a necessary condition—the digital fix is by no means a sufficient condition. For a city to achieve the ambitious targets of positioning itself as a creator and accelerator of world-class added value (in terms of, e.g., SDG performance), it is necessary to have a different mindset, which meets at least two conditions: (1) an organised structure of data systems and data-handling capacities, following a decomposition or cascade architecture; (2) a hierarchical governance system of city intelligence that is able to reap the fruits of the current digital age for the urban economy. The overriding goal of cities in the digital urban century would need to be the achievement of the highest possible quality of urban life in cities (an idea called the XXQ-principle by Nijkamp 2008).Footnote 1 Consequently, obtaining the label of a ‘smart city’ is only a privilege for a limited number of dedicated cities; a smart city is not based on an unspecified goal or a governance dream, but on a testable achievement as compared with other cities. Thus, to become (and to remain) a high-performing and world-class smart city, a strategic and operational framework for urban governance is needed that is based on goal-oriented transparency, reliable and systemic information management, flexible and resilient policy behaviour in uncertain times, and a critical monitoring of the paths forward. It is thus clear that in the digital era urban planning is ‘work in progress’. While old problems have not yet been sufficiently solved, problems (e.g., pandemics, disasters, lack of security) are coming up. Thus, the question emerges: how to develop a new data-driven architecture and methodology that will support sustainable and inclusive urban development goals? This study is not an empirical research paper, although it is inspired by a wealth of previous empirical research; it aims to advance conceptual and methodological thinking on principles of smart urban planning. The paper provides a conceptual architecture for smart urban policy and is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we will sketch out briefly digital promises for smart city policy. Section 3 will present some elements of world-class value creation based on the so-called XXQ-principle, followed by a brief review of selected relevant literature in Sect. 4. Next, Sect. 5—the core of our study—maps out in more detail the conceptual architecture of world-class performance management by smart cities, in which the methodological core concept of what is here called the ‘flying disc’ will be introduced and developed into the new ‘blowing-up model’. This will then lead to a discussion of smart city principles, followed by a retrospective and prospective conclusion.",8
5.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,07 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-021-00191-x,Borders as opportunities in the space-economy: towards a theory of enabling space,February 2021,Peter Nijkamp,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“Good Fences Make Good Neighbours” In the Index of the Handbook of Regional Science (Fischer and Nijkamp 2020), the concept of ‘border’ shows up only a few times, whereas related concepts such as ‘space’ and ‘region’ are ubiquitous all over the 1700 pages of this opus. Since its inception in the 1950s, regional science has focused its attention on the study of regions or of the space-economy in a heroic attempt to introduce the element of ‘space’ explicitly in the traditional economic ‘wonderland of no spatial dimensions’. In so doing, the existence of regions (or of spatial demarcations in geographical space) was largely taken for granted; regions were supposed to be administrative, physical, or planning areas whose socio-economic problems had to be examined in an analytical way. From the outset, it was insufficiently recognized that regions do not exist without pre-specified borders. However, borders have—with a few exceptions (e.g. Lösch 1954; Hansen 1981)—been an underresearched topic in regional science, in contrast to, for instance, political science, sociology, or political geography. Since borders are essentially at the core of regional science research—as the multidisciplinary study of the complex space-economy—it seems pertinent to advocate a more central position of borders in regional science research. We will begin this paper with a very concise historical note depicting the scene of regional science as of the post-WW II period. Regional science has already a respectable history which dates back to the 1950s when the founding father of regional science, Walter Isard, published his first works on what he then called ‘regional science’. The emphasis was mainly on the development of—often quantitative—methods for a proper multidisciplinary understanding of the interwoven and complex space-economy. His most cited work is called ‘Methods of Regional Analysis’ (Isard 1960), which highlights Isard’s interest in the methodology of regional science. Clearly, over the past 60 years, regional science has broadened its scope in various directions, ranging from regional growth theory to spatial econometrics, and from spatial policy analysis to geoscience methods. A comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in regional science can be found in a compendium containing some 90 articles on advanced theories and methods in regional science (see Fischer and Nijkamp 2020). It is noteworthy that in the early days of regional science, quite some attention has been paid to the nomenclature and the spatial object of study in regional science. Is regional science a separate science or is it an amalgam of several disciplines (e.g., geography, economics, political science, sociology)? Might the name ‘regional studies’, ‘spatial science’, or ‘geographical economics’ perhaps be more appropriate? For pragmatic reasons, at the end, the choice was made to use the term ‘regional science’ as a generic concept for studying social science phenomena from a spatial perspective (see also Nijkamp and Ratajczak 2015). It is should be added that—with the emphasis on quantitative approaches in regional science in the vein of the ‘quantitative revolution in geography’ (see Kourtit et al. 2020)—the conceptualisation and contextualisation of the name ‘region’ received far less attention. In the practice of regional science research, mostly, a pragmatic solution was chosen, for instance, by taking for granted the existence of administrative delineations that ensure a territorial demarcation of a region, or the degree of statistical interdependencies that define a region on economic grounds, or sometimes planning regions that are the subject of government competences and hence policy interventions. However, a more fundamental reflection on the nature or functioning of a region as an object of profound research is largely lacking in regional science. Consequently, the question: ‘what is a region?’ has remained largely unanswered. Surprisingly enough, there has been limited attention for classifications of regions in the history of regional science (see, e.g., Paelinck and Nijkamp 1976), but the ‘raison d’être’ of regions, their genesis, and their dynamics has hardly enjoyed any interest in the history of regional science. There is an extant literature on regional dynamics, but hardly any study on border dynamics in regional science. A noteworthy recent exception is a study by Farrell (2018) on the impacts of changing borders on urbanisation phenomena and socio-economic outcomes. Of course, in reality, one may be inclined to adopt a functional perspective on regions (for instance, the degree of industrial or service orientation), but one might also adopt a socio-demographic point of view (for instance, the degree of population density, or age, gender or ethnic profiles). It goes without saying that in case of multiple demarcation criteria, no unambiguous regional or territorial delineation can be found, as each individual mono-criterion region may partly overlap with others, while depending on the degree of multicollinearity among the relevant demarcation criteria, the number of constituent regions may also vary for each criterion employed. In the context of regional science—as a multidisciplinary approach to the study of spatial structures and developments from a broad social science perspective—it makes sense to approach the regional issue in particular from a socio-economic angle. In essence, for a regional scientist, the region is the (inter)action arena of people or business, which shapes—and is shaped by—human behaviour and attitudes over a long-term horizon. It is the place where poverty and wealth, jobs and unemployment, education and skills, quality of life and health, birth and death, culture and technology, or economic history and future meet. Consequently, ‘the region’ in an objective sense does not exist. It is partly a human–social construct, partly a resource–economic construct, partly a stakeholder–political construct, and partly a physical–geographical construct (cf. Harvey 1969). Clearly, if the region is a territorial platform with many appearances, the question also arises what the borders of a region are. Are these also based on human conceptions, on economic interests, on political power, or on natural constraints? Borders between regions are mainly based on human decisions, influenced by a variety of motives. However, borders have serious consequences, often perceived as impedance costs. However, they may also prompt positive economic effects. The present paper will address the nature of spatial borders between regions. Clearly, regional borders are geographical demarcations which are on one side of the spectrum shaped by relatively homogeneous characteristics (e.g. resources) within an area and are on the other hand, in a new digital world, increasingly dependent on digital socio-economic interconnectivity patterns without clear space limits. Our focus will not be on a strict terminological definition of spatial borders, but on the functional opportunities of borders for an open spatial economy. We will argue here that various borders, as long as they are not entirely closed, may generate permeability advantages on two sides of the border. We will use Sen’s (1992) capability theory as a conceptual vehicle for a positive view on the existence of borders. Thus, our paper aims to show that borders may be a source of new socio-economic possibilities for regions in regional science research. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will provide a selection of ideas and theories on borders that have emerged in various disciplines. Then, in the next section, the notion of borders from the perspective of regional science will be highlighted. The subsequent section (Sect. 4) will make a plea for the concept of ‘enabling space’ in border-line discussions and will emphasize two caveats in a demarcation analysis, viz., intra-regional homogeneity and extra-regional connectivity. Section 5 will then provide some retrospective and prospective remarks.",4

They often take several years in completion and involve many stakeholders, locally or at a more global level. Social and economic activities of different groups of stakeholders are so associated that decisions taken by one group affect the socioeconomics of others, especially when they pursue different goals and do not share the same visions and interests. As a consequence, the unique nature of these projects brings tensions and conflicts, mainly related to land use, property rights and other resources. Numerous works point the fact that the resolution of these kinds of conflicts is complicated and that most of them are settled through enforcement (Yusran et al. 2017; Huber and Joshi 2015; Magsi and Torre 2015), a solution which is obviously not always well accepted. Several issues related to resettlement and livelihood further complicate the socioeconomic problems affecting these infrastructural projects. The public authorities hardly compensate the affected people which is often a source of conflicts (Bui et al. 2013; Magsi and Torre 2015; Moran 2004) mainly due to low compensation amount (Awasthi 2014; Li et al. 2015). These projects are also cause of contested displacements and negatively impact the employment and livelihood opportunities of affected community (Sun 2013; Williams and Porter 2006; Oppio et al. 2015; Kaya and Erol 2016). It is always hard to keep the original profession for the displaced populations (Moran 2004). Poor literacy and lack of skills in other professions further complicate the employment issues. As a matter of fact, many people around the world suffered from displacement (Scudder 2005; WCD 2000), and further from unemployment and landlessness (Brown et al. 2009) due to big infrastructure projects. Land acquisition in dam construction projects is a pretty common and very intricate situation, which gives birth to different conflicts (Swain and Chee 2004; Awasthi 2014). Policies related to these projects are hardly unbiased and factors like favoritism to selected people or tribes and mistrust over Government are also common (Vignon and Lecomte 2004; Li et al. 2015; Mann and Jeanneaux 2009; Magsi and Torre 2015). Moreover, such projects can be located in tribal areas where lack of legal rights and informal settings further enhances the conflicts (Lombard 2016; Flood 1997). Inequalities among the local population based on the historical settlements are another source of conflicts, not only among local people but also between them and the Government (Sabir et al. 2017). History of projects related to dam and reservoir construction in Pakistan is not different, which also resulted in poverty and displacement of number of people. Pakistan is becoming water-deficient country, which needs water for irrigation and there is a huge problem of electricity shortfall. Keeping in view this situation, Government’s current focus is on dam and reservoir construction projects. But in spite of Government’s claims of development and better living standard of affected people, the projects like Mangla Dam, Tarbela dam and Chotiari water reservoir in Pakistan resulted in worse socioeconomic conditions and low living standard (Magsi and Torre 2015), although their importance for the economy cannot be ignored. This research focuses on different socioeconomic factors which are likely sources of conflicts arising due to infrastructural projects. The article considers the specific situation of Diamer Bhasha Dam, a very large and contested project in Pakistan, as a case study. To understand the causes and the consequences of the various types of conflict and oppositions linked to the difficult setting of this dam infrastructure, we exploit data issued from numerous interviews with local stakeholders. Further, different articles from national and regional dailies are studied on selected issues as a secondary source. We analyze the various categories of socioeconomic factors, describe patterns of perceptions of different experts and stakeholders, and the way local population are being affected by the project. The paper starts with a presentation of the case study. In the second part we present our methodology, mainly based on stakeholders and experts’ interviews and their exploitation with multiple component analysis (MCA). The results of the MCA analysis further reveal the existence of two main groups of opponents, with different status, visions, and interests. Then, we go into the discussion of weaknesses and flaws of different project activities and their impacts on affected population. We also highlight the risk of conflict perceived by experts, which results from very confronting perceptions of stakeholders in several fields: change in living condition, employment, compensation amount, opposition based on property rights, mismanagement and corruption. Finally, we provide conclusions about our study.",6

Despite the resulting population decline in many countries (in particular, the OECD countries), most cities in our world continue to grow in both number and in size. This spatial-demographic process raises intriguing research and policy questions on urban sustainability and vitality, worldwide, including in Asia. Japan is already in a transition process moving towards a depopulating society as a result of the structural ageing process. Other Asian cities will also become depopulating nations in the near future. Yet, the current megatrend of a structural population concentration in urban agglomerations will clearly not come to a standstill, not even in a depopulating nation like Japan. The unprecedented increase of the urban population in Japan—and all over the world—is closely associated with the magnet effect and the economic achievement of modern cities. In the existing literature the growth of cities is—historically and theoretically—mostly explained by the presence of agglomeration economies. It is also often assumed that such positive returns to scale may be adversely affected by negative externalities, such as environmental pollution, high energy consumption, traffic congestion, criminality etc. Clearly, such negative factors are abundantly present in an urban economy, but if one corrects these phenomena for urban population density, the joint use of alternative energy generation or supply (e.g. cogeneration, renewable energy, and smart grids, etc.), the degree of technological innovation, and the development of well-organised public transportation systems, one often finds that urban agglomerations are rather efficient ecological entities, compared with a completely dispersed pattern of the population in a country. And, therefore, it is important to assess more precisely the real energy–environment–economic (3E) performance of urban agglomerations. In the broad ecological-economic literature, it has often been shown that environmental quality may increase after a certain level of welfare has been reached (see, e.g., Jӓnicke et al. 1989, Larson et al. 1986). This debate has led to empirical research on what is called the inverted U-curve for the relationship between income and pollution (see Shafik and Bandyopadhyay 1992; He and Wang 2012; Zhang et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Destek and Sarkodie 2019; He and Lin 2019; Yao et al. 2019), a phenomenon that was named the ‘environmental Kuznets curve’ by Panayotou (1993). This term originated from the research undertaken by Kuznets (1955) on the inverted U-shaped curve for income inequality and economic development. Furthermore, the relationship between an urban agglomeration—i.e. with a high urban population density—and the 3E performance of a city may show a U-shaped relationship, comparable to a Kuznets Curve (for a review, see de Bruyn 1999 or Graves 2014). This may be caused by the fact that, over a long time span, increasing population density initially leads to a decline in the 3E performance, but after a certain urban size threshold level, a city will begin to improve its combined 3E efficiency. This proposition suggests that population density growth or urban growth facilitates the 3E performance improvement of a city. If this is so, we may derive interesting policy implications for urban strategy development, especially in a depopulating society. The measurement of urban 3E performance calls for an appropriate methodological approach, in which the output-input ratio of cities is interpreted as a performance measure (in economics, usually called ‘efficiency’ or ‘productivity’). The assessment of urban output achievement and urban input efforts is, however, fraught with many operational and empirical data problems. In recent decades, a very effective instrument for benchmark studies has been developed and employed called data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is able to confront a multidimensional set of outputs with a multidimensional set of inputs, there by leading to an efficiency measure (see Charnes et al. 1978; Suzuki and Nijkamp 2017a, b). Since then, DEA has become an important performance method in industrial organisation and public-sector planning. This approach will be adopted here, albeit in various adjusted forms. DEA has become an established quantitative assessment tool in the evaluation literature. Already more than a decade ago, Seiford (2005) mentioned that he had found at least 2800 published articles on DEA in various management and planning publications. Clearly, nowadays this number is already much higher. The DEA methodology has also extended its scope towards other disciplines. Currently, in the urban performance context, there are several assessment studies that have applied DEA models to measure the economic efficiency of cities, which in the DEA jargon, are called ‘Decision-Making Units’ (DMUs) in the DEA jargon. A wealth of introductions to DEA and of its applications to city efficiency rankings can be found in: Borger and Kerstens (1996), Worthington and Dollery (2000), Afonso and Fernandes (2006), Suzuki et al. (2008), Nijkamp and Suzuki (2009), Kourtit et al. (2013) and Suzuki and Nijkamp (2016, 2017b). This large number of applied studies shows that an operational analysis of city efficiency in a competitive environment is an important, but also intriguing research topic in the urban and regional science literature. Meanwhile, DEA has demonstrated its great potential in providing a quantitative basis for comparative and benchmark studies in efficiency or productivity analysis. Regarding an application of DEA to energy and environmental efficiency analysis, Zhou et al. (2008) presented a literature survey on the application of DEA to energy and environmental (E&E) studies, followed by a classification of 100 publications in this field. This study argues that all the research which provides lists of DMUs is confined to just electricity firms or plants, or one country or major region, such as the OECD, APEC, and the EU, or developing countries. Martínez (2011) measures energy-efficiency development in non-energy-intensive sectors (NEISs) in both Germany and Colombia, based on a DEA model. And Wu et al. (2014) apply a DEA model—and calculate related Malmquist indices—for an efficiency evaluation of regions in China. The above list of studies shows that comparative efficiency analysis in the energy–environment sector using DEA models has increasingly become an important research topic in recent years. It is noteworthy that Zaim and Taskin (2000) measure an environmental efficiency based on DEA and a Kuznets Curve on OECD Countries. Clearly, these E&E studies did not apply DEA and a Kuznets Curve on a city level. This suggests a current knowledge gap, and hence our study will just focus on this new topic, viz. a 3E performance and Kuznets Curve analysis on ‘city’ level. It should be noted that DEA was originally developed to analyse the relative efficiency of a DMU by constructing a piecewise linear production frontier, and projecting the performance of each DMU onto that frontier. A DMU that is located on the frontier is efficient, whereas a DMU that is below the frontier is inefficient. The idea of DEA is that an inefficient DMU can become efficient by reducing its inputs, or by increasing its outputs. In the standard DEA approach, this is achieved by a uniform reduction in all inputs (or a uniform increase in all outputs). However, in principle, there are an infinite number of possible improvements that could be implemented in order to reach the efficiency frontier, and, hence, there are many solution trajectories, if a DMU wants to enhance its efficiency. It is noteworthy that, in the past few decades, the existence of many possible efficiency improvement solutions has generated a rich literature on the methodological integration of Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) and DEA models. Here, we provide a concise overview (see also Suzuki et al. 2010). One of the first contributions was provided by Golany (1988), who proposed an interactive MOLP procedure, which aimed to generate a set of efficient points for a DMU. This model allows a decision maker to select the preferred set of output levels, given the prior input levels. Later on, Thanassoulis and Dyson (1992), Joro et al. (1998), Halme et al. (1999), Frei and Harker (1999), Korhonen and Siljamäki (2002), Korhonen et al. (2003), Silva et al. (2003), Lins et al. (2004), Washio et al. (2012) and Yang and Morita (2013) also proposed complementary efficiency improvement solutions. In particular, Suzuki et al. (2010) proposed a new projection model, called a distance friction minimisation (DFM) model. In this approach, a generalised distance indicator is employed to assist a DMU to improve its efficiency by a movement towards the efficiency frontier surface. Of course, the direction of the efficiency improvement depends on the input/output data characteristics of the DMU. It is then plausible to approximate suitable projection functions for the minimisation of distance by using a Euclidean distance in weighted space. As mentioned earlier, a convenient form of multidimensional projection functions that serves to improve efficiency is given by the Multiple-Objective Quadratic Programming (MOQP) model, which aims to minimise the aggregated input reductions, as well as the aggregated output increases. Thus, the DFM approach can generate a new contribution to efficiency enhancement problems in decision analysis by employing a weighted Euclidean projection function, while, at the same time, it might address both an input reduction and output increase. The DFM model is able to calculate either an optimal input reduction value or an optimal output increase value in order to reach an efficiency score of 1.0. Clearly, in reality this might be hard to reach for low-efficiency DMUs. Recently, Suzuki et al. (2015) presented a newly-developed adjusted DEA model, which emerged from a blend of the DFM and the target-oriented (TO) approach based on a super-efficiency (SE) model, to generate an appropriate efficiency-improving projection model. The TO approach specifies a target-efficiency score (TES) for inefficient DMUs. This approach is able to compute both an input reduction value and an output increase value in order to achieve the pre-defined TES. However, this TO approach assumes that TES is set by a decision maker or policymaker, which may introduce subjective elements. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a more objective way to set a TES. Given this background, the first aim of this paper is to present and test an advanced assessment methodology for evaluating the economic and (energy and environment) sustainability-oriented performance strategies of large cities (called ‘government-ordinance-designated cities’) in Japan. It does so by applying a Super Efficiency (SE) DEA model. We compare 19 big cities in Japan in a quantitative benchmark study to trace and identify the highest-performing cities from a 3E efficiency perspective. This approach offers a novel opportunity to test a variant of the Kuznets sustainability curve under various urban population density conditions. From this analysis, we will now suggest that population density growth facilitates the 3E performance improvement of a city. If this is so, we may derive interesting policy implications for urban strategy development, especially in a depopulating society. And, the second aim of this paper is to develop a new objective target setting model in the TO-DFM approach: namely, the autoconfiguration target (AT)-DFM model. In the present study, the above-mentioned new AT-DFM model is applied to provide an efficiency-improving projection for the enhancement of the efficiency of several big Japanese cities. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarises our DFM methodology, while Sect. 3 presents the newly developed model, called the AT-DFM model. Next, Sect. 4 applies this model to measure the economic and sustainability-oriented performance of 19 large cities in Japan. It also provides a test result of our new type of Kuznets sustainability curve under various urban population density conditions. Section 5 then presents the efficiency improvement projection results based on our new AT-DFM model for inefficient cities. Finally, Sect. 6 draws some conclusions.",3

Quite in contrast, other authors such as Batty (2008) have argued that cities are complex systems and that their population is affected by a whole range of intertwined dimensions. Taken together, these substitutable factors influence not only urban agglomeration economies but also other context conditions of cities, thus altering urban costs and benefits (Camagni et al. 2013). In this context, the experiences of developing countries where urbanization has followed a frantic pace over the past two to three decades remain largely unchartered. Although China’s profile is still that of a developing nation, China has arguably followed a rather singular path to urbanization during the modern and postmodern eras. Yet, there is still a dearth of scientific research on the determinants of population growth and on the structures of the urban system of contemporary China from an integrated perspective (Thill et al. 2017). Given this knowledge gap, this paper is a contribution aimed at establishing the existence of other determinants influencing urban agglomeration in China and their interrelated impact on urban population. Since Alonso’s seminal research (1971) on “the economics of urban size,” a body of conceptual and theoretical research has sought to gain a deeper understanding of the issue of optimal urban population. Skepticism about the scientific value of this theory of “optimal city size” is still lingering, in particular in light of the inconsistency between the theoretical “optimal city size” and the state of the urban system in the real world. Hence, the focus has been redirected toward the city size factors in terms of urban costs and urban benefits (Camagni et al. 2013). A large body of literature exists on the role of elements that can be deemed fairly conventional in contemporary urban economics, including agglomeration, urban land rent, quality of life, and social conflicts (David et al. 2013; Evans 1972; Henderson 1986; Parr and Jones 1983; Segal 1976). More recent theoretical research has identified additional drivers that reflect the contemporary complexion of city environments, such as city connectivity, urban functions, and urban sprawl (Camagni et al. 1994; Capello and Nijkamp 2005). Recently, Camagni et al. (2013) argued for a radical departure from the orthodox discourse on urban size. Rather than looking at it as an optimality issue, they proposed a model of equilibrium city size, which also espouses the view that both conventional and unconventional elements affect city size. Their effort provides a pathway to reconsider the relationship between urban population and a range of socioeconomic elements. Despite the flurry of contributions to theories of city size, little effort has been put toward assessing the relationship between conventional or unconventional elements and city size in developing countries such as China (Shen et al. 2020). This is a striking paradox given that these countries are the leading edge in making the twenty-first century the Urban Century globally, that they bring to the fore new templates for urban development, and that they stimulate new perspectives for strategic urban research (Kourtit et al. 2014). To fill this gap in the literature, we apply the conceptual framework of Camagni’s equilibrium model and empirically test the theoretical hypothesis of this model with an improved estimation method applied on data series for Chinese cities. By conducting panel data regression on prefectural-level cities over the 2005–2009 period, we find that the relationship between a range of elements and city size varies across space and that all the ingredients have different roles in affecting the growth of urban population in China. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The second section reviews the extant research and theories on the relationship between city size and traditional factors as well as more recently advanced approaches. The third part describes the equilibrium model and the dataset used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 comprises the results of the empirical estimation of the econometric model on a sample of 262 Chinese cities through national and regional models and a discussion of the interpretation, significance, and contextualization of this analysis in relation to the development trajectory of mainland China. Finally, conclusions in Sect. 5 suggest future strategies in urban planning and urbanization policy as well as pathways for improving the economic and social environment.",

Not only in the field of economic growth analyses, some studies on economic convergence in the context of price levels and its implication on monetary economics have also been documented (see, among others, Beck et al. 2009, De Grauwe 1996, Evans and Karras 1996, and Rogers 2007). The notion of convergence suggests that cross-sectional units exhibit convergence behavior when their variation diminishes over time (Hotelling 1933). While many arguments regarding the convergence of an entire economy, some scholars have proved that a convergence phenomenon may also exist in some economies with similar structural characteristics (Azariadis and Drazen 1990; Galor 1996). In other words, some economies with relatively similar structures may form a relatively common balance transition path, widely known as a club convergence hypothesis. While growth convergence is derived from the law of diminishing marginal returns in classical economic theory, price convergence is rooted in the notion of the law of one price (LOOP). At an elementary level, the concept of LOOP asserts the following idea: within an efficient market, in the absence of trade restrictions, and when expressed in a common currency, the price of the indistinguishable goods in different places must be equal (Rogoff 1996). It implies that price levels across regions would be equal in the long run at the regional level within a country. Therefore, with transportation costs being considered, any regional price differentials are temporary and would tend to disappear in the long run. Nevertheless, proving a LOOP with empirical evidence is challenging and puzzling due to complex macroeconomic factors. Thus, the debates about LOOP are still growing in economic literature. Analyzing price convergence across regions within a country by itself is interesting and, at the same time, challenging work. When studying intra-country analysis, one might consider some common features of the regional economy as opposed to national economy, i.e., the existence of a single currency, having similar customs, and more importantly, there are no trade tariffs. Thus, it is natural to expect that the price convergence process across regions will be more pervasive within a single country than across countries. There are some good prima facie reasons to hold this assumption. For example, products, labor, and capital markets are presumably better integrated within a country. More notably, tax and trade policies are more identical within a country than between countries. Studying price convergence in large and diverse archipelago countries like Indonesia is essential. Besides enriching literature on the application of convergence club analysis in various economies, such a study will also reveal some regional patterns that may have important policy implications. While some previous attempts can provide meaningful information on price convergence in Indonesia, they leave some space for further exploration. For example, Wimanda (2009) and Purwono et al. (2020) apply classical convergence frameworks that evaluate the convergence process by looking at the average level of observation. This concept might have limitations in explaining the variation of price behavior in a diverse economy like Indonesia. Meanwhile, the work of Jangam and Akram (2019) is the first contender that attempts to evaluate price convergence in Indonesia beyond average by applying the dynamic factor model developed by Phillips and Sul (2007). However, they do not analyze the influencing factors of the formation of convergence clubs. Against this backdrop, the current paper provides additional value-added on top of the previous literature by identifying convergence clubs of price dynamics across provinces in Indonesia and explaining the influencing factors towards convergence club formation. The organization of the remaining of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on price convergence studies, while Sect. 3 discusses the methodologies. After briefly explaining the data in Sect. 4, we present and discuss our results on the formation of convergence clubs and influencing factors in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper with remarks.",5

EGs are useful for protecting the environment, and the importance of trade liberalization of the EGs has been widely recognized since the 2001 Doha Ministerial Declaration of World Trade Organization (WTO). This declaration initiated the reduction or elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services (EGSs). In 2011, the WTO report TN/TE/20 was released with the Annex II.A, which contains a list of the EGs based on the Harmonized System (HS) classification at the six-digit level. In 2012, the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) put together a list of 54 EGs and affirmed their commitment to reduce applied tariff rates to 5% or less by the end of 2015. This reduction of tariffs is specified in Annex C of the 2012 Vladivostok Declaration. Then on July 8, 2014 at the WTO, 14 members, including China, the European Union (EU) and the United States, launched plurilateral negotiations on trade liberalization for EGs. Presently, there are 46 countries engaged in the negotiations.Footnote 1 The potential impact of trade liberalization and trade increase of EGs is easily illustrated. This trade liberalization would lead to import demand expansion through import price decrease resulting from tariff reduction, especially in fast-growing developing economies which have comparatively high tariff rates on these goods. Importing EGs at a lower price makes it possible to access climate-friendly goods with clean energy technologies, which could have a substantial effect on climate change mitigation. Especially for the renewable energy sector, cost has been the principal obstacle to the deployment of renewable energy-based electricity generation in developing countries; the reduction or removal of these tariffs contributes significantly to improving access to these goods. Access to more energy-efficient technologies at a lower cost may be particularly important for industries that must comply with environmental policies, which place the burden of emission reductions on the emitters.Footnote 2 The effects of trade liberalization on climate change mitigation can be seen not only on the demand side of the importing countries, but also on the production side of those goods in the importing countries. Increased imports of EGs give producers in the importing countries the opportunity to learn and benefit from technological advances, and allows larger markets for EGs leading to profits from economies of scale by production increase. There are numerous examples that indicate that trade liberalization of EGs increases local capabilities for innovation and adaptation of domestic technology rather than simply fostering dependence on the transfer of foreign technology.Footnote 3 Trade increase in EGs affects producers in the exporting countries as well. The production of EGs has the following characteristics. First, at the initial stage of production, sunk costs for research and development are enormous, and second, the degree of product differentiation can be large depending on the producers. Consequently, many EGs are produced in monopolistic competitive industries with monopolistic power for each variety which is produced with scale economies. Following trade liberalization of EGs in the importing countries, production increase of exporting countries having comparative advantage leads to average cost decrease and profit increase based on economies of scale, which induces the entry of new firms with new varieties. The trade benefit for users on the demand side realized by trade liberalization is the expansion of choices among the varieties with lower prices as a result of increased competition among producers of both exporting and importing countries. Accordingly, these effects on the monopolistic competitive environmental industries will lead to an increase in the worldwide deployment of EGs, which will possibly induce successful environmental protection. For this study, seven goods which contribute to renewable energy production are selected, due to the fact that electricity from renewable energy sources is increasing in every region in the world.Footnote 4 However, the photovoltaic cells sector is not included in this study, as the determinants for this sector were previously examined in Matsumura (2016b) and Matsumura (2019). In addition to EGs related to renewable energy production, three EGs of precision instruments which contribute to monitoring environmental conditions are selected. Those ten EGs are shown in Table 1, under HS 2012 classification at the six-digit level. The estimation model is based on the fixed effect approach of the gravity model with importer and exporter dummy variables. This model is useful for examining the effect of bilateral tariff rates and other proxies of trade costs, such as distance and dummy variables of common language and regional integration. Bilateral tariff rates depend on trade relationships developed through regional trade agreements (RTAs), and thus it is important to examine the effect of RTAs along with the effect of bilateral tariff rates such as most-favored nation (MFN) tariffs and tariffs of generalized system of preferences under WTO. Following Hayakawa (2013), the present paper assumes exporters use the lowest tariff rates although multiple tariff schemes are available in most country pairs for each RTA. The estimation results are rigorously investigated to show cases in which the coefficients of three estimation methods are significant for each of the ten EGs examined in this study. In addition to examining the effect of tariff rates, other important determinants of trade including regional integration are investigated in detail. For the EGs with a significant effect of regional integration, the intra-industry index is introduced to clarify the trade pattern of each country within each region. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, there is a brief review of the literature on the effects of tariffs in the gravity model and the determinants of trade in EGs. Section 3 describes the theoretical foundation of the gravity model for the disaggregated goods, the specification of the estimating model, and the data. Section 4 presents the estimation results for the determinants of trade in each EG, a comparison among the results of the ten goods, and the trade pattern of each country in each good having the robust effect of regional integration. Section 5 concludes.",3

As a result, properties with high natural resource value have been acquired by individual investors and companies, both domestic and foreign. The internationalization of these economic transactions over land has been observed worldwide. As a widespread trend, there has been a movement in which the governmental development authorities of developing countries, or companies in foreign countries, obtained farmland in developing countries with fewer land resource regulations, and promoted urban development (Chen 2003) and energy-intensive crop cultivation (Robertson and Pinstrup-Andersen 2010). Although time and scale vary from case to case, examples of farmland acquired in developing countries with low agricultural income under the pretext of development for public purposes can be seen worldwide (von Braun and Meinzen-Dick 2009; Gonsalves 2010). Then, in the process of such large-scale conversion of agricultural land, some cases of land grabbing by private companies and national development projects have been reported, wherein indigenous local customs and agricultural cultures have been undermined (Kusiluka et al. 2011; Baka 2013). Furthermore, some official initiatives are reported from Asia and African countries, where the state has intervened and developed legal and institutional frameworks to protect the unique resources and culture of these areas (German et al. 2011; Nielsen and Nilsen 2014). The primary issue in these cases was the way of legitimate compensation to farmers who contributed farmland (Sarkar 2007). Theoretical research has been developed on the mechanism and solutions of conflicts between buyers and farmers (Bao and Hui 2013; Ghatak and Mookherjee 2014). In the genealogy of the above research, a purpose, impact to local community, and issues of land acquisition were comparatively clear. However, in recent years, the potential impact that development by foreign companies is expected to bring has been regarded as a problem. For example, it was pointed out that the water use priority of developers stipulated in the land transaction clause may hinder existing local water use practices (Woodhouse 2012). The market for surface and groundwater resources is global, and the impact of land acquisition on local water use practices is an important issue that affects the entire basin (Endo et al. 2018). Depopulation and aging in rural areas are common problems in Asian countries, including Japan. In addition to the decreased number of farmers and forestry workers due to the population decrease, the profitability of agriculture and forestry has declined, while agricultural and forestry land continues to deteriorate. In Japan, land far from residential areas has been acquired by economic entities other than local residents because of the decrease of local landowners' desire for land ownership caused by the prevalent situation (Katano 2014). Under this situation, land acquisition by a foreign economic entity (LAFEE) is taking place in water source areas (WSAs) in Japan. WSAs in Japan were the subject of this study. WSAs include specific regions regulated by the Act on Special Measures concerning Measures Related to Water Resources Areas enforced in 1974 to maintain regional peripheral land that disappeared because of dam construction. However, WSAs are ambiguously defined, as each prefecture enforces this regulation for WSAs in mountainous areas. In this study, WSAs referred to mountainous areas that seldom overlapped with residential areas. Public disapproval of LAFEE may be prevalent in areas with little experience of the process. In Japan, the generally negative public opinion of LAFEE in WSAs began to form around 2010, regardless of political ideology (Takahashi 2011; The Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research 2012; Miyamoto 2017). Influenced by this public opinion, regulations regarding LAFEE in WSAs have been implemented in several prefectures in Japan, though the content and scope are varied. Among them, there is a commonality that it is required to report the property information of the acquirer and the acquisition purpose to the administrative organization in addition to land information details several months before the acquisition (The national trusts in Japan 2014). However, prefectures in Japan do not include a regulatory mechanism, as in the United States, for partial control on the acquisition of farmland by foreign companies. (Uchiyama 2011, Hayashi 2015). In evaluating and reviewing existing ordinances and new defenses, many citizens supported a policy to prevent LAFEE in WSAs and feared that the construction of facilities would endanger surrounding properties and damage forest resources (Yamashita 2018). In addition, previous research has suggested that interest in LAFEE was not local but universal, because local inhabitants were not significantly more interested in LAFEE (Yamashita 2017). However, the grounds for this negative public opinion were unclear and there was no proof of any actual damage during the time of acquisition (Yamashita and Ido 2016). Under Japanese civil code, groundwater use is interpreted to be a right of landowners; however, the ordinances of some prefectures on WSAs also include direct regulation of abnormal water use. Therefore, the possibility of developing dangerous facilities or reducing the availability of forest resources was low as long as existing forest conservation laws and regulations were appropriately enforced. In view of the above, the general public “uneasiness” was caused by the fact that the nation did not accurately grasp this fact. A similar situation has been reported in Georgia (Gugushvili 2016). This study considered that the anxiety caused by the discrepancy between the actual conditions of the LAFEE process and the non-comprehension of these conditions by the public should not be overlooked, because it may disrupt the stability of people’s lives. This is based on the findings of a Kenyan case study, which pointed out that the needs of foreign investors should be more fully comprehended and actively considered when designing land-use systems (Otieno and Oluoch-Kosura 2019). Similarly, in a Turkish case study, a legal system was analyzed based on the recognition that considering the rights of foreign investors to acquire land may be beneficial (Polat 2019). Thus, suitable clarification of the LAFEE process may alleviate the confusion of affected parties. To address this problem, this study investigated the interest in WSAs land acquisition by foreign investors from two regions (Taiwan and Hong Kong) with the highest rates of land acquisition. The rationale of this study is to investigate the other side of the conflict that are foreign investors to establish whether public opinion and regulation of Japan correspond with investor intentions/opinions. This study administered a web questionnaire that collected data on the intention of individuals who met the participation criteria described in Sect. 2.1. Through the use of questionnaires, it was possible to more accurately grasp the actual needs of foreign investors, which the Japanese public had hitherto not understood. This research is expected to contribute to future regional policy planning; the paper has the following layout: respondents to this survey, geographic areas, and data collection methods are described, along with the data analysis framework in Sect. 2. The results of detailed data collection and considerations based on the analytical framework are described in Sect. 3, and a discussion on the issue, based on the results, is presented in Sect. 4. Finally, the social significance of the findings is confirmed, and corresponding recommendations are provided in Sect. 5.",2

Governance is generally composed of government, business and civilian society. In practical terms it involves various organizations and stakeholders in addition to the national and local governments taking decisions that affect others. Watershed management is possibly the best example of such sustainable development. Here, sustainability is based on striking a balance between human society and natural environment for future generations. Sustainability governance forms part of the environmental governance and can be defined as a framework within which the global environment for future generations is discussed and then determined (Asano and Takada 2014). It can also be regarded as governance that is future-oriented. Specifically, it is beneficial to make collective and comprehensive decisions in collaboration with the public sector, the private sector and civilian society. Collaboration between these sectors is necessary to tackle the broad and complex challenges of sustainability, and decision-making within such a framework is usually a collaborative process. The group should include all stakeholders who have an interest in a particular decision, either as individuals or as representatives of a group (Hemmati 2002). After holding several stakeholder workshops, detailed policies are usually developed that play important roles in the decision-making process. This process has been a frequent topic of discussion and has led to the introduction of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) (Annandale et al. 2001). SEA is a systematic and comprehensive process for evaluating the environmental effects of the policy, plan or program system (PPP) and its alternatives at the earliest appropriate stage of the publicly accountable decision-making process, thereby ensuring full integration of relevant biophysical, economic, social and political considerations (Partidario 1999). The potential of SEA to improve governance has also been discussed on the basis of its ability to increase transparency, participation and inclusiveness by advocating a participatory and structured assessment process (Kidd and Fischer 2007). In SEA, communication, participation and reporting have important roles to play by introducing the perspectives and inputs of different stakeholders into the PPP-making process. The objectives of the present study are to introduce the notion of environmental governance into decision-making, by establishing a method for assessing the alternative plans of the many stakeholders and developing a procedure for determining the most appropriate plan due to the planning process devised from SEA. The discussion focuses on the river environmental improvement works.",2

Performance assessment of firms is one of the most important economic activities for management practitioners and policymakers (including investors and creditors) not only because it provides information for management planning and control activities but also because it is crucial for sector-specific development (Asmild et al. 2007; Ertuǧrul and Karakaşoǧlu 2009). Performance assessment generally refers to a method by which firms’ or organisations’ progress toward pre-set goals and objectives, namely revenue growth, profitability, shareholder value creation, competitiveness, customer satisfaction and product quality is measured over time (Viswanadham and Luthra 2005). Performance assessment may be based on financial metrics (financial ratios and value-based measurements) and non-financial metrics (activity-based management and a balanced scorecard) (Knauer et al. 2018; McNamara and Mong, 2005; Myšková and Hájek 2017). However, financial metrics are the most widely used approach to firm-level performance assessment because of their simplicity, objectivity, information content and inputs for economic modeling. Financial performance metrics provide both short-term and long-term views of a firm’s financial strength, health and growth strategies. Financial performance metrics are broadly classified into profitability and value (shareholder) metrics (Carton and Hofer 2010; Richard et al. 2009). Profitability metrics measure a firm’s ability to earn profits on investments, while value metrics measure shareholder value (wealth), residual earnings or economic profit (i.e., profit adjusted for the opportunity cost of capital) (de Wet and Hall 2004; Shayan 2013). Moreover, performance theorists have long held that profitability is a determinant of shareholder value creation (Ganea 2015; Varaiya et al. 1987). In fact, it can be argued that competitiveness and sustainability may depend on the extent to which a firm continues to create value and remains profitable. For example, a firm that engages in product innovation and strategic planning may achieve high returns on assets, sales growth, high profits and impressive overall growth (Cho and Pucik, 2005; Valčić and Bagarić 2017). A strand of the literature on performance assessment emphasizes value-based metrics as the most important and comprehensive measure of performance because value metrics simultaneously measure the returns to all stakeholders, namely, employees, customers, government and shareholders (Athanassakos 2007; Ganea 2015; Rappaport, 1986; Shayan 2013; Uyemura et al. 1996). According to this argument, value-based performance metrics are used to drive value-based management (VBM) control system that aligns corporate actions toward growth, profitability and shareholder wealth (Knauer et al. 2018). Value-based metrics take into account investment risks, cash flow, economic life and the cost of capital (Venanzi 2012). In addition, value-based performance metrics are useful tools for firm-level benchmarking (Valčić and Bagarić 2017; Viswanadham and Luthra, 2005). The foregoing indicates that performance assessment (even within the financial metrics framework) is a multidimensional construct (Carton and Hofer 2010). Furthermore, the organizational performance literature presents numerous financial performance metrics for assessing the performance of firms. However, assessing the financial performance of firms presents a huge challenge because, in addition to their large numbers, these various metrics are arguably unique and differ in the information they present about firms. Although some metrics are considered superior to others (O'byrne 1996; Stewart 1994; Uyemura et al. 1996), there is currently no consensus on a tell-it-all-metric (Petravičius and Tamošiuniene, 2008; Peterson et al. 1996; Venanzi 2012). In addition, different industries are more likely to favor specific profitability or value metrics over others. Given these difficulties, this study proposes a framework comprising an iterative fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) used together with the technique of order preferences by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate the overall performance of firms in a given industry or sector. The proposed framework utilizes all established financial performance metrics, without giving preference to any specific metric or requiring expert opinions (judgements) as presented in similar previous research, and simultaneously evaluates the overall performance of firms based on their profitability and value metrics and finally ranks each firm by its overall performance. The framework was tested using 21 financial performance criteria (profitability and value creation metrics) estimated from the financial data of the top 18 Japanese construction firms for the fiscal years 2010–2020. In the light of the findings, this paper demonstrates that it is possible to evaluate the performance of firms by simultaneously utilizing all available financial performance metrics and, from this, to prioritize firms based on their overall performance. This study addresses the question of how the performance of firms or decision-making units can be evaluated based on (1) the overall value created by simultaneously utilizing all possible value-added metrics, (2) the overall profitability by simultaneously utilizing all possible profitability metrics, and (3) the overall profitability and values created by simultaneously utilizing all possible performance metrics. Several studies have implemented performance evaluation with fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS methods using financial criteria (Akkoç and Vatansever 2013; Aldalou and Perçin 2018; Ertuǧrul and Karakaşoǧlu 2009; Eyüboğlu and Celik 2016; Ioan Ban et al. 2020; Mandic et al. 2014; Rezaie et al., 2014; Seçme et al. 2009; Shaverdi et al. 2016; Wang 2008). However, in addition to contributing to this body of literature, a significant contribution of this research is that the framework does not rely on expert judgement to construct the comparison matrix but relies on the normalized multivariate pairwise correlation matrix between performance criteria which it linguistified, fuzzified and de-fuzzified to create appropriate weight for the performance criteria. Moreover, the proposed framework simplified the evaluation procedure, making it easy for benchmarking analysis. The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows: Section two describes related literature on Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS. Section three describes the Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS research methods adopted for this study. Section four presents the proposed framework, the data sampling procedure, and the financial performance metrics and their estimation strategies. The application of the proposed framework is presented in section five. Finally, section six presents the summary and discussion of the findings, the implications, conclusions, and limitations of the research.",2

As the pioneering arguments on the source of economic growth, Young (1995) and Krugman (1994) summarized that the “East Asian economic miracle” was the result of “perspiration” rather than “inspiration”. In accordance with the traditional Solow model, perspiration-dominant growth should predictably slow down as factor accumulation is subject to diminishing returns to scale (Solow 1957). However, inspiration growth can increase the maximum possible output, given factor accumulation through an upward shift of the production frontier. Studies on the sources of economic growth also induced measurement studies on TFP (Kalirajan et al. 1996; Angeriz et al. 2006; Li et al. 2008; Isaksson 2009; Wei and Hao 2011; Machek and Hnilica 2012; Danquah et al. 2014; Beugelsdijk et al. 2018; Kataoka 2020). For example, Isaksson (2009) described the advantages and disadvantages of the three approaches—growth accounting, regression analysis, and frontier analysis—and concluded that none is perfect. Further, many studies (e.g., Aswicahyono and Hill 2002; Van der Eng 2010; Asian Productivity Organization 2019; Musyawwiri and Üngör 2019) have applied the conventional Solow growth accounting and regression analysis, which requires the restrictive assumptions of a single output, full utilization of the factors of production, and perfect competition. Both derive total factor productivity (TFP) growth as an exogenous residual, that is, as the difference between output and weighted input growth. The conventional growth accounting approach assumes constant returns to scale (CRS) and various returns to scale (VRS). While the income shares under CRS in several studies (e.g., Kataoka 2013; Mendez and Kataoka 2020) are fixed at the conventional 2/3 and 1/3 for labor and capital input, respectively, the TFP growth under VRS is calculated as the residual plus the scale effect. Regression analysis requires the specification of a particular functional form and offers a partial resolution, as it allows relaxing the CRS assumption for the estimation of income shares. Further, frontier analysis approaches, such as non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) and parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), can apply the Malmquist TFP index to multiplicatively decompose TFP growth into two components (efficiency change and technological change, EC and TC, respectively) (Färe et al. 1994; Wei and Hao 2011). However, each approach has advantages and disadvantages as follows. On one hand, DEA does not require any functional form assumptions although it is deterministic, highly sensitive to outliers, and does not consider any random variations. On the other hand, SFA incorporates the error term, although it requires specific functional forms, distributional error term assumptions, and modifications for multiple input and output frontier estimations (Coelli et al. 2005). From Fan et al. (1996) pioneering work proposing a semi-parametric method that allows for statistical noise and requires no specific functional form of the production frontier, many new semi-parametric and non-parametric stochastic frontier techniques have been applied to narrow the gap between SFA and DEA (Gong 2017). Frontier analysis addresses the question of whether TFP stems from technological progress and/or efficiency gains. Production takes place inside the production frontier, and the distance between the production frontier and production indicates inefficiency. Equivalently, the farther below the frontier the production is, the larger the inefficiency becomes. For example, efficiency gains derive from the decrease in distance, while technological progress derives from the frontier shift. Efficiency cannot continue to improve without technological progress, since efficiency gains cannot recur once the frontier is reached (Margono et al. 2011). Being an emerging East Asian economy, as a large insular and the world’s fourth most populous nation with a wide distribution of abundant natural resources, Indonesia consists of economically diverse provinces: the major urban agglomeration (Jakarta), resource-rich off-Java Provinces (Ache, Riau, East and South Kalimantan, and Papua), internationally popular tourist destinations (Bali and Yogyakarta), emerging business cluster provinces (West and East Java), and labor-intensive agricultural provinces (all remaining provinces) (Hill et al. 2008; Kataoka 2018). The nation is also beset by spatial output imbalances: nearly 60% of the national income is derived from the on-Java Provinces, which account for only 6% of the nation’s land, as shown by the choropleth map in Fig. 1.Footnote 1 Provincial distribution of gross regional domestic product (GRDP) in Indonesia, 1990 To mitigate such economic imbalances, the government implemented several policy measures, such as administrative guidelines in the 5-year national development plans and integrated economic development zones, migration to sparsely populated off-Java Provinces, progressive inter-governmental fiscal transfers, and decentralization reforms (Kataoka 2020); however, the policy outcomes are still below target levels. As shown in Fig. 1, the annual average growth rates of the gross regional domestic product (GRDP) in the three most developed on-Java Provinces (East and West Java and Jakarta) exceeded the national growth rate of 4.8% during 1990–2015. Since the World Bank (1993) conducted its multi-country analysis, many studies have examined Indonesia’s TFP growth at the national, sectoral, regional, and firm levels. However, there is no consensus on the empirical results because of the different choices of datasets and/or methods to process the estimates. For example, Van der Eng (2010) found inconsistencies between the Penn World Tables (PWT) and official data from Indonesia’s Statistical Agency in several existing studies. Additionally, physical capital data, which is essential for TFP estimation, has never been officially published. Among existing literature, Van der Eng (2010) used the GDP data from Indonesia’s Statistical Agency and estimated − 0.9% of annual average TFP growth rate in the national growth accounting TFP residuals for 1975–1997: − 9.7% for 1998–1999 and 1.7% for 2000–2008. On the other hand, Musyawwiri and Üngör (2019) used the PWT data and estimated the values as 0.6% for 1967–1996, − 10.7% for 1997–1999, 2.0% for 2000–2006, 0.8% for 2007–2009, and 2.4% for 2010–2014. The Asian Productivity Organization (2019) derived the values as 0.3% for 1970–1990, − 1.1% for 1990–2010, and − 1.5% for 2010–2017 from data obtained from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). Differing from the aforementioned growth accounting studies, Grosskopf and Self (2006) used the DEA-based Malmquist productivity index and the WDI data for five Southeast Asian nations to estimate 0.7% TFP growth rate in Indonesia for 1960–1996. At the regional level, several studies have measured TFP growth in Indonesia (Margono et al. 2011; Kataoka 2013, 2018, 2020; Mendez 2020; Mendez and Kataoka 2020; Purwono and Yasin 2020). For instance, Margono et al. (2011) conducted Translog SFA, incorporating labor and capital inputs with GRDP output, covering 26 provinces for 1993–2000, which considers the effects of the financial crisis of 1997–1998. They employed the approach of Kalirajan et al. (1996)Footnote 2 to additively decompose output growth into output growth due to input growth and output growth due to TFP growth and found negative TFP change due to efficiency deterioration. Although they applied the SFA approach, considering the effects of random shocks in production, their study ignored the role of human capital. Kataoka (2013) estimated provincial capital stock for 1987–2007 following Van der Eng’s (2010) approach and used the conventional growth accounting method to identify small positive mean provincial TFP growth, which varied significantly by province. Kataoka (2018) used DEA to measure overall technical efficiency scores, which were multiplicatively expressed by pure technical (resource utilization efficiency) and scale efficiencies (resource allocation efficiency) for the 26 provinces over 1990–2010. He found considerable improvements in both multiplicative efficiency components. Mendez (2020) and Mendez and Kataoka (2020) used Kataoka’s (2018) DEA efficiency scores to examine the convergence club hypothesis, both graphically and numerically. Further, Kataoka (2020) applied the DEA-based Malmquist productivity index (MI) to measure provincial TFP growth, which consists of technological growth and efficiency improvement, over 1990–2015. He found that seven of the 26 provinces experienced negative TFP change due to technological regress, and it was barely offset by efficiency improvements. Only some on-Java Provinces, mainly Jakarta and West Java, were found to contribute to national technological progress. Purwono and Yasin (2020) used Cobb-Douglass and Translog-type SFA to measure the annual TFP growth of 29 provinces for 2002–2017. They found negative mean TFP change at a nearly zero level, where the negative growth rates were mostly exhibited by the less developed Eastern regions in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Jakarta never showed negative TFP growth rates during the observation period, which confirms the findings of Margono et al. (2011). However, except for Margono et al. (2011) study, no existing studies have examined the contributions of factor accumulation and TFP growth on national and provincial output growth. To address this gap in the literature, the present study identifies the source of national and provincial output growth, measured by the GRDP, in Indonesia over 1990–2015, referring to Kalirajan et al. (1996) additive decomposition method. Our study contributes to the existing literature in at least three ways, as follows. First, as opposed to the existing SFA-based studies, we use the DEA approach, which has flexibility due to its free functional form, less restrictive assumptions, and multiplicative decomposability, for TFP measurement. In addition to the conventional DEA method, we apply the bootstrap technique to derive the bias-corrected efficiency score to cope with stochastic noises from unobserved production. Second, extending from Margono et al. (2011), our frontier analysis uses the long quinquennial balanced panel data of one output and three input variables, covering 26 contiguous Indonesian provinces over 1990–2015. Therefore, our analysis weighs more on the long-term growth path rather than short-term cyclical changes. Further, our dataset incorporates the input variables of human capital in addition to physical capital as the role of human capital is becoming more significant in Indonesia’s long-term economic growth. Lastly, our decomposition analysis quantifies the relationship between the sources of national and provincial output growth, by disaggregating the national output growth components to provincial ones.",1

The positive effects are mostly on the economic development, while environmental impact through carbon emission and quality degeneration remains one of the biggest problems it has created worldwide. The climate change through greenhouse gas emissions problem has become a sensitive problem to both developed and developing countries which calls for urgent handling to avert the imminent danger it poses to mankind. Part of the influencers of climate change is the rapid rise of the world population after the Second World War and the increasing industrialization which generate pollutant emissions through excessive use of energy source (Kaya and Taylan Susan 2020). The issue of carbon emission, which was first discussed after the 1st World Climate Conference in Geneva in 1979, was put on the world agenda as a result of the ""United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"" (UNFCCC). The agreement was signed in order to keep the carbon emission, climate change and environmental pollution at a level that can be prevented. Following UNFCCC is Kyoto Protocol agreement which was signed in 1997 and entered into force in 2005 (Sancar and Bostancı 2020; UN 1998). Nevertheless, the carbon emissions have not declined due to the carbon intensive activities in energy sector, the use of fossil fuels and the increasing industrialization which have kept the emission rates at record breaking (Udemba 2020a,b, c, 2021). Turkey has experienced an intense and one-way process of migration from rural to urban areas following the investments made in the industrial sector and economic breakthroughs (Sağlam 2006). While the population living in urban was around 15% in the early 1950s, this rate increased to 31.5% in 1960, 38.2% in 1970, 43.8% in 1980, and 64.7% in 2000. According to the data, 75.6% of the country's population lives in urban nowadays (World Bank-TEPAV 2015). However, the country, which has undergone an unplanned urbanization process due to the lack of state controls, is going through a painful period regarding environmental pollution, even though it shows economic growth. As stated in the 9th Development Plan (PSB 2006) covering the years 2007–2013, the rapid and unplanned urbanization movements caused an abnormal increase in the population in big cities and an increase in the ownership of motor vehicles in these cities. The population increase and the increasing nature of acquiring vehicles in these cities coupled with the fossil fuel consumption of large industries, increasing energy needs and excessive fuel consumption in urban transportation cause serious environmental pollution. Turkey is faced with the problem of carbon emissions as well as in the whole world. There is a direct relationship between the methods used in electricity generation and carbon emissions (Bajpai et al. 2012). The fuel used in the energy sector in Turkey is formed by a vast majority of coal, crude oil and natural gas (Çetintaş et al. 2017; Kumbur et al. 2005); thus, it causes a considerable increase of the country's carbon emissions. Turkey has not yet made a grand breaking shift to renewables like use of nuclear energy and this has contributed in increase in its fossil fuel consumption. This has made Turkey to be among the countries that contribute the most to global carbon emissions. The per capita carbon emission level, which was 0.6 metric tons in 1960, exceeded the level of 5 metric tons by 2020. On the other hand, the carbon emission (by kiloton) realized in the country during the same period increased 24 times. The gravity of the situation is striking when compared to the data from EU and OECD countries in order to show what danger the country poses to carbon emissions. For OECD countries, carbon emissions per capita were 7.1 metric tons in 1960 and 10 metric tons in 2020. When we consider all OECD countries, the total carbon emission (kt) almost doubled. In the European Union, the per capita carbon emission level, which increased from 4.6 metric tons to 7 metric tons, has increased by approximately 75% in total. On the other hand, electricity use per capita (kW) has increased 30 times between 1960 and 2019 while the share of carbon emissions that occur as a result of electricity usage and heating has increased from 20 to 50%. Looking at these data, it attests to the implication of carbon emission to Turkish environmental performance compared to both the European Union and OECD countries. As of 2019, Turkey is the fourteenth country with the highest total carbon emissions among all countries in the world, surpassing countries such as the UK, Italy, France, India and Spain. Considering the data of the last decade, it is expected that the country will be in the top ten in the list if similar rates of increase occur and if the country does not focus on renewable energy (Say and Yücel 2006). Turkey is considered a commercial cum industrial hub where economic activities are increasingly taking place. Specifically, the economic and manufacturing activities are centered in big cities as remarked earlier and this has drawn many people to the urban centers of the country which has potentials threats to the environmental quality. On this note, we seek to investigate the environmental implication of the Turkish urbanization towards its sustainable development. In addition to this, we expand our study to accommodate other vital indexes such as industry, fossil fuels and FDI in measuring both the environment and economic performance of Turkey. It is proven that urbanization due to increase in industrial and manufacturing activities in cities can pose essential threat to the environmental development (Musah et al. 2020) of any country if not handled well. To ascertain the effect of urbanization, authors incorporate industrialization and FDI which have positive correlations to the urbanization. Scholars (McGee and York 2018) have tried to investigate the impact of urbanization to the environmental performance of many countries but only few (Liu and Bae 2018)) have tried to incorporate industrialization and FDI in their studies to see if there is a link between the three variables. To contribute to the literature, we attempt to answer the following questions: is there a link between urbanization and Turkish environmental degradation through carbon emission? Is the economic growth via FDI and industrial operations affecting the country’s environmental performance, and in what way? Is there a nexus among the adopted variables (economic growth, urban population, industry, FDI and fossil fuels) in this study pointing towards Turkey’s environmental degradation? For effective and efficient research into unfolding the answers to the raised questions, we apply different methods such structural break, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-bound tests with vector error correction Granger causality estimate. The remaining section of this study are literature review, data and methodology, empirical results and discussion and conclusion.",12

As expected, the included articles are diverse and it is hard to summarize them under one specific theme. We consider that this is due to the definition of sustainability. Given the huge volume of studies that deal with sustainability, obviously there exist different definitions—as many as the number of scholars and institutes. Considering scientifically projected threats of climate change impacts on humans in the next 30 years, the highest priority is to verify whether sustainability holds whenever and wherever we carry out whatever action. However, sustainability is too general a concept, so that even conscious people become disoriented when trying to meet sustainability goals in practical settings. A well-known and primitive definition of sustainability may be given as follows: Current generations spend their life without causing any (additional) costs to future generations. If this holds for all the combinations of current and future generations over time, then we can say that sustainability holds (eternally) within the society of any generation in that time frame. The definition of generation is flexible within the given time span within which the same generation exists. Precisely speaking, sustainability needs to hold with all the definitions of generation in the time frame. The definition of cost is also multifaceted. It is usually taken that costs mean environmental costs, because the global environmental issues in the coming three decades are so serious due to the imbalance between the enduring capacity of the Earth and outputs by society in any definition, especially in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, generally speaking, this is not necessarily the case. It is natural to extend the definition of sustainability to incorporate passing costs, including those from “non-feasance” (omission) of different regions/countries/people with any definition even in the same generation, and so on. In a practical setting, sustainability is too abstract and comprehensive to use as a criterion or index to regulate, e.g., people’s behavior. The definition of sustainability is a metaphor. Actually, considering the length of time allowable for humans, “without causing any (additional) costs” should now be replaced by “with compensating for the cost in the past (especially in terms of accumulated GHG emission).” However, we do not further discuss a possible alternative to “sustainability” because the point here is the last sentence in the first paragraph. Changing the point of view, we can say that SDGs are specific and explicit goals that aim to induce codes for the behavior of the generation until 2030, in order to construct a sustainable society, focusing on current and near-future urgent global issues that should definitely be fixed by then. Implicit/explicit concepts and philosophy are fairness, equity, safety, peace (no conflict), cooperation, etc., which are necessary for the survival of humans. As mentioned with the (possible) variation in the definition of sustainability, nothing is said about costs that were caused and passed by the previous generations to the current generation. In analogy with the expansion of the definition above, cases in which the past generation passed costs to the current generation of different countries are serious. To construct a sustainable society, international collaboration is essential, but this would be difficult to establish without a clear solution for cost-bearing among different generations and/or different countries/regions. However, for the current generation, which is responsible to the future generation in terms of sustainability in any sense, collaboration is a “must” in a different sense than, e.g., compensation, subsidization, etc. The achievement of SDGs is a prerequisite for the construction of a sustainable or pseudosustainable society, and in this sense, SDGs are more practically oriented. Accepting the concept and philosophy of sustainability and, therefore, varieties and ambiguity of the definition in the practical sense, we briefly explain articles in the special feature section, focusing on their positioning in achieving SDGs and their possible contribution to the expansion of frontiers of regional science.",2

It was established in Europe with the TGV of France in 1981. HSR technology for passenger transportation subsequently expanded worldwide. By the end of 2018, 42,978 km of high-speed railway networks were in operation worldwide. Moreover, by 2025, considering planning and route networks under construction, it is projected to be 98,504 km in 44 different countries (UIC 2018). The formation of inter-regional networks through the development of HSRs activates the movement of economic entities between regions. Inter-regional networks increase productivity in networked areas. Many empirical studies discuss the impact of inter-regional networks on productive activity (Burger and Meijers 2016; Camagni et al. 2016; Otsuka 2017, 2018, 2020a, b; Van Meeteren et al. 2016; Wetwitoo and Kato 2017). The increased accessibility gained by HSR opens up new possibilities for cities connected to lines, thereby implying opportunities for urban and region revitalization, increased accessibility to both short-and long-distance regions, and new possibilities for inter-regional networks. HSR has diverse impacts on the economy, environment, and technology. In China, there is abundant research on HSR. Since the early 2000s, China has ambitiously pursued its national strategy to develop railway infrastructure systems. The strategy is characterized by the development of HSR systems spanning over 16,000 km by 2020. Thus, China’s HSR evolved into the world’s most extensive system in the last decade, with a total track length of more than 11,028 km, 425 newly constructed HSR stations, more than 1000 HSR train sets covering over 28 rural areas and 28 cities, and servicing more than five million people (Chen and Haynes 2015a). Continuous investment in HSRs in China significantly impacts the overall Chinese economy (Chen and Haynes 2015b, c, d). HSR has a positive impact on tourism demand and housing value growth. The new railway network systems deployed serve as catalysts for accelerating urbanization and, thus, strengthen the productivity of the service and manufacturing sectors and promote economic growth. Furthermore, railway investment in China has had a positive impact on social welfare through the stimulus effect on household income. The completed railway infrastructure further promotes revenue growth by reducing transportation costs. However, studies in many countries, including China, do not provide a coherent view of whether the continuing investment in HSRs will increase CO2 emissions and negatively impact the environment (Westin and Kågeson 2012; Chen et al. 2016). HSR operations may increase greenhouse gas emissions while stimulating economic activity or replace passenger vehicles with higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies robustly examine which effect is dominant. The growth of deployed inter-regional transportation infrastructure, especially HSR, is expected to mitigate current transportation issues such as road traffic congestion and air pollution from the automobile and airline sectors. Thus, a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of high-quality inter-regional infrastructure investment is a fundamental and vital issue. This assessment is not only helpful in understanding the effectiveness and benefits of transportation infrastructure investment policies but also valuable to the international community in developing sound strategies for HSR development. Therefore, this study quantitatively analyzes the effects of inter-regional networks containing HSRs on energy intensity and clarifies the possibility of modal shifts in passenger movements. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy intensity is one of the critical policy challenges encountered by Japan in its quest for sustainability. The Government of Japan has implemented various measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, typified by the expansion of renewable energy. Despite the implementation of these measures, problems related to greenhouse gas reduction currently exceed the capability of individual technologies to manage them. By introducing energy and environmental policies through new institutional designs and changes, the government must promote nation-building to create a low-carbon society. In this regard, Japan’s National Land Plan aims to develop a national landscape that promotes interaction among economic entities through regional agglomeration and inter-regional networking (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism [MLIT] 2015). Regional agglomeration is the formation of compact cities that leads to the creation of a low-carbon society, and networking is the creation of a super-megaregion through the improvement of inter-regional networks, which, in turn, enhances the sustainability of regional economies. There are three perspectives on inter-regional networks’ favorable impact on energy consumption patterns (Otsuka 2020c). First, the formation of an inter-regional network increases productivity and enables investment in energy conservation, which improves energy intensity. Second, the formation of high-speed transportation networks promotes business-trip and reduces the time spent by employees in office buildings, which leads to energy intensity improvement as well. Third, as modal shifts in passenger travel progress, the overall energy intensity improves. In this study, we focus on the third perspective. The efficient design of high-speed transportation networks enables people to avoid using private vehicles, which saves transportation energy because the energy efficiency of passenger vehicles is poorer than that of public transportation such as railways (Table 1). From the perspective of solving global environmental problems, high-speed railways are preferred to passenger vehicles as a means of travel. This study quantifies the possibility of decreasing energy consumption in the passenger vehicle sector by improving inter-regional networks and provides a solution to realize sustainable development goals. Thus, the first novel aspect of this study is that it discusses the potential for improving energy intensity in the passenger vehicle sector. The second novel aspect is that this study clarifies the changes in energy consumption patterns as a result of the installation of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen, a high-speed magnetic levitation train. The Linear Chuo Shinkansen is a 438-km-long Shinkansen line connecting Shinagawa, Nagoya, and Shin-Osaka, with a commuting duration of approximately an hour, which is a considerably lower duration compared to other transportation options (Fig. 1). This new high-speed railway will enable Japan’s three major metropolitan areas to collaborate closely as an integrated economic zone and possibly create a globally unparalleled super-megaregion. Moreover, the significant reduction in time distance will stimulate business-to-business exchanges and strengthen the competitiveness of regional economies by initiating collaborative developments and innovations (MLIT 2017).

The Linear Chuo Shinkansen has the potential to improve both firm productivity and energy intensity. This is because firms facing environmental constraints can invest in energy conservation by increasing their profits. These types of investments will promote research and development on energy conservation and encourage the renewal of manufacturing facilities, thereby balancing the increase in productivity with improvements in energy efficiency. Furthermore, the Linear Chuo Shinkansen can achieve a modal shift from passenger vehicles to railways and thereby improve the energy intensity of regional economies. This study simulates the changes in the energy consumption pattern of the passenger vehicle sector due to the installation of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen and reveals the possibility of facilitating modal shifts in passenger travel. Based on the evidence provided, we define the role played by high-speed transportation infrastructure in improving regional energy intensity and achieving regional economic sustainability. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the empirical analysis methods, and Sect. 3 presents the results of the analyses and evaluates the extent of reduction in energy consumption of the passenger vehicle sector that may be realized by the installation of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the paper and discusses future research agenda.",5

Increasing population, rapid urbanization, expanding industries, changing land use decisions and escalating fossil fuel dependency are addressed as the main anthropologic reasons behind climate change (IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change), 2001). The scientific projections indicate that 1.5 °C warming in average temperatures is a threshold for global vulnerability. According to the IPCC report (2018), the average global warming has already reached 1 °C, and if the warming ratio does not slow down, it will reach the 1.5 °C threshold sometime between 2030 and 2050. As Hughes et al. (2003) and Parmesan and Yohe (2003) reveal, ecosystems, physical systems and related human actions will be seriously affected from the observed and projected impacts of global warming (Tompkins and Adger 2004). Despite technological improvements and economic growth, society still depends on natural resources such as clean air, water, food and others. There is a strong bond between societies, economies and the environment in terms of livelihood, health, security, food, material and culture. Therefore, sustainable governing of natural capital is a critical issue in the globalized world. The solutions to upcoming destructive stresses need flexible and adaptable actions that are addressed by resilient thinking rather than short-term economic gains and fixed strategies (Simonsen 2011). From this point of view, it can be suggested that cities, which accommodate more than 50% of the world’s population, are the focal point of climate change challenge as a part of both the problem and the solution (Kamal-Chaoui and Robert 2009; Evans 2011). Cities can prove to be important actors for worldwide sustainable economic development when it comes to adopting a climate-resilient and low-carbon development path (Corfee-Morlot et al. 2009). There is a multidirectional relationship between climate change and urban regions. The activities in urban areas such as industrial production, transportation, consumption constitute the majority of GHG emissions. On the other hand, urban regions are vulnerable to externalities because they have high population density and they are centers for socio-economic activities (Boyd and Juhola 2015). Nevertheless, urban areas are key in responding to climate change impacts on account of their infrastructure and financing potentials (Balaban 2017). Climate change is a serious threat to the social, natural and physical infrastructure in cities (Norman 2010). Direct and indirect impacts of climate change on urban areas have already been observed as sea level rise threatens coastal settlements and water resources; more frequent and severe extreme weather events damage both infrastructure and superstructure; more frequent and severe heat waves decrease comfort levels and cause health problems; the demand for cooling energy increases; and droughts, water scarcity and changes in biodiversity occur (Hunt and Watkiss 2011). It is projected that the impacts will continue escalating in the future, and cities will confront more intense threats (IPCC 2014). The rising sea levels threaten coastal cities including Tokyo (Japan), Hong Kong (China), New York (USA), Shanghai (China), Rotterdam (The Netherlands), and İstanbul (Turkey) where commercial and economic activities are concentrated. Any negative climate change impacts on these vulnerable cities affect not only the local economy but also the global economy (Gasper et al. 2011). As their population increase, urban settlements expand towards natural areas changing the land use in such areas. In dense and growing cities, green cover decreases and the amount of impenetrable concrete and asphalt surfaces increase. In case of heavy rains, the storm water cannot reach the soil and get absorbed leading to severe floods. Floods damage settlements and infrastructure, pollute water resources, disrupt water supply and treatment services. In particular, informal settlements of disadvantaged groups located in high-risk areas of cities, such as valleys and basins, are highly vulnerable to such disasters (McGranahan et al. 2007; Kadıoğlu 2018). Concrete and asphalt surfaces also intensify the heat creating “urban heat island effect” in dense urban regions. Increased temperatures and urban heat island effect cause decrease in air quality and comfort levels, and lead to unhealthy environments for the people. Consequently, residents in urban areas demand more energy for cooling causing an indirect increase in GHG emissions (Ünal 2018). Each region on earth is expected to face different impacts in varying severity and at a different time. Thus, each region will experience different scenarios depending on its geographic conditions, development level, vulnerabilities, adaptation capacities, etc. Therefore, the most effective climate change responsive and resilient development can be formulated by focusing on local dynamics, vulnerabilities and potentials (Tanner et al. 2009; Bahadur and Tanner 2014). As the final stage of a more comprehensive climate change resilience pathway study, this paper aims to identify the priority planning areas in İstanbul metropolitan region based on previous studies that focused on the climate change vulnerability and risk levels to reveal urban sectors that are under the highest threat, requiring urgent policies for climate change resilience. İstanbul is the largest metropolitan in Turkey with a country-wide hinterland; therefore, it is chosen as the case study area. Turkey is in the early phases of climate-based development, mitigation-adaptation concerns to climate change. In recent years, Turkey becoming part of the Kyoto Protocol, accepting the Paris Agreement and involving in international organizations on climate change have helped to improve institutional awareness. However, in this multi-dimensional and uncertain pathway, Turkey needs to adopt both national and local strategies for a more resilient structure, especially in metropolitan cities with high population. The motivation behind this study is to fill the gaps in launching the development of a more resilient system. From this point of view, the priority planning areas are defined as the most important management areas of regional government regarding the region’s climate associated vulnerabilities and risks. Regional system has been defined by 11 urban sectors (culture, biodiversity and ecology, infrastructure, materials, land use and development, transportation, energy, water resources, agriculture and health) and 25 planning areas, which are the components of the system that are highly likely to be impacted by climate change. In order to assess priority levels of planning areas, a vulnerability-risk matrix is developed by referring to the “Preparing for Climate Change; A Guidebook for Local, Regional and State Governments” (Snover et al. 2007), and planning areas are ranked based on their priority score. The study reveals a comprehensive perspective that considers all vital sectors in İstanbul, compares the vulnerabilities as well as risk levels and highlights the path for further resilience development policies.",3

In general, the occurrence of major earthquakes features periodicity. The Nankai Trough earthquake is recognized as a disaster that caused significant damage. It has occurred repeatedly at intervals of approximately 100–150 years. The largest class of earthquakes expected to occur along the Nankai Trough are called “Nankai Megathrust Earthquakes” (NMEs) (Japan Meteorological Agency 2020). Shizuoka Prefecture is predicted to suffer the highest number of deaths of all prefectures in Japan as a result of an NME (Cabinet Office Central Disaster Prevention Council 2012). The Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant (HNPP) is located in Shizuoka Prefecture’s coastal area and there are concerns about additional economic damage being caused by a resulting tsunami. The HNPP was shut down after the Great East Earthquake in 2011. From the perspectives of crisis management and safety, it is important to assess the impact of various regional-level risks. In this study, we develop a method for analyzing the impact of a possible tsunami and nuclear accident caused by an NME by constructing a dynamic inter-regional input–output (IRIO) model featuring a production technology bottleneck due to a shortage of input goods. Our analysis is focused on the supply-side impact, i.e., inter-regional and inter-sectoral interactions after a disaster. We evaluate the direct damage to the disaster area as well as the indirect impact over time and space to the surrounding area. Toyoda and Kawachi (1997) conducted pioneering work on the economic damage to production activities caused by the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in Japan. Kunreuther and Rose (2004) compiled important literature regarding the economic analysis of natural disasters. Both the immediate direct economic damage and the indirect economic damage resulting from a large-scale disaster that occurred during the recovery period is estimated. Since a disaster occurs locally in a specific region, spatial spillover is also estimated. To minimize the damage caused by disasters, companies formulate business continuity plans (BCPs) and local governments formulate disaster prevention plans. However, in these plans, the effects of indirect damage assessed via backward and forward linkages during the recovery process are often not sufficiently examined. Input–output (IO) modeling offers a powerful tool for analyzing the economic impact and assessing the resilience of natural disasters on a global, national, and regional level (Miller and Blair 2009; Shishido 2010). Galbusera and Giannopoulos (2018) reviewed various disaster modeling aspects based on an IO model considering both demand- and supply-side direct and indirect damages and resilience using static and dynamic presentations. The Input–Output Inoperability model (IIM), which is an extension of the IO model, is one useful method for evaluating risk. Haimes and Jiang (2001) provided the theoretical basis for this approach, which has been used and extended by researchers to assess the impact of post-disaster supply and demand changes on economic losses through forward and backward linkages (Leung, Haimes, and Santos 2007). A Dynamics Input–Output Inoperability Model (DIIM) has also been developed to handle the dynamics of risk of inoperability. Several applications of the DIIM approach are examined, including cases of terrorism, natural disasters, and epidemics (Lian and Haimes 2006; Akhtar and Santos 2013; Orsi and Santos 2010). The production sector’s post-disaster recovery process, including the role of inventory, has been analyzed (Barker and Santos 2010; Hallegatte 2014). Since natural disasters occur geographically and locally, it is important to evaluate their spatial impact. The IRIO model has established a convenient way to evaluate the spatial spillover of events such as disasters. Notable case studies include the multi-regional commodity flow model by Okuyama and Hewings (1999) and the recursive dynamic multi-regional supply use model based on linear programming by Koks and Thissen (2016). Oosterhaven (2016) proposed a method that minimizes the information gain between the pre- and post-event patterns of economic transactions using IO tables to evaluate the impact of disruptive events. One feature of this study is proposing a dynamic IRIO model for the municipalities in Shizuoka Prefecture. The direct damage caused by a tsunami and a nuclear accident in the coastal area of Shizuoka Prefecture is provided exogenously by the reduced value-added inputs (i.e., capital and labor) based on disaster scenarios. This idea emerged from the hypothetical extraction method (Dietzenbacher et al. 1993). The dynamics are given as an exogenous recovery process of value-added inputs. During the recovery stage, many sectors are affected and production activities cease. The supply chain is disrupted and related production decreases due to shortage of input goods, even if the delivery system is business as usual. This phenomenon is described by the production technology bottleneck and is modeled by the Leontief-type production function.Footnote 1 The delivery system is specified by the output coefficients. The produced regional goods are delivered to sectors and regions by the output coefficients. This situation continues until production levels recover. To improve the delay in recovery, a mechanism wherein input goods are supplied from outside is incorporated. In this study, we use a non-competitive, import-type, IRIO table that separates imports and exports to consider supply flow conditions for relief supplies from outside of the disaster area. This study estimates the economic damage to municipalities in Shizuoka Prefecture caused by a tsunami and an accident at the HNPP caused by the NME. The damage immediately after the disaster is estimated based on the production sectors located in areas affected by the tsunami and the nuclear accident. The damage until recovery is evaluated based on several scenarios, considering spillover over both space and time. In Japan, many studies have been conducted on the economic assessment of natural disasters using the IO approach after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake (Toyoda and Kawachi 1997; Ashyia 2005; Tatano and Tsuchiya 2008; Shimoda and Fujikawa 2012; Tokui et al. 2012; Okiyamau et al. 2012; Manaki 2013; Kabuta 2014; Tokunaga and Okiyama 2014; Nozaki 2016; Shibusawa and Miyata 2017; Tokunaga and Resosudarmo 2017; Shibusawa and Hanaoka 2018; Shibusawa and Matsuhima 2020; Shibusawa and Hanaoka 2020). These studies include impact evaluations such as the industrial structural changes before and after the earthquake, the direct damage caused by a disaster, and the indirect ripple effect of the recovery stage, and the reconstruction investment effect using IO, optimization, and computable general equilibrium models. Evaluations have also been made on the risks of future earthquakes and tsunamis. However, in assessments of the economic damage during the recovery process using an IO approach, studies have been conducted in Japan and at the prefectural level (e.g.Tatano and Tsuchiya 2008; Shibusawa and Miyata 2017), but not many studies exist that takes into account the spatial dependence of production activities at the municipal level (Shibusawa and Matsushima 2020). In this study, using a dynamic IRIO model, we evaluate the economic damage and recovery process under a risk of a tsunami and HNPP accident caused by the NME. Our analysis is focused on the supply-side impacts of the production sector in municipalities in Shizuoka Prefecture. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted under several scenarios and cases. The effect of Japan’s depopulation on the recovery process after a disaster is also analyzed.",2
6.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,15 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-021-00216-5,GIS and remote sensing-based spatiotemporal analysis of cumulative flood risk over Bangladesh’s national highways,February 2022,Kashfia Nowrin Choudhury,Helmut Yabar,Takeshi Mizunoya,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The road network plays a crucial role in the economy of Bangladesh. The movement of passengers and freight is largely dependent upon this mode of transportation. Though there are other modes such as rail or waterways, the road remains the popular mode among all (Quium and Hoque 2002). The national highways (NHs), as well as regional highways of Bangladesh, are supposed to withstand floods with a 50 year return period with a design consideration of 1.0 m of free broad above the HFL (Highest Flood Level) for dual carriageways (RHD 2005). However, in recent years, it has been proven to be insufficient to resist the increased magnitude of floods. The floods of 1998 alone accounted for 15% of total road damage which is about 0.7% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (World Bank 2011). The UK (Road Note 31) and USA (AASHTO)-based pavement standards guidelines for NHs and other roads seem inadequate to withstand the increased flood magnitude of the world’s sixth most flood vulnerable country Bangladesh (Alam and Zakaria 2008; World Bank 2011). Two-thirds of the nation lies below 5 m of the sea level with high vulnerability from rivers and monsoon flooding and all these factors make this country one of the most vulnerable countries from climate change perspective as well (World Bank 2010). Due to the geographic, socio-economic, and demographic aspects, floods are almost inevitable. It disrupts the road network along with other important infrastructures almost annually. Each year, this country experiences at least one flood and sometimes, it inundates the country multiple times. From 1952 to 1996, the country experienced 28 major floods with 11 devastating events (Paul 1997). The number may be higher if other floods are also included with the major floods. In recent years, this trend has become more severe as the country encountered at least one flood annually after the year 2000 (DFO 2020). According to one projection of the World Bank, the flooded area of the country may increase up to 4% by 2050 and the projected flood adaptation cost for roads is around USD 3.3 billion by that time (World Bank 2011). It seems that the road network may not be able to avoid floods and it will be severe in the future. To overcome the challenges, it is essential to understand the historical impact of floods over roads especially the NHs for long-term decision-making. In this regard, this study aims to identify the flood risk over NHs by specifying the affected location with measurement to illustrate the cumulative flood risk over NHs. The floods always remain a threat to the road network along with other infrastructures. At present, the situation is worse due to climate change and other factors (e.g. rapid urbanization, deforestation). In 2019, flood-affected around 195 km (km) of NHs, over 150 km of regional highways, and more than 650 km of district roads (zilla road) of Roads and Highways Department (RHD) with an economic need of around BDT 4805.7 million (approx. USD 56.53 million)Footnote 1 for the repair of over 1000 km of flood-affected roads (Adhikary 2019b). According to the same report, during 2017, the same organization (i.e. RHD) encountered over 5000 km of flood damage and asked for BDT 11,660 million (approx. USD 136.65 million) from the concerned ministry. During the 2007 flood, this organization experienced damage to over 55% of the road network (approx. 2344 km) (MoFDM 2007). Overall, flood has an economic impact equivalent to 1.5% of the overall GDP (Benson and Clay 2002). The insufficient conventional data and spatiotemporal variable nature of flood make the overall hazard management quite complicated and in many cases absence of a historical database (i.e. long-term) with non-reliable measurement techniques makes the situation worse (Islam and Sado 2000). In the past, road and other infrastructures construction often ignored climate factors (Adhikary 2019b). All these aspects make the road extremely vulnerable to floods in a country where 80% is considered as floodplain (Sultana and Thompson 2017). However, in the resources, constrain context of developing countries where there is a lack of continuity of policies and governance, in many cases, the non-structural measures of flood management are proved to be quite effective with better record-keeping of relevant flood event data (e.g. damage, occurrence) than structural measures adaptation (Egbinola et al. 2015). Hence, the identification of the actual gap of the existing practice is a prerequisite to the adaptation of appropriate mitigation measures to reduce the flood risk over NHs. Therefore, to formulate an effective sustainable policy or mitigation methodology, it is essential to understand the existing need and policy or practices of the country regarding flood affected road network. Instead of the high flood vulnerability of NHs, there is no reliable historical database regarding specific damage of roads from the flood which is an essential element for long-term policy formulation for the existing road network. The understanding of the flood pattern and occurrence is essential to formulate an effective long-term flood impact reduction strategy for any important infrastructures (e.g. NHs) (Kabir and Hossen 2019). Often, the flood-affected road data are collected manually without detailed specification regarding the location or length of a certain type of road (e.g. NHs). The reliability of such manually collected data is often questionable due to a lack of adequate verification and specific reliable measurement techniques. The situation is worse for specific historical data of flood-affected roads. There are some newspaper reports but often published without a reliable data source, therefore the acceptance of such data is not beyond doubt. Sometimes, during emergency, budget allocation for flood-affected roads, the manually collected data (i.e. affected length) may not always ensure proper distribution of the limited resources due to lack of adequate verification with limited time. In the case, of long-term decision-making the decision-makers may not be able to analyze various aspects like cumulative risk from flood, similarly affected location (if any) due to the absence of a historical database regarding different types of flood-affected roads with the location. This study identifies it as a gap of the present practice and aims to contribute to this sector. Using GIS and RS may identify the flooded roads without wasting time and resources to visit the region in detail. It will also allow establishing a detailed length and location-wise flood-affected database of important roads (e.g. NHs) for further decision-making. This type of database will be especially useful for roads like NHs when the government has a plan to expand them shortly and also emphasize existing road maintenance rather than new road construction (Planning Commission 2012). The government of Bangladesh kept the provision in national policy to expand and consolidate (if necessary) the NHs in long term (i.e. within 2041), by constructing access-controlled expressways as well as providing service lanes to ensure better connectivity with the local roads (Planning Commission 2020). Therefore, to build a sustainable road network, it will be useful to analyze the historical impact of flood over certain NHs (i.e. cumulative risk, the pattern of effect) before investing for long term (i.e. 2041). Other solutions like flood hazard maps may provide relevant information regarding flood prediction or risk assessment for infrastructures. Though, in developing countries’ perspective, the acceptance of such useful maps are often threaten by various factors such as data constrain (i.e. hydrological, hydraulic, elevation, land-use) to prepare the map, lack of literacy among general users (i.e. complexity in understanding), etc. (Osti et al. 2008). In many cases, such advance digital maps are not available for specific historical events in detail for the entire country (Islam and Sado 2000). Instead of wide acceptance and utility of flood hazards maps in developed countries, the above-mentioned factors may limit the efficiencies of such maps considering the actual context of the country (e.g. Bangladesh). In many developing countries, the flood mitigation policies or measurers are often inadequate or sometimes do not exist and many times existing policies are ineffective or conflicting in their standpoints (Osti et al. 2008). Hence, it is essential to identify the actual gap of existing practice for flood management for roads (e.g. NHs) and other infrastructures properly before adapting a mitigation measure otherwise it may not be sustainable in the long run. With the comparison of other natural disasters, the floods damage a larger area for an elongated duration than others. However, flood management and identification activities are more complicated due to the lack of resources in developing countries of monsoon Asia (e.g. Bangladesh) (Joy and Lu 2004). Sometimes, the flood magnitude is too extreme to quantify with the limited number of instruments installed over the ground. This situation gets worse if we take into consideration the historical data of developing countries (e.g. Bangladesh). It is often more complicated while looking at specific historical information (i.e. location, length) of flood-affected roads. In this regard, remote sensing (RS) provides an appropriate solution for all the above-mentioned issues by providing information on before, after as well as during flooding situations which are also useful to identify the flooded roads. In many cases, the analysis with RS is more economical and effective than a ground survey for flood monitoring (Bera et al. 2012). Considering the difficulties regarding the accessibility and reliability of available historical flood data, this study relies on RS. Flood detection is one of the best applications of RS (Huang et al. 2012). There is enough empirical evidence of the effectiveness of using RS data for flood detection. Many studies obtained spatial and temporal maps for flood inundation using this approach (Huang et al. 2014). In this regard, this study relies on RS to analyze the historical flooding of Bangladesh where actual observation data is difficult to access for past events. Then, GIS is a recognized software worldwide for flood management and many other purposes (e.g. road network management). This software analyzes spatial information systematically. This is a computer version of geographic reality to fulfill specific information needs such as create, shear, and apply essential information based on data and maps (Pucha-Cofrep et al. 2018). This software is reliable to verify numerous flood aspects like post-disaster verification of flood extent, topographic map, flood plain management, etc. (Simões and de Barros Trannin 2012). In this context, the combination of GIS and RS is an ideal solution for this study to accomplish the desired requirements. The study area for this research is the NHs and selection criteria are based on economic importance. To select the extreme events, this study analysis flood events of the past 20 years. Then, it selects seven extreme events based on the number of deaths over 100. To identify the flooded region, the satellite images from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor are analyzed with GIS. To find out the flooded NHs, this study intersects the flooded area with the NHs using GIS software. Finally, the affected roads are analyzed further to understand the pattern of the impact. In developing countries like Bangladesh in the case of flood impact assessment, the idea of annual impact assessment is more popular than that of the specific impact of floods. This often overlooks the specific impact of floods (e.g. pattern of impact). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study before analyzed the specific impact of floods over the NHs of Bangladesh like this study. This study conducts a detailed analysis of each of the floods of the past 20 years to identify the specific flood events. Consideration of the specific impact of a single flood rather than focusing on the annual impact of the flood is also a strong aspect of this study. This study will contribute to a better understanding of historical flood risk over the NHs. It is possible to adopt this approach for the preparation of a detailed reliable historical database regarding flood-damaged roads. This distinct approach of this study can play a meaningful role to mitigate the existing gap of lack of a reliable historical database of flooded NHs. This will also contribute towards better financial management and flood mitigation measures adaptation regarding NHs. Due to the lack of preservation of specific historical data related to flood damage over certain types of roads (e.g. national, regional), it is difficult to calculate the cumulative impacts of multiple floods. The major floods visit after a while, so it is not unusual to forget which roads were affected, what is the pattern of effect, or any specific location receiving similar impacts multiple times when there is a lack of information. This visualization will allow the solution to the above problems and leads towards the minimization of flood risk over the NHs of Bangladesh. The paper arrangement is as follows: Sect. 2 provides the scope of this study and proposed methodology with a detailed explanation of specific events selection and preparation of flood-affected road network maps, Sect. 3 illustrates the maps and discuss the flood impact pattern and effect over the study area in details, finally, Sect. 4 concludes with a relevant recommendation based on national road policies of the country.",2

We divided the period from 2005 to 2030 into two groups according to the degree (i.e., mild and rapid) of depopulation. These population dynamics are a matter of concern, because they not only restrain and impede the regrowth of Japanese regional economies but also lead to increased disparities among regions. The domestic output of the food/beverage industry in Japan gradually declined from the beginning of the 2000s to 2015 because of the increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) for this industry in East Asia and a decreasing labor force population during this period. Furthermore, the food/beverage industry’s domestic output exhibited a downward trend from 2015 to 2030 because of rapid depopulation in Japan. We evaluated the impacts of the decline in labor force, domestic market, and total-factor productivity (TFP) on the primary and food/beverage industries and regional economies during each period. As a countermeasure to the rapid decline in population and TFP in Japan’s depopulating society between 2015 and 2030, we propose demand-side consumption tax reduction and supply-side innovative agro-based food industry cluster policies. The economic effects are analyzed using the four-region computable general equilibrium (4SCGE) model.Footnote 2 This paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 presents the trends of the depopulating society in Japan for 2000–2040 and regional production activities for Japanese food/beverage manufacturing during 2000–2015. Section 3 explains the framework of the 4SCGE model. Section 4 explains simulation contents and results using the 4SCGE model.

6.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,16 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-021-00198-4,"Is meeting the needs of tourists through ethnic tourism sustainable? Focus on Bali, Indonesia",February 2022,Yoko Mayuzumi,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Bali province in Indonesia is a small island with an area of 5,632.86 km. Not only “South Island” and “Beach”, but also it attracts tourists all over the world with the impression of “rich nature”, “the island where many kinds of gods live”, and “the island of culture and art”. Indonesia is the largest Muslim country globally, with Muslims accounting for 88.1% of the total population. On the other hand, in Bali, more than 90% of the island's total population is Hindu, and they are called Balinese Hindus. Furthermore, Balinese Hinduism is a particular case of inheriting the original Hindu culture, although it is called soft Hinduism because of its milder discipline, unlike Indian Hinduism. Tourism in Bali began in the 1920s during the Dutch colonial era. After Indonesia got independent as a nation, President Suharto's in 1972 made tourism development a top priority for economic growth in Bali. The story of the tourism industry in Bali had led to relieving extreme poverty for the most impoverished region in Indonesia. As the number of foreign tourists increased, the tourists, mainly Westerners, had deep interests in Balinese natural unique resources and traditional culture, rather than the Indonesian government’s closed rich resort. Western tourists had moved to more attractive targets, private beach and luxury hotel enclosed had become the destination for tourists having some limited purpose. Many foreign tourists like western had admired cultural and ethnic tourism. Tourism in Bali is currently being expanded on two different axes, selling ethnic culture and beach life. Ethnic tourism involves the first experience and the meet of another culture to provide tourists with a more “intimate” and “authentic” experience (Greenwood 1982; Klieger 1990). According to Weiler and Hall (1992), ethnic tourism defines as “travel motivated by the tourist's desire for direct, genuine and intimate contact with people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds from the tourist”. And the purchase of souvenirs is an opportunity to experience different cultures, and through this act, tourists can form a space for cross-cultural and social negotiation. As a hot topic of international tourism before the occurrence of COVID-19, while the number of tourists worldwide has increased in recent years, including in Bali, over-tourism (an old concept is also called tourism pollution) is focused as a problem. There are reports on many issues that have a significant impact on the sustainability of tourism activities. These are the problem of overuse of toilets and aging of accommodation facilities and graffiti on cultural properties, destruction to natural ecosystems due to step on by a large number of tourists. Tourism pollution means the concentration of tourists and the occurrence of problematic events there. The United States and the western countries that the tourism pollution has occurred earlier get the following advice from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), “There is ‘Carrying Capacity’ in the tourist area. Therefore, it is necessary without giving damage to the natural environment, economy and social culture, at the same time, the maximum number of tourists that can visit at one time should be adjusted so as not to reduce the satisfaction of tourists”. The UNWTO has also proposed guidelines for solving tourism pollution and published the Guidebook for Sustainable Tourism Indicators (STI:2004). The STI set the following three points. (1) (Environment) Optimizing the use of tourism resources, (2) (Society) Respecting the socio-cultural authenticity of the receiving society, (3) (Economy) Evaluation indicators aiming for guarantee long-term economic activities. And more, the management is added to the 4th. Based on these viewpoints, it is desirable to add the perspective of “sustainable tourism” and set a policy that considers the actual conditions of each region. Regarding the concept of over-tourism in STI, although STI focus on first for the environment and second for society and culture, they do not fully address the second. One point included in the second is “about the happiness to the receiving society”. This point is a problem concerning tourism’s impact on the community (local benefits related to tourism). For example, many articles have reported issues with manners by tourists, traffic congestion, and excessive access to residents’ houses (intrusion into living customs). The recent report of “Survey on the ideal way of sustainable tourism policy” by the Japan National Institute of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (2019) shows a leading example of efforts to examine “about the happiness to the receiving society”. There are three examples of tourism indicators that have been worked on (Kenta 2019). These include the DIT-ACHIEV (Dublin Institute of Technology ACHIEV Model), a guideline for Ireland's sustainable model formulated in 2008, and the KI-TOMM (Kangaroo Island, Kangaroo Island, Kangaroo Island, Australia, composed in 1996. Tourism Optimization Management Model), and the Sustainable Tourism Zone of the Caribbean established in 2005. These are indicators set in consideration of sustainability from the perspective of both residents and tourists. These cases are one of the few advanced efforts. In 2012, “Jatiluwih” in Bali has been registered as a World Heritage Site in the rice terraces' rural landscape. Visiting a large number of tourists has caused severe problems to the local community. For example, many residents are converting their farmland into accommodation according to the growing demand for lodging by tourists. Or tourists are encroaching on local farmland and destroying the footpaths between rice fields without permission. Thinking about these problems seriously, the local administration has launched a policy that recommends agriculture and tourism to develop together. Specific initiatives include promoting home-stay guesthouses run by local residents as opposed to hotels built by outside capital, charging fees for tourists to enter the village and using the income for the village, and charging fees for waste disposal of leftover food by tourists from the cafeteria. In the future, in such places, detailed guidelines on sustainable tourism that care about the happiness of the community, rather than not only focusing on economic benefits for tourism revenue, need to be formulated in regional policies. Besides, to coexist with COVID-19, tourist destinations should consider sanitary management and disease prevention measures. At the same time, it is necessary to increase the attractiveness of tourism in areas that are currently unpopular or where outdoor tourism is possible. This view will also become a universal recognition of sustainable tourism in the future.",11

At the same time, it has to ensure that the growing population has access to adequate and sustainable food and shelter (Chougrani and El Amrani 2021). On the other hand, based on our possibilistic approach, we, the human beings, have always meant to modify the natural environment at the individual and communal levels to meet our growing societal and biological demands (Lawrence et al. 2013; Dutta et al. 2016). Therefore, collectively environmental exploitation is increasing day by day through the transformation and intensification of human activities (Belton et al. 2020; Schmidt et al. 2020). India is a monumental example from the developing world, where the economy is changing with the rapid transformation of each sector to meet the needs of its huge population. In coastal regions, land conversion into aquaculture is one of such dominant phenomena. Having a favorable subtropical climate for brackishwater aquaculture and a suitable coastal area of 11.91 lakh hectares spread over ten states (Johny and Madhusoodana 2007; NABARD 2018), the shrimp production and associate land-use conversion in India started expanding since the 1980s (Prasad et al. 2019). As per the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) production statistics, shrimp production in India increased from 119,407 tons in 2010 to 739,161 tons in 2017 (FAO Fish-Stat 2020), which shows clear evidence of the mentioned reckless expansion. Several studies predicted that this expansion would continue in the future (Duarte et al. 2007; Merino et al. 2012), in spite of worries regarding the long-run viability of the industry (Naylor et al. 2000). Among different production hubs of saltwater shrimp in India, West Bengal is considered the second-highest producer of shrimp after Andhra Pradesh (NABARD 2018). It has the most significant potential impounded brackish water area covering around 405,000 hectares (Ministry of Agriculture, GOI) of the coastal region spread over three districts, i.e., East Medinipur, North Twenty-Four Parganas, and South Twenty-Four Parganas (NABARD 2018; The Fish Site 2021). Nowadays, the expansion is not only restricted to the coastal tide-affected areas (Le et al. 2018). Instead, in West Bengal, it is expanding more and more towards the interior freshwater agricultural blocks. Where the productive agrarian lands are getting converted (Maiti 2019; Rajakumari et al. 2020), and the process of massive depeasantization comes into the picture (Paprocki and Cons 2014). The depeasantizationFootnote 1 or occupational transformation has two-way recursive primitive accumulation; firstly, it is the negative repercussions and at the same time a precondition for expansion of capitalist shrimp production (Adnan 2013). In the present study area (Bhagwanpur II block, East Medinipur), such landscape conversion-led depeasantization is very common. Inhabitants of this region convert the natural ecosystem artificially to adopt capitalistic shrimp farming. They dig their agricultural land, fill it with fresh cannel water sometimes by pumping groundwater, then mix salt and chemical fertilizers in freshwater to make it suitable for shrimp production (Field Survey). Apart from these intentional conversions, other factors also work as a mediating factor of depeasantization. Such as the growing aquaculture systems continuously making the surrounding agrarian landscape unproductive through saline water intrusion (Chowdhury et al. 2010; Rajarshi and Santra 2011; Jayanthi et al. 2020) and creating the precondition for further expansion by making small-scale farming difficult and expensive (Jayanthi et al. 2020). To consider these vulnerabilities of such haphazard growth of shrimp aquafarm, it is essential to quantify the process of expansion. Since the majority of these brackish water fishing ponds are illegal/unauthorized, it is hard to obtain information about the altered land uses from land revenue and fisheries offices (Dutta et al. 2016). Under this circumstance, remote sensing coupled with GIS can be a very useful tool. The obtained spatial databases from remote sensing are not only well fitted for visualizing the change but also provide various statistical information for calculating the trend of transformation (Williams et al. 2015; Das et al. 2016). There are several social researchers also who mainly pointed out its positive impacts when it has been practiced in the coastal environment. Such as elevation of household income (Hamid and Mohammad 1998; Jahan et al. 2010), greater food security, expanded work possibilities (Gammage et al. 2006), and the increasing number of wage earners (Sharmin and Ali 2005; USAID 2006; Belton and Thilsted 2014). Some of them are primarily concerned with the greater earning potential for women in the household (Gammage et al. 2006; Islam 2009). Other studies have revealed a wide range of adverse environmental, economic, and societal consequences (Ahmed et al. 2010; Belton and Thilsted 2014; Jahan et al. 2014; Toufique and Belton 2014). However, only a few sociological studies have been conducted in the inland freshwater environment, where catastrophic agrarian transformations for capitalist accumulation are happening by destroying productive agricultural land. Therefore, it is indispensable to understand the capability of this kind of rapid transformation in bringing sustainable positive difference in the livelihood system for a large number of reliant people. The SLA is a widely used framework in this regard (DFID 1999; El Bilali et al. 2017; Barnes et al. 2017; Mistri 2019). Studies have used this framework to analyze different influences, viz., constraints, and opportunities on livelihoods and ensure the essential influencers are not neglected (Ashley and Carney 1999). Ahmed et al. (2010), in his study of “Prawn postlarvae fishing in coastal Bangladesh: associated challenges for sustainable livelihoods”, used the SLA to understand the role of shifting occupation to prawn fishing in poverty reduction of an agriculturally underdeveloped region. Wang et al. (2021) considered the SLA to reveal the impact of livelihood capital endowment (LCE) on households’ income growth and poverty alleviation under different rural land consolidation (RLC) situations. SLA is also helpful in analyzing the influential parameters behind the diversified livelihood choices of rural households (Huang et al. 2021). Thus, to provide a holistic view, the present study is designed in three phases. In the first phase, the study attempted to quantify such land conversion in an inland agricultural region of the East Medinipur district of coastal West Bengal through GIS and remote sensing data. After that, it tries to detect the changing economics, livelihood opportunities, and sustainability compared to the agricultural society using the SLA framework. Finally, it highlights the coping strategies the people have adopted to manage the livelihood constraints and significant risks they face in the long term. The findings of this study are the micro-level empirical elaboration of the rapid occupational shift of the agricultural society/depeasantization and how it led to long-term threefold vulnerabilities, i.e., environmental, socioeconomic, and livelihood for an inland agriculturally prosperous region of a coastal district of West Bengal, India. It will be helpful for economists, geographers, and policymakers to make some suitable sustainable plans in combating the vulnerability issues for similar situations.",1

It contributes about 27% toward GDP and is the primary source of income for most rural households (MoAD 2019). According to the World Bank (2019) report, more than 70% of the population lives in rural regions and extensively depends on the farming sector for their livelihoods. Moreover, agriculture also plays a crucial role in increasing the purchasing power of rural households. It has been promoting non-agricultural and agricultural employment opportunities and retaining price stability (Gupta et al. 2016). The agricultural share of the GDP plunged from two-thirds in 1980 to below one-third in 2017, but the population's dependence on economic activities in this field has changed since the early 1980s, dropped 93 to 60% in 2017.Footnote 1 In the past 30 years, the progress of the agriculture sector has tumbled, and the result is that food production is not adequate to feed the increasing population. Like the import of other raw materials, agricultural imports have also increased over time. That tendency attracted the planners, policymakers, and other working organizations in Nepal's agriculture sector (Thapa et al. 2019). The experience of advanced agricultural nations showed that the adoption and usage of advanced technologies in agricultural practices are crucial for the country's agricultural growth and rural economic development (Aryal et al. 2018). Specifically, cumulative efforts are required to increase the strength of advanced agriculture inputs, innovate through agricultural research, and support infrastructures like irrigation systems, roads, new markets, storage, processing, and agricultural credit (Brizmohun 2019; Lokonon and Mbaye 2018). These infrastructures help augment agricultural productivity (Takagi et al. 2020). The appropriate agricultural development situation is to change farmers' behavior to use capital-intensive and improved agricultural techniques. Smallholder farmers mainly dominate Nepal's agricultural sector. They face several challenges, including limited access to advanced agricultural technologies, low use of improved production inputs, poor extension services, less credit facilities, and climate change (Thapa et al. 2019). If we look at the long-term climate risk index (CRI), Nepal is at the 9th number with CRI score of 31.5 as reported in Table 1. Nepal has experienced 180 events from 1999 to 2008, leading to total losses of 0.4% of the GDP. Besides, the agriculture sector is characterized by high risks and ambiguities in production prices. In this situation, farmers can adopt the latest agricultural technology with greater certainty to deal with current risks and suspicions; agriculture credit and insurances are necessary to develop farmers' confidence in adopting advanced technology (Thapa et al. 2019). Nepal's agriculture remains the largest economic sector. It contributes 32% of value-added and 64% of employment in the agriculture sector (MoAD 2015). Therefore, productivity growth in this sector is the key to increasing the total productivity of agriculture. Agriculture sector also plays an essential role in reducing poverty in Nepal. Between FY 2004 and FY 2011, most poverty reduction efforts arose in rural regions, and increased agricultural income significantly contributed to poverty alleviation (Amin et al. 2020). Total revenue growth decomposition indicates that farm income and wage growth (24.4%), remittances (23%), respectively, of farm wages (23%), and commercial revenues (18%) (Thapa et al. 2019). However, agriculture growth has been significantly lower in the recent period. In 2018, the annual growth rate of agricultural GDP was only 2.81%, which was lower compared with neighboring countries (see Fig. 1). Source: World Bank (2018) Annual growth rate of agricultural GDP of Asian countries. Data  Similarly, cereal yield covers most of Nepal's cultivated land area (2795.7 kg/ha in 2017). However, the average yield in Nepal is still low compared to neighboring regions (see Fig. 2). Source: World Bank (2018) Cereal yield in Asian countries. Data  To meet the sufficient food demand of the increasing inhabitants, Nepal is gradually becoming a net food importer in recent years, including staple foods like rice, potatoes, corn, and highly valued foods such as fruits and vegetables. From 2009 to 2013, cereal imports increased significantly, with rice at 39%, corn at 26%, and at 126% wheat. In addition to this, importing fruit products and vegetables has doubled recently (Sharma 2019). Several recent studies in the context of Nepal have been documented in the existing literature, for instance, socio-economic factors affecting the adoption of better quality rice varieties (Ghimire et al. 2015), adoption of improved quality rice varieties, and its impact on welfare (Ghimire and Huang 2016), adoptions of enhanced agricultural technologies and production practices (Kumar et al. 2020a), and climate change-rice production nexus (Rayamajhee et al. 2020). However, these studies used a survey-based dataset. Our study is different, and it is the first attempt in the same case of Nepal. The main research question is: whether or not formal credit and technological development contribute toward improving rice production in Nepal? In particular, the present paper makes four contributions to the existing literature. We first verify the long-term co-integration interactions between the variables using the ARDL bounds testing methodology. Second, we evaluate the short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) effects of formal credit and technological development factors (i.e., improved quality seeds and chemical fertilizers used) on rice production. Third, we discover the causality connections among the variables by employing the VECM method. Finally, we confirm the robustness of long-term outcomes based on the IRF and VDM methodologies. Figure 3 demonstrates the determinants of rice production. The determinants of rice production",

However, since 1950, researchers have been consistently trying to figure out which factors have the most impact on the growth rate of a country (Solow 1956; Romer 1990; Lucas 1988). Foreign direct investment (FDI) is seen to be a key factor to enhance economic growth, since it improves the physical and human capital of the host nation and possibly enhances real GDP (Elkomy et al. 2016; Qazi et al. 2017). Many nations across the world have developed an FDI-friendly climate and opened up their economies in trying to entice more FDI in the hopes of boosting their economies. Furthermore, FDI inflows help to bridge the gap among reserves and required investment levels (Sabir et al. 2019). Endogenous growth models accentuate that inward FDI is a crucial factor for economic growth, because this is a cause of technology allocation from advanced economies, reduced poverty, increased productivity and enhanced the knowledge and expertise of workers in the recipient country as a result of internationalization (Chenaf-Nicet and Rougier 2016). The endogenous growth theory gives theoretical justification for policies that indicate FDI spillover and a beneficial influence on growth and development for local companies (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1997). Due to the surge in foreign investment, a significant amount of effort and time have been devoted to determining the impacts of FDI in host nations. On the empirical side, quite a few researches have shown that the FDI–growth connection is influenced by other important elements in the recipient country's ""absorptive capacity,"" such as with development of financial markets (Azman-Saini and Law 2010; Alfaro et al. 2010), and economic growth (Almfraji and Almsafir 2014), human capital (Blomström and Kokko 2003), trade liberalization (Kumari and Sharma 2017), liberal marketplaces (Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003), and the difference in innovation among recipient and source countries (Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Havranek and Irsova 2011). This research agrees with the concept of absorptive capacity in describing FDI–growth association; nevertheless, this work focused on a different interesting and understudied linkage: the function of institutions’ quality in describing FDI–growth connection. Aside from FDI, domestic institutional quality has an essential influence in the country's economic expansion (Jude and Levieuge 2017; Yeboua 2021). Domestically weak institutions’ quality results in negative economic outcomes such as poor investment, poor performance, and lower per capita GDP, and all of these issues hinder the sustained economic growth progress. Good institutions’ quality, conversely, promotes high investment, effective factor allocation, eliminates unpredictability, and assists in the collaboration of economic agents, resulting in economic progress (Jude and Levieuge 2017). The differences in FDI–growth associations are substantially connected to the diverse structure of domestic institutions among nations. As a result, a same quantity of FDI may be predicted to produce various levels of economic growth in different nations; nevertheless, few researches have concentrated on identifying the influence of institutions’ quality on the FDI–growth association (Delgado et al. 2014; Jude and Levieuge 2017). Developing countries specifically more rely on foreign investment due to shortage of capital and large population which increase the consumer size and thus aggregate demand in the country. However, the inflow of FDI in developing countries is significantly increasing in the last three decades due to large market potential in these countries (Qazi et al. 2017). According to the World Investment Report (2019) by the World Bank, the global FDI inflow share to developing countries has risen by 54%. Africa’s FDI inflow rise up to 11%, although it’s more share is resource seeking but it is significantly surging the economic growth of this region. Similarly Asia’s FDI inflow increases up to 4%. Most of the developing countries are eliminating and reducing the restriction on the entry of FDI to different industries, which is significantly contributing to the economic enhancement of these countries directly and indirectly (via conditional factors of the host country). China, Hong Kong and Singapore are the top developing economies after USA to receive the inflow of FDI. Latin America has also made significant reforms to attract a larger amount of FDI including privatization, adoption of bilateral investment and deregulations of economic activities after the 1990s. Alternatively, the quality of domestic institutions in developing country has not developed as in advanced countries, which may blur the positive effects of FDI inflow on the economic growth in these economies (Contractor et al. 2020). According to World Governance indicators by World Bank, Asia is a region that is performing better in terms of institutional quality, followed by Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which has a significant influence in obtaining FDI and on economic growth. As a result, the ongoing study aims to look at the influence of domestic institutions’ quality on the economic growth, and its role in affecting the FDI–growth relation of 80 countries from three developing regions, namely, Asia, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). The reason for selecting these regions is that these regions receive higher level of FDI inflows in contrast to other developing regions, according to the world investment report 2020. Moreover, developing countries extensively rely on FDI inflow as a promoter of economic growth (Hayat 2019). The study contributes to theoretical and empirical literature in several ways; however, the major contribution of this study is described in three points. First, this study is unique in that it digs deeper into the current literature and builds conceptual insights by analyzing empirical facts via how the domestic institutions’ quality in a country can influence the economic growth, and how disparities in the host country’s institutions’ quality can be used to describe the varied connection between FDI and growth across nations. Secondly, for in-depth analysis, we also estimated the influence of all five institutions indicators individually to check their relevancy to alter FDI-induced economic growth separately for each region, which have not been empirically examined more recently and specifically for the regions selected in this study. Finally, the study makes use of a larger dataset of 80 nations from three distinct areas of the globe, as well as comprehensive and relevant institutional measures based on the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project (Kaufmann et al. 2004). This article is structured as follows: Sect. 2 is devoted to empirical literature assessment on FDI, economic growth and institutions’ quality. Methodology and data used in this study are provided in Sect. 3, and empirical results are provided in Sect. 4. Finally, the conclusion of the research is presented in Sect. 5.",3

Harun Ur Rashid,Noman Uddin,Syed Zabid Hossain,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Tax evasion has been the most controversial and extensive issue of debate and discussion over the last few decades, especially in emerging markets. Emerging countries have been encountering tax evasion problems in generating their required tax revenue due to the absence of good governance (Ajaz and Ahmad 2010; Islam et al. 2020). In addition to the lack of good corporate governance, socioeconomic conditions also cause tax evasion to a large extent (Umar et al. 2019). The developed countries are also fighting against tax evasion, despite having lower tax evasion than developing countries (Dreher and Schneider 2010). Hence, prior studies had attempted to overcome those challenges, but they could not get a perfect solution to the problem (Akdede 2006; Chang and Lai 2004; Rashid et al. 2021; Rashid and Morshed 2021; Sanyal et al. 2000; Umar et al. 2019). Tax evasion is a more acute problem in developing countries because about twenty percent of their tax revenues become unrealized due to tax evasion (Andreoni et al. 1998). Every year, 17 percent of gross income tax is unpaid in the United States owing to tax evasion, while Europe loses $1.3 trillion. Average tax evasion was 8.6% in Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in 2013 (Rashid and Ahmad 2020). According to Rashid (2020), tax evasion occurs when people engage in criminal behavior while paying taxes. Similarly, Alm et al. (2019) defined tax evasion as an intentional and unlawful action adopted by people to reduce their legally due tax responsibilities. Tax evasion, which is the major cause of a country’s underdevelopment, creates a large tax gap in government earnings (Rashid and Ahmad 2020). It is viewed as a huge income loss for the government, putting pressure on the government to deliver smooth public services (Islam et al. 2020; Rashid et al. 2021; Rashid and Morshed 2021). Many researchers have focused on the economic variables of tax evasion (Alm et al. 2016; Torgler and Schneider 2007a; Tsakumis et al. 2007). Alm and Torgler (2006) noted that tax compliance relies upon numerous factors beyond the standard economic ones. Some researchers have focused on non-economic variables associated with tax evasion. For example, Riahi-Belkaoui (2004) emphasized the need for a contingency theory that calls on not only economic determinants of tax compliance but also institutional and moral determinants. Yamen et al. (2018) compared tax evasion of old versus new European state members of the OECD and found that the government’s institutional qualities negatively impact tax evasion. Researchers have considered their studies on the impact of governance quality on tax evasion in specific regions. For example, Yamen et al. (2018) conducted their research in OECD countries, Nurunnabi (2018) in the Muslim world, and Islam et al. (2020) in SAARC countries. Umar et al. (2019) explored that high levels of public governance are associated with high socioeconomic standards, which, in turn, contribute to high tax compliance. The main difference between the study of Umar et al. (2019) and the present study is that the previous one was based on a conceptual rather than an empirical finding, which might have some limitations due to unproven reliability and validity. To overcome these limitations, the study has empirically examined whether good governance in the public sector reduces tax evasion. Empirical analysis on the relationship between governance quality and tax evasion incorporating the mediating effect of socioeconomic conditions has yet to be examined thoroughly. The decision of citizens regarding whether they will pay or evade tax greatly depends on their perception of government services and qualities (Rashid 2020). Moreover, the focus should be on the socioeconomic conditions that governments generate through public goods or government spending. High levels of public governance are linked to high socioeconomic conditions, which in turn lead to high tax compliance. On the other hand, poor public governance leads to a poor socioeconomic situation, which has an adverse impact on citizens' desire and ability to pay taxes. Additionally, socioeconomic conditions are strategic because they act as a mediator between public governance quality and tax compliance (Umar et al. 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how socioeconomic conditions play a role in good governance and tax evasion. However, prior studies have investigated the impact of institutional factors on tax evasion in specific regions. Moreover, limited research on the effect of governance quality on tax evasion compared between developed and developing countries motivates this study. Therefore, this study raises the following research questions: RQ-1. Do good governance and socioeconomic conditions impact tax evasion? RQ-2. Whether the socioeconomic conditions mediate the relationship between good governance and tax evasion? RQ-3. Is there any significant difference in the impact of good governance and socioeconomic conditions on tax evasion between developed and developing countries? Based on the research questions, the study investigates the effect of good governance and socioeconomic conditions on tax evasion by comparing developed and developing countries. The research also aims to examine whether socioeconomic conditions mediate the relationship between good governance and tax evasion. Moreover, the study contributes to the existing literature in the following ways. First, this study explains the nature of non-economic variables of tax evasion by different researchers or scholars and evaluates the link between good governance and tax evasion. Second, the study provides a brief snapshot of various data sources for upcoming regional and global tax researchers and practitioners. The consequence of this study enhances the existing literature on the issue. Finally, the findings of this research will help and guide the government and policymakers to understand the interrelationship between governance indicators, socioeconomic conditions, and tax evasion. It also helps to establish the best policy for reducing tax evasion. The remaining parts of the paper are structured as follows. The second section deals with the review of literature on tax evasion and the development of hypotheses. The third section includes a description of the research design and methodology. The fourth section contains the summary and analysis of the empirical results. As a final point, the last part summarizes the conclusion and provides policy implications and limitations of the study, with suggestions for future research.",3

For measuring production inefficiency, we can draw on several useful references including, for example, Coelli et al. (2005), Fried et al. (2008), and Kumbhakar et al. (2015). According to these researchers, most studies are based on two phases of production, production itself or the cost of production, and employ one of two methods, either parametric or nonparametric. After considering the various combinations of these phases and methods, they take one of four approaches. For instance, the estimation of production and cost functions and data envelopment analysis (DEA) are parametric and nonparametric methods, respectively. Of course, each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, DEA is practical and provides useful solutions to the improvement of efficiency in decision-making units (DMU) and measuring scale elasticity locally (Thanassoulis et al. 2008). In this paper, however, we choose not to focus on nonparametric approaches like DEA, because it is difficult to use them to clarify the technological relationships between inputs and outputs. In other words, we cannot estimate the marginal productivities of inputs or the marginal costs of outputs, an important consideration in the economic analysis of production efficiency. In addition, in this paper, we do not consider the cost function approach as a parametric method. Most microeconomics texts explain that we derive the cost function through the profit maximization of the economic agent. Consequently, if economic agents do not maximize profit, it is difficult to assume the existence of a stable cost function. For the same reason, when we analyze the inefficiency of some kinds of public sector or nonprofit organizations, it is not possible to assume that agents maximize profits. Of course, we do not consider our chosen empirical study, being the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) in China, as a profit-maximizing agency. In this context, the production function approach is one of the more general and robust methods as it directly represents the technological relationship between inputs and output. We can then define any inefficiencies using this relationship even if the production units do not maximize profit. However, we also question some of the assumptions entailed in the production function approach. For instance, when we employ the stochastic frontier function approach to estimating the production function and thereby obtain some stable (and sometimes efficient) production function, we need to include inefficiency terms following a probabilistic distribution, for example, Kumbhakar and Lovell (2003). This means that we require information about the distribution of the error terms in estimating the parameters for the production function. Naturally enough, we question whether it is plausible to assume that an inefficient production unit has the same technology (production function) as the efficient production unit. If we cannot presume the parameters in the production function over production units, we should extend the production function approach to mutually different production functions over production units to loosen the constant parameters hypothesis. For instance, Berger and Humphrey (1991) consider the concept of a thick frontier, which they implement by separating the observations and estimating different cost functions for each quantile. By limiting the evaluation target to production inefficiencies and including some additional assumptions, the proposed method provides not only the inefficiencies in each DMU’s total factor productivity, but also its inefficiencies in input utilization. In this paper, we first propose a method to measure production inefficiency. We then decompose it into the contributions of each of the inputs by estimating the target (efficient) production function and the production technology (function) of the ith unit. Next, we propose a method to estimate the target (efficient) production function and the production function of the ith unit by applying quantile regression. We subsequently apply this method to measure the inefficiency of primary sector production for the XPCC, constructing the capital stock using the area sown and specifying other inputs to demonstrate its practical usefulness and validity. By conducting this case study, we can shed light on the several advantages and challenges when we apply the proposed method to real production data from both technical and empirical viewpoints. Additionally, we compare the proposed inefficiency to measures obtained by corrected ordinary least squares (COLS) and DEA to investigate the characters of the proposed method when calculating the correlation coefficients and the estimated rankings. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 proposes the method used to estimate the inefficiency of the ith production unit and the two types of decomposition methods. Section 3 conducts the empirical analysis for the primary production sector function of the XPCC in China and compares the proposed inefficiencies to those obtained by COLS and DEA. Section 4 provides some concluding remarks.",

Consequently, 25% of mountain areas provide essential ecosystem services to their inhabitants and visitors, supporting around 12% of the world population dependent on its resources (Mountain Partnership 2014). Hence, in the last couple of decades, mountain tourism has been gradually securing its position within the diverse forms of tourism around the world (Río-Rama et al. 2019), having established the mountains as the second most visited tourist destination after coastal areas (UNEP 2007). Mountains contribute 15–20% of tourism, generating revenue around US$100–140 billion per year worldwide (Simon et al. 2013; Taher et al. 2015). Undoubtedly, that led to the gradual expansion of the mountain-tourism research domain. However, the success story of tourism collectively depends upon the interactive relationship among all the ‘decision-making factors’, e.g.,—attractiveness, available facilities, accessibility along with climate (Braun et al., 1999; Keating and Kriz 2008); whereas the sustainability of a tourist destination is controlled by the ‘three fundamental pillars or dimensions’, namely—environmental, social and economic (Lozano 2008; Lu et al. 2018). While mountains inherently possess some of these elements (e.g.,—clean air, pleasant climate, all-encompassing graceful natural landscape ranging from rugged snow-clad mountains, deep valleys, cascading waterfalls to pristine lakes with religious, spiritual and aesthetic appeal, diversity and niche of flourishing flora-fauna and rich cultural tradition and historical heritage) (Zeng et al. 2022), some in mountain environment are uniquely shaped by ‘mountain specificities’ (e.g., inaccessibility, fragility, marginality) (Joshi and Dhyani 2009). Therefore to make tourism ‘viable, equitable, and bearable’ in a sensitive mountain set-up (Slocum 2015), a balanced synchronization among these elements is essential. Although, depending on the geographical location, climatic zone, intensity of tourism activities, carrying capacity, the resilience of the host environment along with sociological attributes of the host society (Joshi and Dhyani 2009; Lu et al. 2018) and institutional capability of an area, the impacts and/or outcomes could be positive or negative in different mountain areas (Rosenzweig and Parry1994). In this context, the popular mountain tourist destinations in the Asian developing countries are said to be more exposed and vulnerable to climate change (Ludwig et al. 2007; Faulon and Sacareau 2020), while the added pressure of uncontrolled population growth (both local and floating) is worsening the situation. Unfortunately, until now, researchers have mainly connected the aforementioned variabilities with impacts on the temperate mountain areas (Faulon and Sacareau 2020). Although, the imprints may not always be identical across all the developing countries or even for different areas within the same country. Several studies have identified India from Asia, one of the densely populated developing countries in the world as well also as one of the highly vulnerable countries to climate change (INCAA 2010). However, the recorded changes and their magnitudes showed the climate change-driven extremes and variabilities are found to be more critical around the Himalayan mountainous region of the country, potentially threatening the water supply of the region, ironically which belongs to the widely acclaimed ‘third pole’Footnote 1 (Barua and Katyaini 2014; Tiwari and Joshi 2014; Sharma and Goyal 2019). Additionally, in the mountain regions of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) and its adjoining landscape that covers more than 67% area of the entire Himalaya (Nandy et al. 2006), existing non-climatic issues are also getting complicated (NITI-AAYOG 2018). Anticipated water scarcity, insecurity due to drying natural springs (Tambe et al. 2011), ground-water and water-quality depletion, and water pollution (Tiwari 2012; Lohchab et al. 2017) are pertinent in many parts. While, socio-demographic changes (Apollo 2017) and anthropogenic alteration have initiated environmental problems, like, environmental degradation (Ives 2004, 2012), solid waste (Wani and Ahmad 2013), threats to  wetlands and ecosystem services (Ghosh and Chakraborty 2021), biodiversity and human-wildlife conflicts (Maikhuri et al. 2001). These contemporary issues impacting the ecological and socio-cultural health of the mountains may directly or indirectly impact the potential economic sector, e.g., tourism in the region. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how far the above-mentioned issues are covered and linked with the present status of tourism process in the IHR by the past studies. Since tourism in IHR has been a vital source of livelihood opportunity for the local communities where an average of 19% (ranges from 8% up to 37%) of the population lives in poverty as of 2020 (RBI 2020). Tourism contributes significantly up to 22% of state GDP in many of the IHR states (2014–15), higher than the national GDP of 9.3% contributed by tourism (NITI-AAYOG 2018). The continuous growth in the IHR-tourism industry recorded approximately a four-fold increase (about 270%) in tourist influx between 2001–2019 (MoT GoI 2001–2020). At the same time, the number of dependent population living in or below IHR has also increased significantly.Footnote 2 With the growing income and tourism development, tourism demand is likely to increase further multi-fold (240 million tourists) by 2025 in IHR (NITI-AAYOG 2018; Neupane et al. 2021). Despite such contribution and potential, IHR can be seen losing its international tourism share in South Asia by 2% and in India that decreased by 5.5% in the recent decade, between 2001–2019 (MoT GoI 2001–2020; WTO 2001–2019). However, the possible reasons behind such falling share are still unknown. In order to answer the same, a broad understanding of the characteristics of IHR-tourism as a whole, factors controlling tourism in IHR, ongoing trends in the tourism industry and its research domain is necessary. This will help to recognize the contribution as well as the progress of IHR-tourism both in the business market and in the field of mountain tourism research compared to similar mountain regions worldwide. While researchers in IHR periodically studied and contributed to the development of the tourism research field, nothing with a view to clarifying the conceptual focus in tourism research, identifying existing research trends, interlinking within or across the IHR-region, under one umbrella ever approached. Hence, the past and latest findings documented by the previous studies appear sporadic, incoherent and fragmented. Only a few review-based research could be found on IHR, that too either have generalized the tourism status of IHR-states, like West Bengal and Assam (Report, NITI-AAYOG 2018) or sporadically studied many topics (like, Sati 2016) or concerned with a specific set of issues, for example—climate or climate change impact (Singh et al. 2016; Dimri et al. 2017), water (Negi 2002), ecology/plant/biodiversity (Pathak et al. 2019; Rai and Singh 2021), solid waste management (Thakur et al. 2021), agriculture (Kumar et al. 2021), remote sensing-based approach (Bhattacharya and Mukherjee 2017; Kaushik et al. 2019) and so on. However, this theme-specific unstructured development of knowledge of past studies might not meet the practical needs of the academic practitioners, tourism managers and decision-makers who pursue to understand in which direction the IHR-tourism industry is moving and what would be the future course of actions and research need for the progress of both the industry and its research-domain in the ecologically sensitive mountain region; therefore, call for coverage and integrity. The present review-based study aims to exemplify this claim by answering the most relevant and fundamental research question in the case of IHR-tourism: what is the status of mountain-tourism development and tourism-research progress in IHR and how they are interconnected?—yet not explored due to lack of relevant approach and ignorance. Through this review, the study seeks to draw the attention of the academicians, policy makers, tourism managers and practitioners by providing knowledge on the state of IHR-tourism research, its trend, focus, latest findings and exposure, the process, shift and progress in knowledge-domain from past to present along with spatiotemporal concentration and distribution. Henceforth, the above-presented primary research question is explicitly directed by the following thematic sub-questions: (i) what are the overall pattern of topical, thematic and methodological focus of tourism research in IHR across spatiotemporal dimensions?—to clarify the current state of tourism development in IHR; and (ii) what are the publication and collaboration trends?—to measure the maturity and exposure of IHR tourism research. However, the process can be intricate to source the seminal works specific to tourism in IHR. Hence, the study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) combined with content and bibliometric analysis. The SLR enables to ‘filter-out research that contributes little’ that are reported and justified, allowing to build edifices of previously undiscovered public knowledge based on maximum (re)use of previous research findings’, thus identifying key scientific contributions to a field and expanding the boundaries of existing research (Tranfield et al. 2003; Weed 2006; Pahlevan-Sharif et al. 2019a, b). While the bibliometric analysis map existing intellectual territory or maturity level of scientific disciplines or fields (Koseoglu et al. 2016) containing dispersed and diverse knowledge (Strandberg et al., 2018), one of the most unbiased methods to discover emerging research trends (Tregua et al. 2020) where content analysis is a powerful data reduction technique (Stemler 2001) ‘to discover trends and patterns of development concerning certain concepts’ (Lu and Nepal 2009) and the most important step of the research process in qualitative, quantitative and mixed research studies (Boote and Beile, 2005; Combs et al. 2010; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2010). There are tourism involved studies with multi-disciplinary background which have employed SLR in combination with both bibliometric (Comerio and Strozzi 2019; Niñerola et al. 2019) and content analysis (Leung et al. 2014; Ruhanen et al. 2015; Chang and Katrichis 2016a, b; Koseoglu et al. 2016; Khoo-Lattimore et al. 2019; Soliman et al. 2021; López-Bonilla and López-Bonilla 2021). However, except for a few recent studies (e.g., Río-Rama et al. 2019; Zeng et al. 2022), the application of these approaches in the field of mountain tourism is still limited. Hence, clarification of synthesised relevant research information via a planned literature review like this would help to structure the mountain-tourism research field by arming it with practical ideals. The study would also offer an outlook of the most advanced areas as well as enlighten the neglected areas concerning mountain-tourism, supporting the strangers to target specific topics). Significantly, the study outcomes will underpin the human-induced challenges and contemporary issues threatening the mountain ecosystem, which will be a substantial input for multiple disciplines concerned with the sustainability and progress of mountain regions. Therefore, the present study supposes this SLR will also serve as a foundation and inspiration for substantial, useful future tourism research in IHR and similar mountain region. With this motivation in the following section, we systematically reviewed the tourism research in IHR with the aim of in-depth profiling of all the available and relevant past literature, explicitly directed by the thematic research questions. Following the above action points, the study begins with the description of the study area followed by the details of the research methods and data analysis techniques with their rationale; the later section provides the results and findings that summarize the status of IHR-tourism quantitively and qualitatively following the discussion which provides linkages and clarifications, and ends with a conclusion which also digs into the existing research-gaps, highlights practical implications and directs future pathways.",1

In many parts of the world, this is manifesting in the increased volatility of extreme weather events. Over 475,000 people lost their lives during the last two decades (2000–2019), and 2.56 trillion US dollars in damage were incurred as a direct result of over 11,000 extreme weather events globally (Eckstein et al. 2021). This is also why, between 1980 and 2019, 180 million people find themselves in urgent situations every year (CRED 2020). Financially, natural catastrophe damage accounts for 0.29% of world GDP. Over 80% of which were caused by weather and climate-related calamities (Pielke 2019). Flooding, among natural dangers, is one of the most devastating, resulting in fatalities and significant damage to personal property and public infrastructure. Major flood-related calamities have tripled in almost three decades since the 1980s (ADB 2013; Hoeppe 2016). On average, floods claim around 6000 lives and inflict 19 billion dollars in damage annually globally (CRED 2019). In the last two decades, floods have impacted an estimated 2 billion people globally (Ebi 2021). Asia appears to be the hardest region hit by natural disasters (ADRC 2016). In 2018, Asia incurred approximately 45% of catastrophe incidents, 80% of fatalities, and 76% of the impacted population. Flooding affected the greater part of the population (about 50%), followed by storms (about 28%) (CRED 2019). Hydrological-related disaster, hence, is probably one of the deadliest in Asia (Shaw 2006). Located in Southeast Asia, Vietnam has been severely devastated by natural catastrophes in recent decades. In the report on Global Climate Risk Index 2021, Vietnam was accentuated as one of the twenty countries most affected by extreme climatic phenomena in the last twenty years (Eckstein et al. 2021). As the total national population share, Vietnam was ranked sixth with 45.8% of the population (equivalent to 45.5 million) at risk of severe flooding, according to the report on Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2020 (Rentschler and Salhab 2020). The high flood risk in Vietnam arises out of its tropical monsoon climate, a long coastline, dense river system, and dense population along rivers and coastal areas (Razafindrabe et al. 2012; Chau et al. 2014). Excessive human interventions, such as deforestation (McElwee 2004) or inconsequential land-use management (Chau et al. 2013), have further exacerbated the probability of these types of risks in Vietnam. According to the World Bank’s estimates (2010), natural disasters damage Vietnam between 1% and 1.5% of its annual GDP. Reducing flood damages, therefore, has become a central task of the Vietnamese government. However, despite the incessant efforts of both the authorities and floodplain residents, damages by floods still frequently occur on vast scales. It is evident that victims of natural hazards, after experiencing severe damages, usually encounter obstacles to rehabilitate due to mental distress and lacking resources (Opdyke et al. 2017; Chan et al. 2018). Recent studies highlighted that government resources for post-disaster reconstruction, especially in developing countries, are confined and, therefore, inefficacious in major floods (Aldrich et al. 2015; Chan et al. 2018; Nguyen et al. 2021). Most households tend to be forgotten after experiencing natural hazard-induced damages (Osberghaus 2015). Moreover, the retard in relief operations leads the efforts of the government less worthwhile. As reported by Alam and Collins (2010), delivery of formal aid usually require nearly a week to access major-affected zones. In the context that formal support is still inadequate, households' recovery process is believed to be more reliant on informal assistance gained from their social networks (Hernández-Plaza et al. 2004; Sadri et al. 2018). Society seems to play more active and inclusive role than the authorities in supporting victims of natural hazards (Chan 2015). With regard to post-disaster recovery outcomes, most recent literature concentrated on physical robustness, emotional wellness, social welfare, and particularly the restoration procedure's satisfaction (Elgar et al. 2011; Dai et al. 2016; Maass et al. 2016; Bubeck and Thieken 2018). Households’ post-flood restoration swiftness, though not less crucial, has inadequately been addressed. Why are some groups able to return to normalcy rapidly while others take longer? What factors influence their rate of recovery? Does social connection influence the recovery rapidity? Does psychological reliance on the government hinder the recovery process? Clarifying these issues is critical since delayed rehabilitation increase social burdens, deepen victims' emotional pain, and prolong their economic hardships. Additionally, failure to recover from floods will serve as a pretext for increasing other forms of risk, thus increasing the vulnerability of flood victims to future flood episodes. By recognizing the meaning of quick recovery and knowledge gaps of prior literature, this study aims to examine post-flood recovery rapidity in connections with households' characteristics and resources, including demographics, social relationships, and reliant psychological reliance on the government. This objective was achieved through investigating farming households' efforts to restore from a severe flood befalling in 2017 in the central area of Vietnam. Through this study's results, we aim to deepen the understanding of factors accelerating post-flood recovery of farming households, which are fundamental to propose related policies and interventions. Following the introduction, the remaining sections comprise the body of this paper: Sect. 2 explores published documents on factors touching the rehabilitation of households/communities following natural disasters. Section 3 provides key concepts and the theoretical framework. Section 4 shows an overview of the research area and our approaches.

Inequality in economic and social development across regions and intra-regional disparities among different segments of the society received serious attention in the adoption of economic policy since the beginning of the planning era (Kurian 2000). However, despite a constant effort and rapid economic growth, economic inequality in per capita income and other socio-economic indicators across states in India is on the rise (Dash 2014; Kumar and Rani 2019; Misra et al. 2020). The 12th Five-Year Plan mentions regional inequality as a serious developmental challenge to the Indian economy (Planning Commission 2013). The plan attributes two reasons for increasing interstate inequality in India. First, per capita income in some states is rising faster as compared to some others. Second, the rate of growth of population in some of the low per capita income states is comparatively high. Highlighting the increasing inequality in India, Pal and Ghosh (2007) argue that the regional inequality in India sharply rose during the economic reform. Similarly, Ghosh (2008) also pointed out divergence in per capita income across states particularly after the implementation of economic reform. A large number of studies including Cashin and Sahay (1996), Bandyopadhyay (2021), Lolayekar and Mukhopadhyay (2016), and Mishra and Mishra (2018) examined the income disparity across states in India for different periods of time. In the last couple of years particularly after economic reform, the services sector outperformed agriculture as well as industry and occupies the dominant position in the Indian economy. The contribution of the services sector to the GDP of the country increases from 45 to 62 per cent during 1990–91 to 2019–20. The period also witnesses a declining share of agriculture from 30 to 18 per cent and a shrinking industry with a decline from 25 to 20 per cent share to the GDP of the countryFootnote 1. Apart from changing sectoral composition in favour of services, the growth of services also remained consistent and high during that period. Several studies, e.g., Gordon and Gupta (2004), Balakrishnan and Parameswaran (2007), Nayyar (2008) and Eichengreen and Gupta (2011) explained the services revolution in India and attributed the surge in growth in the Indian economy to the services sector terming it as services led growth. It is important to note that the growth within the services is concentrated in a few segments, such as business services and telecommunication services (Aggarwal 2012; Banga 2005; Eichengreen and Gupta 2011; Gordon and Gupta 2004). Apart from the concentration of growth in some of the services segments, there is also a concentration of these segments within some states leading to widespread disparity in the growth across states. In India, the states with higher per capita income, attract more modern services industry resulting in accelerated services growth and a higher share of modern services output (Ghani 2010). According to Government of India (2018), services contribute more than 80 per cent of the gross state value addition in Delhi and Chandigarh, whereas Sikkim receives about 31 per cent share from services. Similarly, Bihar registered the highest growth rate (15 per cent) across states, whereas Uttar Pradesh registers 7 per cent growth in services net state domestic product (NSDP) which is the lowest across statesFootnote 2. Such concentration and variation in growth are likely to widen economic inequality and retard inclusive development at the pan-India level. Several researchers investigate whether the disparities in per capita income across states are narrowing or converging over time. While most of the studies examine convergence at the aggregate level, studies focusing on specific sector, particularly the services sector is rather limitedFootnote 3. Moreover, these studies use regression-based analyses which are criticised because of their inability to portray the pattern of convergence or divergence for the entire period. In this context, it is pertinent to study whether the rapid growth in services causing interstate income inequality in India. Using data from 25 states for the period 1995–2020, we examine whether there is convergence in services NSDP across states in India. This paper makes three important contributions to the existing literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies including Shingal (2014), and Sanga and Shaban (2017) have examined the income convergence at the sectoral level including services. Second, unlike the existing studies, we utilise non-parametric methods such as kernel density estimates and transition probability matrix in our empirical analysis. The use of non-parametric methods such as kernel density estimation and transition probability matrix enable us not only to obtain the overall trend in convergence but also to visualize the distribution dynamics of the convergence for the entire time period considered in the study. Finally, the sample period of 1995–2020 can be considered crucial as India witnessed phases of high economic growth following economic reforms initiated in 1991. Moreover, the period also witnesses a slowdown of India’s growth rate since the global financial crisis (Subramanian and Felman 2019). The findings of our study suggest a pattern of convergence in the first 10 years of the sample period. Whereas, in the subsequent period, we observe a diverging trend. Our results are consistent across the methods adopted in the study. The paper is organised into five sections including the introduction. The second section summarises some of the existing literature in the domain. The third section discusses the sources of data and the methodologies used for the empirical analysis in this paper. Section 4 summarises the finding of the empirical analysis and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",

Earlier results up to the mid-70s were summarized in Okuguchi (1976) where mainly linear models were discussed. Two notable developments have been done since then. One is an introduction of nonlinearity into an oligopoly framework. Nonlinear models with their asymptotic behavior, including several modifications and variants of the classical model, were analyzed in Bischi et al. (2010). The other is the inclusion of environmental issues. More and more attention has been given to environmental policies to control environmental degradation in recent decades. The primary sources of the degradation are greenhouse and the pollution emission by industries using nonrenewable energy sources. The governments and other regulators are interested in creating incentives for the firms to reduce pollution emissions. Two kinds of polluters are usually considered, point source (PS) polluters and non-point source (NPS) polluters. In the case of PS polluters, the regulator knows the individual emission levels, so that it can place punishments or subsidies individually. In the case of NPS polluters, the regulator can monitor only the total emission level produced by the industry, so the traditional approach cannot be used. The regulator can effectively use a traditional environmental tax to curb emissions in the literature on PS pollution. Haruna and Goel (2018) studied optimal pollution abatement in a mixed duopoly when the firms have a linear price function and perform emission reduction R &D with imperfect appropriation. The optimal strategies for public and private firms are determined and compared. Gama (2020) ranked the widely used environmental command-and-control instruments in output, profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare in an n-firm framework. Sagasta and Usategui (2018) compared the optimal emission taxes on selling and renting firms in a durable goods oligopoly with n-firm. Wu and Chen (2013) compared PS and NPS pollutions in water quality and determined that NPS pollution made larger contribution to nutrient loads. Controlling NPS pollution, Segerson (1988) suggested monitoring the ambient concentration of pollutants and introducing uniform taxes or subsidies to the firms. Therefore, the regulator defines an environmental standard, and implements an ambient charge policy. Accordingly, it charges taxes if the concentration is above this standard or gives subsidies if the concentration is below it. Ganguli and Raju (2012) examined it in the Bertrand duopoly and noticed that larger ambient tax could result in higher concentration. Raju and Ganguli (2013) examined it in Cournot duopoly and numerically showed the effectiveness of ambient charges. Ishikawa et al. (2019) showed that the ambient charge effect in n-firm Bertrand oligopolies depends upon the number of firms, their abatement technologies, and the degree of substitutability of the differentiated products. Matsumoto et al. (2018) presented a generalization of the effective ambient charge in the n-firm Cournot framework. Matsumoto et al. (2018) constructed a multi-stage game in which duopoly firms determine their optimal output and select the optimal abatement technologies, whereas the regulator determines the optimal tax. Matsumoto and Szidarovszky (2021) introduced hyperbolic demand function in a Cournot oligopoly without product differentiation and demonstrated the condition under which the ambient charge is effective. The basic model in this paper is an n-firm Cournot oligopoly where the firms produce homogeneous goods and emit pollution. The first novelty of the model is adopting a nonlinear price function instead of linear price functions that were assumed to simplify the mathematical analysis in most studies. The second and more critical novelty is an introduction of uncertainty. All models introduced and discussed earlier were based on the simplifying assumption that the regulator can observe the pollution concentration exactly, and analytical considerations are confined to the behavior of the firms to avoid the uncertainty influence or limited to a duopoly case. However, these are not the cases in real life, since concentration might depend on the location where measurement is made, and every measuring equipment faces certain inaccuracies. Since this error is not known exactly by the firms, they consider a random error that either adds to or multiplies the true concentration. Therefore, the profit of each firm is also random, and its expectation is the major objective to be maximized. To ensure best or close to best outcome, the variance or the standard deviation of the profit is also minimized. Therefore, each firm faces two conflicting objectives. Two concepts are applied in this paper: multi-objective optimization and the idea of certainty equivalent. One-stage games are analyzed where the firms cannot modify the exogeneous clearing technology. In the first case, the equilibrium is unique, and in the second case, there is the possibility of multiple equilibria. The effects of the ambient charges are also analyzed on output and emission levels. This paper is developed as follows. The next section introduces the mathematical model with two different ways to incorporate error terms. They are discussed in Sects. 3 and 4. The additive case is equivalent to the deterministic model, so we concentrated on the second approach of a random multiplier. Section 4 is divided into two parts depending on the solution concept. For each case, equilibrium analysis is presented, and the dependence of the individual outputs of the firms, industry output, product unit price, and pollution emission levels on the tax rate is examined in Sects. 5 and 6. Section 7 discusses the duopoly case, and Sect. 8 offers conclusions and further research directions.",1

On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) announced a pandemic, and as of March 11, 2021, more than 6,000,000 deaths and almost 450,000,000 incident cases have been officially recorded worldwide. Today, the COVID-19 Pandemic is one of the most critical disasters that humanity has faced and it has affected countries physically, socially, and especially economically (United Nations, 2020). According to data revealed by the Ministry of Health in Turkey, the COVID-19 Pandemic appeared in Turkey at the beginning of March 2020; it then rapidly spread across the country through metropolitan cities, such as Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. In particular, Istanbul, with its high total population and population density, has become the Wuhan of Turkey (Bahçetepe 2021). It is clear that COVID-19 can be transmitted easily across cities or regions, and researchers from different disciplines have investigated the reasons behind this dilemma (Franch-Pardo et al. 2020). Although the reasons for variation in rate of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic remain somewhat unclear, many studies around the world have found that geo-environmental factors (Coccia 2020), demographic characteristics (Mollato et al. 2020; Arbel et al. 2021), and climatic conditions (Ma et al. 2020; Oto-Peralías 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Rios and Gianmoena 2021) can affect the severeness and spread of COVID-19. Some researchers have also focused on the relationship between health and social geography (De Kadt et al. 2020; Gibson and Rush, 2020; Kuupiel et al. 2020; Hierro and Maza 2022). Additionally, some have made interdisciplinary correlations between COVID-19 and social behavior (Allcot et al. 2020; Kuchler et al. 2020; Martinho 2021; Boumahdi et al. 2021; Cutrini and Savati 2021; Florida and Mellander 2022). While the COVID-19 Pandemic has become a hot topic in the academic community, GIS (Geographic Information System) has also become a vital method to observe the spatial distribution of infectious diseases. GIS is already a helpful resource for preventing an epidemic and enhancing the potential of care (Mollalo et al. 2018, 2019; Xiong et al. 2020). Guan et al. (2020) first used the spatial statistics of GIS to understand relations between patients' demographic characteristics and the level of COVID-19. After these first geographic analyses provided a base and methodology for others, many researchers started to reproduce them for other countries on different scales, such as USA (Dong et al. 2020), South Korea (Rezaei et al. 2020), and Spain (Orea and Álvarez, 2020). Therefore, it is clear that GIS has become an essential tool for analyzing, capturing, and visualizing the COVID-19 epidemic. It profoundly affects decision-making in daily life and provides a predictive model for the onset of disease (FranchPardo et al. 2020). The literature also contains some studies on the relationship between COVID-19 and spatial parameters in Turkey. Döker and Ocak (2020) discussed using GIS to monitor the geographic extent of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Zeren and Vildancı (2020) used hotspot analysis and the LISA model to understand the existing spatial pattern of the pandemic in Turkey. In addition, Zeren et al. (2021) evaluated the transmission of virus and mobility factors between sub-regions using the Global and Local Moran's I Indexes. Moreover, Istanbul Development Agency developed the vulnerability map of Istanbul using physical, economic, social, and environmental variables. However, no Turkish study has evaluated the impacts of spatial variables on the spread level of COVID-19. Therefore, this study aims to understand and analyze the association between determining physical, natural, economic, demographic, and mobility factors on Turkey's pandemic within the scope of recent developments and information. Turkey and its 81 provinces (both cities and rural areas) were chosen as a case area following this purpose. The dataset was also prepared at the province level and obtained from open-source websites. In the dataset, the dependent variable is the COVID-19 incidence, revealed by the Ministry of Health on 2 April 2021. The fundamental reason to set this date is that vaccination is not yet widely available in the community, and new variants have not begun to dominate the pandemic. On the other hand, explanatory variables consist of 20 different demographic, economic, physical, natural, and mobility indicators. After data wrangling, independent variables were examined in terms of their significance and multicollinearity in the correlation through explanatory regression analysis. Finally, the global and local regression models (OLS, SLM, SEM, and GWR) were employed to analyze their statistical and spatial relationship in ArcGIS and GeoDa. The results are intended to present the first attempt to use regional geographic modeling in COVID-19 studies throughout Turkey and may provide policy-makers with valuable information for targeted intervention. The structure of the paper comprises five main sections. Section two summarizes the place-based factors affecting the spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic on different scales through the studies found in the literature. In the third section, the research methodology is explained step by step. This section also contains explanations and details about the process of acquiring data and for Moran's I Index, Explanatory Regression Analysis, Ordinary Least Square, Spatial Lag Model, Spatial Error Model, and Geographically Weighted Regression. In section four, the results for each analysis type are explained separately. In the last section, variables associated with the spread of COVID-19 are also discussed in reference to the literature, and the paper is concluded by highlighting the study's primary results, constraints, and potential for future studies.",1

Human mobility behaviour is generally considered to be based on distance and time measurements; however, it can also be influenced by several external determinants, such as weather conditions, transport modes, and income status (Patla and Shumway-Cook 1999; Vilhemson 2005). Since being a goal-directed behaviour, mobility is recognized as an action based on individual choice. The means of transport used to hold the travels also vary according to the purpose. All these complexities have been the key motivator for scholars to investigate the dynamics of urban mobility patterns (Blommaert et al. 2017). As obtaining mobility data—especially from smartphones—became easier in the last decade, research at the urban and regional scale discussing issues related to transportation (Calabrese et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2019), economics (Dong et al. 2017), health (Arimura et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2021), and environment (Ford et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2016) have commonly seen. Human mobility is among the most discussed topics in urban studies, as it reveals the relationship between people and space in the discourse on urban planning (Sun et al. 2011; Jahromi et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2021a, b). However, it is hard to understand the main reasons for mobility behaviours through basic analytical tools since the economic, social, historical, cultural, and political contexts of space are temporal (Saurin 2021). Analysing complex urban systems is key for drawing conclusions about spatial rearrangement since it reveals how patterns change when human movement loses momentum—as has happened almost throughout the world in the last two years. The COVID-19 pandemic has cut into intracity mobility and required a rethinking of urban dynamics. Its greatest effect has been a major interruption of everyday life since many countries have imposed restrictions on community mobility to reduce disease transmission (Furceri et al. 2020). The pandemic became more than just a health crisis; it also posed a threat to the social and economic existence of cities and cultures (Cheshmehzangi 2021). Therefore, the changes in human mobility in different urban functions during the COVID-19 pandemic have attracted considerable attention from scholars. Previous research has identified mobility as a critical factor in explaining behavioural changes to manage the pandemic, and it has been discovered that different patterns of mobility can be found in different urban functions (de Oliveira et al. 2021). A study in Portugal, which examines the mobility patterns in different locations based on the number of cases, has revealed that the population quickly adopted the government measures, nonetheless, mobility, particularly in the parks, increased after the lockdown was over (Tamagusko and Ferreira 2020). A paper in the USA has found that community mobility at public transport stations decreased by 50%, followed by retail/recreation areas (45%) (DePhillipo et al. 2021). Mendolia et al. (2021) have found that mobility in grocery/pharmacy and transport categories was similarly affected by COVID-19 cases, while mobility in workplace areas appeared to be less affected and mobility in parks was not affected. A study examining changes in mobility patterns for different location categories during the pandemic period in New York City has revealed that stay-at-home requirements reduced mobility at transit stations, while parks and recreation areas were slightly affected (Jiang et al. 2021). da Silva et al. (2021) have discovered that the first wave of pandemics caused a greater reduction in mobility, in addition to this, parks and grocery/pharmacy categories had opposite characteristics compared to the other ones in a study conducted in various parts of America and Europe. Li et al. (2021), examining changes in travel purposes during COVID-19, have revealed that the rates of resident, park, and grocery/pharmacy activities increased during the lockdown period, while the rates of leisure and shopping activities decreased. A paper by Y. Liu et al. (2021a, b) has discovered that the influence of COVID-19 on various urban functions was indicated over differing change patterns in different regions. A study in which effective reproduction number of COVID-19, weather conditions, and mobility trends were used as an indicator found that the decrease in mobility in retail/recreation and transport station areas was efficient in reducing the number of cases; whereas the increase in time spent in the parks prevented the spread of the pandemic (Ghirelli et al. 2022). Despite considerable progress, there is currently insufficient research on the non-linear determinants of mobility change. Most papers, on the other hand, fully focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the production shortage caused by the lockdowns, as well as the support offered to individuals suffering from income loss in Turkey, have lowered financial strength (Küçükoğlu 2021). On the other hand, although weather conditions are known to be a natural factor affecting mobility, a limited number of studies included weather conditions in their analysis (Ghirelli et al. 2022). Therefore, it should be acknowledged that mobility patterns may also have been delivered of economic and weather-wise factors, which implies that the scope of studies associated with mobility pattern change must be widened. The purpose of this paper is to understand the determinants of pandemic-induced changes in intracity mobility in the following urban functions; grocery/pharmacy, parks, transit stations, retail/recreation, residential, and workplaces. One of our testable hypotheses is that the government measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, stay-at-home requirements, and school and workplace closures are not determinative of the mobility changes in every urban function. The other hypothesis is that the influence of the pandemic on mobility changes remains in the background after the post-NN era. Lastly, both economic factors—such as the depreciation of TRY or economic support to households—and weather conditions have an impact on urban mobility change, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. To evaluate our hypotheses, we used distance correlation and stepwise sensitivity analysis methods, the details of which are described in the Materials and Methods section. Compared to previous studies, this study contributes to the current international list of literature on this topic in three ways. First, the data we analysed are beyond being just pandemic-related, but the non-linear model also identifies the weather-wise and economic determinants of change in the mobility pattern. Second, while analysing the impact of COVID-19 on different urban functions, we compare the pre-and post-periods described as the new normal (NN) by the Turkish authorities. Third, we used daily sequence data, meaning that we could monitor the change day by day.",2

Burcu Özdemir Sarı,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The first two decades of the twenty-first century have witnessed pivotal events such as economic crises, disasters, international migration, war, and the pandemic, the effects of which have been global. Not all countries have experienced these extreme events equally. However, the devastating effects display similarities, such as the decline in economic activity, increased unemployment rates, worsening housing and living conditions, and increased risk of eviction and homelessness. When the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, the world had only just recovered from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Turkey had not been affected much by the GFC. Rather, countries with more liberalised housing finance and real estate markets had been hit by the crisis (Hegedüs and Horvath 2015). The limited negative impacts of the GFC on the Turkish economy and housing sector were due to the lately developed mortgage finance system, less reliance on mortgage finance products, and a highly regulated financial sector (Coşkun 2016; Özdemir Sarı 2019). However, just before the pandemic, Turkey experienced an economic crisis in 2018, the effects of which continued in 2019. The political tension between Turkey and the US triggered the 2018/19 exchange rate crisis (Çakmaklı et al. 2020). The depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the US Dollar and increasing inflation rate followed. Hundreds of firms declared bankruptcy and the official unemployment rate reached record-high levels (Akcay and Güngen 2019). With the outbreak and spread of Covid-19, governments worldwide adopted several extraordinary measures, such as lockdown orders, restricting business activity, and requiring households to 'isolate at home' to limit social interactions and the spread of the virus. Covid-19 and associated measures had significant consequences on the economy and radically transformed people's lives. Even at the very beginning of the pandemic, researchers highlighted its unique, enormous, and multidimensional nature. For instance, Gopinath (2020), in the article she wrote for the IMFBlog, indicated that this is the 'worst economic downturn since the great depression'. She highlighted the existence of overlapping simultaneous crises and wrote: ""This is a crisis like no other, and there is substantial uncertainty about its impact on people's lives and livelihoods…many countries now face multiple crises—a health crisis, a financial crisis, and a collapse in commodity prices, which interact in complex ways."" This multiple crisis environment and the increased time spent at home emphasised the role and meaning of housing for households and society like no other crises had before. During this process, the functions of housing have expanded beyond its primary functions of being a shelter, a commodity, and an investment good. Housing has attracted attention, providing/limiting access to open and green spaces, ensuring an adequate/inadequate home office or home-schooling/distant education environment, and being a determinant of households' health conditions. As a result, once again, housing proved to be an indispensable pillar for the well-being of society. The Turkish economy, housing markets, and households also have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no time for a recovery period after the 2018/19 economic crisis. The pandemic and the measures taken to tackle it have deepened the already existing social, economic, and spatial inequalities. The lockdowns and restrictions experienced during the pandemic have resulted in the shutdowns of many small and medium-sized businesses, including construction firms, leading to lower economic output and increased unemployment. On the other hand, the new living conditions brought about by the pandemic caused changes in housing consumption and preferences of households. Some households managed to adapt to new consumption needs, such as increased physical space requirements, whereas others were hardly surviving in overcrowding with already poor housing conditions. There is a mutual relationship between the housing markets and the overall economy. Housing markets are vulnerable to economic fluctuations, yet they may also cause a deepening of the economic crisis. Failures in the housing markets may cause several problems, some of which are observed as direct housing outcomes, whereas others emerge as problems in the broader fields. Examples include housing quality and affordability problems, homelessness, unemployment, increased inequality in the distribution of wealth, and a decline in the performance of regional and national economies (Bramley et al. 1996). Therefore, it is essential for urban and regional policies to regularly monitor changes in the housing markets. This monitoring process becomes especially vital in countries where the construction sector plays a significant role in the economy. Turkey is one such country. Our study investigates the trends in the Turkish housing markets under the effects of the 2018/19 economic crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. At present, it is not yet possible to monitor all of the effects of these two events based on evidence since some results are likely to become apparent in the coming years. Still, some of the supply- and demand-side trends in the housing markets are currently observable, and they form the focus of the present paper.",2

The pandemic has also caused a decreased workforce and dramatic changes in different sectors, such as health, education, finance, and tourism as well as the world economy (Nicola et al. 2020). The pandemic has created uncertainty for the real estate and housing sector due to self-isolation, social distancing, and travel restrictions. In addition to a decline in the number of viewings of rental accommodation because of the infection risk (Nicola et al. 2020), housing choice preferences of individuals have changed with the increase in time spent at home and the popularization of working from home (Nanda et al. 2021; Tomal and Helbich 2022). During the first period of the pandemic, housing investments decreased with increasing risks (Francke and Korevaar 2021). At the same time, different interest rate cuts were provided by many countries during this period (Sahin and Girgin 2021). These changes have affected supply (Chen and Frankin 2020), demand (Kuk et al. 2021), and prices (Li et al. 2022) in the housing markets. Rental housing is one of the most important components of an effective housing market (Ugurlar and Eceral 2014), because it allows users to move easily in the market with its alternative and flexible structure (Scanlon and Whitehead 2011). However, the dramatic changes in mobility, workforce, and economy during the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the rental housing market in addition to properties for sale. Although previous studies have shown that rent prices have a negative relation with confirmed COVID-19 cases (Tomal and Marona 2021; Trojanek et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022), it is clear that a decline in household income and uncertainty created an insecure environment for tenants. According to Kholodilin (2020), several countries have developed housing policies specially to protect tenants from the negative impacts of the pandemic. For this purpose, governments have suspended or banned evictions, limited the rent increases, and provided rent subsidies to sustain rental market affordability. The rental housing market in Turkey is shaped by a free-market environment and there is limited regulation to control rent increases and evictions. Rental activities throughout the country are carried out by real-estate offices and individuals without any limitation on the initial rent price. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has not developed any specific regulation to reduce negative impacts on tenants. Therefore, the private rental housing market in Turkey provides an example of how a global pandemic will affect rent prices if no policy is developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the private rental housing sector in Turkey. For this purpose, the trend of unit rent price change is examined over four periods defined according to the particular national process adopted in response to COVID-19 at any given time. The methodology of the study is based on the descriptive analysis and comparison of the exchange of rental unit prices and unit prices at the provincial scale. Average unit rent prices of the Turkish provinces are compared using ArcGIS 10.6. to show how private rent prices have changed during the pandemic. This study consists of five main parts. Following the Introduction, Sect. 2 examines the literature regarding private rental housing markets and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sect. 3, the general characteristics of the rental housing market in Turkey and its current situation as of December 2021 are stated. In Sect. 4, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rent prices in the provinces of Turkey is analyzed within the framework of the described periods. In Sect. 5, a general evaluation is carried out depending upon the results of the analysis.",3

Luzon is the largest and most populous island division and serves as the national economic and political center. It is home to the country’s capital region, the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metropolitan Manila. Visayas Island is one of the three principal divisions located in the central part of the archipelago, where the second most populous province of Cebu is located. Mindanao is home to the majority of Filipino Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines and has the largest concentration of ethnic minorities in the country. The Spanish colonization influenced this geographical structure in the religion. In the pre-colonial period, Islam was the monopolistic religion of the archipelago. After Spanish colonization in the sixteenth century, the Philippines was Christianized, with political and commercial influence spreading from the international port city of Manila to other regions in Luzon Island and the northern region of Visayas Island. Spanish control was limited to the northern regions while Islam remained influential in the southern islands. The growing presence of Islam triggered the establishment of independence in Mindanao, and the nation experienced prolonged conflicts and rebellions that led to economic stagnation (Federspiel 1998). This geographical structure established the long-lasting North–South economic imbalances, widely known as “Imperial Manila Syndrome” (hereinafter, IMS). IMS was termed a persistent “core–periphery” development imbalance, in Myrdal (1957) and Hirschman’s (1959) regional structure (Tusalem 2020). This spatial imbalance indicates that as the provinces moved further away from Manila, the less developed they became. IMS was the consequence of capital city-oriented public finance approach, which allocated public spending to higher population-density regions, while maintaining strong control over inter-governmental transfers and central government directives, but without appropriate budgetary support. The remote local governments from Manila were under-funded, and influence was monopolized by political dynasties. This promoted a culture of corruption, fiscal dependence, and economic stagnation (Mendoza et al. 2016; Mendoza and Ocampo 2017; Tusalem 2020). In the Philippines, the subnational administrative structure consists of four tiers as of 2020: 17 regions, 81 provinces, 1633 cities/municipalities, and 42,046 barangays (a most local level administrative district). The lower three tiers are defined as local government units (LGUs) that mainly deliver local public goods and services, while the regions are administrative divisions that mainly coordinate economic development planning across LGUs as well as deliver national ones (Philippines Statistical Authorly, PSA 2020). As a lower-middle-income Southeast Asian nation, the Philippines has been beset by poverty since its independence (e.g., Gerson 1998; Albert 2007; ADB 2009; Almaden 2015; World Bank 2018). From 2000–2018, the nation could have substantially decreased poverty, measured by the headcount ratio,Footnote 1 to 16.6% in 2018, below the world average of 23.0%, from 33.7% in 2000. However, poverty reduction, inevitable with income growth, continues to be disproportionate across subnational regions. The spatial imbalance of income growth and poverty has frequently been studied. Manasan and Mercado (1999) applied Barro and Sala-i-Martin’s (1992, 1995) neoclassical growth model to examine the presence of σ- and β-convergence in per capita income for 1975–1997, utilizing regional-level per capita gross regional domestic product (GRDP). Balisacan and Fuwa (2003, 2004a, 2004b) also employed the same neoclassical growth model to test the presence of σ- and β-convergence at the provincial level using the per capita income/expenditure compiled from household expenditure microdata. Akita and Pagulayan (2014) utilized the regional-level per capita GRDP variable for 1975–2009 to conduct the island-region one-stage Theil inequality decomposition and bi-dimensional decomposition method. The within-island inequality component plays a dominant role in overall income inequality, particularly in Luzon, which has been the largest contributor. The tertiary sector contributes substantially to the overall interregional income inequality.Footnote 2 In addition, spatial poverty imbalance has also been frequently studied. Balisacan and Fuwa (2004a) applied instrumental variable estimation with province-level panel data to examine the factors that influence poverty incidence and used household income per capita as the instrument variable. Income growth, human capital, and agrarian reform programs were positively associated with poverty reduction. Balisacan et al. (2008) described the unbalanced regional socio-economic development between the developed Manila region and the underdeveloped far-flung Southern regions, using various regional statistics, such as poverty, income and its growth, health, education, infrastructure, and public services. They inferred a core–periphery structure, although they did not directly label it. Clausen (2010) elucidated the relationship between globalization-driven growth and spatial imbalance of economic and social development in the Philippines from 1980 to 2008. She implied a coexistence of poverty reduction in the core regions of Metro Manila due to specialist skill accumulation and migration versus the increasing poverty in peripheries owing to an unproductive agricultural sector, geographically visualizing the regional data on sectoral employment and migrant workers. Her study infers the presence of the regional specialization of labor. Vista and Murayama (2011) employed a multiple regression model to explore the effects of spatial and non-spatial factors on poverty incidence by applying two neighboring pilot site provinces of Albay and Camarines Sur. They incorporated spatial variables (agro-climatic environments, access to road infrastructure, and proximity to major markets) and policy variables (the land distribution program, fiscal decentralization policy, and population growth), which have a substantial effect on poverty. Balisacan (2011) adopted the Alkire-Foster aggregation method to decompose the poverty index into multidimensional components, which are classified by population sub-groups (e.g., the industrial sector, rural–urban locations, and regions). He found that poverty was mainly located in rural agriculture sectors in the Visayas, Bicol, Zamboanga Peninsula, and Muslim Mindanao. Kurita and Kurosaki (2011) employed province-level per capita consumption, poverty incidence, and the Gini coefficient to estimate the relationships among growth, poverty, and inequality for 1985–2003. Their study applied the generalized method of moments with lagged variables to control for potential biases due to dynamic structure and found that the presence of inequality reduced the speed of income growth and poverty reduction. Using the region-level poverty incidence for 1985–2009, Fujii (2017) utilized a dynamic poverty decomposition method wherein interregional poverty inequality was divided into six components (population shift, within-group redistribution, between-group redistribution, nominal growth, inflation, and methodological change). He concluded that nominal growth and inflation were by far the two most influential factors that contributed to poverty incidence. Mendoza et al. (2017) descriptively provided unique spatial characteristics by comparing the poverty incidence and other socio-economic household variables, such as per capita income by source, education, employment, rural–urban demographic structure, agricultural land quality, and local government quality among Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao provinces. They inferred the nation’s core–peripheral development structure. Tusalem (2020) empirically addressed the presence of IMS and described how the unitary state government delivers more public services, disaster relief operations, poverty alleviation programs, financial supports, and fundamental infrastructure projects in the capital and its neighbors, and less so in remote provinces. He employed panel-corrected standard errors and panel-specific AR-1 autocorrelation models to note that physical distance from Manila negatively affects economic, poverty, and human development indicators, and rural funds for provincial development, or IMS. Salvacion (2020) applied the geographically weighted regression to explore spatial patterns and examine the effects of topographic, climatic, and socio-economic factors on the poverty incidence in the mountainous farming and fishing province of Marinduque Island. Using the village-level observations, the topographic factors, such as the land slope and annual rainfall, showed greater effects on poverty incidence, possibly because they influence agricultural productivity. To our knowledge, few studies have broadly examined the spatial distribution patterns of poverty in the Philippines. Moreover, no existing literature explores the presence of its multiple convergences. To address the gap, we examine the provincial-level spatial distribution for the period 2000–2018, by progressively applying four regional inequality analysis methods: (i) conventional inequality measures (the Gini coefficient, the coefficient of variation, and Thiel T & L indices), (ii) growth incidence curve, (iii) one-stage Theil decomposition method, and (iv) club convergence analysis. Our study makes a threefold contribution to the existing literature. First, our multi-dimensional approach provides a more comprehensive picture of spatial distribution analysis. The conventional inequality measures display a broad picture of the overall spatial distribution, and the remaining methods explore the influencing factors of the change in distribution. Second, we examine the presence of single and multiple equilibria in convergence by applying Phillips and Sul’s (2007) nonlinear time-varying factor model, which is more informative than Barro and Sala-i-Martin’s (1992, 1995) traditional approach. Third, our balanced panel data on poverty are unique, as we estimate the values from the existing municipal population data for the study period. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our methods and data. Section 3 states our empirical results. Sections 4 and 5 present the discussion and conclusions, respectively.",

They are diverse and include medical conditions, health and health care, spiritual life, socioeconomic activities, working conditions, information technology, migration, agricultural and food conditions, culture, education, and population structure. In particular, rural residents often comprise the majority of the population at high risk for serious illness, including the elderly and the poor. In addition, they face healthcare disparities in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in the healthcare setting, resulting in an environment with limited numbers of viral tests and recoveries. Charbel (2018) reports that deaths from infectious diseases in the urban group declined much more rapidly than in the rural group. Qian (2021) presented four explanatory variables, “location (urban/rural classification),” “existing social vulnerability (Social Vulnerability Index),” “community resilience (Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities),” and “diversity among neighborhoods,” and found that urban groups had higher levels of resilience than rural groups. This result is consistent with the earlier findings of Charbel (2018), as well as Cutter et al. (2016) Qian (2021) report that this correlation has matched in all the U.S. counties. On the other hand, when focusing on mental health regarding well-being, there are reports of different aspects of the existence of health disparities due to inadequate rural health care. It is about the paradox of rural well-being in developed countries (Denmark is the case here). According to reports on the subject in developed countries, rural residents tend to exhibit higher levels of subjective well-being than urban residents. Higher connective social capital in rural areas and higher access to natural amenities contribute to the paradox of well-being in rural Denmark (Sørensen 2014). As noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights strengths and weaknesses in urban and rural areas. However, Sørensen (2014) cautions against generalizing these findings to other regions, especially considering differences in demographic structure, socioeconomic status, transportation, culture, physical environment, and scale of intervention. This study aims to determine the reality of urban and rural subjective well-being in a corona disaster in a developing country, specifically the Indonesian island of Bali, as a case study. It will address the following issues in turn and finally verify the hypothesis: 1. to present an index of “subjective well-being” based on an objective global case study; 2. to select the survey subjects in Bali and conduct a questionnaire survey, and 3. to analyze the obtained data and verify the hypothesis through the results of the analysis. Aristotle called happiness the final goal of life and defined “well-being” as not only temporary pleasure and happy feelings but also a life in which people use their unique human reason and make the best use of their abilities to the fullest (The previous studies in this field have used both well-being and happiness.). As the tool for examining a person's well-being, there is a proposal for a quality of life assessment scale, the WHO Quality of Life 26 (1997), which can be of common use across countries, cultures, ages, and genders around the world. This tool is a 26-item QOL questionnaire routinely used in clinical settings in health care. The WHO defines QOL as “an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. And it consists of six domains (1. physical domain, 2. psychological domain, 3. level of independence, 4. social relationships, 5. environment, and 6. spirituality/religious/beliefs) (Tasaki et al. 1998). On the other hand, as an indicator of people's happiness comprehensively from the viewpoint of consumers and with a qualitative evaluation perspective, there is a happiness indicator as a theory of people's subjective well-being, apart from QOL (Quality of Life: ease of living and satisfaction), which is an indicator of well-being as a quality of life. Happiness is discussed primarily in the fields of psychology and economics. A typical example is Pugno's (2004) “paradox of happiness.” Research on methods of measuring and quantifying happiness is still ongoing, and recently, self-reported “subjective well-being (individual evaluation of positive and negative emotions, happiness, life satisfaction, etc.)” in psychology is considered a better indicator. The mainstream view is that direct measurement of “subjective well-being” using questionnaires is effective (Ando 2014). The following further summarizes previous studies about well-being on the content generated by the COVID-19 pandemic for urban and rural areas, divided into developed and developing countries, and on the strengths and weaknesses of their respective health care.",
7.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,02 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-022-00269-0,Does financial inclusion control corruption in upper-middle and lower-middle income countries?,March 2023,Rajesh Barik,Sanjaya Kumar Lenka,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Financial inclusion is defined as the easy and affordable access of financial services by the poor and marginalized people (Asian Development Bank 2000; Beck and Demirgüç-Kunt 2008; Rangarajan 2008; Reserve Bank of India 2014). In recent years, the magnitude of financial inclusion has enhanced significantly in both developed and developing countries (Mader and Duvendack 2019). It has been observed that over the years, the accessibility and usability of formal financial products and services among the poor and marginalized sections of people are increasing (Hussain et al. 2021). Like high-income countries, adults from middle-income and low-income countries are also frequently using different modes of formal financial services in their day-to-day lifecycle. The recent adaptability of digital payment technologies across all sections of people has drastically augmented the overall financial transactions. Specifically, the rapid use digital technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic are well noticed around the globe (see Sahay et al. 2020; Sornaganesh et al. 2020; Ozili 2020a, b). Hence, understanding the rising trend of digital technologies and the high accessibility of financial services among the mass sections of people, it is always a matter of inquisitiveness to demystify the fact how has the wide range of accessibility of basic finance impact corruption practices in the countries. Corruption is always defined as the misuse of public power for the individual benefits. Hence, the corruptive behavior of the public authority has significant impact on the other socio-economic outcomes. Control of corruption has always been a key factor for the reduction of poverty, inequality (Gupta, et al. 2002), and unemployment (Adjor and Kebalo 2018; Abé Ndjié et al. 2019), and the overall economic development. Hence, comprehending the significance of control of corruption and observing the high accessibility of financial services among all sections of people, a debate has been erupted among the world academicians and policy makers for bringing a clear-cut evidence on the inter-relationship between financial inclusion and corruption. Some economists (like Raghuram Rajan) have argued in favor of financial inclusion and control of corruption. While delivering 20th Lalit Doshi memorial lecture in Mumbai (India), prof. Rajan emphasized that the promotion of financial inclusion and digital finance [like internet/mobile banking, direct benefit transfer (DBT), linking unique biometric identification with a bank account, etc.] can break the corrupt practices in public services. Conversely, a counter argument has been put forward that the high degree of financial inclusion with less financial literacy/awareness, no supervision, and inadequate regulation can enable people to access huge credit and allow them to invest their obtained credit in different unauthorized or illegal activities like insider trading, money laundering, gambling (Ajide 2020), which ultimately enhance the process of corruption in the country. Understanding the theoretical arguments from both sides of financial inclusion on corruption, this study has endeavored to empirically examine the impact of financial inclusion in controlling corruption between the selected upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries in the world. While, looking the World Bank classification of countries on the basis of country’s income, it can be understood that unlike low- and higher-income countries, upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries have less income gapFootnote 1 in between them. Hence, it would always be a noteworthy attempt to study how the process of financial inclusion is responding differently to two almost similar kinds of income groups’ countries. This study contributes to the existing literatures of financial inclusion in the following ways. To the best of authors’ knowledge, Ajide (2020) is the only empirical study which is depicting the role of financial inclusion in controlling corruption in 13 African countries. Hence, this is the first study which is empirically examining the same relationship in a cross-country level and trying to understand how the process of financial inclusion behaving differently in a cross-country level. Second, unlike Ajide (2020), this study uses principal component analysis (PCA) to construct financial inclusion indexes for both the upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries. Third, this study examines the non-monotonic relationship between financial inclusion and control of corruption for both the groups of countries. Fourth, identifying the nature of the considered sample countries, it can be said that these countries are having different stages of financial inclusion and its inter-relationship with corruption. Hence, along with the overall sample, this study also endeavored to examine their inter-relationship for lower-middle and upper-middle income countries separately. Fifth, this study applies various panel data models to strengthen the regression results. Finally, this study also make an attempt to provide some valuable policy suggestions to both the groups of countries about the role of financial inclusion in control of corruption. The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 of this paper describes the theoretical nexus between fiancé and corruption. Section 3 provides a brief review of literature. Section 4 gives a detailed explanation of the data and econometric techniques used in this study. Similarly, Sect. 5 presents the empirical findings and intensely discusses the results. Lastly, Sect. 6 delivers a concluding remark and suggests some valuable policy recommendations for the policy makers and governments.",2
7.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,23 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-022-00260-9,Productivity analysis of Sri Lankan cooperative banks: input distance function approach,March 2023,Arandarage Mayura Prasad Arandara,Shingo Takahashi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Cooperative banks are financial institutes functioning under specific cooperative principles and are non-profit-driven.Footnote 1 They provide regular banking services as well as credits to their members. The business model of cooperative banks is different from those of traditional commercial banks. While traditional commercial banks are investor-owned, cooperative banks are owned by their members. The working capital of cooperative banks is thus formed by the shares of their members, and every member is entitled to vote to elect the board of directors. They aim to enhance consumer surplus to have maximum benefits for their members (Groeneveld 2012). In 2010, European cooperative banks were holding around 20% of the share of loans and deposits in their domestic markets (Birchall and International Labour Office 2013). Cooperative banks have been resilient to environmental changes (Groeneveld 2012; Roelants et al. 2012). For example, they outperformed traditional investor-owned banks during the global financial crisis, from 2007 to 2010, and have increased their customer base by 14% and assets by nearly 10% (Birchall and International Labour Office 2013). On the other hand, Italian cooperative banks suffered from the recession and over time showed a decline in efficiency (Barra et al. 2013). According to a study by Pasiouras et al. (2007), the technical efficiency of Greek cooperative banks has been negatively affected by GDP per capita and the unemployment rate in the geographical area. Thus, it would be important to examine their recent performance in challenging environmental conditions including the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, the percentage of the population using credit unions is 48.88% in North America, 9.16% in Europe, and only 4.34% in Asia (McKillop et al. 2020). Despite the lower figure in Asia, cooperative banks are prominent in Sri Lanka, the focus of this study. According to the bank division of the Department of Cooperative Development (DCD) of Sri Lanka, more than 30% of the population is using one of the three forms of financial cooperatives in Sri Lanka, namely cooperative rural banks (CRBs), thrift and credit cooperative societies, and other financial services cooperative societies. Among them, CRBs are considered to be more financially stable, as they function under well-established multi-purpose cooperative societies (MPCSs), which are formed by the integration of several business entities such as retail shops, fuel stations, and communications centers. In other words, CRBs are membership-based banking systems, and their operations are restricted to a specific area determined by an MPCS. As stated in the mid-year statistics of DCD in 2020, CRB deposits of over Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) 139 billion were recorded in Sri Lanka, nearly 50% being loaned out to their members. Their prominence stems from the fact that the agriculture sector and small and medium enterprises account for a considerable portion of the credit needs of the population, and traditional commercial banking sectors are not willing to lend such small amounts. In the past decade, CRB operations have been challenged by the increased competition of newly entered microfinance institutions in the market and more recently by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examines the economic performance of cooperative banks in Sri Lanka, with a focus on CRBs. Studies on the productivity of cooperative banks are relatively scarce in the productivity analysis literature. Most extant productivity analyses have focused on traditional commercial banks and state banks. Their findings are summarized in studies such as Berger and Humphrey (1997), Berger (2007), and Maudos and Pastor (2001). Although several studies focus on cooperative banks, the majority have been carried out in developed countries, mostly in Europe (Lang and Welzel 1996 for Germany; Molyneux and Williams, 2005; Barros et al. 2010; Kontolaimou and Tsekouras 2010; Spulbăr et al. 2015 for Europe; Battaglia et al. 2010 for Italy; Glass et al. 2014; Yamori et al. 2017 for Japan). We identify only a few studies on developing countries, particularly in Asia (Feroze, 2012 for India; Jayamaha and Mula 2011; Jayamaha 2014 for Sri Lanka; Mirasol and Garcia 2020 for the Philippines; Othman et al. 2013 for Malaysia). Most of these studies have used a nonparametric approach with a single performance measure, and none has provided productivity decompositions. Addressing this research gap, the current study contributes to the literature by using stochastic input distance function estimations that handle multiple outputs and allow to decompose productivity of cooperative banks in the emerging economies. Our study would be innovative since to the best of our knowledge, we would be the first to use the input distance function approach with multiple outputs to decompose the productivity of cooperative banks in emerging Asian economies and to empirically examine the effect of government regulations enacted during COVID-19 on their performance. The objectives of this study are, thus, (1) to empirically examine the performance of Sri Lankan cooperative banks by estimating technical efficiency and TFP, (2) to decompose TFP change to recognize the contribution of each component to the productivity change of cooperative banks and (3) to identify the effect of changing market and environmental conditions on the cooperative banking industry including the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we use a unique set of cooperative banking sector data restructured and compiled from quarterly financial reports of CRBs produced to the Provincial Department of Cooperative Development, Sabaragamuwa Province during the period 2016–2020. This data set contains interest, salary, and other operating expenses as inputs. We also use multiple output measures—interest and other operating revenues. Since we do not have clear price data, we adopt the input distance function method introduced by Shephard (1953), which permits multiple outputs to estimate technical efficiency (TE) while allowing us to decompose total factor productivity (TFP) growth into a scale change (SC), technical change (TC), and technical efficiency change (TEC) without price information. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature on bank performance studies. The methodology is presented in Sect. 3 and Sect. 4 describes the data. The empirical results are discussed in Sect. 5, and Sect. 6 concludes.",
7.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,07 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-022-00263-6,Impacts and risks of borrowing on corporate performance: evidence from Japan and Sub-Saharan Africa,March 2023,Ekote Nelson Nnoko,Yuji Maeda,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Studies have shown that government debt strongly correlates negatively with corporate debt and investment but positively with corporate liquidity (Graham et al. 2014). Interestingly, Majumdar and Sen (2010) found that debt structure matters. Furthermore, domestic and foreign debts exist in short-term and long-term debts and secured and unsecured debts (Bhaduri 2002). It is essential to consider institutional differences and debt heterogeneity in analyzing the impact of capital structure on firm performance. Growth, cash flow, size, product and industry characteristics also influence the optimal capital structure. Besides, Gordon and Shoven’s (1982) study revealed that changes in interest rates or inflation could lead to higher debt–value ratios and corporate bankruptcy rates. That financial leverage is significantly but negatively affected by the industry’s firm size. Moreover, with a growing asset base, firms at a growth age will need external borrowing more than firms at a mature or declining age with a considerable asset base and accumulated retained earnings. Consequently, there could be a possible effect of borrowings on corporate performance; thus, this study investigates “borrowings, risk analysis and corporate performance, empirical evidence from Japan and SSA listed manufacturing companies.” Borrowings constitute the capital structure of a firm (debt–equity ratio). The main determinants of business capital structure choice may include general economic determinants linked to economic development, the level of stock market development, the size of the banking sector and the level of financial market development (Gaspareniene et al. 2019). Borrowings constitute a risk to the lender and the borrower. Therefore, corporate borrowings expose the company to many different types and levels of risk. The source and nature of funds determine the type of risk involved. Borrowing from a company can be done privately through bank loans. It can also be done publicly through a debt issue known as corporate bonds. This bond allows many investors to become lenders (or creditors) to the company. Bankruptcy may result if the borrower defaults to paying the principal and interest to the lender; V.V.Kovalev believes that the creditworthiness, credit risk of the borrower, is the organization’s potential ability not to lose its current solvency after receiving a loan and at the start of the targeted use of these funds (Burdina 2020). All manufacturing companies listed in Japan and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) face financial risk. Financial risk, also called debt risk or financing risk, is due to debt financial uncertainty, uncertainty in firm yields, interest rate, exchange rate and inflation. The financial risk can be defined as a deviation from expected historical returns during a particular period (Bofah, n.d.; McClure 2010). Manifestations of financial risk in manufacturing listed companies include but are not limited to low profitability, poor economic efficiency, lack of funds, lack of solvency, unreasonable debt structure, poor operating capacities, a high proportion of non-performing assets, weak growth ability and stagnant enterprise development. A firm’s internal management and external factors such as the government’s macro-control measures and changes in the business environment contribute to a firm’s financial risk. The macro-environment includes but is not limited to the economic, legal, market, social, cultural and natural environment. One can use many tools to assess and analyze financial or credit risk. Some credit rating firms, such as Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody, issue credit ratings to capture and grade financial risk. Besides, many institutional investors in corporate bonds often supplement these firms’ ratings with their credit analysis. However, interest coverage and capitalization ratios are among our standard tools. Interest–coverage ratios explain how much money a firm needs to generate each year to fund its debt’s annual interest. A company needs to generate enough earnings to service its annual debt; therefore, the minimum ratio should be 1.0; the higher the ratio, the lower the credit risk. A standard interest–coverage ratio is EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) divided by annual interest expense. The capitalization ratio captures the volume of interest-bearing debt the firm needs to carry in proportion to its assets. The capitalization ratio could be determined by dividing long-term debt by total assets. This ratio assesses the company’s degree of financial leverage. Therefore, the lower the capitalization ratio, the better the company’s financial leverage. Corporate governance is affected by the leverage (debt), especially in countries experiencing financial distress and crisis. This effect is because financial constraints can constrain managers to react to crises and develop any retrenchment strategy. Without retrenchment, there can be no recovery strategy (Higgins and Toms 2003). Also, firms with higher debt levels reduce their investment after and during a financial crisis. The negative effect of firm leverage on investment is persistent for several years after the countries’ shock with sovereign stress (Kalemli-Ozcan and Laeven 2018). This negative effect of firms on investments is more substantial within firms holding short-term debt in countries with sovereign stress, consistent with rollover risk being a vital channel influencing the investment. Therefore, the developing countries and emerging markets’ debts and equity markets occupy a higher risk position and cost in debt and equity financing than developed financial markets. As a result, it is challenging to issue domestic currency debts abroad. The relatively underdeveloped capital markets could limit local firms from issuing debt in long tenors or effectively hedging their currency through financial derivatives. Besides, weak institutions and corporate governance problems limit firms’ access to equity financing. Long-term funding is difficult to obtain locally and could finance long-term investments with short-term funding locally. The patterns of foreign borrowings are different across countries and sectors. An interesting result is that less profitable firms borrow more from abroad than the profitable firms (Kawai et al. 1999). The question to answer is: Is there any effect of borrowings on corporate performance? If yes, is there any difference between the effect of borrowings on Japanese listed manufacturing companies’ corporate performance and that of the listed manufacturing companies in SSA? How can we optimize corporate performance amidst borrowings and related risks of listed manufacturing companies? This study is significant because it would add to the existing academic and professional literature on borrowings, risk and corporate performance. It would improve a firm’s management of capital structure for better performance. It would also help a government improve the financial markets to serve local and foreign corporations’ needs better. The study is also unique because it compares the impact of borrowings and corporate performance between Japan and SSA. The remaining part of this study will review relevant literature, methodology, data presentation, data analysis, results, conclusion and limitations.",

It impacts positively on poverty, development, environmental sustainability, education, labor, care systems, peace and societal security (as can be seen in the transversal gender lens of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals). It is also essential to transform all forms of violence, especially gendered violence. A fundamental step towards gender equality is women’s participation in politics. As equal citizens, women ought to have equivalent responsibilities, rights and opportunities. Over the last century, societies and nations across the globe have transformed in favor of gender equality, all countries except for the Vatican have reformed in favor of equal political rights. Quota systems have been established, and legal reforms have guaranteed that women have formal access to politics as activists, voters, candidates, party members, public servants and leaders. Women are still underrepresented at all levels of decision-making, but there have been significant advances. In 2022 women constitute 26% of national parliamentarians worldwide, compared to 11% in 1995 (UN Women 2022). Given patriarchal culture and sex-gender systems traditionally relegating women to the private-domestic realm, female empowerment has been met with resistance, backlash and violence. Gender Based Violence against Women is the form of violence that affects women participating in politics given that they are women, with a gender component. In order to comprehensively research Gender Based Political Violence against Women (GBPVAW) in the Mexican context, given the legal reforms in April 2020 that put forward a clear legal concept of GBPVAW, outlining conducts and sanctions, a multidisciplinary research model was designed and implemented during the 2020–2021 Federal Electoral Process (20–21 FEP), the first ensuing the reform. Given the significant gender and social inequalities in Mexico, it was designed taking gender justice and social justice as pillar. Gender justice defined as “the achievement of equality between women and men in conjunction with measures to redress the disadvantages that lead to the subordination of women and to enable them to access and control resources together with human agency” (Benavente and Valdés 2014, p. 16). Social justice has to do with a positive freedom conception, with guaranteeing rights and human security (Truong et al. 2014), it relates to societies’ ability to promote the conditions for wellbeing, enabling persons and collectivities to exercise their abilities, express their experiences and determine the course of actions (agency). According to Iris Marion Young (2000, 2003) it includes not only the distribution, but also the institutional conditions necessary for the development of personal capacities, communication and collective cooperation. Nancy Fraser (1997, 1998, 2000, 2005, 2015) develops a tripartite conception of social justice for the era of complex, globalized and contemporary societies, of post-social politics, encompassing the economic dimension of redistribution, the sociocultural dimension of recognition together with the political dimension of representation, all three bearing equal weight. A social justice perspective is indispensable, since political violence goes hand in hand with social and economic exclusion in a plurinational state such as Mexico, and women occupy diverse social positions intersectionally (Bonfil 2017). This means that gender inequality and violence is concomitant to other structural inequalities, power relations and social differentiation systems, and there is great benefit on analyzing them specifically and in conjunction (Crenshaw 2005; Yuval-Davis 2006; Zúñiga 2014). For example, only 1% of women legislators at federal level are indigenous, despite 21.5% of the Mexican population identifying as indigenous (Bonfil 2017), Afro-Mexican women are not even represented. Conceptually, GBPVAW is different to political violence, and it is relevant, since it is a type of violence that seeks to limit women’s political participation because they are women (Krook 2020; Krook and Restrepo 2016a, 2016b). Conceptualizing GBPVAW in Mexico took years of discussion and more than forty legal reform initiatives since 2012. In April 2020, it was officially defined as “any action or omission, including tolerance, based on gender elements and exercised within the public or private sphere, which has the purpose or result of limiting, annulling or undermining the effective exercise of electoral political rights” of women (DOF 2020). Mexico committed to women’s political participation through multiple means, such as international agreements, quota systems, legal reforms, although cultural beliefs, institutional obstacles and structural determinants persist (Friedenberg 2017), hindering women’s representation and reproducing the sex-gender system. This translates into dogmatic opinions stating women are less capable to become apt candidates, to win elections and to rule; into institutional practices that segregate women at the bottom of party hierarchies, leave them out of decision-making political organs, and make them candidates in non-competitive districts. Also, gender care systems and structural constraints limit women’s participation in politics, with a gender wage gap between 30% (Cuellar and Moreno 2022) and a total workload of 19.7 h extra per week for women, especially given domestic work (Pedrero 2018). Women in Mexico achieved suffrage in 1953, voting for the first time in 1955. Since, women’s participation in the public realm has steadily increased. For example, the country went from having 14% of female federal representatives in 1995 to having 49% in 2018, a three-fold increase in 23 years. During the 20–21 FEP, women made up 51% of candidates at all levels of government, which was unprecedented and ranks Mexico sixth in terms of female federal representation (IPU 2020), however ownership and control of political parties was mainly in the hands of men (82.27%). The country is made up of 32 federal states, and in its entire history it has only had 15 female governors, 6 got elected during the 20–21 FEP given parity quotas. Female representation at municipal government was 28% prior to the 20–21 FEP, and 27% as a result of elections, despite candidate quotas. There have been significant advances in the realm of political representation, although challenges persist and go hand in hand with the economic arena of redistribution and the sociocultural dimension of recognition, where violence towards women for gender reasons is ever present. Thus, the research model developed in order to assess GBPVAW is multidisciplinary, triangulated, and aware of regional and intersectional disparities.",

Therefore, the government has been considering the introduction of various policies, such as green innovation and the expansion of renewable energy, to reduce the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions (METI 2021). The climate change problems that the world is currently facing are beyond the scope of what can be addressed by individual elemental technologies. By introducing energy and environmental policies through novel institutional designs and changes, as well as new regulations and deregulations, Japan now needs to contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society as a responsible industrialized country. To realize this decarbonized society, we have to clarify the factors that promote efficient energy use. This study thus focuses on the residential sector and statistically examines the potential for improving the efficiency of its electricity use. The long-term trends that Japanese households face include a declining birthrate and a rise in the aging of household members. The first feature of this study involved statistically identifying the effect of these long-term trends on the efficiency of residential electricity demand. Specifically, a declining birthrate results in a decrease in the average number of household members. A smaller average household size then allows residents to live in more compact spaces. Herein, living spaces with fewer rooms may allow for more efficient energy use because occupants have more opportunities to share electricity with one another. In addition, this decrease in the number of household members then increases the demand for housing complexes in place of single-family dwellings because it then allows for fewer rooms to be occupied. In this context, many apartment buildings are concrete structures and are better insulated than detached houses. Hence, promoting occupancy in housing complexes may improve energy efficiency because of the more efficient use of heating and cooling equipment. Therefore, this study generated the following hypothesis: H1: Smaller household sizes serve to improve the efficiency of residential electricity demand. The aging of household members implies a subsequent increase in the percentage of the population who are aged 65 years and older. Important to note here is the fact that it is common for people to experience a decline in their cognitive functions as they age. This means that, unless digital and automation technologies are fully available, aging increases peoples’ likelihood of forgetting to turn off the equipment used for heating, cooling, and others that increase overall power demand. Furthermore, because the elderly spend relatively more time at home, increases in age are likely to lead to more inefficient use of electricity. In other words, aging is likely to worsen energy inefficiency. Because Japan has a rapidly accelerating aging population, it is crucial to clarify the effect of the long-term trends of its declining birthrate and aging population on the efficiency of electricity demand on its prospective future changes in energy efficiency. Therefore, this study examined the validity of a second hypothesis. H2: An increasingly aging population will worsen the efficiency of electricity demand. Furthermore, there is a possibility of structural changes in the electricity demand structure in Japan in recent years; for example, the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 caused all nuclear power generation to be shut down simultaneously, with thermal power generation—mainly liquefied natural gas—then becoming the primary source of electricity supply. In addition, the growing problem of global warming has led to a significant revision of Japan’s energy policy towards a focus on renewable energy as a primary energy source. With this shift in energy policy, electricity prices, which had been on a downward trend, began to rise. Prior studies have revealed that this rise in electricity prices has since changed consumers’ demand habits and has had a structural effect on the price elasticity of electricity demand (Otsuka 2019a; Tanishita 2019; Wang et al. 2022). This study then examined whether this energy policy revision also had a significant effect on the efficiency of electricity demand. Hence, the third hypothesis was proposed. H3: Energy policy revisions in the wake of Japan’s natural disasters improved the efficiency of electricity demand. This study uses stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to identify household attribute factors that determine the inefficiency of household electricity demand. Therefore, this study provides valuable information for policymakers. Governments interested in reducing GHG emissions may develop policies more compatible with a decarbonized society, such as promoting household electrification. Focusing on household attributes and providing more insight to governments could reduce overall energy policy costs. This is an essential contribution of this study. The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Methods describe the theoretical background and empirical methods used to verify the validity of the above three hypotheses. This section also presents the estimation model and data used in the analyses. Results and discussion then analyzes the efficiency of residential electricity demand and verifies the validity of the research hypotheses. Finally, our conclusions and future implications are presented.",1
7.0,1.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,19 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-022-00258-3,Pollution haven hypothesis and the environmental Kuznets curve of Bangladesh: an empirical investigation,March 2023,Mahamuda Firoj,Nair Sultana,Abeda Sultana,Unknown,Unknown,Female,Female,"Greenhouse gas emissions are the major contributor to environmental problems like global warming, acid rain, climate change, and ozone exhaustion. These environmental problems have created some issues with water and food stock, energy production and consumption, alive ecologies, human health, and the overall social and economic welfare of humanity (Spash 2020). Among the greenhouse gases, carbon emission (CO2) is the most substantial contributor to recent environmental problems (Cai et al. 2018). In this perspective, possible relationships between carbon emissions and socioeconomic indicators such as economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), urbanization, and energy consumption/production have persisted as a matter of concern among international development practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. In this domain, the momentous experiential base is the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, presented by Grossman and Krueger (1991). According to this hypothesis, an inverted U-shaped association occurs between environmental quality (typically signified by CO2 emissions) and economic growth or national income. Thus, EKC hypothesis postulates that CO2 emissions increase with the rise of income at first until reaching a turning point [threshold level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita]; after that point, CO2 emissions have decreased (Grossman and Krueger 1991, 1995; Dinda 2004). Like the EKC hypothesis, the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) concept has become more popular due to the variation in pollution costs among developing and developed countries during the last two decades. Trade liberalization also triggers policymakers' thinking about the PHH theory (Bhowmik et al. 2022). As a key component, the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) boosts the economic growth of host countries, creating market competitiveness by sharing knowledge, technology, and management skills globally (Ssali et al. 2019). Moreover, many environmental economists claimed that FDI involving pollution-intensive production facilities would be the reason for the potential environmental degradation of the host countries. As a consequence, it might cause climate change and global warming. Many studies have agreed on the validity of PHH in many developing nations (Solarin et al. 2017; Salahuddin et al. 2018; Rana and Sharma 2019; Assamoi et al. 2020) and proved that the rise in FDI inflows leads to an increase in pollution intensiveness. However, several prior research findings suggested that FDI inflow affirmatively improves the environmental eminence of host countries by practicing energy-efficient and environment-friendly technologies (Cole and Fredriksson 2009; Tang and Tan 2015; Abdouli and Hammami 2017; Agboola and Bekun 2019). In the era of globalization, a developed and efficient financial sector plays a significant role in attaining inclusive growth (Zheng et al. 2022; Rashid et al. 2020; Pervez et al. 2018). Modern technology adoption through FDI in different financing channels is considered the most crucial step. Bangladesh is predominantly attracted to demonstrating the stage of financial development regardless of carbon emissions. We investigate the EKC hypothesis in the context of financial development despite economic growth. In recent years, several empirical studies have concentrated on the nexus between financial development and environmental degradation. For example, using Indonesian time-series data, Shahbaz et al. (2013) examined the impact of economic growth, financial development, and trade on CO2 emissions. Zaidi et al. (2019) investigated the long-run connection between financial development and carbon emissions to examine the EKC hypothesis in 17 APEC (Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation) countries. Using Chinese provincial data, Zhao and Yang (2020) used EKC and PHH to investigate the impact of financial development, economic growth, and energy consumption on CO2 emissions. Because of rapid development in the last few years, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest growing economies, with an eight percent annual real GDP growth rate (World Bank 2020). Bangladesh's outstanding development prospects have engrossed much foreign capital (Hossain 2021). However, with the fastest economic growth and the incursion of foreign capital, the volume of carbon emissions has also swiftly increased (Hasan and Chongbo 2020). Financial development is another crucial factor in an economy's ability to create opportunities for capital and investment and improve the creation of merchandise and service industries. Thus financial development endorses economic growth but upsurges CO2 emissions together, which negatively affects the environment of Bangladesh (Bae et al. 2022; Khan et al. 2021). Energy-related CO2 emissions in Bangladesh have increased by 556% from 1990 to 2019 (Enerdata 2020). An enormous amount of carbon emissions poses a challenge to the sustainable development of Bangladesh’s economy (Rashid and Uddin 2018; Rashid et al. 2019). On the other hand, the development strategy of Bangladesh has moved towards liberalization with an exercise in domestic deregulation, but it also elaborates partial dismantling of trade barricades. This involved dynamic international rearrangement of production or the starter of FDI inflows into Bangladesh. A vital aspect of the appearance of such global phenomena has been the growing severity of pollution control management in developed countries (Rashid and Hamid 2022). They have been on the lookout to exploit the comparatively sloppier environment policy in emerging economies like Bangladesh (Ahmad et al. 2017). Developed countries endure by employing environment-friendly technologies in their economies while pushing environmentally harmful technologies to the developing nations. This occurs due to the worldwide and internal policy change and more confounds the matter, prominent to PHH. We can rely on the appearance of EKC with local policy change and PHH with universal policy change. Therefore, the primary motivation of this study is to find out the answer to the following questions: (1) Does the relationship between financial development and carbon emissions in Bangladesh support the EKC hypothesis? (2) Does the relationship between FDI inflow and carbon emissions in Bangladesh confirm the PHH? Even though the prior studies have recurrently investigated EKC and PHH, a few insufficiencies in the prevailing literature have been resolute in the study. First, the research on the impact of financial development and FDI on CO2 emissions using the ARDL model is relatively uncommon in the prior literature. Second, the validity of the PHH and EKC hypotheses has never been simultaneously examined for Bangladesh. To pledge these shortages, the study examines the validity of PHH and EKC hypotheses for Bangladesh from 1986 to 2018 using the ARDL model. Furthermore, this study contributes to the existing literature in the following ways. First, this study uses the ARDL approach to examine the relationship between the variables. Compared to other estimation procedures, the ARDL model is more functional in integrating variables to order zero, one, or mixed orders one and zero. Furthermore, the ARDL estimation process covenants with the potential endogeneity problem of the concerned variables and is formed to be efficient in the case of small samples. Moreover, the study investigates the EKC hypothesis in the context of financial development. In addition, unlike other studies that concentrated on the relationship between FDI and CO2 emissions in Bangladesh, this study incorporates trade openness, energy consumption, fixed capital formation, and urbanization in the function of the CO2 emissions along with FDI inflow and financial development. Finally, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, limited studies have been performed in environmental economics in the context of Bangladesh. Hence, the study contributes to the existing literature and further enhances the international debate on environmental degradation and its impact. The remaining portion of the study is set up as follows. First, relevant literature is represented in the literature review segment. Second, the materials and method sections show the basic information of the data, empirical models, and methodology. Third, the results are analyzed and interpreted in results and discussion. Finally, we have concluded the paper by providing some policy recommendations along with a summary.",5

The scope of land utilisation is being reduced for population pressure for those countries mainly rely on agriculture. According to the agricultural census in India (2015–16), total operated land has decreased to 1.11% within just 5 years (Agricultural Census 2021) and about 114.01 M ha land is now being treated as degraded and wasteland (ICAR 2010), 0.17% of Indians lag in their productive life due to starvation (Kumar and Patel 2020). Farming community need to focus more on producing major crops to meet the need of the increasing population. Identification of proper land for production and yield with maximum capability is one of the needed prerequisites for farming communities and government administrators too. A relationship between land characteristics and crop requirements is known as suitability assessment (Mustafa et al. 2011). Productivity of land for crops and water potentiality can be enumerated by land suitability evolution (FAO 2022). Suitability analysis supports to identify ideal location for crops within a specified area. Land suitability analysis must be carried out in such a way that local needs and conditions must be reflected well in the final decision. Land suitability investigation is an interdisciplinary method that assemble the information from diverse fields like soil science, meteorology, economics, management, social science. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), current suitability and potential suitability can be measured. In this paper, present condition has been taken for the current sustainability approach. Several criteria are needed for the evaluation (Belka 2005). Multi-criteria-decision-making (MCDM) or multiple criteria evaluation (MCE) has been advanced to progress spatial decision making when a set of substitutes needs to be evaluated based on conflicting and disproportionate criteria. MCE is an effective tool for multiple criteria decision-making process (Malczewski 2006). Geographical Information system (GIS) software helps in the application of MCDM and MCE approach in appropriate way with significant algorithms and supports to visualise the results through maps and other meaningful representations. Application of MCDM and MCE through GIS has been proved significant and effective on spatial analysis. Different geographical areas with different features have been evaluated based on land suitability. Malczewski (2006) produced a survey literature on GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis. Bhagat et al. (2009) conducted land suitability analysis for cereal production. They used elementary GIS technique in their research work. Pan et al. (2011) applied the concept of producing super maps for a better visualisation of land suitability; it was based on Liao city, North China. Mustafa et al. (2011) applied AHP technique to discover suitable croplands of Agra district in India, they used soil chemical and physical properties data as parameters. Samanta et al. (2011) implied MCDM techniques in Morobe province in Papua New Guinea for refined better place for rice cultivation. They selected five parameters: topography, climate, land accessibility, physical and chemical properties of soil. Yalew et al. (2016) identified suitable agricultural land in the upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia using MCDM techniques. They incorporated topography, soil properties, climate, land use, road network as parameters of the study. Bozdağ et al. (2016) applied this method for Cihanbeyli in Turkey to determine suitable agricultural land. The evaluating criteria of their study were topography, soil, climate and groundwater. Ahmed et al. (2016) applied GIS-based agricultural land suitability to determine suitable agricultural land for rubber crops in Malaysia. They considered topography, climate, rainfall, soil properties as parameters. Kazemi and Akinci (2018) applied MCDM and GIS systems in Golestan Province, Iran to identify rainfed farming zones. They used seasonal rainfall data as major parameter in the study. An extensive literature review about crop suitability analysis showed that the type of parameters varies with varying geographical locations (Table 1). Geographically, West Bengal is diversified and economically depends on agricultural activities and shares a significant proportion from the total agricultural production of India. The aim of the study focuses on the application of AHP techniques to determine the suitable crop lands of West Bengal. The main objectives of the study are (i) to identify the crop suitable zones and (ii) correlation between suitability and allied agricultural factors such as agricultural labourer and agricultural production. Several studies (Santra and Mitra 2016; Rukshana and Molla 2021; Sarkar et al 2021) have already covered small portion of the state on related subject matter but in this paper, the whole state has been selected as study area. Novelty of this article lies in application of crop suitability analysis for physically and economically vast diversified heterogeneous region where it is generally used within a comparatively smaller homogeneous boundary. According to the authors’ knowledge, this kind of MCDM technique already applied in West Bengal, India within a specific geographical boundary, for the first-time authors of this paper attempted to analyse whole state. Also, authors attempted to correlate their observation with real-world socio-economic factors of the study area to understand actual utilisation of crop suitable land from economic and social perspective also. Validation process that has been applied in this paper is also quite unique compared with other contemporary research article related to this field.",

This concept roots going back more than a century as agglomeration. It became more prominent both in theory and practice after the 1980s in particular. In this period, the concept of agglomeration reemerged as an industrial district. This concept was named as cluster, after Michael Porter’s studies (1990; 1998) in which the concept was associated with competitiveness. In its long history, this concept has been analyzed from many perspectives and it found a wide area in policies and practice. The theoretical and practical studies indicate that the concept has been used as an industrial instrument for supporting local production, innovation, and rivalry, as well as for decreasing costs and diminishing regional disparities (Porter 1998; Maskell and Lorenzen 2004; Becattini et al. 2009; Sölvell et al. 2009; Cruz and Teixeria 2010; Lazzeretti et al. 2013; Graf and Broekel 2020). In the 1990s, clustering became an industrial policy in the European Union (EU), and these policies have started being applied in EU countries since 1999 (Sölvell et al. 2009; Obadic 2013). The development of the industry in Türkiye has necessitated clustering policies to have more effective outputs. Although the industrial development and development of organized industrial zones (OIZs) have a long history, the clustering policies mainly started after the 2000s with the process of adaptation to the EU. Comprehensive clustering policies were started with Türkiye’s Ninth Development Plan (2007–2013), with clusters having been promoted nationally, regionally, and locally (Cansız 2011; Erol and Yıldırım 2013). In addition, OIZs have clustering characteristics by being a spatial agglomeration of firms (Cansız 2011). They have been a crucial dimension of industrial development in Türkiye since the 1960s. As an instrument of industrial development, OIZs have almost half of the total industrial employment (41%) in Türkiye (Ministry of Industry and Technology 2021), also the number of OIZs are increasing year by year; 145 of 293 OIZs are founded after 2000. In addition to directing industrial development and preventing environmental issues, OIZs have become the main poles of development (Özer 2008; Bayülken 2017). Even if they have clustering characteristics, whether the OIZs in Türkiye have clustering potential and whether they differ in terms of their clustering potential need to be analyzed. This study analyzes the clustering potential of OIZs in Türkiye in this context. This study’s novelty is in how it suggests the clustering potential coefficient (CPC) as a coefficient for defining OIZs’ clustering potential. The importance of this study can be evaluated in two aspects. First, the study develops a new perspective for identifying the industrial cluster. With the difference of previous studies, this study analyzes the clustering potential of places where firms are already agglomerated. The second important aspect is that the results of this analysis can direct the clustering policies for OIZs in Türkiye. This study has three main objectives. The first is to analyze the general characteristics of OIZs to provide a general framework for comparing all of them. The second objective is to develop the CPC formula and calculate it for each OIZ. This is the main concern of the current study and its contribution to the literature. This objective also includes a comparison of OIZs’ clustering potentials. The third objective is to analyze the statistical differences between OIZs’ CPCs and OIZs’ general characteristics. The study consists of five headings, including this introduction. After the introduction, Sect. 2 discusses the conceptual framework in terms of the historical development of the concept. This section of the study constructs a conceptual framework on clustering. Sect. 3 provides the methodology and discusses studies that have been performed about identifying clusters. After providing the methodology for defining industries’ relations, Sect. 3 then explains the formula for calculating CPC, which is the study’s original contribution, as well as provides the data used in the study. Sect. 4 first gives OIZs’ general characteristics, production types, size in the number of parcels, occupancy rate in parcels, and foundation year using maps.

A highly unequal regional distribution of economic resources can lead to disparities not only in income, but also in accessing essential services such as education and healthcare. Such regional imbalances can also lead to migration, cause brain drain, and instigate social unrest, all of which can severely impact the overall sustainability of a country. In this context, the book Akita and Kataoka (2022) serves as a highly informative research compendium. It provides not only a comprehensive overview of the measurement of regional inequality, but also presents four case studies that deepen our understanding of regional inequality in the context of the development challenges of Indonesia: decentralization, premature deindustrialization, financial crisis, low labor productivity, among others. The book strikes a balance between methodological rigor, intuition, and empirical applications. The style of the book is accessible to a wide range of readers, from advanced undergraduates in economics to scholars working on regional development issues. The empirical applications based on the development challenges of Indonesia make the book more relevant to any scholar working in the field of regional science. As the world’s largest archipelagic nation with more than 13,000 islands and 300 ethnic groups, Indonesia is spatially diversified in terms of its environment, endowments of natural resources, economics, ethnicity, and culture. These regional characteristics are strong incentives for conducting research in the field of regional development.",

The introduction of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was followed after the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that started a global effort in 2000 to address poverty and have been arguably, the most anti-poverty movement in contemporary history (Fullman et al. 2017; Hák et al. 2016; Kumar et al. 2018). Yet, the SDGs are beyond poverty including 17 global goals and intending to entertain sustainable growth that not only focuses on economic indicators but also has a comprehensive outreach of the pillars that cover major developable areas (Globocnik et al. 2019; Nodehi and Taghvaee 2021b; Taghvaee et al. 2021a, b, c). In doing this, SDGs provide a platform to implement the Triple Helix model, which considers three main actors of Economy, Environment, and Social (or health) (Mohanty and Behera 2020). These platforms are assumed to be inherently related and have a potentially significant effect on global sustainability (Campagnolo et al. 2018; Fanghella et al. 2016; Glavič and Lukman 2007; Luengo-Valderrey et al. 2020; Nodehi and Taghvaee 2022; Purvis et al. 2019; Taghvaee et al. 2017a, b, c). Yet, it is not well defined whether globalization and openness, as a result of the UN platform of the SDGs for 2030, support global sustainability or are against it (Amin et al. 2021).Footnote 1 Many studies, such as (Blanco & Ram 2019; Nodehi et al. 2021; Shirazi et al. 2020; Štreimikienė and Kačerauskas 2020; Taghvaee et al. 2017a, b, c; Taghvaee et al. 2021a, b, c; Tremblay et al. 2020; Umar et al. 2020), argue that globalization has a constructive role in the global sustainable development at the mercy of advancement in transportation, communication, and international relations. Nonetheless, in its basis, such arguments pave the way to make full use of comparative advantageous (based on David Ricardo’s law of comparative advantage) (Xu et al. 2020). Many researchers, however, believe that globalization and openness (that represents free trade policies) are destructive in case of environmental and social development, referring to the Kuznets Hypothesis that supports economic development, arguing, openness decreases the income inequalities by widening the gap between the developed and developing countries (Blanco & Ram 2019; Hanif et al. 2020). According to such concepts, income inequality increases at the earlier stage of economic development while it decreases at the later stages. Precisely, the same nexus exists in environmental development, as discussed by the Environmental Kuznets Hypothesis. Following this hypothesis, the environment degrades at the first phase of economic development (arguably in developing economies), whereas it improves at the later phase of economic development (as in developed countries) (Ali et al. 2020; Behera and Pozhamkandath Karthiayani 2021; Boutabba et al. 2018; Elshimy and El-Aasar 2020; Fong et al. 2020; Moutinho et al. 2020; Taghvaee and Parsa 2015; Zhang 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). Furthermore, globalization and openness have different environmental concomitants in developing and developed countries regarding Pollution Heaven Hypothesis. For instance, the developed countries, due to their stringent environmental regulations, accumulate and reallocate their polluting investments in the developing countries for the lax environmental regulations, inexpensive labor, tax cuts, and low production costs (Omri et al. 2019; Youssef et al. 2020). According to these blatant contradictions, many countries like North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran rely only on their own internal drivers of sustainability as they follow place-based governance rather than flow-based governance (Xu et al. 2020). Thus, it is notoriously vague if globalization and openness coincide with global sustainable development or not. To answer this question, this study aims to estimate regional sustainability elasticities to show if sustainability has a synergetic or trade-off character. This character shows whether globalization and openness are consistent with global sustainability. In this manner, our research estimates and compares the effects of each sustainable development pillar of social, environment, and economy, in global regions and their potential spillover effectsFootnote 2 on each other. To do this, our research maps the spillover effects of sustainable development in the globe by defining an index to measure the sustainable development spillover effects among various regions of the world, namely: 1. North America, 2. Latin America and Caribbean, 3. European Union, 4. Sub-Saharan Africa, 5. North Africa and Middle East (MENA), and finally 6. Pacific and East Asia. Our methodology follows (Nodehi et al. 2021; Taghvaee et al. 2021a, b, c) to measure the index of sustainability elasticities by employing the SEY model, including simultaneous equations system, Vector Autoregressive (VAR), and Granger causality models within 1971–2016. In a systematic analysis, using synergetic elasticities of sustainable development, this study acknowledges spillover effects (or peace and partnership) as the 4th pillar of sustainable development (or sustainability) to introduce the concept of Integrated Sustainability. This concept is a tool to answer the question of the study.",13

Saiful Islam,Masayuki Sato,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Bangladesh is an agrarian country with more than 61.82% of the population residing in rural areas (Statista 2020) and whose primary occupation is agriculture. As a key economic sector, agriculture continues to be the mainstay of rural livelihoods, contributing to nearly 13.29% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) (BBS 2021) as 38.30% of the labor force is engaged in this sector (World Bank 2019). However, due to global warming, Bangladesh is experiencing disastrous weather extremes (IPCC 2011a, IPCC 2011b). For instance, the recent cyclones, Cyclone Fani in 2019, Super Cyclone Amphan in 2020, and Cyclone Yaas in 2021, are evidence of extreme weather events. Being one of the prime hot spots for climatic extremesFootnote 1 and catastrophes in the world, the country suffers from severe household income loss and subsequent deficiency in household expenditure (Dasgupta et al. 2009; 2010). For example, owing to climatic extremes, the country is expected to continue to lose 2% of its GDP annually; even worse, it is anticipated that this annual loss will have increased to approximately 17% by 2050 (The Daily Star 2021). Cyclones, droughts, and floods are recursive in nature and the economic burden due to these extreme climatic events is enormous (Nino et al. 2003; Khandker 2007; Sarker et al. 2012). In addition, climate change and variability cause fluctuations and significantly intensifies extreme climatic events when they occur (IPCC 2011a, b and Khan and Rahman 2007), which leads to an increase in income losses over time. In their research, Bandyopadhyay and Skoufias (2015) pointed out that climate-induced precipitation variability influences employment via household income reduction, resulting in reduced household expenditure, particularly funds that would typically be set aside for purchasing food. In addition, climate change adversely affects the momentum of the food supply chain (FSC) (Godfray et al. 2010) and acts as a substantial buttress of food price hikes (Friel and Bradbear 2013). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) identified Bangladesh as one of the countries in the world that is severely vulnerable to issues related to climate change, extreme climatic events, and related anthropogenic hazards. In addition, the IPCC predicted that by 2100, the average global temperature will have increased from 1.8 to 4.0 °C affecting crop, livestock, and fisheries production. As a result, the number of people at risk of hunger may double by 2050. Despite not doing any harm to the environment related to climate change, poor people at the root level are the real sufferers (Pal 2010) (see Fig. 1). Climate variability and change increase the frequency and intensity of extreme events (Patwary 2016) that causes substantial damage to crops, livestock, and fisheries. Nonetheless, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty and hunger. And even, successfully achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Over the course of 15 years, Bangladesh achieved national food security, increasing annual rice production from 151 kg/capita in 1995 to 217 kg/capita in 2010 due to increases in irrigated areas and yields (Mainuddin and Kirby 2015). Financial loss due to extreme events for 2009–2014. Source: BBS 2015 (Bangladesh Disaster-related Statistics) Geographically, Bangladesh is a low-lying delta characterized by the confluence of three mighty rivers—the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna, which are crisscrossed by more than 200 rivers. Downstream riparian and extensive floodplains are salient morphological features of the state. In the south, the Bay of Bengal takes up almost 19 out of 64 administrative districts.Footnote 2 This hydro-meteorological complex situation makes the country vulnerable to an array of extreme climatic events such as cyclones, droughts, and floods (see Fig. 2). For instance, in 2007, Bangladesh experienced severe flooding from July to September, which severely impacted agricultural production. Furthermore, with little time to recover, the country was struck in the same year on November 15 by Cyclone Sidr, a mighty and deadly storm that devastated the southern coast of the country and took more than 3000 human lives. The estimated economic loss was over the US $1 billion, with the fallout from the storm continuing to increase even now. Extreme weather events have significant adverse effects on crop yield and result in food insecurity (Islam et al. 2022a and Chavez et al. 2015). Erratic weather conditions accompanied by weather extremes such as cyclones, droughts, and floods batter and raze people’s livelihoods repeatedly making them more difficult to support their households. To make matters worse, due to extreme events, Bangladesh has experienced soaring prices for basic commodities. Climate extremes areas of Bangladesh (MoEF 2008). Source: Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) Climate change will increase developing countries’ dependency on imports and accelerate existing food insecurity, especially in South Asia (Josef and Tubiello, 2007). More than one out of seven people still lack access to sufficient protein and energy resources to maintain a healthy diet and even more suffer from some form of micronutrient malnourishment (FAO 2009). Wheeler and Braun (2013) argued that climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk due to climate change (Kumar, et al. 2015), which causes short-term variability in supply. Moreover, climate variability (Kumar and Sharma 2013) and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently already vulnerable to hunger and nutritional deficiency. In India, Sharma and Singh (2018) conducted a study considering state-wise panel data and found that during Kharif and Rabi seasons climatic factors have a significant influence on the food security index (FSI). Additionally, they found that climate change may escalate food inequalities. Households need long-term strategies to adapt to these dynamic conditions to maintain their livelihoods, and food self-sufficiency remains a key development agenda for the country. Although this research aspect is important due to the long-term regional impacts of extreme climatic events, existing studies (Kumar et al. 2017; Sharma and Singh 2018; and Islam et al. 2022b) seldom analyze the impact of climate change and extreme climatic events on household expenditure. The novelty of this study is its contribution to the assessment of the effects of climatic disasters such as cyclones, floods, and droughts in Bangladesh. Specifically, in this paper, we seek answers to the question, “To what degree do climate change and climatic extremes influence household expenditure in the vulnerable areas of the country?” More specifically, to know the fact about household food expenditure, non-food expenditure (education and health, etc.) along with household total expenditure. Additionally, we wanted to explore the answer to the question “what is the country’s overall food security situation and the movements as well?” Based on the research questions placed here in the paper, the objectives are as follows: (a) to identify the effects of climate change and climatic extremes on household total expenditure; (b) to determine the impact of climate change and climatic extremes on household welfare aspects (education, health, and housing, etc.) as well as on household food expenditure; and (c) to assess the household food security movement over the years irrespective of vulnerable areas of the country. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. First, we focus on identifying the impacts of climate change and climatic extremes on household expenditure in Bangladesh, utilizing evidence from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS). Moreover, we reported some of catastrophic losses and damages from the recent past to understand the reality in the areas. The following section reviews the existing literature on climate change, extreme climatic events, and their effects on household income and expenditure to understand its significance and to monitor whether the present research problem (i.e., climate change and extreme climatic events) demands further attention. In the subsequent section, we elaborate on the materials and methods in which analytical procedures, variable measurements, variable definitions, data sources, and descriptive statistics are prioritized. After that, we present the empirical results of the analysis in detail. Finally, we conclude the discussion in light of the overall arguments and facts.",1
7.0,2.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,15 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-022-00252-9,Climate change and risk scenario in Bangladesh,June 2023,Mohammad Chhiddikur Rahman,Md Shajedur Rahaman,Md Maniruzzaman,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The impact of climate change is global anxiety for the human being. Increased global surface temperatures are affecting the occurrences of climate extreme events (WMO 2021). As average weather information for a certain place over a longer period (30 years, according to the World Meteorological Organization) is referred to as climate, the average temperatures, precipitation, and sunlight are all included in the climate change scenario description. Climate change is driven by natural phenomena (such as variations in lunar output/solar radiation or the earth's orbit, or natural internal climate systemFootnote 1 procedures) or by human activity, as stated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, United States of America. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mentioned that changes in climate events may occur because of human activities or natural erraticism (McCarthy et al. 2001). The adverse impacts of climate change and vulnerability have evolved as environmental and socioeconomic issues which are increasing the climate-related risks to people all over the world (Adu et al. 2018). An increase in temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels is playing a pivotal role in this regard. The global mean surface temperature during 2006–2015 was 0.87 °C higher than in 1850–1900. Global warming caused by humans is now growing at a rate of 0.2 °C each decade and many natural resources have already been degraded because of rising temperatures and CO2, which may become irreversible if the temperature increases over 1.5 °C (Tollefson 2018; Vo et al. 2021; Higano and Otsuka 2022). Increases in mean temperature in most land and ocean zones, hot extremes in most populated regions, excessive precipitation in many regions, and the likelihood of drought and precipitation deficiencies in some regions are only a few examples of these variations (Ramamasy and Baas 2007; Huq and Ayers 2008; Seneviratne et al. 2012). Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts (Huq and Ayers 2008). The topography and climate change have made the country exposed to different climate hazards (MoP and ADB 2021). Bangladesh suffers from floods, droughts, cyclones, tidal surges, tornadoes, earthquakes, infrastructure collapse, waterlogging, river erosion, water and soil salinity, epidemic, pollution, etc. (BBS 2016). Therefore, the livelihood of the community is already under intense pressure due to natural calamities. Climate-induced hazards threaten the momentum of development and the survival and future of the majority of the country’s vulnerable population. Besides, the vulnerable community can suffer from climate change-induced food security concerning rice production (Kabir et al. 2021; Rahman et al. 2020a, b; Islam et al. 2020). Many pieces of research recognized vulnerability in agriculture, fisheries, and aquaculture (Rahman et al. 2021; Haque et al. 2017; Rahman et al. 2015a, b; Allison et al. 2009) because there would be severe flooding, occasional seasonal droughts, and loss of arable land that would be resulting in reduced rice production by 3.9% each year during 2005–2050 (World Bank 2010). However, Bangladesh took these warnings seriously to develop stress-tolerant rice varieties targeting the stress-prone ecosystems. As a result, rice production increased by 2.84% per year during 1971–2020 (Al Mamun et al. 2021; Rahman et al. 2021). Moreover, climate change is expected to reduce agricultural GDP in Bangladesh by 3.1% each year and would be amounted to $36 billion during 2005–2050 (Huq et al. 2010). The studies in the literature that addressed the economic impact of climate change mostly employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to assess the socioeconomic vulnerability. For example, Adu et al. (2018) assessed the maize farmers’ household vulnerability using LVI. The study used primary data on generating the results. Their study concluded that Wenchi municipality was more vulnerable to climate change than Techiman municipality. Relatively unavailability of natural water, higher dependency ratio, lower social network, insecure health status, bad quality of foods, etc. were the cause of higher vulnerability in the Wenchi municipality. The farmers’ perception of climate change in Nigeria has been analyzed by Falaki et al. (2013). They used the regression models and found that 71.9% of farmers seeming an upsurge in air temperature. The rainy season overall precipitation amount in 5-year period exposed a steady drop in rainfall amount in July. The Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) was used by Pandey and Jha (2012) to assess the climate change vulnerability in different villages of India. Raju et al. (2018) identified that per capita income, population density, percentage of literacy rate, and livestock population are the major drivers of the overall livelihood vulnerability in different districts of Karnataka, India. The multidimensional livelihood vulnerability in Nepal has been assessed by Gerlitz et al. (2017). The results of the study showed that 96% of the people were multidimensionality exposed to climate change. In the Eastern Brahmaputra sub-basin, the most vulnerable was Lakhimpur among the surveyed districts, while it was Chitra in the Upper Indus sub-basin. Sujakhu et al. (2019) highlighted the indigenous people of Nepal and found that engagement in multi-income generating activities reduces household vulnerability. In the context of Bangladesh, Ahmed et al. (2021) assessed the climate change risk perception of the vulnerable char farms in the Gaibandha district. The findings of the study reveal that most of the char residents belong to medium to high perception index values and few have belonged to low and medium values. Hoq et al. (2021) assessed the livelihood vulnerability of the flood-prone haor basin in Bangladesh. They found that access to roads and transport may be a major issue that would lessen vulnerability in the haor area. Therefore, they emphasize developing a strategy for minimizing vulnerability in the haor areas of Bangladesh by launching a better road network. Mudasser et al. (2020) estimated the livelihood vulnerability of the coastal belt of Bangladesh. The flood risk of the southeast part of Bangladesh has been assessed by Brouwer et al. (2007). Mondal et al. (2020) assessed the flood risk of the Teesta River basin in Bangladesh. Sarker et al. (2020) mentioned that several local adaptation plans are adopted by char inhabitants in the aspect of climate change effects that improved their livelihood resilience. The study also exposes that homestead gardening, altering cropping patterns, tree plantation, and migration are the most communal approaches adopted by char residents. Flood is Bangladesh’s most common and frequent natural hazard. It has a great impact on the economy of the country. The following are the economic costs of the country’s four “extreme” floods: 600 million U. S. dollars in 1974, 2.2 billion U.S. dollars each in 1987 and 1988, and 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. Flood damage in 1987 and 1988 dropped the country's GDP by roughly 4%, and flood damage in 1998 reduced it by about 6% (Banerjee 2010). The flood in 2007, damaged the crops worth value 84.4 million U.S. dollars (Rana and Islam 2015). Besides flood, cyclone affects Bangladesh severely. Cyclone damages in three ways storm surge, flooding, and wind. Cyclone Sidr in 2007 caused damage to the agriculture, manufacturing, household, and social sectors that valued at 373 million U.S. dollars, and had an impact the on reduction of DGP by 0.5% (GoB 2008). In 2020, the super cyclone Amphan affected about 10 million people, and the damage valued worth 131 million U.S. dollars (Kabir et al. 2020). Out of 64, 19 districts of Bangladesh are affected by salinity, where about 7 million people live (Rahman et al. 2015a, b). The soil salinity would reduce agricultural productivity by 15.6% and the income of the rice producers may decrease by 7–10% in the coastal belt of Bangladesh if no new adaptation technology is invented (Dasgupta et al. 2014). The above-stated literature sowed that most of the studies mainly identified the livelihood vulnerability, risk, and socioeconomic impacts of the specific climate change events in the pocket areas of a specific country. None of the studies included a whole country and considered all the climate hazards to assess a country’s climate change risk. As Bangladesh is vulnerable to multiple climate extremes, it needs a holistic approach to get the location-specific climate risk status to suggest specific options to alleviate the climate change risk. It would help to investigate the vulnerability of the areas, which are more at risk of climate change and also could be able to figure out the local adaptation options for mitigating the risks. Therefore, this study attempted to estimate the level of climate risk in the 64 districts of Bangladesh and categorized them according to the intensity of risk considering the value of losses, affected households, and hazard-induced sickness and injury. Prior to that, this study showed the climate change scenario of Bangladesh using long-term climate parameters. The study used historical and nationally representative data to the appropriate tools and techniques to represent the scenario of climate change and its risk in Bangladesh. The following is how the rest of the article is structured. Section 2 discusses the data source and description, the econometric method used for empirical estimation of climate change scenario, and the intensity of risk. Section 3 describes the empirical findings, which include an empirical assessment of climate change in Bangladesh and the intensity of climate risk in its 64 districts. Section 4 presented a discussion of the findings. Section 5 outlines the climate-vulnerable communities' adopted adaptation techniques and Sect. 6 concludes the article.",1

The little change in daily weather phenomena like rainfall, humidity, and temperature can bring significant changes in agricultural production, daily economic activities, and human health, which affect poverty and the overall well-being at the household and regional levels (Füssel and Klein 2006; Lee et al. 2016; Panda 2012). Moreover, the social and economic vulnerability to climate change is context-dependent and a changing phenomenon (Kasperson and Kasperson 2005). It has been well acknowledged that a particular region’s environmental, social, economic, institutional capabilities, and political stability determine climate change vulnerability. More specifically, climate change vulnerabilityFootnote 2 results from multi-dimensional societal phenomena of specific places at specific times. From a social and economic point of view, Brooks et al. (2005) argued that vulnerability is also associated with people or a particular region’s ability or inability to recover from livelihoods and well-being stress, which is produced by climate change or variability. Whereas IPCC (2001) looked at vulnerability from the perspective of climatic exposure, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity; it mentioned that “vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with the adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity”. After analysing the above vulnerability definitions, it has been found that vulnerability is context and region specific. Further, in the context of rural regions, the changing climatic component has a direct impact on the region-specific agro-ecosystem and the related economy, which has been creating numerous difficulties, including livestock losses, food insecurities and hikes in food prices, impacting rural health, livelihood losses, accessibility of natural resources and institutional facility, inter-group conflicts (Das et al. 2020). Figure 1 shows the complex dynamics of rural social and economic vulnerabilities and how they relate to other associated phenomena in the context of changing climate. Source: Prepared by the researcher based on the literature review and field survey, 2018 Interrelationship between climate change and socio-economic vulnerabilities in the rural area. In India, from the existing literature, it has been found that majority of the climate change vulnerability studies are model-based, notably in the field of public health, economic growth, and agricultural production (Dasgupta et al. 2013; Fischer and Chhatre 2016; Pandey and Jha 2012). These model-based studies lack the bottom–up effects of climate change on rural livelihood vulnerabilities. There are fewer studies about establishing the link between regional inquiries of rural livelihoods and vulnerabilities to climate changes in IndiaFootnote 3 based on primary field surveys using the index-based methodology. It has been found that intensive empirical research is needed to shape a suitable policy to deal with climate vulnerabilities Chaliha et al. (2011). Therefore, the present study explores the regional patterns of socio-economic vulnerabilities in the sub-Himalayan West Bengal. What factors are the main contributors to the regional rural vulnerability in the same geographic area? Specifically, why and how is one region different from others regarding vulnerability in the same geographical space? To assess the regional patterns of vulnerability, we have developed a socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) to climate change as an assessment tool, mainly focusing on the Himalayan foothills of West Bengal. Moreover, the study would create comprehensive empirical knowledge for scholars and policymakers about the dynamics of vulnerability in the Himalayan foothills of West Bengal.",1

These regional distributions of the river system have more impacts on the downstream part and causes of higher erosion vulnerability, especially large river network system-based deltaic parts. In this regard, Bangladesh is one of the largest deltas where Padma, Meghna, Jamuna and Brahmaputra are the main rivers entering from the northern side of the country and flow toward the Bay of Bengal to the south. The most common natural and hydrometeorological events are flash floods, typhoon floods, droughts, earthquakes, cyclones, hurricanes, landslides, and riverbank erosion, which cause extensive damage to properties and human lives (Du et al. 2013). Bangladesh also faces natural disasters (floods, cyclones, storm surges, droughts, salinity intrusions and riverbank erosion) every year. Of the disasters, riverbank erosion is one of the foremost natural disasters responsible for the poverty of the people living near the river catchment area (Khan et al. 2014). Especially in the monsoon or rainy season, riverbank erosion becomes vigorous. Because of the global climate change, sea levels are rising and erosion is also increasing in Bangladesh, especially during monsoon time, while water discharge is very high from upstream to downstream. Khan et al (2014) has reported that about 607 km2 riverbank has been eroded from1973 to 2014 on both sides of the Jamuna River system. Rashid et al (2021) reported that the thalweg of Jamuna River is shifting continuously from one position to another and affecting human life and socio-economic condition of the related population by eroding massive landmass. Coleman (1969) reported that Jamuna River has migration of about 10 km westward between 150 years. There are many deltas in the world, but they are not erosion prone as the Bengal delta. The most dynamic process in the landscape that causes geomorphological changes in the river courses during flood plain development is riverbank erosion (Hooke 1979). The most recognized phenomena of riverbank erosion are loss of human settlement, precious land, and urban centers (Deb and Ferreira 2015; Pahlowan and Hossain 2015). As human lives are closely related to the rivers in Bangladesh, their livelihood is mostly affected by the dynamic process of the river. Several studies have been conducted related to cyclones, floods, flash floods, and riverbank erosion covering different areas of Bangladesh (Khan 1991; Khan et al. 2014; Shamsuzzoha et al. 2021; Islam et al. 2022). Rahman and Gain (2020) applied the survey method to assess the adaptation to riverbank erosion in the southern part of Bangladesh. Rahman and Gain (2020) applied the survey method to assess the adaptation to riverbank erosion in the southern portion of Bangladesh. They suggested that people near the erosion-prone riverbank areas are affected socially, economically, and culturally, affecting their lives. Rahman (2010) described the physical environmental conditions focusing on the socio-demographic profile of the victims of riverbank erosion in Jamuna flood plain area. Tha et al. (2022) used different indices to detect riverbank erosion and identify riverbank erosion hotspots along the Mekong River in Cambodia. However, there is a lack of research on vulnerability assessment and land use planning for large delta systems considering multiple criteria. Multi-criteria decision system considers several criteria which are highly influential for assessing vulnerability. Therefore, assessment of the vulnerability for estimating river erosion impact on livelihoods in riverine basin is highly required to project yearly losses, especially Jamuna River which carries large amount of water from upstream. In this regard, it is important to map the river erosion vulnerability using influential multiple criteria in spatial and time scales. Satellite remote sensing can be used for the spatial mapping and time scale to project the vulnerability in the single river basins, whereas multi-criteria considering climate change, land planning, distance and geographical extent can be used for modeling to estimate the erosion hazard. Recently, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method has become a very familiar approach for suitability and vulnerability analysis, as it has significant advantages when used with GIS that supports the decision-making process in a systematic way. It also provides a transparent reflection of this decision using thematic maps (Ferretti and Pomarico 2013). This multidisciplinary approach is a very powerful integrated method in complex land use scenarios (Saleh et al. 2015), and it has been used in diversified fields in spatial analysis for land use analysis (Hossain et al. 2009; Ferreti and Pomarico 2012; Hassan and Nazem 2016). Traditional methods can be applied to determine the degree of suitability and vulnerability in any aspect, but they are very difficult and time consuming (Frazier and Page 2000). In recent decades, geographic information systems (GIS) and satellite remote sensing (RS) tools have been suggested to be very effective and have attracted considerable attention in the field of suitability and vulnerability assessment (Tehrany et al. 2014; Khosravi et al. 2016). Many studies using MCDA have been conducted for land suitability assessment, industrial development, different crop production, and flooding hotspot identification (Muhsin et al. 2018; Purnamasari et al. 2019; Habibie et al. 2021; Meshram et al. 2022a, b, c). Meshram et al (2022a, b, c) applied the fuzzy MCDM approach for prioritizing watersheds in terms of soil erosion in Narmada basin, and fuzzy-based multi-criteria method for soil erosion vulnerability assessment in Gusru Watershed, India (Meshram et al. 2022a, b, c). However, studies related to riverbank erodibility analysis are very limited. There are many methods, such as the frequency ratio (FR) model (Lee et al. 2012), artificial neural network (ANN) (Kia et al. 2012), analytical hierarchy process (AHP) (Chen et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2020) and logistic regression (logit) model, which are commonly used in combination with geospatial data for suitability and vulnerability mapping (Pradhan 2010). For this analysis, AHP and fuzzy inference systems were used to establish the weights for different criteria, and aggregation was performed in ArcMap (Rikalovic et al. 2015). This system is useful for analyzing the vector-based polygon database. Hachol et al. (2017) used the AHP approach for assessing river training works and compared it with other methods to estimate flood risk. Shinshaw et al. (2021) used fuzzy logic and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for the prioritization of potential soil erosion susceptibility regions in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Erosion-prone riverbanks are common problems in many parts of the world and require a potential solution for land use planning from historical and climate information. In addition to the knowledge from the fields and geospatial variability of river courses over the time periods, in this regard, fuzzy inference systems (FISs) and analytical hierarchy processes (AHPs) with time series remote sensing datasets can be employed for erosion vulnerability assessments in riverine and deltaic regions to face the challenges of climate change. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to develop an erosion vulnerability map through MCDA by applying a fuzzy expert system, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and satellite remote sensing datasets.",1

Tsusaka,Avishek Datta,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Climate variability affects food security by contributing 60% of yield variability around the world (Matiu et al. 2017). Climate change in the forms of rising temperature and unpredicted rainfall is expected to adversely affect agricultural production including rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Kumar and Sharma 2013; Marambe et al. 2014; Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment 2016; Rahman et al. 2017; Jayawardena et al. 2018). Each crop exhibits a specific range of optimal temperature and rainfall during the growth stages to maximize its yields (Mohanty et al. 2013; Chowdhury and Khan 2015). Variation in temperature may cause shortened duration of the growing phase, rice flower sterility, and pest and disease outbreaks. On the other hand, rainfall fluctuation as characterized by drought, flood, and erratic rainfall patterns significantly diminishes crop yields (Marambe et al. 2014; Esham et al. 2018). Thus, climate change is a major cause of crop failures, poverty, and food insecurity (Kumar and Sharma 2013; Marambe et al. 2014; Esham et al. 2018). The sensitivity of crop yields to phase-specific temperature and rainfall varies geographically (Gourdji et al. 2013; Ahmad et al. 2021). If climate variability continues to increase, there is a need to understand the responses of paddy yields to changes in temperature and rainfall at the macroeconomic scale to inform policies geared towards sustainable development (Gumel et al. 2017; Matiu et al. 2017). According to the Global Climate Risk Index 2017, Sri Lanka was considered as one of the countries mostly affected by climate change (Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment 2016; Eckstein et al. 2018). Sri Lanka is an island located in the tropical zone of the Indian Ocean, frequently affected by climatic events (Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment 2016). The agricultural sector contributed 7% to the Gross Domestic Product in 2020 (Central Bank of Sri Lanka 2020) and utilized 45.5% of the total land area (World Bank 2022), and 25.1% of the national workforce (Department of Census and Statistics 2020), catered to nearly 80% of the domestic food requirements and generated 70% of the income for rural population (Institute of Policy Studies 2015). Among various crops, paddy accounts for the largest crop area and is the main staple in the Sri Lankan cuisine, produced across various agroecological landscapes of the country. Sri Lanka is nearly self-sufficient in rice consumption, and paddy contributed 0.8% to the Gross Domestic Product in 2020 (Central Bank of Sri Lanka 2020). Besides paddy, Sri Lanka is well known for its production of tea, rubber, coconut, and fruits (Thibbotuwawa and Hirimuthugodage 2015). Global warming and climate variability affect the hydrological cycle and the irrigation demand in crop production (Kamruzzaman et al. 2020), whilst the weather patterns exhibit spatiotemporal variations (Gourdji et al. 2013; Ahmad et al. 2021). Further, climate impacts on crop yields differ by water supply systems (FAO 1997; Tsusaka and Otsuka 2013a) and the growth phase of the plant (Yoshida 1981; Ahmad et al. 2021). Although literature is loaded with assessment of climate change impacts on agriculture globally, limited studies have disaggregated such impacts by plant growth phase, crop season, water supply system, and climatic zone. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the effects of key climatic variables (i.e., temperature and rainfall), capturing both endowments and changes, on paddy yields in different spatial (climatic zones and water regimes) and temporal (crop seasons and plant growth phases) spheres in Sri Lanka. The output of this study provides policy makers research-based evidence in formulating climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector of Sri Lanka and beyond.",3

Singh,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Climate change is a crucial issue in today’s era of economic development, which is negatively impacting the livelihood security of people in developing and developed economies of the world (Uleberg et al. 2014; Ahsan et al. 2020; Singh and Jyoti 2021; Pickson et al. 2020; Aliyari et al. 2021). The fluctuations in weather patterns, temperatures, meteorological and evaporating glaciers and rainstorms are familiar examples of climate change (Guntukula and Goyari 2020; Chandio et al. 2021, 2022; Warsame et al. 2021). It results from excessive human involvement on the planet, particularly in the present era (Hossain et al. 2018). It is more pronounced in developing countries (Warsame et al. 2021; Ikehi et al. 2022).
 The changes in the climatic variables have a high association with the country’s social and economic development and contribute explicitly to the development of the agriculture sector of the economy. The agriculture sector is highly vulnerable and sensitive due to climatic change (Chandio et al. 2021; Warsame et al. 2021). It has created significant challenges to the farm production sector as crop production largely depends upon climate change variability, which may have substantial implications for sustainable livelihood security. Rainfall, temperature, and ecological exposures are assumed to be crucial for the productivity of many crops (Chandio et al. 2021; Gul et al. 2022). Frequent climate changes may severely affect precipitation, temperature and ecological-sensitive crops such as rice, wheat and sugarcane (Baig et al. 2021). However, the impact of temperature, rainfall, precipitation and carbon emission varies according to the crop and geographical location (Malhi et al. 2021). Singh and Jyoti (2021) found that rising temperature and rainfall may reduce crop yield, while moderate temperature and precipitation may be helpful to increase crop yield. Further changes in the climatic variables help farmers to select an appropriate crop for cultivation in a specific geographical region. However, the adverse climatic effect of extreme temperature, excessive rainfall, and carbon emission have severe implications in developing countries (Mendelsohn 2009; Ozdemir 2022), such as India, due to their high dependency of the population on agriculture and natural resources. Kumar et al. (2021) noted that around 43.2 percent population in India directly or indirectly earns their livelihood sources from the agriculture sector. It also has the second largest population globally; thus, population pressure on agriculture is higher than on other economic sectors. Further, it is anticipated that by 2050, India will have the highest population in the world (Kumar et al. 2021). Subsequently, it is expected that the agricultural sector will face more challenges in India in the near future. Besides, India’s limited cultivatable land (about 40 percent) comes under secure irrigation. Most of the arable area depends on rainfall and its variability (Krishna Kumar et al. 2004; Cagliarini and Rush 2011). Many studies have shown that Indian farmers have a lower economic capacity with little technical progress than developed countries’ farmers to deal with climatic events. There are many reasons for the small size of land holdings, the rising cost of cultivation, low literacy of farmers, technological backwardness, insignificant support from financial organizations and government for farmers, low support of agricultural cooperative societies, poor research and development structure of the agricultural sector and low Agri-entrepreneurial opportunities which would increase more vulnerability of this sector in future. In addition, Indian farmers cannot apply adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Kumar et al. (2016) claimed that India would experience a substantial loss in agricultural production due to climate change. Specifically, India will experience two-thirds of the total losses of agricultural production due to climate change in Asian countries as it has a large share in the net revenues of the crop (Mendelsohn 2014). Himachal Pradesh (Province) is a hilly state located in the northern part of the country. It is bordered by Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand (see Fig. 1). The state is highly susceptible to climatic variables such as water scarcity, landslides, rainstorms, glacial lake outbursts, floods and anthropogenic activities (Agrawal et al. 2019). Himachal Pradesh is at the latitude of 30° 22′ 40″ N to 33° 12′ 40″ N, and longitude of 75° 45′ 55″ E to 79° 04′ 20″ E. The elevation of the state ranges from 350 to 7000 m from the sea level (Jaswal et al. 2015). The state’s total geographical area is around 55,673 sq. km. (see Fig. 1) and just 10 percent area comes under cultivable land (State Centre on Climate Change, 2020). Figure 2 describes the state’s total food grain area and production from 1990–91 to 2020–21. It shows a declining trend in the total food grain cropped area from 900 (000 hectares) in 1990–91 to 763.4 (000 hectares) in 2020–21. However, total food grain production has shown fluctuation over the period. It ranged from 1017.2 (000 tonnes) in 2009–10 to 1740 (000 tonnes) in 2016–17.

Source: Author’s Estimation Total area and production of food grain crops in Himachal Pradesh. The state is divided into four agro-climatic zones: Shivalik hill zone, Mid-hill zone, High hill zone and Cold, dry zone. Each zone gives information about the area in sq. km. (% of total area), elevation (M), mean annual temperature (C), soil type, rainfall (mm), and type of crop produced (Department of Agriculture, Government of Himachal Pradesh, 2022). Details of each agro-climatic zone are provided in Table 1. Wheat, maize and rice are the three major crops cultivated in the state. More than 80 percent area is used for cultivation of these crops in the state (see Fig. 3). The wheat and maize area sown were 41.18 and 34.84 percent of total food grains in 1990–91, which further increased to 43.53 and 39.15 percent in 2018–19, respectively. The area under rice crop decreased to 9.77 percent in 2018–19 from 9.84 percent in 1990–91(See Fig. 3). Figure 4 indicates the production of wheat, maize, rice, and gram in Himachal Pradesh. It shows that out of the total food grains production, 90 percent and above come from wheat, maize, and rice. During 1990–91, the production of maize and rice was around 43.49 and 7.40 percent of total food grains, and it has increased to 45.56 and 8.67 percent, respectively, during the last 28 years. Wheat production has shown a slightly declining trend during the mentioned period. It declined to 40.33 percent in 2018–19 from 41.79 percent in 1990–91. It indicates that any variability in the production of wheat, maize and rice crops would severely impact food security, livelihood security, nutritional security, the income of the farming communities, price instability of food grain products and developmental policies in the state. As a result, it may harm the growth of the state economy. Source: Author’s Estimation Area sown of food grain crops in Himachal Pradesh. Area sown of different crops is shown as a percentage of total food grain area. Source: Author’s Estimation Production of food grain crop in Himachal Pradesh. Production of different crops is shown as a percentage of total food grain production. The state economy has experienced a structural transformation from agriculture to industry and industry to service; however, the importance of the agriculture sector has not declined. The agricultural sector remained the main occupation of the people and provides a source of livelihood security for 63 percent population of the state (Kumar and Pattanaik 2018). Agriculture and allied activities contribute to the state’s gross state domestic product is around 9.50 percent (Economic Survey, GoHP, 2022–23). The agriculture production (about 80 percent of the total cultivated area) in the state largely depends upon rainfall due to limited irrigation facilities (State Centre on Climate Change, 2020; GoHP, 2020–21). However, the net irrigated area in the state has shown an upward trend over the period. It has grown from 103,640 hectares in 2005–06 to 119,517 hectares in 2015–16 (See Fig. 5). The net irrigated area in the state was around 114,381 hectares in 2016–17, out of which canal, tanks, and wells and tube-wells contribution is 2.92, 0.18, and 23.39 percent, respectively (See Fig. 6). The comparative picture of Himachal Pradesh in terms of gross irrigated area, gross sown area, net irrigated area, net sown area, and cropping intensity has been provided in the Appendix (See Fig. 11 to Fig. 15).

Irrigation is shown as a percentage of net irrigated area of the state. Looking at the past literature on climate change and its impact on agriculture, it has been found that the existing studies are mainly focused on their investigation at the international level (e.g., Mendelsohn 2014; Malhi et al. 2021; Ali et al. 2021; Gul et al. 2022) and national level (Singh and Jyoti 2021). Some studies have explored the same issues for the major states of India (Saravanakumar 2015; Guntukula and Goyari 2020; Kumar and Upadhyay 2019; Singh and Jyoti 2021; Singh et al. 2022). Few studies have explored the impact of climate change on yield, production, and cropped area of food grain for a small state like Himachal Pradesh (Rana et al. 2011; Kondal et al. 2011; Ahlawat and Kaur 2015; Sharma et al. 2020). Thus, examining the impact of climatic factors on the major food grain crops in Himachal Pradesh would be significant in academic research. It is a micro-level study that is helpful for policymakers to develop climatic policy action at the state level. Since the climatic and geographical conditions of Himachal Pradesh are significantly different from the other Indian state. Therefore, the results of this study attract the attention of agriculture scientists, climatologists and regional and national policymakers to adopt a separate or specific policy for the individual crop to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change in farming. Consequently, this study would provide an appropriate research gap for the researchers. The validity of empirical findings can be checked through a primary survey of state food grain and cash crop growers. The study’s specific objectives are (i) to examine the influence of climatic factors on yield, production, and cropped area of food grain crops; (ii) to determine the nature of yield, production, and area sown function of food grain to climatic factors; (iii) to explore the expected yield, production and cropped area of food grain. The article is structured into five sections, including the introduction. The literature review has been provided in the second section. Data sources and estimation methods are discussed in the third section of the manuscript. The fourth section discusses the result and discussion, followed by the summary and conclusion.",3

According to World Bank estimates, in the areas affected by desertification the annual foregone income sometimes amounts to US $ 2.4 billion each year (Williams 2011). Desertification has caused negative impact on the provisioning of ecosystem services, specifically in terms of the production of food and fodder. It has also resulted in groundwater depletion linked to over extraction, reduced crop yields due to sandblasting, wind erosion, frequent dust storms, siltation of reservoirs, loss of biodiversity, increased multidimensional poverty, food insecurity, migrations, malnourishment, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and reduction in efficiency of energy generation of solar panels (IPCC 2019; Williams 2011). Also, cyclical droughts have been cited as a consequence of land desertification (Karmaoui 2019). Although human-induced pressure, such as grazing density and land use changes, intensifies the impacts of climate change that in turn accelerates desertification (Karmaoui 2019), the human societies living in the drylands are the ones to suffer the most due to desertification, as their livelihoods are dependent on the land’s productivity. When poor people do not have access to resource substitutes, they would be left with no choice but to deplete the natural resources at hand, and thus they continue to be a part of the ‘vicious circle’ that links poverty to population growth, which in turn leads to drought and land degradation (Low 2013). Particular groups in society are impacted more in comparison to other groups, due to insufficient entitlements that lead one to cope with socio-economic and environmental hazards. Entitlements are defined as “the set of alternative commodity bundles that a person can command in a society using the totality of rights and obligations that he or she faces” [7, p. 14]. Endowments, on the other hand, are the resources owned by an individual, and endowments constitute entitlements. An individuals’ abilities are influenced by his/her capabilities, which are generated by his/her entitlements. Poor people mostly live on the degraded lands and by having lesser number of entitlements become usually vulnerable to the vagaries of climate-induced changes. Scarcity of water has been flagged up as the major issue in the arid regions of the world, which is triggered by the overuse of agricultural and human water use in those regions. Similarly, soil and water components of the ecosystems in drylands remain threatened. Soil erosion, another impact of desertification, leads to topsoil removal, leading to siltation of reservoir (Williams 2011). The impacts of desertification on the vital soil and water resources, in turn, impact the socio-economic conditions of the dryland population (Karmaoui 2019). Agro-pastrolist households in the arid regions of the developing countries are most affected by the vagaries of climate shocks; however, very few studies have been conducted to assess the adaptation and vulnerability of such households (Lemmen and Warren 2004). Similarly, no such study has been conducted at household level in the drylands of South Punjab, and this study aims to fill this gap in literature and share the perceptions regarding the impacts of desertification that the locals, residing in these drylands, witnessed. The current study aims to highlight the impacts of desertification on the human health, livestock and food security of the study area and to identify, district-wise, the greatest impact of desertification (among the impacts on human, financial, animals and environment). It also aims to explore how these impacts affect the overall adaptive capacity of the locals.",2

Droughts could be investigated from different perspectives: (a) meteorological, (b) agricultural, (c) hydrological, and (d) socioeconomic. Meteorological drought reduces precipitation, agricultural drought reduces soil moisture, hydrological drought increases runoff and reduces water storage, and socioeconomic drought reduces water supply and demand in a region. All types of droughts have an impact on the environment, agriculture, and society (Wilhite and Glantz 1985; Wilhite 2000; Dai 2011; Zhang et al. 2022). The impact of drought on the agriculture sector is nearly 82% greater than that on other sectors, at only 18%. Drought causes more than 34% of crop and animal production losses in the least developed countries (LDCs) as well as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (FAO 2021). Asia is the most vulnerable region, with a drought loss of approximately 49 billion USD, followed by Africa at 30 billion USD and Latin America and the Caribbean at 29 billion USD. Therefore, agricultural drought assessment indicates an increase in drought occurrence from spring to summer, which is the typical time for agricultural and vineyard growth (Meng et al. 2017; Spinoni et al. 2018; Arab et al. 2020). Drought assessments in vineyards are essential because grapevines are one of the most sensitive fruits in the world and are susceptible to water stress. During the summer, when high evapotranspiration is combined with extremely low precipitation, grapevines suffer severe growing issues. Different methods have been used for drought assessment and monitoring around the world, including (1) in situ measurements and (2) remote sensing-based observations. In situ agricultural drought monitoring is the most relevant and historic (Maes and Steppe 2012; Ford and Quiring 2019). They are based on ground measurements of hydroclimatic variables (precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, soil water content, vegetation, and others) obtained from climatic, agricultural, and hydrologic stations and can provide quantitative and qualitative information over a given area of interest (Kanellou et al. 2008). Most drought assessments require precipitation information; however, many parts of the world have insufficient rain-gauge networks (Anderson et al. 2011). In this case, satellite remote sensing spatial and temporal scenes (Landsat 8 OLI, 30 m resolution, 15-day interval; MODIS 250 m, 16-day interval; and Sentinel 2 m resolution, 10-day interval; JAXA and CHIRPS rainfall) have the potential to capture the spectral signature of the soil surface and canopy information for drought assessment, particularly in the red, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal spectral bands. Since 1999, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Climate Hazard Center (CHC) have been developing CHIRS datasets at the University of California to produce long-term rainfall maps all around the world, particularly in areas where ground data are scarce. CHIRS has a long-term precipitation record from 1981 to the present (Funk et al. 2015). The application of remote sensing and CHIRPS in agricultural drought assessment is based on the notion that drought can influence soil and vegetation biophysical and chemical parameters of soil, soil moisture, organic matter, vegetation biomass, chlorophyll, canopy and soil temperature (Anjum et al. 2011; Shahzaman et al. 2021; Arab et al. 2022). Drought can cause a decline in vegetation vigor that is detectable via satellite. Globally, the assessment of drought impacts on vegetation and agricultural fields is a challenging and difficult task. However, satellite-based drought indices overcome some of these limitations, especially in large areas. The use of satellite-based vegetation indices for drought assessment on a large scale began in the 1980s (Tucker et al. 1986). Since then, various indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (indices derived from NDVI such as standard vegetation index (SVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI)), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), standard precipitation index (SPI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health index (VHI), and others, have been used to assess drought on regional and global scales for wheat, maize, paddy, soybean, tea, and other crops (Aulia et al. 2016; Agutu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2019; Das et al. 2020; Arab et al. 2022). The SVI has been used for drought assessment since 2002 (Petars et al. 2002) and is an excellent predictor of vegetation response in the short term. Moreover, the SPI is the most common precipitation deficit index used in describing drought conditions. The SPI has been used for drought monitoring since 1993 (Mckee et al. 1993) and indicates precipitation deficiency at a specific site over several periods of time. SPI can be calculated for the long and short term. In the short term, it is used for soil moisture monitoring and is crucial for agricultural production for drought detection on a large scale. In this case, many researchers have investigated the relationship between drought indices and the yield of agricultural crops. For instance, regression between yield and 12-month SPI explained up to 0.64 of the yield variability in a curvilinear relationship (Yamoah et al. 2000). The impact of drought on winter wheat during the main growing season was cited at 0.71 (Zhang et al. 2016). These indices are essential for drought monitoring on small and regional scales, especially in regions where ground-referenced data are limited. There are very few studies that use the SVI and SPI for drought assessment on a small scale. Therefore, it is necessary to increase efforts toward large-scale drought assessment that may aid in better understanding climatic variability and the evolution of droughts, particularly in regions (especially those in underdeveloped countries) with unique vulnerabilities and complicated geographies. In this regard, there is no similar study for vineyards' regional-scale drought assessment. Vineyard drought assessment and monitoring on a regional scale is challenging due to the large-scale satellite datasets and vineyard variability during the growing season. In this regard, several cloud computing sources are available for spatial big data processing. Amazon Web Service debuted in 2006 as a fee-based cloud computing platform that allows customers to create their own virtual data center (Tamiminia et al. 2020). In 2008, the Google Cloud platform began as a public cloud-computing platform with a multidatabase of satellite images and a geographical data analysis interface for data storage, data analysis, machine learning, and mapping systems. (Gorelick et al. 2017; Krishnan and Gonzalez 2015). Drought assessment using modern technology and techniques can support policy-makers and regional governments in assessing grape growers whose livelihood depends on grape production. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine the severity of drought in vineyards using the SPI and SVI indices within the fruit set and berry formation stages using satellite remote sensing and CHIRPS rainfall datasets.",1

The continuous increase in CO2 emissions is expected to have massive ramifications for the global climate system, with catastrophic consequences affecting all segments of society (Raihan et al. 2019, 2022b; Isfat and Raihan 2022). Therefore, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing environmental quality has become a global concern to ensure sustainable development and mitigate the negative effects of climate change (Ali et al. 2022; Raihan et al. 2021b, 2022c; Raihan and Said 2022). Consequently, determining the main determinants of CO2 is essential to increasing environmental quality. If the functional relationship between natural resources and modern development processes cannot be prevented, environmental damage will unavoidably occur. Such issues are more common in developing countries like Vietnam, where economic growth, energy security, agricultural value added, and environmental sustainability are simultaneously important (Shahbaz et al. 2019). Vietnam is a developing country that has had significant economic progress during the last four decades (Nguyen et al. 2021). Vietnam has also devised techniques for achieving economic growth that is compatible with long-term development. Vietnam has ratified international conventions to adapt to climate change and reduce carbon emissions, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. In its current Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC), Vietnam has acknowledged that it will reduce GHG emissions by eight percent using domestic resources by 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. At the same time, Vietnam is grappling with major environmental issues. Overall understanding Vietnam's vulnerability to climate change is becoming increasingly important for policymakers seeking to strike a balance between policies aimed at mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable development, as well as implementing measures that achieve both. The trade-off between pollution and development is the most difficult aspect of achieving this dual goal at the same time. A significant question that arises is how Vietnam might reduce CO2 emissions, and this question can be answered by examining the country’s environmental variables. Vietnam has transitioned from a low-income country to a lower-middle-income country as one of the world's fastest-growing transitional economies (Nguyen et al. 2021). Vietnam’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased nearly nine times from 30 billion USD in 1986 to 259 billion USD in 2020 (World Bank 2022). It is the 2nd fastest-growing economy in Southeast Asia and 23rd in the world with an annual GDP growth rate of 7% in 2019 (World Bank 2022). However, Vietnam's impressive economic progress is linked to an increase in energy use, which has resulted in a slew of environmental issues (Al-Mulali et al. 2015; Tang and Tan 2015; Phong et al. 2018; Shahbaz et al. 2019; Nguyen et al. 2021). The fact that Vietnam’s economy is based on fossil fuels such as coal and oil is the primary source of the country’s increasing environmental issues (Shahbaz et al. 2019; Nguyen et al. 2021). The increase in fossil fuel energy use leads to a substantial rise in CO2 emissions (Raihan et al. 2022d). Since 2018, Vietnam’s CO2 emissions per capita have surpassed the global average (Nguyen et al. 2021). Therefore, the country is highly concerned about the growing emission intensity, especially from the energy sector. Hence, climate change challenges have heightened the debate over the adoption of energy conservation regulations in Vietnam, as well as the necessity to comprehend the nexus between economic growth, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Agriculture is one of the primary drivers of environmental degradation (Raihan et al. 2023a). Agriculture is linked to CO2 emissions and is considered ultrasensitive to climate change (Raihan and Tuspekova 2022a). Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities account for roughly one-fifth of global yearly CO2 emissions, making it the second-largest source of CO2 emissions and a key contributor to global climate change (IPCC 2014). Vietnam's agriculture sector has advanced tremendously over the last quarter-century. It is a major producer and exporter of a variety of agricultural products, including coffee, peanuts, and rice. Furthermore, agriculture has been the leading employment in Vietnam across all economic sectors, employing more than 18.8 million Vietnamese in 2019 (Nguyen et al. 2021). However, improving agricultural value added, as well as environmental quality, are both necessary for long-term development. Increased agricultural value added decreases poverty, increases income distribution, food security, and promotes economic development (Raihan et al. 2023b). Agricultural value added also benefits the environment, according to economic research (Shahbaz et al. 2019; Prastiyo et al. 2020). Agricultural value added is linked to economic growth, which promotes demand for cleaner environments, commodities, and services, as well as the government's ability to enforce environmental legislation (Borlaug 2007). The argument that agricultural value added opposes the spread of cropland into forest areas follows the same logic. This encourages forest protection while also reducing pollution and environmental deterioration (Burney et al. 2010). Agricultural value added, on the other hand, has long been seen to contribute to environmental deterioration, and this alarm is growing. According to a study published by the FAO (2017), about half of the worldwide forest cover has been encroached upon, groundwater supplies have been depleted, and biodiversity has been destroyed as a result of increased food production and economic growth. According to the same research, the annual combustion of fossil fuels in agriculture puts billions of tons of GHGs into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change (Wang et al. 2020a). As a result, research on the relationship between agricultural value added and environmental degradation is critical for the development of successful sustainable agriculture policies. Over the last three decades, the determining factors of environmental degradation have been examined in several studies. Grossman and Krueger's (1991) analysis sparked a debate over whether there is a relationship between environmental degradation and economic advancement. This study influenced many scholars, and empirical research on the environmental consequences of economic expansion flourished as a result. As a result, various studies employing time series data examined the associations between environmental pollution indicators such as CO2 emissions and economic development (Adebayo et al. 2020; Begum et al. 2020; Raihan 2023a). However, there has been very little research in Vietnam on the interaction of CO2 emissions and environmental variables, even though it has become a hot topic among contemporary researchers worldwide. Therefore, the present study aims to fill up this literature gap by using econometric approaches to explore the nexus between economic growth, energy use, agricultural value added, and CO2 emissions in Vietnam. This research is expected to contribute to the recent literature and policymaking in Vietnam in three ways. Firstly, the novelty of this research is the evaluation of the impact of agricultural value added on CO2 emissions in Vietnam which is a ground-breaking attempt to reveal the nexus between agricultural value added and CO2 emissions. Secondly, several diagnostic tests, unit root tests (ADF, DF-GLS, P-P), cointegration tests (ARDL bounds test, Johansen cointegration test, Engle-Granger cointegration test), and cointegration regression models (ARDL, DOLS, FMOLS, CCR) were employed to verify the precision of the results. In addition, the Toda-Yamamoto causality test was utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. Lastly, the study’s findings would provide policymakers with more comprehensive and useful information for developing successful policies in the areas of low-carbon economy, promoting renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture that would reduce CO2 emissions in Vietnam. In addition, the findings from this investigation are useful for environmental policy evaluation and further policy formation to prepare Vietnam for a 1.5 °C world by strengthening policy and action plan to reduce the climate change impacts thereby ensuring sustainable development and environmental quality in the long term. This study encourages examining the dynamic impacts of socio-economic and environmental factors on environmental pollution in developing countries with rapid economic growth to establish a balance between sustainable development and emissions reduction. This study’s outcome could provide suggestions and recommendations to other developing countries aiming at building successful strategies to achieve environmental sustainability while strengthening climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.",5

Prosperity in economic pursuit entails not only the fulfillment of the materialistic requirements of men but also qualitative adjustment in social and cultural ways of life, as well as the supply of basic utilities through eliminating poverty and inequity. Sometimes, the phrase is employed in a variety of contexts, such as in the fields of international development and health-care, politics, among others, etc. (Michalos et al. 2006). It is important to distinguish between the standard of living and quality of life because the latter is mostly determined by one’s income (Derek et al. 2009). The concept of ‘standard’ differs from that of ‘quality’ in that it encompasses not only the materialistic standard of living but also other, more ethereal aspects of life, such as leisure, security, social rights, personal fulfillment, cultural resources, living circumstances, social life, health-care, physical and mental health, environmental quality issues, social belonging, etc. Even amongst two cultures or nations with comparable material levels of living, one may be more appealing to an individual or a group of individuals than the other from the standpoint of quality of life. Thus, quality of life refers to more than just a person’s material circumstances and also includes other intangible aspects of existence (Rajaram 2010; Derek et al. 2009). The phrase ‘Quality of life’ (hence shortened as QoL) is used to describe an individual’s or a society’s overall well-being. So, quality of life refers to a person’s levels of well-being in relation to the essential opportunities available to him or her. On the other hand, it is more of a multidimensional notion that takes into account a person’s perception of their level of well-being across a variety of spheres of life and in accordance with their cultural and value systems (WHOQoL Group 1996; Ray and Dasgupta 2012). There are two ways to access people’s lives: a subjective approach and an objective method, respectively. As already mentioned, numerous elements, including mental satisfaction, education, job opportunities, housing quality, etc., heavily influence both the subjective and objective quality of life (Huppert et al. 2005, 2010). This field has gained a deeper grasp of several determinants over time, including education, access to decent housing, the availability of wholesome food, other essential services and resources, etc. (Kitchen and Muhajarine 2008; Derek et al. 2009). The level of essential amenities in each household has been evaluated objectively in this research study. There were discovered to be both subjective and objective viewpoints used to evaluate people’s quality of life (Sen 1985; Dasgupta and Weale 1992; Diener 1995; Osberg and Sharpe 2000). As a result, quality of life is a complicated, multifaceted, and comprehensive phenomenon that requires a holistic perspective (Kironji 2008; Hagerty et al. 2001; Das et al. 2021a; Das and Mistri 2013). Numerous scholars have investigated Quality of Life, tried to pinpoint its components, and compared QOL across a range of geographic contexts, including cities, states, and the entire country. International organizations including the UNDP (1994), the UN, and the Overseas Development Council (1996) created their own QOL measures in addition to the researcher. When QoL are favorable, it helps to offer things like nutrition, clothing, shelter, education, and health, among other things. It also helps to eliminate perversion, evils, conservative and traditional mindsets, and impartial social standards and values (Das et al. 2021a, b). The adequacy of civic infrastructural facilities and social necessities determines how quickly a region’s socio-economic transition will proceed in the future (Rana 2018; MDG 2014). The accessibility of these services has an impact on the quality of life in cities (Hassan and Daspattanayak 2008; Bhunia and Rana 2017; Das and Mistri 2013; Das et al. 2020, 2021a, b, c; Rana 2018; Mondal and Das 2021; Haque et al. 2020; Ghosh et al. 2022a, b). In a nutshell, ‘basic amenities’ relate to those needs that are required (but not sufficient) for anyone’s regular lifestyle and have a one-to-one correspondence to QoL (Das et al. 2021a, c; Hagerty et al. 2001). For its rising urban population, West Bengal is experiencing a severe scarcity of essential services (Das et al. 2021a, b, c; Chaplin 2011; Kumar 2014; Shaban and Sharma 2007; Thompson et al. 2000). Basic urban amenities and services, such as access to drinking water, electricity, toilets, drains, kitchen facility and the fuel used for cooking are crucial for the quality of life of city dwellers and are important for the future development of West Bengal’s towns’ infrastructure as well as for closing the gap between the state’s various categories of towns (Das et al. 2021a; Gardner and Oswald 2007; Rappaport 2008a, b; Wheeler and Hendon 2004; Mondal and Das 2021). It also aims to highlight the spatial distribution of household quality of life against a theoretical framework (Das and Mistri 2013; Murray 1988). According to the Houselisting and Housing Census of West Bengal (2011), approximately 45 per cent of urban households do no longer have access to running water, 15% of urban households do not even have access to latrines, and nearly 34 per cent of urban households are yet to be covered by adequate waste water outlet facilities. Drinking water availability for a sufficiently long period of time in a day is still a faraway dream for urban households. Over 14% of households in this state’s urban areas still have no access to power. LPG/PNG is a cleaner cooking fuel that is unavailable to more than half of the households. Identically, city people face other issues such as a lack of municipal amenities (Das et al. 2021a, b, c). Access to basic facilities for households is not only limited but also insufficient, resulting in a dehumanized living environment in many of the state’s urban centers. Evidence also shows that the amount of amenities offered to urban people vary significantly across West Bengal (Mundetia et al. 2018; Chauhan et al. 2015; Deaton 2003; Jain et al. 1988; Das et al. 2021a, b). The broad socio-cultural context, economic affordability, and rising urban population are the elements driving this significant scarcity (Kumar 2015; Mulligan and Carruthers 2011; Adeyinka and Olugbamila 2015; Das et al. 2021a, b, c; Auckland Council 2011; Gardner and Oswald 2007; Hansen and Winther 2010; Rappaport 2008a, b; Wheeler and Hendon 2004; Mahadevia 2001; Chaplin 2011; Kumar 2014; Shaban and Sharma 2007; Thompson et al. 2000). The lack of access to such services as faucet (tap) water, toilets, connectivity of waste water outlet, power, bathing facilities, cooking facilities, and LPG/PNG are the significant impediment to urban growth. West Bengal’s quality of life has deteriorated as a result of rapid urbanization (Hassan and Daspattanayak 2008). Large cities and metropolitan areas are also affected by a lack of essential amenities (Das et al. 2021a). In addition to natural growth, the state’s urban landscape is confronted with a number of difficulties, such as significant immigration from rural areas has fuelled these regions’ expansions; this migration comes either as a result of agrarian sector collapse and or merely in quest of desirable prospects, a glaring regional imbalance in the coverage of basic amenities among towns and cities of different sizes, the limited ability of urban local bodies to provide those services, etc. (World Bank Report 2003; Das et al. 2021a, b; Kumar 2015; Mondal and Das 2021; Ghosh et al. 2022a, b). It is undeniable that development and urbanization have a strong relationship. The process of urbanization is usually regarded as an unavoidable by-product of development (Das and Das 2019a, b). The demographic dynamics in urban centers are fast changing as a result of increased industrialisation and tertiary activities, resulting in a severe ‘demand and supply’ challenge for urban civic services (Knox et al. 2007; North Shore City Council 2005). Many developing and increasingly industrialized urban centers have overwhelmed local government capacities. As a result, developing schemes and strategies for the overall improvement of a region’s urban centers becomes increasingly complex (Bhunia and Daspattanayak 2018). Every economy in the world aspires to improve its quality of life (Tahir and Majeed 2020). The term ‘quality of life’ refers to a judgement (assessment) made regarding important aspects, or the entirety, of a person’s life or society (Gasper 2010). Quality of life is defined by the Dictionary of Human Geography (Johnston 1981) as the condition of social well-being of individuals or groups, as perceived by them or as determined by ‘observable indicators.’ UNDP (1998), WHOQoL Group (1996), Ray and Dasgupta (2012) defined QoL as the satisfaction of basic needs such as health, education, cultural, value systems and standard of living, while Sirgy et al. (2004) defined it as a qualitative measure of well-being that incorporates consumer, health, social, economic, and physical well-being. Prior to Anand and Sen (2000) and Majeed (2019), scholars and economists measured QoL using GDP per capita (Nussbaum and Sen 1993; Majeed and Mumtaz 2017). However, Anand and Sen (2000) and Majeed (2019), WHOQoL Group (1996), Ray and Dasgupta (2012) stated that QoL is affected not only by income, but also by other major sociological, physiological, and human dimensions of an individual’s life that were previously ignored. As a result, Sirgy et al. (2004); Tahir and Majeed (2020) concluded that QoL is a subjective measure and that the best empirical approximation is the ‘Human Development Index (HDI)’. Similarly, one way to analyze QoL is to look at how well people’s ‘happiness criteria’ are satisfied- that is, those requirements that are a necessary (but not sufficient) condition of happiness for everybody—and without which no member of the human race can be happy (MacCall 1975). The quality of life measure identifies the socio-economic environment’s overall qualities in a given area. It can be used as a strong tool for community development planning to track key indicators that include the community’s social, health, environmental, and economic characteristics (Pal and Kumar 2005). As a result, quality of life (QoL) is described as “the status of objective conditions/status of family living.” It can also be defined as a measure of a society’s or family’s emotional, mental, and physical needs being met (Pal and Kumar 2005). It is not a constant phenomenon because it is affected by factors such as location, development status, and so on. Thus, QoL is a word that refers to the entire qualities of a region’s socio-economic environment. To describe QoL, structural approaches (including indices) have been applied in numerous cases (Pal and Kumar 2005). Quality of life, on the other hand, refers to the whole of assisted living facilities, which are non-medical, residential environments that provide housing, food, and personal services, among other things (Ball et al. 2000). Other definitions of QoL can be found all around the world. Improving the quality of life, happiness, and well-being has recently become essential to the development agendas of many governments, with words used interchangeably (Galloway 2006). In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion on how to define the quality of life, especially as it relates to frail elders (Birren and Dieckmann 1991; Croog 1990; Katz et al. 1995; Stewart and King 1994). There is a difference in the quality of life between people with middle- to late-stage dementia who live in regular institutional settings and those who live in specialized care facilities (Reimer et al. 2004). Despite the lack of a formal, agreed-upon definition, researchers generally agree that the construct is multifaceted and includes both subjective and objective components (Birren and Dieckmann 1991; Lawton 1991; Stewart and King 1994). Cultural festivals, on the other hand, can improve people’s quality of life (Liburd and Derkzen 2009). Albouy et al. (2016) looked at the quality of life in terms of climate change and climatic amenities. Hwang et al. (2011) looked at changes in health status, quality of life, substance use, health-care utilization, and residential stability. Jensen et al. (2004) investigated the urban quality of life by examining the link between socio-economic situations and urban forest amenities. There is a link between urban expansion and quality of life from an urban perspective (Sharma and Abhay 2022). Sundari (2003); Mawkhlieng and Debbarma (2018); D’souza (1979); Von Münch and Mayumbelo 2007, and Das et al. 2021a, b) both try to understand the conditions and quality of living in urban slums. There are several essential aspects that can help residents of urban informal dwellings enhance their quality of life (Richards et al. 2007). However, relationship between QoL and basic amenities (Moolla et al. 2011; Mulligan and Carruthers 2011), issues like deficiencies in the basic services viz. drinking water, its sources, availability and quality (Bhargava 1985; Havelaar 1994; Haruna et al. 2005; Ejechi and Ejechi 2008; Rieger et al. 2016; Antonova and Sagdeeva 2013; Stoner 1978; McKenzie and Ray 2009; Hassan and Daspattanayak 2008; Bhunia and Rana 2017; Das and Mistri 2013; Das et al. 2020; Das et al. 2021a, b, c), its health perspectives (Kang et al. 2011; Holgate 2000; Huang and Xia 2001; Koch-Weser 1988; Fram and Belitz 2011; Chalchisa et al. 2018), effects of water exercise (Sato et al. 2007; Tahir and Majeed 2020), water contamination (Haydar et al. 2009), drinking water as an indicator of QoL (Cassivi et al. 2017; Das et al. 2020, 2021a, b; Das and Mistri 2013); latrine facility and sanitation (Nallari 2015; Peprah et al. 2015; Biran et al. 2011; Das et al. 2021a, b, c; Das and Mistri 2013), its impact on human health (Kattula et al. 2015), scarcity and sources of violence (Srinivasan 2015; Heijnen et al. 2015; O’Reilly 2010), ground water contamination due to pit latrines and poor sanitation (Wright, et al. 2013; Chandana and Rao 2021; Cronin et al. 2007; Chakrabarti 2001; Satterthwaite 2016), poor sanitation and lack of hygiene (UNICEF/WHO 2009; WHO/UNICEF 2012; Clark and Gundry 2004; Eisenberg et al. 2007; WSP 2010; Bartlett 2003), its challenges (Wankhade 2015; Andersson et al. 2016), onsite sanitation (Shivendra and Ramaraju 2015); bathing facility (Whitehead et al. 2016); sources of energy and electricity (Pasten and Santamarina 2012; IPCC 2007; Lee 2011; Bridge et al. 2016; Bose et al. 2013; Nadimi and Tokimatsu 2018; Mazur 2011; Das et al. 2020, 2021a, b, c; Das and Mistri 2013); fuel used for cooking (Arent et al. 2011; Resch et al. 2008; IEA 2010; Glaser 2011; REN21 2011; Herring 2006; Das et al. 2021a, b, c; Das and Mistri 2013); and cooking facility (Das and Panda 2017; Banerjee et al. 2012; UNDP 2001; Das and Mistri 2013) have been studied in multidimensional perspective. As a result, people have been flocking to areas with high perceived quality of life. Such migration can occur as a result of the increased demand for amenities that comes with broad-based technical improvement (Rappaport 2008a, b). India and outside of India, numerous international and national studies also illustrated the spatial disparity in the distribution of basic amenities (Anthonj et al. 2020; Azage et al. 2020; Hasan and Alam 2020; Satur and Lindsay 2020; Ghosh et al. 2022a,b, 2021; Chaudhuri et al. 2020; Pradhan and Mondal 2020). Prior studies focused on district-level quality of life rather than examination at the level of individual households across several aspects (Ohlan 2013; Kumari 2016; Chaudhuri and Gupta 2009; Das et al. 2020, 2021a, b, c). On the other extreme, there is little research on the topic of basic facilities in small towns and Census Towns (CT). Jain and Korzhenevych (2020), Jain (2018), Samanta (2017) and Anuja (2012), argued that the small towns and CTs are sustained with extreme deprivation of urban basic services, and differ significantly from one another between Census Towns (CTs) and Statutory Towns (STs). On the other hand, Mukhopadhyay (2017) contends that when a comparison is made between CTS and STs, a confusing image about the fundamental facilities emerges. The CTs and STs are not significantly different from one another in terms of their entitlement to statutory status. This is the novelty of the research study since it examines the quality of life in West Bengal’s urban centers (size class and civic status category-wise) based on the availability of basic utilities for households. With certainty, this research angle can help to better visualize the situation and comprehend how households’ quality of life is actually faring. In light of the foregoing discussion, the current study attempts to fill the gap by evaluating the quality of life in terms of levels of essential basic amenities (availability and accessibility) across the size class and civic status of urban centers in West Bengal, which has not been studied as thoroughly as it should be. In addition to this, this study wants to demonstrate various dimensions of disparity between large-size class towns and small-size class towns as well as CTs and STs in terms of the availability of urban amenities and basic services.",1

There is a direct relationship between the emergence of a city and the birth of civilization (Calik 2019). The most important economic and social centers that are considered as a potential growth of any country are urban areas that also attract economic, health, and urban development activities (Ziyari et al. 2018). Today, 54% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and it is predicted to increase up to 66% by 2050 (Parlak et al. 2020). Cities are in continuous-fast growth and development; consequently, it causes changes in land use, and land covering (Dey et al. 2021). Uncoordinated growth of urban areas and lack of proper planning have a negative impact on natural resources and lead to the replacement of non-evaporative surfaces (urban area), the loss of vegetation, and lack of water resources (Al Rakib et al. 2020). The economy, culture, and politics of the society are reinforced by the development of the cities; on the contrary, urban ecological processes are gradually degraded. As a result of disruption in the natural process of the environment, the economy, politics, culture, health, and well-being of the people will be endangered (Tang et al. 2018; Brahmasrene and Lee 2017; Arsanjani et al. 2013). The environmental hazards of watersheds, coastal areas, rainforests, and the risks on natural systems surrounding landfills, mining sites, etc. have been extensively studied by researchers, while less attention has been dedicated to the dangers of the urban developments on the environment (Hua et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2018). Thus, today, the issue of urban sprawl has become a common challenge for all environmental planners, managers, and urban designers (Patino and Duque 2013; Subedi et al. 2013; Akin et al. 2015). Irregular expansion in urban areas is one of the most important issues in sustainable urban management in developing countries. Various constructions have caused changes in the spatial structure of the cities (Aliani et al. 2021). Development in cities is certain, hence to avoid negative effects on natural ecosystems, and land-use/land-cover changes, the principles, and criteria must be defined with proper urban development planning, so that it can unite city managers toward a common purpose that is having well-developed city and also to ensure the sustainability of development while supporting the ecology and environment of cities. To achieve this, various development criteria, including economic, social, and environmental, must be considered in setting strategies. Appropriate development in a city takes place when the land is used in proportion to its potential and capabilities, and this is achieved through studies evaluating the ecological potential of cities. Numerous criteria are effective in the assessment of the ecological potential to predict the physical expansion of the cities. Thus, it requires decision-making strategies based on which criteria and solutions are identified and considering the importance of different criteria and in the end selecting the best option (Bausys et al. 2020a). One of the important issues in urban planning is the appropriate determination of land use. In this matter, it is necessary to determine the best use for each unit of land according to environmental criteria, such as slope, height, direction of slope, climate, erosion, land capability, soil, as well as economic and social factors (Luan et al. 2021; Yohannes and Soromissa 2018; Everest et al. 2021). Multi-criteria decision-making models are a set of methods that allow decision-makers to select, rank, order, or describe a set of alternatives in the decision-making process by considering a set of (often conflicting) criteria (Penadés-Plà et al. 2016; Sehra et al. 2012; Vassoney et al. 2021; Everest and Gür 2022). The multi-criteria decision-making method has great potential to reduce cost and time and increase accuracy in spatial decisions and can provide a suitable framework for solving spatial problems in urban and rural areas (Gebre et al. 2021; Balta and Yenil 2019; Yuan et al. 2022; Everest 2021). For complex decisions when different options are evaluated based on a large number of criteria, multi-criteria support systems can be used successfully. Each of these decision-making models has its own capabilities and limitations, which are necessary to choose the most suitable method by knowing them (Angelis and Kanavos 2017; Razmak and Aouni 2015). The main steps in solving multi-index problems include the following steps: defining the goal, determining the evaluation indicators (indicators affecting the goal that it is possible to collect information about), separation of quantitative and qualitative indicators, separation of indicators with a positive and negative aspect (a positive indicator means that we want to increase their value in the model; a negative index means that we want to decrease their value in the model), and range of qualitative indicators (qualitative indicators must be converted to a quantitative value, so that calculations can be performed on them. Most of the indicators with they are a rank scale that can be converted into quantitative numbers using the spectrum method (Abdollahi et al. 2022; Siroosi et al. 2019). Multi-criteria decision models, environmental criteria of urban development, and GIS are the main components of urban development zoning (Azizi et al. 2014; Arsanjani et al. 2013; Akin et al. 2015), which are very important in environmental sciences and urban geography (Basse et al. 2016). Using quantitative models and methods as powerful tools for better understanding is essential. Today, to legalize the humanities, the use of numbers, and statistical and mathematical techniques in research of all branches of science has become so popular (Pourtaheri et al. 2016). The WASPAS method is a multi-criteria decision model. This model is a combination of the weighted sum model (WSM) and weighted product model (WPM) that seeks a common optimal criterion based on two optimal criteria, i.e., the success criteria of the weighted average are similar to the WSM method. This is an acceptable multi-criteria decision approach that is used to evaluate several options considering appropriate decision-making criteria (Chakraborty and Zavadskas 2014; Triantaphyllou & Mann1989; Maccrimon 1968). Among the multi-criteria decision models, the WASPAS method has a high computational efficiency that is used as the total weight of the integrated product (Tayali 2017). The advantages of this model include a very accurate technique and its matrix based on objective data, which is used to make decisions on very sensitive issues (Pourtaheri et al. 2016). Urban development and changes in land-use patterns cause extensive social and environmental impacts. These effects include the reduction of natural spaces, the accumulation of vehicles, the reduction of agricultural land with high production capacity, the impact on natural drains, and the reduction of water quality. These are somehow related to the change of land-use patterns due to human activities. Today, the need is to evaluate the accuracy of urban development in accordance with the sustainable development strategy. Accordingly, in this study, the WASPAS model was used to identify environmental indicators with an emphasis on prioritizing urban development criteria in Zanjan, so the selected indicators are based on spatial indicators of sustainable development. Numerous studies have applied WASPAS approach to investigate multi-criteria problems in different study fields, which some of the most important studies are reviewed below. Hashemkhani Zolfani et al. (2013) have used WASPAS multi-criteria decision model to locate new business locations with a forward-looking perspective. Due to the complexity, high risk, and timing of selection of the right place for creating a new business center, this new multi-criteria decision model used can provide a forward-looking perspective for future competition. Vafaeipour et al. (2014) used WASPAS and GIS to evaluate solar project sites in Iran. They concluded that the integrated approach used is helpful to make the decisions for energy sector and plan energy management. Chakraborty and Zavadskas (2014) studied the application of WASPAS multi-criteria decision-making in industry. Their study indicated that the correct and rapid decision-making process in establishing production units is effective in the current competitive world. Zavadskas et al. (2016) investigated optimal indoor environment to assess energy efficient requirement and human needs of dwelling houses applying WASPAS method. According to their findings, WASPAS is an appropriate approach to assess indoor environment and provide alternative options. Esfandiari Mahni et al. (2017) studied the role of higher education institutions in the physical development of cities using the WASPAS model. In this study, the effectiveness of the establishment of all higher education institutions called Islamic Azad and medical sciences were evaluated and ranked. The results indicated that the university of Sistan and Baluchestan is the most effective University. Deveci et al. (2018) used an MCDM method-based WASPAS- and TOPSIS-based interval type-2 fuzzy to select a car sharing station. According to their results, the used method provides a more accurate decision-making tool in problems with high levels of uncertainty. Emovon et al. (2018) assessed the strategy selection for ship system operation to enhance Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) using WASPAS. They evaluated WASPAS as a suitable approach for this purpose. Badalpur and Nurbakhsh (2019) assessed the risk quality of road construction project in Iran using WASPAS technique. They proposed the WASPAS procedure as an appropriate approach with more accuracy among MCDM methods to evaluate the risks in a real condition. Tuş and Adalı (2019) examined the digital time and attendance system to track employees’ time and attendance in the companies using a combined approach including WASPAS. The use of WASPAS can help ranking alternative systems in this case. Rani and Mishra (2020) assessed a framework to select fuel technology using a combine MCDM involved WASPAS approach. The final findings confirm that the development framework has a proper efficiency in selection of fuel technology. Shaaban et al. (2020) investigated a fuzzy hybrid approach for ranking the flare gas recovery methods and allocating to refineries. Their finding indicated that the method used is efficiently carried out for allocating to refineries of South Pars gas field in Iran. Gokasar et al. (2022) used the fuzzy WASPAS approach to rank the transportation bridge maintenance and repair projects to reduce climate change impacts. They reported that the ranking results are robust and CO2 emission criterion is the dominant criterion in their study. Tacking the above-mentioned studies into account, WASPAS approach is an appropriate procedure to evaluate different multi-criteria and multi-decision problems, such as site selection, software selection, etc., and hence, in this study, we used this approach to zone urban development. Zanjan city with an area of 6763 km2 is located in the center of Zanjan province. The presence of the Tehran–Tabriz highway through this city has resulted in economic, social, industrial, and urban developments in the region. Favorable climate, environmental, and natural characteristics like rich freshwater sources and fertile soil resources have increased the potential of the region for urban and industrial developments (Water District of Zanjan 2007; Parchianloo et al. 2017). Figure 1 shows the location of the study area in the province and the country. One of the most obvious manifestations of instability in Zanjan city is the existence of relatively large abandoned areas. The presence of these tissues in the city has caused instability in its economic, social, physical, and environmental dimensions (Mohammadi and Mohammadi 2017). Location of the study area in Zanjan province and Iran Zanjan county is the most prominent population center of Zanjan province due to having a population of over 569,379 individuals. This county is considered to be the 20th most populated center in Iran (Statistical centre of Iran 2021). The population of this county has increased by more than 126,000 during the last 15 years (2006–2021). This rapid population growth has brought many environmental and socio-economic problems. Currently, Zanjan province is one of the important centers of agriculture and animal husbandry in the west of the country. All kinds of activities in both sectors are carried out in two industrial and traditional ways. Another part of animal husbandry is nomadic herding in this province. In the field of industrial animal husbandry and meat and milk production, Zanjan province has achieved a worthy position in the country and is considered one of the most important poultry centers in the country. In the industry and mining sector, Zanjan province has a privileged position (Management and planning organization of Zanjan province 2016). In the northern slope of the Tarem mountains, in the northwest–southeast part and parallel to the Qezal Ozen river, there is a row of Marl, Conglomerate, and Sandstone deposits that sometimes have chalk lenses and alternately cover the Eocene Azar debris. In Zanjan province, the areas located south of Tarem mountains are a part of the central Iranian plate, which have been transformed into several tectonic blocks limited to fault zones as a result of the operation of the northeast–southwest faults, the most important of which are: a. The rock strata units of this extraterrestrial include the following tectonic strata units—Late Precambrian platform sequence (Kaher formation) Middle Triassic which has long sedimentary intervals in its Paleozoic sequence, so that everywhere the Permian rocks are directly on the Cambrian platform carbonates (formation) Mila) are located. Geological Surveys in terms of having a history of mining and having reserves of metallic and non-metallic ores, geological and exploration studies of Zanjan province have a long history, so it must be said that this area is the first area of Iran where basic geological-exploratory surveys have been carried out (Aghanabati 2011). Major geomorphological units in the studied area include alluvial plains and plateaus. Parent materials in the study area mainly include young alluvial deposits. The soils of the target area include two orders of Inceptisols and Entisols, and suborders of Xerepts, Fluvents, Orthents, and groups of Xerofluvents, Xerorthents, Calcixerepts, and Haploxerepts (USDA 2014).",
7.0,3.0,Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science,03 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41685-023-00284-9,Spatial disparities in health status and access to health-related interventions in Madhya Pradesh,September 2023,Alinda George,Pritee Sharma,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The health status of the population is given prime focus in both national and international policymaking as it is a primary requisite for sustainable development. Health was a major focus area in Millennium Development Goals adopted by United Nations in 2000, and the higher stress on this area continues through the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015. Despite the continued focus on improving health, global mortality and malnutrition rates among women and children remain alarming. UNICEF (2020) reports that the under-5 mortality rate has declined by 60 per cent from 1990 to 2019, but around 5.2 million children died before age five in 2019 alone. Globally, among children under five years of age, 149.2 million were stunted, 45.4 million children were wasted, and 38.9 million had overweight in 2020 (UNICEF et al. 2021). In 2019, 30% of women aged 15–49 and 40% of children under five suffered from anaemia globally (WHO 2021b). A huge divide exists between developed and developing countries on maternal and child mortality (Pathak et al. 2010). South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa account for a significant share of maternal mortalities globally (Panda et al. 2019). These higher shares of mortalities and poor health status among women and children can be attributed to the inequalities prevailing in the access to health-related interventions like reproductive health care, nutritional interventions, access to education and basic facilities, fulfilment of reproductive rights of women, awareness and affordability of healthcare and other socioeconomic and cultural constraints (Pathak et al. 2010; Rivillas et al. 2020; ABVIGGPA 2017; Sarkar et al. 2021). According to WHO (2021a), one-fourth of the world population lacked safely managed drinking water services, half of the population lacked safely managed sanitation services, and three out of ten people lacked basic hygiene services in 2020. 11.3 percent of married women worldwide have an unmet need for family planning (UNFPA 2022), and post-natal care services remain highly inequitable in low- and middle-income countries (Langlois et al. 2015). Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia possess the lowest levels of antenatal care globally (UNICEF 2022) and the highest share of marriages before 18 years (UNICEF 2018). India accounted for 12 percent of global maternal deaths estimated in 2017 (WHO 2019), and along with Nigeria, it accounted for about one-third of under-five deaths globally in 2019 (UNICEF 2020). India possesses the highest share of wasting among children (19%) globally (Von Grebmer et al. 2022). Although the Government of India puts effort into improving women and child health through programmes like the National Health Mission, maternal and child mortalities and malnutrition rates remain high (Panda et al. 2019). The disparities in availability, access and affordability of health-related interventions caused by differences in region, caste, wealth etc., limit the improvement in maternal and child health (Singh et al. 2013). The population in Empowered Action Group (EAG) states suffers mostly from poor health status, higher rates of maternal and child mortalities and morbidities and low access to health interventions, as compared to other states of India (Mishra et al. 2021; Singh et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2012; Mukhopadhyay 2015; Arokiasamy et al. 2013; Rai et al. 2012). These states lag in demographic transition due to the higher population growth rate and high fertility rate (Awasthi et al. 2016). Poverty, low urbanization rate, a higher proportion of tribal people, illiteracy, and limited access to infrastructure, among other factors adds to their lower health status and limited access to healthcare (Pathak et al. 2010; Awasthi et al. 2016; Mukhopadhyay 2015; Kumar et al. 2012; Arokiasamy et al. 2013, Acharya 2018). Table 4 in the appendix indicates that these states perform worse than all India averages in fertility and mortality indicators like birth rate, death rate, fertility rate, the mean age of marriage, and mortality rates of women and children. Madhya Pradesh, one of the EAG states, is no exception as it possesses a higher birth rate, fertility rate, mortality rate, and low mean age at effective marriage of women than all India average. Due to recent economic growth, the state has escaped its “BIMARUFootnote 1” tag. However, the development of the social sector, especially the health sector, remains weak owing to the inefficiencies in the public health care system. The higher mortality rates and malnutrition prevailing among women and children are mainly attributed to the disparities in health interventions in the state. The state performs worse in the health sector when compared to other states of India. It is ranked 23rd in SDG Goal 3 in the latest NITI Aayog report (Aayog 2021), whereas Sinha et al. (2016) classified the state, along with other EAG states, as strugglers in the performance of the health sector. Panda et al. (2019) found that districts of Madhya Pradesh have higher deprivation in maternal and child health care. Bora and Saikia (2018) predicted that out of 50Footnote 2 districts of Madhya Pradesh, 49 are not likely to achieve the SDG target 3.2.2 of reducing neonatal mortality to 12 per 1000 live births by 2030, and 29 will not be able to achieve the SDG target 3.2.1 of reduction of under-five mortality to 25 per 1000 live births by 2030. Guilmoto et al. (2018) found that Madhya Pradesh, along with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan, accounts for two third of female excess mortality in India. Sharma et al. (2007) found wide disparities in health infrastructure, reproductive health, utilisation of reproductive care services and socioeconomic development among districts of Madhya Pradesh. From the available literature, it is understood that higher disparities exist among the districts of Madhya Pradesh in health status and health-related interventions. Therefore, a detailed study is required to assess the differences in health status and health-related interventions among districts and the reasons for these disparities. It is also necessary to understand whether access to health interventions is associated with better health status in these districts. The studies on the spatial distribution of access to health care have become necessary due to the recognition among policymakers that average health status is inadequate to represent the performance of the health sector in a region (Lauridsen and Pradhan 2011). A study of the spatial distribution of health status and access to health-related interventions is necessitated here due to the wide disparities in the health sector in Madhya Pradesh reported by the literature (Sharma et al. 2007). The spatial disparities in access to health care are assessed mainly by the construction of health indices. The health indices will facilitate spatial mapping and spatial correlation analysis, which will help prioritize interventions for the needy and ensure equity in health coverage (Colomé-Hidalgo et al. 2021). The indices used for assessing the inequality in health care generally do not follow a particular framework and use indicators based on literature only (Sarkar et al. 2021; Panda et al.2020) This study advances from the other attempts by preparing a framework for assessing inequalities in health-related interventions and health status. From the studies on health inequalities, it is clear that access to healthcare is linked to policy interventions to reduce poverty and hunger, promotion of female education and gender equality, and access to basic facilities. As maternal and child health inequities have socioeconomic implications like poor health outcomes, increased healthcare costs and low socioeconomic development, a reduction in those inequalities can bring a reduction in poverty and hunger, gender equality, improvement of education etc. (Panda et al. 2019). Similarly, reduction in poverty, better status of women, improvement in education etc., can reduce health inequalities (Panda et al. 2019; Maitra 2004). Due to this interlinkage of health with other socioeconomic parameters, this study tries to assess the inequalities in health care in Madhya Pradesh by connecting SDG 3 to other SDGs. The linkage of SDG3 with other SDGs is mentioned elaborately in section 2. The Health Intervention Index is prepared based on the linkage of SDG3 (Good Health and well-being) with SDG 1 (No poverty), 4 (Quality education), 5 (Gender Equality), 6 (Clean water & sanitation), 7 (Affordable and clean energy), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Health Status Index is prepared based on the linkage of SDG3 with SDG2 (Zero Hunger & Malnutrition). Indices on health disparities are generally constructed using arithmetic mean (Panda et al. 2020), geometric mean (Rothenberg et al. 2014; Khan and Hussain 2020) or principal component analysis (Kumari and Raman 2022; Jackson et al. 2015). Principal component analysis will facilitate identification and mapping of major components contributing to variations in health-related interventions and health status in Madhya Pradesh. It will facilitate targeting policy interventions in deprived areas. This study aims to assess district-level inequity in access to health in Madhya Pradesh by finding the association of SDG 3 with other Sustainable Development Goals. The objectives of this study are: First, it tries to identify the variations in health-related interventions in districts of Madhya Pradesh through a Health Intervention Index (HII). It explores the spatial association of these interventions and identifies the hotspots. Second, it tries to identify the variations in the population's health status in Madhya Pradesh using the Health Status Index (HSI), explore spatial association, and identify hotspots. Thirdly, it tries to find the association of both indices through bivariate spatial association techniques. The article is organized as follows: The first section deals with the relevance of assessing health care disparities in Madhya Pradesh, whereas the next section discusses about the association of SDG 3 with other SDGs. The third section deals with the methodology used for preparing the indices. The following section for results discusses about the major components contributing to variation in health status and access to health-related interventions. Discussion section interprets the results in connection with previous literature and specifies the strength and limitations of the study. The sixth section concludes the study.",

This is because of the growth in population, rise in purchasing power, and increased cooking convenience for rapidly growing urban populations (Bissah et al. 2022; Mané et al. 2021; Ajala and Gana 2015; Demont et al. 2012; Seck et al. 2010). Between 2020 and 2050, nearly 2 billion people are predicted to be added to the world's population, with more than half of them residing in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa where the population is projected to increase, by 99% (Bin Rahman and Zhang, 2022). Like the population, rice consumption is also expected to increase significantly in sub-Saharan Africa and West Asian countries (Connor et al. 2022). However, an opposite effect is noted. Britwum and Demont, (2021) found that rice production in sub-Saharan Africa is seriously hindered by low productivity issues. Bissah et al., (2022) also confirm this assertion by stating that in Ghana, rice production is not increasing at the same rate as demand even though Ghana has the potential to produce more rice. In Uganda, however, local rice dominates imported rice because it is protected by a high tariff barrier, making it competitive (Kikuchi et al. 2015). The opposite effect is observed in West African countries in which imported rice dominates (Adjah et al. 2022; Todomé et al. 2018). Since the 1960s, African governments have responded to the increase in population demand by implementing accessible food import policies rather than by boosting local production. Consequently, they are now challenged by the historical urban disadvantage between the local and imported rice markets (Britwum and Demont 2021; Rutsaert et al. 2013). Benin is, a coastal country in West Africa with a population of approximately 12.10 million and a population growth rate of 2.7% (World Population Prospects United Nations 2019). The country’s urban areas are the primary centers for employment opportunities and are densely populated, resulting in a higher percentage of rice demand compared with local areas (Seck et al. 2010). Demont et al. (2017) reported that rice consumption in Benin increased from 10 kg per habitant per year in 1990 to 67 kg in 2010. Furthermore, the increase in the demand for rice is accompanied with high-quality expectations as a consequence of colonial import reform policies. The market has been shaped by cultural and colonial heritage and has been influenced by Asian rice import norms (Britwum and Demont 2021). Indigenous preferences for African or local rice can be traced back to the dawn of agriculture. In this day and age, urban consumers are dissatisfied with local rice because of its low quality and prefer imported rice, which they consider to be superior (Amfo et al. 2022; Ouédraogo et al. 2021; Todomé et al. 2018; Fiamohe et al. 2018; Demont et al. 2013). For the last decade, African governments and rice institutions have been cautiously investing in the local rice sector to improve the various intrinsic quality characteristics of rice, such as color, cleanliness, shape, and fragrance. This has been through the implementation of new rice milling methods; introduction of new varieties of rice seed; and promotion of agricultural mechanization (Ademiluyi et al. 2021; Zossou et al. 2013; Tomlins et al. 2005). According to Todomé et al. (2018), Benin rice production has been improved to facilitate access to urban markets. Nevertheless, despite the positive evolution of local rice, several reports show that imported rice brands continue to dominate consumer purchase decisions in urban markets (Ouédraogo et al. 2021; Demont et al. 2017; Demont and Ndour 2015). Todomé et al., (2018) and Rutsaert et al. (2013) identified two reasons for this behavior in their studies. One reason is that seaports near urban areas facilitate the entry of imported brands, primarily from Asia, with high intrinsic quality to which consumers have long been exposed. Another reason is that locally produced rice is generally considered low-quality product. However, opposite consumer behaviors have been observed in rice-producing areas where local rice is seems to be preferred. (Demont et al. 2013). Batra et al. (2000) justified this behavior by stating that consumers in less developed economies prefer non-local-origin products due to a “foreignness” attitude effect on consumers. In contrast, Demont et al. (2013) revealed through field experiments that the persistent consumer preferences for imported rice have less to do with the product’s foreignness than with its superior post-harvest grain quality. According to Demont et al. (2017), urban markets are significant areas where local rice producers can focus on strengthening their competitiveness against imported rice if the quality is appropriate. According to Ouédraogo et al. (2021), “there is potential urban demand for local quality rice.” Amfo et al. (2022) stated that “there is a great market potential for local rice.” A substantial body of literature exists on local rice, including the dependence on imported rice in urban areas, its poor quality, and its eventual potential in urban areas. However, it is not clear which factors could increase local rice preferences and competitiveness in urban areas designated as potential markets so as to increase local rice sales and productivity in West African countries. Rice is the primary food source for nearly half of the global population (Cuong et al. 2022). It is one of the world’s most important grain crops and cereals in Ghana (Bissah et al. 2022) and is the staple cereal in Senegal (Mané et al. 2021). It plays a critical role in food nutrition security in many West African countries (Adjah et al. 2022). Furthermore, rice is the most important staple food for the world’s poorest people, who live primarily in Asia and Africa (Bin Rahman & Zhang 2022). Many initiatives have been launched to make sub-Saharan Africa self-sufficient in rice production (Adjah et al. 2022). As a result, rice production in Africa has increased from 29 million metric tons in 2012 to more than 37 million metric tons in 2022 (FAOSTAT 2022). Figure 1 shows the rice production trends in Benin, where an increase in local production has also been observed due to the emergence of national and regional policies and strategic measures dedicated to supporting rice producers. Source: FAOSTAT 2022 Production quantities of rice in Benin. In Benin, a new parboiler was introduced to stimulate local rice production and processing, which increased milling yield and intrinsic quality (Demont et al. 2012). According to Todomé et al. (2018), local parboiled rice has greater health benefits than white rice and is an excellent solution to reduce market reliance on imported white rice. Ouédraogo et al.’s (2021) experimental auction revealed that consumers in Burkina Faso were willing to pay a higher premium for local parboiled rice rather than imported Thai rice. This demonstrates the positive outcome of the various measures taken to increase local rice preference. The introduction of a new Engelberg model of rice mill, imported from Asia, reduced the average number of rice impurities. Research organization “AfricaRice” collected data from 110 millers who used Engelberg mills and noticed that their production changed from poor milled rice quality to increased milled rice quality in the local market (Futakuchi et al. 2013). Different projects, such as the National Rice Development Strategy for Benin in 2011 (MAEP 2011) and the National Rice Development Strategy second generation (SNDR2-2019/2025), implemented by the government have the goal of revitalizing the agricultural sector with the project statement “Benin will be able to produce enough quality milled rice to satisfy its own population’s needs, increase stakeholders’ incomes, and release surpluses for export” (Météo-France DClim 2020). In Nigeria, the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization trained rice farmers on Sawah Eco-technology, a method to increase rice production created by Prof. Wakatsuki (Ademiluyi et al. 2021). Nigerian governments also influenced the rice industry by imposing higher taxes on imported rice in order to encourage local production (Hamid et al. 2021). Ekanem et al. (2020) reported several national projects aimed at expanding domestic rice production with the goal of overcoming demand-market imbalance and making the country self-sufficient in rice production. In Senegal, Fiamohe et al. (2018) highlighted rice development strategies, such as the Grande Offensive Agricole pour la Nourriture et l’Abondance and the Agricultural Transformation Action Plan. The Coalition of African Rice Development was formed with the goal of doubling rice cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa over 10 years starting in 2008 (Demont and Ndour 2015; Seck et al. 2010). However, Adjah et al. (2022) reported that between 2008 and 2018, the increase in rice production in sub-Saharan Africa was primarily due to area expansion in an extensive agricultural production system. According to Demont et al. (2013), Nigeria and the Ivory Coast can attribute their actual progress in rice production to their national development strategies, which include investments in processing and supply chain upgrading, as well as supply shifting investments in area expansion, intensification, and mechanization. As world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, mainly concentrated in Asia and Africa, global production will need to nearly double (Connor et al. 2022). In assessing rice self-sufficiency, Van Oort et al. (2015) stated that policymakers should consider three options to meet future consumption: (1) increase yields, (2) increase imports, and (3) area expansion. He stated that if the percentage of production cannot be as high as needed, then importation would still be necessary. While West African countries are implementing several policies to reduce importation and improve food security, it is obvious that focusing on increasing production volumes alone will lead to saturation of local markets and processing (Demont and Ndour 2015). Additionally, Fiamohe et al. (2018) deduced that in urban markets, an increase in local production does not fully translate into an increase in urban consumption. Britwum and Demont (2021) stated that an effective self-sufficiency goal for rice must go beyond agronomic traits and include preferences tailored to consumers whose opinions have been shaped by cultural and colonial heritage. It is thus necessary to evaluate which factors correlate with urban consumer expectations and how local rice upgrading value chains could profit from these rapidly expanding market opportunities. Although the government and rice institutions have limited imported rice and launched initiatives in West Africa to boost rice production (Hamid et al. 2021), imported rice brands are still found in large quantities in Benin’s urban markets. Most recent studies and experiments based on West African local rice markets have considered the intrinsic attributes of rice as a segment with major improvements in the last decade. Intrinsic qualities are defined as product characteristics, such as color, cleanliness, purity, grain shape and size, grain homogeneity, the proportion of head rice, aroma, taste, and swelling capacity (Bissah et al. 2022; Mané et al. 2021; Rutsaert et al. 2013). Enhancing these characteristics increases consumers’ willingness to pay for local rice (Demont and Ndour 2015). However, few documents are available for stakeholders and policymakers on how the improvement of extrinsic functions can also be important levitate of consumer preference for local rice, though it has been highlighted as an area that matters for market development and performance improvement (Ibrahim et al. 2020; Obih and Baiyegunhi 2018). Extrinsic qualities include packaging, brand label, certification, reputation, information and promotion campaigns, proximity, advertisement, price, and availability (Amfo et al. 2022; Bairagi et al. 2021; Obih and Baiyegunhi 2018; Demont and Ndour 2015; Rutsaert et al. 2013; Tomlins et al. 2005). Obih and Baiyegunhi (2018) highlighted the need for improvements in marketing functions of the local rice industry in Nigeria. Demont and Ndour’s (2015), study on upgrading rice value chains found experimental evidence from 11 African markets supporting the need for additional investment in extrinsic quality attributes. These need to be improved and more effectively tailored to urban consumer demand to differentiate local from imported rice. Recent studies have provided approaches, such as prioritizing the establishment of marketing policies and strategies based on customer demand and expectations. Such analyses are relevant in the context of our study and address the need to know where efforts have to be focused to match local rice production with high urban consumer expectations. Understanding urban consumer preferences and the value placed on extrinsic attributes, is critical for local rice producers and policymakers seeking to increase rice production and consumption. This study’s overall objective is understanding how to reduce Benin’s dependence on importation by increasing the purchase behaviors of local brands by urban consumers through the improvement of external rice attributes. The specific objectives are investigating which extrinsic factors influence consumers’ purchasing decisions and evaluating local rice producers’ considerations of extrinsic attributes in a market with high expectations and competition. This study used a binomial logit to test the hypothesis that, on the one hand, marketing and communication strategies built on extrinsic attributes representing the study’s explanatory variables can increase local rice brands’ competitiveness in Benin urban areas. On the other hand, local rice producers who do not adopt proper marketing functions based on extrinsic attributes are likely to have fewer sales in the urban market. In the sphere of continuous improvement of the intrinsic quality of rice in Benin, what are the effects of extrinsic variable enhancements on consumers’ preference for locally produced rice brands in urban markets? This study examined urban consumer behaviors and extrinsic factors driving their purchase decisions on rice.",
