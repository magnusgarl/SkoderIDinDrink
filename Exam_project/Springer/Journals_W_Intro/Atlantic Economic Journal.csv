Virgo: A Career Spent in Service to the Development of the Science and Art of Economics,September 2013,David E. Ault,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In ways that will be discussed shortly, peer review of papers and manuscripts submitted for inclusion in the programs of professional organizations and publication in the journals and other publications sponsored by those organizations is even more important today than it was in the early 1970s. When John founded the IAES, essentially the only way that a scholar could have his or her work published or presented was to submit a manuscript or synopsis/outline to an editor or conference organizer. After screening by appropriate organization personnel, those prospective pieces were then reviewed by peers in the field to determine if the work would advance our understanding of some aspect of the discipline. Even the working paper series published by many of the Ph.D. granting universities and research institutes were reviewed by the editor of the series before these drafts were circulated among interested parties. This widespread practice insured that virtually no piece was added to the canon of the fields of the discipline without some level of peer review, which diminished the likelihood that readers or members of the audience who were not experts in the field were exposed to concepts and conclusions that were inconsistent with the body of work that preceded them. With the advent of the Internet and Social Media, this is no longer the case. Anyone can now create a web log, “blog,” and post his or her musings, where they will literally float forever. The fundamental issue or weakness with blogs is that they are unsubstantiated opinion. Regardless of the credentials of the blogger and the documentation used to support their arguments, the resulting piece is no more than an opinion. Until that opinion is subjected to some level of scrutiny by at least one qualified, preferably unbiased peer, the posting is little more than one person’s perspective on a particular topic. Bloggers are free to use their expertise in one field to imply that they have equivalent expertise in an unrelated discipline. We find, therefore, Nobel Prize winners in the sciences claiming to hold superior positions on ethical issues such as abortion or transplant lists while Oscar winners hold court on the outcomes of political elections or the proper role of U. S. Foreign Policy in the Far East. Without peer review, it is impossible to know if any of these blogs, tweets, or text messages contribute to our understanding of the issues at hand. When my wife was pursuing her baccalaureate in Journalism, she was told that she could not submit material attributed to a specific person unless the item had been verified by two additional sources. Direct quotes were permitted only if recorded or confirmed by two independent sources. This created pressure to verify key parts of any story because deadlines loomed. This also led to the discussion of what transpired at a given place and time over a period of a few days as material was gathered and verified. This resulted in far fewer factual errors, misquotes, and manipulation of quotes than is presently the case with the “24 Hour News Cycle.” With the pressure to broadcast what is deemed “news” worthy before the competition breaks the story, there is little or no effort to verify the information that is being disseminated. The creation of Twitter, Facebook, and other forms of social media that place immediacy over accuracy leads to an environment in which one is never certain as to the validity of the material that he or she is reading, watching, or listening to. The coverage of the “Newtown Massacre” illustrates this issue all too well.Footnote 1 Within an hour of the initial announcement that that the school had been the site of the murder of an unknown number of persons, including children, the shooter’s mother, Nancy Lanza, was misidentified as a teacher at the school. The killer was “identified” as Ryan Lanza, the actual shooter’s older brother. Ryan Lanza was not even in the state at the time of shootings, yet reporters sought out and interviewed acquaintances of the older Mr. Lanza before the local authorities were able to identify the remains of the actual shooter, Adam Lanza. Anyone basing their discussion of the Newtown slayings on the information distributed by such organizations as National Public Radio, CBS News, or The New York Times within the 24-hour news cycle would likely have transmitted more misinformation than actual facts. Even refereed publications are not immune to the pressure to publish before being “scooped.” The prestigious British Medical Journal, The Lancet, is now known more for the mistake that it made with respect to vaccines and autism than it is for the quality of the medical research that it has published since 1823. In 1998, The Lancet published an article claiming to have found a link between childhood vaccines or the vaccination process and autism in young children.Footnote 2 In fact, the article was not peer reviewed, and it was based on a sample of 11 observations that was not created for the purpose of studying autism. Despite objections from some on the Lancet staff based on the work not meeting the normal peer reviewed standard, the article was published.Footnote 3 The damage that this incident has caused to the credibility of the journal will take years to repair and can only be undone by insuring all pieces that appear in the journal are subject to an accepted peer review process. The role of peer-reviewed publications and conferences like IAES journals and conferences is more important in the Internet age than in previous eras because readers and listeners should be assured that the material being presented is consistent with the body of literature to which the authors wish to add. One cannot expect an audience to develop the expertise to be able to act as his or her own referee in all but a small number of fields. We in the profession as well as those who rely upon our work must be able to demonstrate that the work is consistent with the body of knowledge upon which it is based, that is, something more than simply unsubstantiated opinion. No discipline can advance without a peer review process. The conferences sponsored and made possible by the IAES staff serve one major purpose in addition to providing the opportunity for authors to present their work, that is, to permit colleagues to assemble in one place to exchange ideas over the course of a few days. The creation of “chat rooms” and other online forums does not substitute for face to face conversations. It is difficult to write notes on napkins and slips of paper while conversing when one is sitting before a computer, smart phone, or electronic reader. Conversations just do not take place in cyberspace as they do when face-to-face. It is hard to get answers to questions on complex topics into 140 characters, even when one knows the code in which the other person is writing. There is one other attribute that journals and conferences have that cannot be adequately replicated digitally: the library effect. One of the concerns that has been expressed by scholars is that, with the digitization of the materials that used to be disseminated primarily by libraries, the experience of going into the stacks and card catalogs is lost. When one had to go to the library to find materials, one, while looking for a specific work, had to scan other material in the same location. As a result, the researcher frequently found additional material, some of which was better fitted to his or her purposes than the work that was reason for the search. Simply leafing through the cards in a subject index would yield an initial bibliography of a dozen or so works. However, the publication of several articles, especially the diversity that tends to appear in general purpose journals such as The Atlantic Economic Journal (AEJ) or International Advances in Economic Research (IAER), within the cover of a single issue allows the reader to serendipitously yet efficiently find other articles or entries that may be of interest. In the digital age, even though one can download the table of contents of a given journal, the managing editor and staff of the journal have to put the issue together before one can search its contents. Conferences afford the same efficiency in that one can attend a number of sessions on a variety of topics by spending a few days, usually in a location in which people want to gather, and walking from one presentation site to another. It is easy to add or drop presentations, ask questions of a number of authors, exchange comments with others who are part of the audience, meet with co-authors, or simply to renew old friendships. There is no way to replicate the comprehensive nature of the conference through videoconferencing and other applications in cyberspace. Scholarly societies that publish journals and organize conferences have, therefore, an indispensable role to play in the expansion of the knowledge base of economics or any other discipline. The peer review process is the key to creation of new knowledge. The publication of journals and the organization of conferences are among the most efficient ways to disseminate that information.",

Kohn,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The cause of John’s premature death is all the more tragic because of his extensive scholarly contributions to the economics of healthcare. His last three books were Health Care: An International Perspective (1984), Exploring New Vistas in Health Care (1985), and Restructuring Health Policy: An International Challenge (1986). Of his 49 articles and chapters in books, 11 were on health care. Of the 52 papers presented at conferences, healthcare was the subject of 16 of them. David Ault, past Dean of the School of Business at SIUE, attributes John’s interest in health care economics to his wife’s scholarly achievements in that area, which is all the more to John’s credit. When I suggested to Kathy that as “outstanding as your career has been, I suspect that his encouragement played a part in it” (email 12/10/12), she replied: “You are correct. He was always there for me, supporting me in whatever I chose to do. Life is not the same without him by my side” (email 12/23/12). About the same time as John’s death from bacterial meningitis, a specialty pharmacy-related meningitis outbreak occurred. This outbreak and the related policy debacles were made public in the appearance of Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the U.S. House of Representatives on November 14, 2012. Included in her statement was some disturbing background information. In March 1992, the Agency had issued a Compliance Policy Guide delineating the FDA’s enforcement policy on pharmacy compounding (the mixing of drugs to physician specifications), to which the compounding industry objected. “. . . several bills were introduced, some with significant support, to limit the Agency’s oversight of compounding. In May 1966, in a House Commerce Committee hearing on FDA reform legislation, FDA Commissioner David Kessler testified that the compounding provision being considered by the Committee was likely to encourage large scale manufacturing under the guise of pharmacy compounding, and could allow for potentially dangerous compounding of sterile products, leading to serious safety problems or death.” (Hamburg 2012, 5) The subsequent Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, which addressed the FDA’s authority over compounded drugs, exempted such drugs from the following three critical provisions of the act: “the premarket approval requirement for ‘new drugs’; the requirement that a drug be made in compliance with current good manufacturing practice; and the requirement that the drug bear adequate directions for use, providing conditions are met.” (Hamburg 5) Such brazen exemptions characterized the rejection of regulation that was growing among conservative congressmen. Abetted by present laws, Commissioner Hamburg charged that the New England Compounding Center in Framingham (NECC) “has repeatedly disputed [the] FDA’s jurisdiction over its facility,” noting that when the “Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy re-inspected NECC in 2011 [, … it] found the facility to be ‘satisfactory’” (4). Based on my reading of Hamburg’s statement, I would argue for a new rule, that any compounding pharmacy that ships “out of the state” as much as “5 % of [its] total prescriptions” should be subject to strict FDA authority (5). As the situation stands, there is a palpable conflict of interest at the state level that such a rule would eliminate.",1

Muteba Mwamba,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"On the one hand, Leamer (2007) notes that eight out of ten post-war recessions in the U.S. were preceded by shocks to the housing sector. This number rises to nine, when we include the recent “Great Recession”. In this regard, Nyakabawo et al. (2015) stress the importance of housing prices shocks in particular. On the other hand, Hamilton (2008) indicates that nine of ten recessions in the U.S. since World War II have been preceded by an increase in oil prices. Interestingly, Hamilton (2009) even goes as far as arguing that a large proportion of the recent downturn in the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) during the “Great Recession” can also be attributed to the oil price shock of 2007-2008. In this regard, Kaufmann et al. (2011) identified a significant long-run (cointegrating) relationship between household expenditures on energy and U.S. mortgage delinquency rates, and hence, postulate a direct role for energy prices in the 2008 financial crisis. In addition, Breitenfellner et al. (2015) analysed, using conditional logit models, the role played by energy inflation as a determinant of downward corrections in housing prices, based on a dataset 18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies spanning four decades. The authors provided strong evidence that increases in energy price inflation raised the probability of such corrective periods taking place. Given this, an important research question is to analyse the many channels underlying the relationship between housing and oil prices:Footnote 1 (i) Oil price hikes adversely affect economic growth (as discussed above), and thus, dampen the demand for housing, and reduce the price; (ii) However, oil price increases are likely to increase construction and operational building costs, which might result in a decline in the supply of housing, thus pushing price up; (iii) If there is a tightening of monetary policy to curb the pressure induced by oil price increases on headline inflation, this is likely to withdraw liquidity from the housing market and hence, reduce housing prices through a fall in demand; (iv) However, if housing is used as an inflation-hedge, the inflationary-effect of oil prices might increase housing demand and hence, raise prices; (v) An increase in oil returns might also be associated with moving funds into the oil market at the expense of investment in housing as an asset, thus reducing price. So in summary, though an increase in oil price could either increase or decrease housing prices, depending on the strengths of the various channels, it is more likely that the negative impact is likely to dominate on average. Such a presumption has to do with the economy-wide negative impact generally associated with oil price hikes. But this remains to be empirically verified. Against this backdrop, our paper investigates the time-varying interdependence between real housing returns and real oil returns for the U.S. economy over the annual period of 1859–2013, allowing for a set of control variables (economic growth, inflation and the interest rate) that are known to affect both these markets (Breitenfellner et al. 2015). Specifically, we construct time-varying measures of correlations between real housing market returns and real oil price returns based on the dynamic conditional correlation generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model of Engle (2002). Taking into account both time variation and conditional heterogeneity in correlations, the proposed measure has several advantages compared to other commonly used indicators. For instance, it is able to distinguish negative correlations due to single episodes, synchronous behavior during stable years and asynchronous behavior in turbulent years. Unlike rolling windows, an alternative way to capture time variability, the proposed measure does not suffer from the so-called “ghost features,” as the effects of a shock are not reflected in n consecutive periods, with n being the window-span. In addition, under the proposed approach there is neither need to set a window span, nor loss of observations, nor is there a requirement for subsample estimation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to analyse the time-varying relationship between real housing returns and real oil returns covering over 150 years of U.S. history, with the start date corresponding to beginning of the modern era of the petroleum industry with the drilling of the first oil well in the U.S. at Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859.Footnote 2
 At this stage, it is important to indicate the reasons behind our preference to use a DCC-GARCH approach rather than a time-varying vector autoregressive (VAR) method. First, as it is well-known, identifying shocks in a VAR would require us to order the variables. However, at an annual frequency, it is difficult to postulate which variable should be ordered first, i.e. is believed to be more exogenous. Of course, one could use various orderings and check for the robustness of the results. But then again, this would not guard against the possibility that the degree of exogeneity over such a long-span of data did not vary over time. An alternative approach would have been to use sign-restricted time-varying VAR, but this would take away from us the very essence of our exercise of deciphering the correlation between these two variables, which as indicated in the paper could be either positive or negative. In other words, one could not have, without doubt, imposed a theory-based sign either. Keeping these issues in mind, we decided to resort to a DCC-GARCH approach, which provides us with a time-varying correlation between these two variables accounting for heteroscedastic disturbances, without having to worry about the ordering of variables or sign-restrictions in a VAR model. Having said this, one limitation of our approach, given the long time-span of data, is our inability to control for other important variables (like macroeconomic and demographic) which are likely to affect both real housing and oil returns.Footnote 3 In such a multivariate setting, a VAR approach is preferable, as it also allows us to analyze the importance of the other variables (shocks) in the relationship between housing prices and oil price. Nevertheless, given that our concern is a time-varying analysis of correlation between these two variables, the DCC-GARCH framework can be considered most appropriate in the context of our study. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that comovements between housing and oil market returns are consistently negative over time, apart from periods of U.S. recessions during the 19th century, wherein correlations are positive.",18

In this context, two questions become ever more relevant to policymakers: What are the benefits and costs of minimum wages? The first question produced a plethora of papers that agree that minimum wages decrease inequality but disagree on the size of this effect (e.g. Neumark and Wascher 2006; Manning 2003). In contrast, the discussion of minimum wage costs yields strong disagreement. Empirical papers point to negative, positive or insignificant minimum wage effects on employment. The following analysis aims to tackle this question, where the focus is youth employment. The reason for the restriction to the younger age class is twofold. Firstly, the soaring youth unemployment in post-crisis Europe has become a pressing issue to policymakers. Secondly, minimum wages should have a more pronounced impact on young workers, since they are more likely to work in low-skill sectors (Manning 2003). The present paper employs a fixed-effects panel data model covering 19 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries in order to estimate a nonlinear relationship between minimum wages and youth employment. In particular, it will be shown that the minimum wage effect on youth employment varies with labour market institutions. The motivation for considering nonlinearities follows Coe and Snower’s (1997) hypothesis that institutions form synergies in their interactions. In the context of minimum wages, this hypothesis has only been thoroughly examined by Neumark and Wascher (2004). However, Neumark and Wascher’s paper suffers from the low quality of institutional variables. The present research paper employs better institutional and control variables as well as a larger number of observations. In doing so, significant negative synergies are estimated between minimum wages and institutions that enforce labour market rigidity such as unemployment benefits and union density, while a positive synergy is found with active labour market policies that constitute training for the unemployed. Two key conclusions follow. Firstly, many minimum wage panel data models are misspecified as they omit the interactive term with labour market institutions, which might account for some of the discrepancy in empirical evidence. Secondly, policymakers need to consider the institutional setting faced before adjusting minimum wages. This paper suggests that minimum wage raises in rigid markets will depress youth employment particularly strongly.",2

Malkiel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Baumol is best known for his contributions emphasizing the inexorable relative increase in the costs facing the service sectors of the economy. Known as the eponymous ailment “Baumol’s Disease,” his insight has wide applicability to both microeconomic and macroeconomic phenomena. Baumol developed the cost-disease model in a series of writings published during the 1960s, most notably his book with William G. Bowen on the economics of the performing arts (e.g., Baumol and Bowen 1966 and Baumol 1967). As he pointed out, different sectors of the economy have experienced significant differences in their ability to realize productivity gains. In both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, new technologies, investments in labor-saving capital, and economies of scale have resulted in persistent gains in productivity, i.e., in increases in output per labor-hour worked. The cumulative gains in productivity have offset the tendency for wages to rise over time, and the prices of goods in the technologically progressive sectors have tended to rise more slowly than the overall rate of inflation. In some cases, such as the production of computers and mobile phones, productivity gains have been sufficiently large, enough that the prices of these goods have actually fallen over time. In other sectors of the economy, notably the service sectors, productivity gains are much harder to achieve. The classic example offered by Baumol and Bowen (1966) is the preparation, practicing, and performance of a string quartet. It still takes four musicians to perform a string quartet, exactly the same number that it took during Mozart’s time. While some service industries have benefited from important productivity enhancements, it remains true that in the so-called “handicraft” services, it is more difficult to achieve productivity gains. Hence in fields such as the performed arts (Baumol fought a losing battle with his publisher to retitle his book with Bowen since the arts were performed—not performing), education, healthcare, and productivity gains are likely to be smaller than in the manufacturing industries. With wages rising throughout the economy, it follows that the relative costs of providing services in the sectors experiencing slower productivity growth will rise relative to those sectors enjoying rapid productivity growth. Thus, the relative costs of services such as theatre tickets, concert performances, and education will tend to rise faster than the general level of inflation. The problem is not restricted to education and the arts. Computers have gotten cheaper, but healthcare has not. The insight has important macroeconomic implications. In an economy where rising incomes increase the demand for services, the share of economic output devoted to the service sectors tends to rise. In the developed countries of the world, including the United States, Japan, and Western Europe, services account for about three-quarters of each country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Baumol et al. (1989) predicted these changes during the late 1980s. Another implication of Baumol’s research is that the overall rate of productivity growth will become smaller over time. The current slowdown in productivity growth throughout the developed world, where services have increased in importance, is entirely consistent with the Baumol cost-disease model. Baumol’s Disease also has profound implications for urban finance and what he called “the crisis of the larger cities” (Baumol 1967). Many of the services provided by municipal government are afflicted by cost disease. Consider police protection, education, health and welfare services, and garbage removal. While some productivity enhancements have proved feasible, most of the services provided by cities are in areas where technological change is likely to be slower than in the provision of manufactured products. Thus, Baumol argued, “The upward trend in the real costs of municipal services cannot be expected to halt” (Baumol 1967, p. 423). The inexorable rise in municipal government budgets should not be ascribed to malfeasance or mismanagement. “This is a trend for which no man and no group should be blamed, for there is nothing that can be done to stop it” (Baumol 1967, p. 423). In an interview with Alan Krueger in the Journal of Economic Perspectives (2001), Baumol was passionate in his defense of service sector activities. He noted the public outcry over the terribly high price of a college education, even though it cost fewer labor hours than it did 50 years prior. The public focuses on the fact that a college education costs twice as many automobiles as it did then. “The danger is that we will deny ourselves education, that we will deny ourselves a lot of the activities or the products whose costs are determined by the cost disease,” Baumol said (Krueger 2001, p. 217), “You can think of all sorts of horrible things that can happen”. Garbage removal and police protection could become less effective and the arts and education could suffer substantially. Baumol was a lifelong champion of public support of the arts and education.",

While conventional tools for analysing pathways towards integration can, by applying them in reverse, provide some insights, disentangling a country from a form of integration as comprehensive as the EU is plainly about much more than rescinding a preferential trading agreement. Consequently, the secession of the United Kingdom (UK) from the Union poses challenges to economists and the analytical tools of the profession. These challenges are accentuated by the political ramifications of the Brexit decision and the role in it of expert analysis. During the referendum campaign, those advocating “remain” repeatedly stressed the likely economic costs of leaving the EU, attracting the dismissive label from their opponents of “Project Fear”, echoing similar criticisms levelled at the “no” side in the 2014 Scottish independence vote. At one point in the campaign, this even led Michael Gove (one of the dissident members of David Cameron’s government allowed to campaign, against the government line, in favor of Brexit) to assert, in a Sky News interview (Gove 2016), “people have had enough of experts”. In the nine months following the referendum, the British economy seemed to weather the storm, growing at around the rate forecast earlier in 2016 on the assumption the country would remain in the EU, triggering predictable gloating from many on the “leave” side. However, growth slowed in the first quarter of 2017 and various survey data, published in the run up to the snap general election called for June 2017, suggested a deceleration of the economy. The unexpected outcome of the general election has accentuated uncertainty, not just about how the UK will now reconfigure its relationship with the EU, and has renewed concerns about the economic impact. For the economists, as for the pollsters who misread voting intentions in both the referendum and the 2015 and 2017 UK general elections, their credibility as contributors to political debate is under challenge. It can always be argued that public debate is too quick to ignore standard health warnings about margins of error, the need for simplifying assumptions and the fact that projections are often “what if” exercises. Equally, the use (and misuse) of the various modelling exercises has often been predicated on an exaggerated certainty about the quality and robustness of analysis, suggesting that the involvement of economists in contentious political issues is fraught with danger. The resulting conundrum is how to reconcile making effective contributions to debates in which economics ought to have a contribution to make, while retaining enough detachment to be (and be seen to be) non-partisan. This article continues by summarising some of the key views about how leaving the EU will affect the UK economy, then turns to ex-ante assessments of the likely impact on the UK economy. The following sections discuss the UK’s trade linkages and the political economy of Brexit. A concluding discussion examines the implications for economists.",11

By 1990, foreign-owned U.S. dollar securities and real assets were larger than U.S.-owned foreign assets. This dramatic change in the U.S. international investment position occurred even though the U.S. Treasury had not borrowed in a foreign currency and few U.S. firms had sold their debts to foreign lenders to obtain the money to finance their U.S. activities. Instead, the change in the U.S. international investment position resulted from the surge in foreign purchases of U.S. dollar securities. The first dramatic reversal in the U.S. international investment position was during World War I when the U.S. morphed from an international debtor to an international creditor. The U.S. had become an international debtor at birth in 1789, since non-residents owned some of the physical assets in the then 13 states. Moreover, the revolutionary government had borrowed $5 million from the French government in 1778. U.S. international indebtedness increased throughout the nineteenth century as state governments and the railroads sold their debts in London and other foreign centers. In 1910, U.S. international indebtedness was less than one percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). During the First World War, British and other European demand for U.S. foodstuffs and munitions increased. Initially these purchases were financed with money from selling U.S. securities acquired in the nineteenth century and then from selling debts to American investors and the U.S. government. The U.S. international creditor position increased modestly over the next 70 years as a small part of U.S. saving was used to purchase foreign securities and real assets. The sharp increase in foreign demand for U.S. dollar securities in the 1980s might have resulted from shocks in Japan, Germany, and other foreign countries that led to declines in investment spending and increases in excess saving. Alternatively, the shock might have originated in the U.S., which could have experienced an increase in U.S. investment spending (or an increase in the U.S. fiscal deficit) relative to U.S. domestic saving. The increase in the U.S. trade deficit and the counterpart re-configuration of trade imbalances reflect changes in the saving-investment relationship. The U.S. had a trade deficit during most of the 100 years when its net debtor position was increasing. Did the change in the configuration of the U.S. and foreign trade balances in the 1980s reflect that the U.S. demand for saving had become larger than U.S. investment, or instead did the increase in the foreign demand for U.S. dollar securities displace U.S. saving? The reversal in the U.S. international investment position occurred soon after the transition from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangement of adjustable parities to the floating currency arrangement. The IMF arrangement had been designed to limit changes in the prices of currencies and the size of each country’s current account deficit or surplus. There are no such limits under the floating rate arrangement. It seems unlikely that the changes in the rules for exchange market intervention by central banks and adoption of the floating currency arrangement would have had a significant impact on saving and investment in individual countries. New rules might have been adopted to limit changes in the market price of the U.S. dollar and the real price projected from differences in national inflation rates. There have been four episodes since 1980 when the U.S. capital account surplus increased. One occurred in each of the four decades: 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. These changes in the U.S. capital account surplus in each decade can be identified as a dollar cycle. Each cycle had an expansive phase when the U.S. capital account surplus increased and a contractive phase when this surplus declined. The price of U.S. securities increased in the expansive phase of each of the four cycles. The price of the U.S. dollar increased in the expansive phase of the first, second, and fourth cycle. A recession followed the end of each of the contractive phases. The first question that is addressed is whether the shock that led to the large change in the U.S. international investment position in the 1980s originated in the U.S. because the U.S. had too little saving or in Japan and other countries that had excess saving. Several of my earlier works (e.g., Aliber 2018) referred to the crowding-out versus crowding-in distinction. Did American borrowers crowd out foreign borrowers by paying higher interest rates than some displaced foreign borrowers would have paid? Alternatively, did the foreign savers crowd into the U.S. market and displace American savers by accepting lower interest rates than some American savers would have accepted? The second question pertains to adjustments in the U.S. economy that occurred to ensure that there would be an increase in the U.S. current account deficit that would correspond to the autonomous increase in the U.S. capital account surplus. Otherwise, the market in the U.S. dollar would not have cleared. The transfer problem process was at work in the U.S. as in Iceland. U.S. domestic demand had to expand to absorb the real resources that were the counterpart of the financial transfer to the U.S. The principal factor that led to the increase in U.S. household and business demand was the surge in household wealth. The third question is why openness of the U.S. economy to the inflow of foreign saving led to a secular decline in the competitiveness of firms that produce in the U.S., as is evident in the increase in the average annual U.S. trade deficit as a ratio of U.S. GDP from each successive decade since 1980. The increase in the U.S. capital account surplus led to a higher price for the U.S. dollar and hence to a decline in the competitiveness of firms producing in the U.S. The U.S. industrial economy was hollowed out as some industrial capacity was scrapped. As U.S. manufacturing capacity declined, the price of the U.S. dollar would tend to be lower for each level of foreign investment in the U.S. The fourth question, one in counterfactual history, is whether the U.S. would have morphed into the world’s largest debtor if the adjustable parity arrangement had been retained. Once one is in the realm of counterfactual history, a multitude of different assumptions can be made. The U.S. became a major international debtor because market forces led to sharp undervaluation of the currencies of the major U.S. trading partners. If the rules for currency market intervention had required that countries limit the undervaluation of their currencies, then the U.S. international debtor position would have increased at a less rapid rate.",2

McCauley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the late 1950s, the U.S. dollar began to extend its domain. First came bank accounts in London (Schenk 1998), then Eurobonds issued by firms and governments (O’Malley 2015). U.S. policy, including interest rate caps, reserve requirements and deposit insurance on domestic bank accounts, and even controls on capital outflows all pushed dollar intermediation offshore (Aliber 1980, 2016). Today, banks and investors hold $12 trillion of claims on borrowers outside the U.S. These borrowers owe a like amount arising from off-balance-sheet commitments to buy dollars against foreign currencies. Half or more of the world economy lies in a dollar zone defined by having a currency more stable against the dollar than against the euro or other key currency. Oddly enough, dollar depreciation eases global credit conditions even as the rest of the world loses wealth on net. From the late 1950s, influential voices have argued that the dollar’s global role suffers from inherent instability. Triffin (1960) argued that the world’s need for dollars would either cripple trade or unhinge the dollar from gold in the era of fixed exchange rates. Later, after the dollar floated against major currencies, (Volcker and Feldstein 2013) and many others ascribed unsustainable U.S. current account deficits to the global demand for dollars. Most recently, Fahri et al. (2011) and Caballero et al. (2017) worried that the demand for safe assets would either encounter a crippling shortage or would lead the U.S. Treasury to over-borrow. Against these voices, Kindleberger (1965), McKinnon (1969) and Bordo and McCauley (2019) argued that there was no inherent instability in the dollar’s role. A related question is whether the dollar’s broad use confers an exorbitant privilege on the U.S. economy, as alleged in France in the 1960s (Eichengreen 2011). Those who see the dollar’s role as unstable tend to see it as lucrative so that fairness joins necessity in pointing to change. This brief overview paper contends that the global role of the dollar remains large and suffers from neither economic instability nor unacceptable privilege. The triple coincidence of the gross domestic product (GDP) area, maximizing agents and a single currency’s use does not hold (Avdjiev et al., 2016). In particular, since the dollar’s domain does not coincide with the U.S. economy, the rest of the world can supply itself with dollars and benefit from any favorable financing opportunities in the dollar. The global domain of the dollar has changed both the effect and operation of U.S. monetary policy. Offshore dollar debts and the dollar zone give the Fed’s policy often overlooked power, directly and indirectly, to alter monetary conditions globally. Offshore dollar debt imparts to movements in the dollar some surprising effects. Dollar depreciation can make dollar borrowers more creditworthy and ease the supply of credit to them. In 2008 and 2020, the Fed found reason within its domestic mandate to extend dollar credit abroad freely when dollar funding markets seized up and thereby extended its backstop to the dollar’s global domain. Looking forward, political forces, not economic forces, constrain this backstop. The rest of this paper poses and answers eight questions. The first four concern the domain and economics of global dollar markets: banking, bond and foreign exchange. The fifth and sixth address widely held views, arguably myths, that the dollar’s international role is inherently unstable and is lucrative to the U.S. economy. The seventh and eighth deal with macro policy: The Federal Reserve’s capacity to backstop the global domain of the dollar.",5

It complements studies that are concerned with structural differences between public- and private-sector employment and remuneration (Bosch 2006; Mavromaras et al., 2017). The empirical and theoretical literatures suggest a relationship between public- and private-sector wages. The direction of causality is tested using Granger-causality analysis and applying vector-error-correction models (VECMs) with quarterly data from South Africa for the period 2000 to 2016. Remuneration patterns constitute an important linkage between the micro- and macro-spheres of the economy. On the microlevel, they reflect the incentives and constraints for individual decisions about how many hours to work and which wage to accept. On the macrolevel, wage dynamics have important consequences for inflation, unemployment and, through work experience, productivity. Together, this affects the sacrifice ratio or, in other terms, the real costs needed to maintain price stability. For instance, in a bargaining system with more than one trade union, wage leadership reduces the effective number of independent trade unions and increases the degree of centralisation of wage bargaining. Assuming that the leading trade union has some degree of inflation aversion, this could allow the central bank to be more accommodative while simultaneously reducing inflation and unemployment to their lowest socially optimal levels (Coricelli et al., 2006). Without referring to monetary policy regimes, either completely centralised or completely decentralised, bargaining systems are associated with better macroeconomic performance (Calmfors and Driffill, 1988). One of the reasons why the remuneration pattern is important comes from the structural diversity of the economy. A familiar approach is to distinguish between economic activity that is exposed to international competition, and economic activity that is not as exposed. The separation into a public sector and a private sector, which is applied in this paper, makes the same distinction. Exporters, especially when located in small, open economies, usually face competition from other global suppliers. Maintaining cost and price competitiveness imposes an immediate constraint on wage-cost dynamics. This does not mean that the wages paid by export-oriented producers should be lower. It only means that external competition guides how far wage costs can go. Suppliers serving the domestic economy face competition only from among themselves and potential market entrants. The strength of the competition then depends on technological characteristics, market size and regulation. Usually, domestic competition, when sheltered from international suppliers, is less fierce than in export-oriented sectors, and the scope for open or tacit collusion is potentially significant. The public sector is free from competition concerns on the supply side. The wage bill is constrained by the budget, while the earnings and employment split are influenced by alternative options in the private sector (Fearon 2004). Furthermore, there is evidence for a close relationship between the wage rate and per capita government spending in South Africa (Alm and Embaye, 2010). This could also be linked to the stated policy goals in the National Development Plan (NDP) and the New Growth Path (NGP), as well as earlier strategic policy documents, which put poverty alleviation at the centre of government policies (NDP 2012; NGP 2011). In general terms, one can assume that private-sector earnings are driven more by market developments than by public-sector earnings. Therefore, the direction of causality either increases (for public-sector earnings following the private-sector developments) or decreases (for private-sector following public-sector earnings) the role of market forces. Therefore, different exposure to competition in the product markets generates a different framework for wage negotiations and outcomes, even if labour-force regulation (specifically dismissal protection) is applied uniformly throughout the economy. This heterogeneity becomes even more important if wage bargaining follows a pattern, meaning that negotiations in one sector follow the outcomes in another sector. In such cases, the orientation of the wage leader to price stability has important consequences for the sacrifice ratio, which is determined by the pressure on the wage-formation process to limit inflationary wage increases. Perhaps this is most true for the relationship between public- and private-sector earnings because there is an asymmetry of budget constraints between the two sectors. In other words, the public sector has the capacity to let the earnings of its employees deviate from the private sector, regardless of market forces. Therefore, the public- and private-sector earnings pattern is relevant for the efficiency of market forces contributing to the restoration and subsequent maintenance of a labour-market equilibrium.",2

Dwyer,Rachel Kreier,Maria X. Sanmartin,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Smartphone ownership is now almost universal among younger age groups, with more than nine in 10 individuals born after 1981 owning a smartphone (Vogels 2019), while the proportion of American adults who use the internet increased from 14% to 87% in the two decades since 1995 (Duggan et al. 2015). Many of the consequences of the burgeoning use of information and communication technology are good. Cell phones summon ambulances to accident sites. Global positioning system apps provide directions for the lost. Video calls allow parents overseas to maintain connections with their faraway children. One can only imagine how much deeper social isolation would have been had the current pandemic taken place in a pre-Zoom world. The benefits are perhaps most pronounced in the field of education. There is a vast literature on the benefits of technology for student academic achievement (Burnett and Merchant 2014; Merchant et al. 2014). However, there is growing evidence of risks associated with too much of a good thing, especially with the social networking and gaming aspects of technology. Concern often focuses on teens and young adults, since their heavy use of the new technologies is well-documented. A telephone survey conducted for the not-for-profit organization Common Sense Media reported that half of surveyed teens felt addicted to their mobile devices, and 60% of parents viewed their teenaged children as addicted (Common Sense Media 2016). Even in education, concerns are rising that smartphones disrupt students’ ability to concentrate (Gazzaley and Rosen 2016). The literature on internet addiction, cell-phone addiction, pathological internet use and problematic internet and phone use is growing rapidly, although surprisingly little of that work has appeared in economics journals thus far (see later discussion). In light of the broad range of concerns addressed in the literature, this study conceptualizes problematic use broadly, understanding the term to encompass behaviors ranging from overuse to dependence to addiction, as well as mental health problems such as anxiety and depression that some researchers have found to be associated with some types of technology use (Lepp et al. 2014; Rotondi et al. 2017). Much of the literature has focused on the existence and magnitude of technology addiction (Griffiths and Kuss 2017; Lopez-Fernandez et al. 2017). In a seminal article, Young (1998) constructed a scale of internet addiction based on the pathological gambling model in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Thus far, gambling is the only behavioral addiction included in the manual, although prominent voices have called for adding technology-related disorders, and the inclusion of some version of gaming addiction as a recognized disorder seems likely in future editions (Block 2008; Kuss et al. 2017). In succeeding years, Young’s index of addiction has been used to examine attributes of addicts, from gender to mental well-being (Davenport et al. 2014; Ogletree et al. 2014; Park et al. 2013). Another developing literature has examined the implications of technology addiction for a variety of academic, relationship and mental health outcomes (Lepp et al. 2014; Hampton et al. 2011; Magsamen-Conrad et al. 2014). Not all of the literature has found negative impacts of social use of technology on mental well-being for all users. Magsamen-Conrad et al. (2014) hypothesized that for some types of users, namely self-concealers, technology enhances online social capital and improves relationships and outcomes. They also found some evidence for heterogeneity both in the propensity to become addicted and in how addiction affects quality of life. A 2010 Pew survey found that adults who used social networking sites were significantly less likely to be socially isolated (Hampton et al. 2011). Given this evidence of heterogeneity, delineating the characteristics of the subset of users at high risk of problematic technology use is an important research goal. The work reported here begins to address this goal. The current study contributes to the literature on problematic technology use in several important ways. First, a data set was used that combined information on the use of phones and computers by teens and young adults for a broad range of purposes. Combined analysis of cell phones and computers becomes more important as advancing smartphone technology and the penetration of mobile tablet devices blurs the distinction between the two types of hardware platforms. Second, because the data set is nationally representative, the findings are of more general applicability than the findings of previous smaller surveys. Third, the study included an innovative set of analyses: 1. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the appropriateness of grouping technology use into three categories of utilitarian, social and entertainment purposes (the USE model); 2. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to uncover types of users based on utilization patterns, including one type likely to be at elevated risk of problematic use; 3. Regression analysis of the demographic characteristics of the user type that was hypothesized to be at the highest risk for problematic technology use; and 4. A seemingly unrelated regression analysis of the demographic characteristics of individuals prone to use technology for each of the three latent categories of purposes validated in the confirmatory analysis.",2

49.0,1.0,Atlantic Economic Journal,22 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11293-021-09698-2,Carry Trade Returns and Segmented Risk Pricing,March 2021,Gordon Schulze,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Carry trade strategies show a persistent outperformance compared to a passive benchmark strategy, even on a risk-adjusted basis, and appear to be unrelated to traditional risk factors (Burnside, 2011a; Byrne et al., 2018). Here, investors construct a zero-investment portfolio where they borrow funds in low interest rate currencies and invest in high interest rate currencies. At the end of the investment period, investors are exposed to exchange rate risk when converting the funds for local consumption. If the foreign interest rate (investment currency) is higher than the domestic interest rate (funding currency), the forward exchange rate is quoted at a premium.Footnote 1 Thus, when considering pure exchange rate risk, the high interest rate currency is expected to depreciate in order to prevent favorable trading opportunities. However, one can observe that investment currencies do not depreciate at the amount of the interest rate differential (Lustig & Verdelhan, 2007). Because of this, exchange rates become partly predictable (Della Corte et al., 2009) and an uncovered speculation strategy in the future spot exchange rate might be profitable. As this empirical observation is persistent over time, it has attracted considerable research interest. The literature controversially discusses the returns to carry trades as a risk premium for the uncovered exchange rate risk when considering risk-averse investors. Lustig and Verdelhan (2007, 2011) explained the cross section of currency returns by the consumption-based asset pricing model. Zviadadze (2017) provided evidence of multiple sources of consumption risk of currency returns. In contrast, Burnside (2011a, 2011b) showed that traditional risk factors, i.e., consumption risk, fail to explain carry-trade returns. He concluded that so far, there exists no unifying risk-based explanation of currency returns and stock returns. Menkhoff et al. (2012) related carry-trade returns to less traditional risk factors such as global foreign exchange volatility, while Christiansen et al. (2011) used an asset pricing model dependent on foreign exchange volatility regimes. Based on their results, currency returns are negatively correlated with global foreign exchange volatility and stock market risk of high interest rate currencies increases in regimes of high foreign exchange volatility. This asymmetric correlation with stock market risk points to a stream of literature that relates carry-trade returns to crash risk and peso events. Brunnermeier et al. (2008) showed that the returns of high interest rate currencies are negatively skewed and exposed to crash risk, which is related to funding illiquidity. Dobrynskaya (2014) and Lettau et al. (2014) explained the cross section of carry-trade returns with an asset pricing model accounting for stock market downside risk. In contrast, Byrne et al. (2018) showed that a common (carry-trade) risk factor produces smaller pricing errors compared to foreign exchange volatility and stock market downside risk. They concluded that carry trade portfolios are exposed to risk characteristics not captured by stock market downside risk and, thus, currency and stock markets are not completely integrated. Burnside (2011a) ruled out crash risk as currency crashes are not systematically correlated with distress in the stock market. Burnside et al. (2011) argued that there is a small probability of peso events, while the stochastic discount factor (SDF) in these states must be sufficiently large in order to justify carry-trade returns. Bhansali (2007) identified a relationship between carry-trade returns and implied volatility. He proposed that different risk pricing between the foreign exchange market and the options markets could lead to potential arbitrage opportunities. Clarida et al. (2009) replicated carry trades by foreign exchange option strategies and substantiated his findings. Jurek (2014) hedged crash risk with foreign exchange options and showed that crash-hedged carry trades still offer a great portion of unexplained excess returns. He concluded that carry-trade returns are not due to peso problems. Lustig et al. (2011) explained carry-trade returns by different loadings of each country’s SDF on a common global risk factor, which can be identified by the slope factor of currency returns sorted by their interest rates. Based on these findings, Verdelhan (2018) added a characteristics-based explanation by cross-country differences of preference parameters. With heterogeneous risk aversions of domestic and foreign investors, Verdelhan (2010) built a model that reproduces the uncovered interest rate parity puzzle, which forms the basis for currency returns. On an aggregate basis, Ornelas (2019) found predictive power of the volatility risk premium (risk aversion sentiment) over future currency returns. A similar conclusion was drawn by Demirer et al. (2020), who used a time-varying risk aversion index. This paper addresses carry-trade returns from a risk pricing perspective and contributes to the literature of proposed differences in risk pricing and heterogeneous risk aversion by an empirical analysis. It builds on the conclusion drawn by Burnside (2011a) that there appears to be no unifying risk-based explanation of currency returns and stock returns, and it extends the findings of Bhansali (2007) by quantifying his reasoning of different risk pricing. This paper adds to Verdelhan (2018) by estimating cross-country differences of preference parameters in terms of risk aversion as well as to Ornelas (2019) and Demirer et al. (2020) by disaggregating the relationship between risk aversion and carry-trade profitability at the country level. It also adds to Zviadadze (2017) by estimating preference parameters. The analysis differs from Verdelhan (2010), who applied a consumption-based asset pricing model with external habit preferences, and from research estimating time-varying implied risk aversion in the stock market (i.a., Rosenberg & Engle, 2002), as both consumption-based risk aversion and implied risk aversion across countries and time are examined, while relating potential differences to currency returns. If markets are complete, there should be a common SDF that prices states of nature, which, accordingly, should not be systematically different between financial market segments. Then, the change in exchange rates equals the ratio of the countries’ SDFs. With incomplete markets as in real life (Cochrane, 2005), i.e., not all states of nature can be spanned, the SDF is not unique (Backus et al., 2001). Thus, differences in risk pricing of financial market segments could lead to (significantly) different return-risk tradeoffs, i.e., risk arbitrage. A data set over the period from January 2008 to March 2017 was analyzed which uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the numeraire currency, the Japanese yen (JPY) and the Swiss franc (CHF) as funding currencies, and the Australian dollar (AUD) and the New Zealand dollar (NZD) as investment currencies. The countries’ interest rate differential plays a leading part in the carry-trade performance (Lustig et al., 2011) and a direct relationship between SDF and interest rate exists (Cochrane, 2005). Thus, the central asset pricing model was used to analyze the consumption-based risk pricing in the corresponding interest rate market. With regard to the findings of Bhansali (2007) and in combination with Burnside’s (2011a) conclusion, this is compared to a market-implied measure of risk pricing using implied and realized volatility of the countries’ stock market indices. Based on a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation, significant and persistent cross-country differences of risk aversion were found in the interest rate market compared to the implied risk aversion in the stock market. This may offer opportunities for risk arbitrage and, therefore, a risk pricing-related explanation of carry-trade returns. However, this would also imply that there is no unifying SDF. Consequently, the interest rate market and the stock market appear to be segmented in risk pricing for the countries of carry-trade currencies.",2

McCauley,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the past year, the U.S. Treasury’s semiannual currency report set the stage for a little drama. Last summer, recently retired Treasury official Sobel (2020) argued that the Treasury should not finger Switzerland as a currency manipulator. Sure, Switzerland is running a large current account surplus and accumulating foreign exchange (FX) reserves at a rapid pace. However, its policy interest rate at -75 basis points could hardly go lower. Switzerland received big safe-haven inflows in early 2020 and was not sterilising (offsetting the increase in domestic bank reserves) its intervention.Footnote 1 In short, Sobel argued that the intention of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is securing monetary stability, not protecting the traded goods sector. This recalled the argument of former Undersecretary of the Treasury Taylor (2007) that the Bush Administration should not oppose a massive ¥35 trillion (circa $350 billion) dollar-buying spree by the Ministry of Finance in 2003-04 because the Bank of Japan was simultaneously engaging in quantitative easing (i.e., increasing bank reserves as a rough counterpart to the intervention) in order to overcome deflation. However, arguments regarding the implementation of current U.S. currency policy miss the big picture. This article steps back and asks how the dollar is being managed, what this suggests about the international monetary and financial system and which U.S. policies might make a difference. The argument of this article proceeds in four propositions. First, U.S. authorities have ceded the management of the dollar to the rest of the world. Second, the rest of the world buys more dollars when the greenback is in a long downswing than when it is in a long upswing. Third, the international monetary and financial system can be analysed as a free-rider game in which the outcome of U.S. currency policy is irrelevant. Fourth, three policy alternatives to the current naming and shaming warrant consideration.",

Prinz,Hanno Beck,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Recently, a macroeconomic theory, modern monetary theory (MMT) (also dubbed modern money theory), has become a hot topic in United States (U.S.) politics. Stephanie Kelton, a proponent of this theory, was among the advisers of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Her contemporary, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a popular member of the Democratic Party in the U.S., seems to also adhere to MMT. MMT offers politicians what they want most: a simple justification for policies they want to carry out. A case in point is active U.S. labor market policy. The U.S. public expenditures in this policy area are very low in comparison to all other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Council of Economic Advisers, 2016). After the near meltdown of the financial system and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, attitudes towards active labor market and social policies might have changed. Therefore, MMT may provide a welcome academic justification for these policies. Moreover, the popularization of MMT through the blogosphere may have a profound effect on U.S. politics and economic policy in the 2020s and 2030s (Brady 2020). A special feature of MMT and its policy recommendations is public debt. According to MMT, public expenditures can be financed by public debt or even by printing more money without negative economic side effects such as inflation, crowding-out of investments or national insolvency (Forstater 1999; Mosler 1998). The only precondition is that the respective state has its own currency. This is the most provocative conclusion of MMT proponents. MMT is not a new theory that emerged from the financial crisis of 2008. Most of the policy recommendations can be found in the work of Lerner (1943, 1944, 1951), dubbed functional finance, as also mentioned by MMT proponents. The theory itself is Post-Keynesian and monetary. Post-Keynesian economics (Arestis 1996; Lavoie 2009) is the general heading for very different economic concepts and theories that rely on Keynesian economics, but that do not accept New Keynesian concepts (Dixon and Rankin, 1995). Meanwhile, economists of this tradition formed a group whose common feature is a so-called coherent financial stock-flow accounting framework (Godley and Lavoie, 2012, p. 12, who also sketch the development of MMT; Nikiforos and Zezza, 2017). As will become clear in the following, ex post accounting identities play a crucial role in MMT.",2

Financial integration, through the equalization of the marginal return of capital across countries, has only transitory effects. Financial integration accelerates the convergence rate of those scarce in capital and efficiently allocates savings towards more productive activities. However, several empirical studies found that the growth benefits of financial integration are, at most, modest and that financial development appears to be crucial for determining the impact of integration on growth (Furceri et al., 2019). The present analysis provides novel theoretical predictions on the short- and medium-run effects of financial integration among countries that differ in their level of financial development, and explains the empirical findings, even in the absence of aggregate or global risks (e.g., the global financial crisis or COVID-19 crisis). In particular, the standard model is modified by introducing a financial development gap between the two countries that became financially integrated. This leads to predictions that are the opposite of those prescribed by the neoclassical growth model. Financial integration reduces the speed of capital accumulation. Moreover, integration bears the long-run consequences of persistent financial development gaps on capital accumulation. Financial depth, by shaping the saving and investment behavior of individual agents, has important implications for capital movements among countries and can help explain the emergence of large external imbalances, as observed in recent decades. This work proposes a two-country model based on Angeletos (2007). In each economy, heterogeneous agents are subject to idiosyncratic production shocks. The presence of idiosyncratic risk generates a wedge between the risk-free interest rate and the marginal return on capital (risk premium). Better financial institutions, by lowering the portion of shocks that affect agents, facilitate a lower risk premium and lesser need for precautionary savings. In equilibrium, this results in a higher risk-free interest rate and, at the same time, a higher level of capital. The main difference with Angeletos and Panousi (2011) is that here the two countries differ not only in terms of financial depth, but also in the level of accumulated capital. The advanced economy has already reached the autarky steady state, while the other is still in the process of accumulating capital. When these two countries liberalize their capital accounts (they can exchange risk-free bonds), the interest rate on bonds is immediately equalized at a level that is between the interest rates prevailing before integration. The amount of accumulated capital in the developing country at the moment of integration shape the short-run consequences of liberalization. If the developing country is still far from its autarky steady state, then on impact it experiences a boost in consumption and capital accumulation financed through the issuance of risk-free bonds, while the advanced economy reduces consumption and buys those assets. However, if the developing country is close to the autarky steady state level of capital, the rate of capital accumulation slows down as a consequence of integration and the advanced economy issues bonds and enjoys higher consumption. The medium- and long-run effects, instead, only depend on the financial development gap. The model proves that when these two economies open up their capital accounts, in the medium term, the developing country experiences a reduction in the speed of capital accumulation, and therefore in growth, and an increase in savings. In the long run, however, this economy achieves steady state levels of capital and production that are higher than the ones under autarky. The opposite is true for the advanced economy in which financial integration boosts consumption and dissaving in the medium term. High consumption in the advanced economy is financed by capital inflows through the issuance of external debt. However, this forces agents of the advanced country to reduce both consumption and capital stock in the long run. As already mentioned, the long-run consequences are in line with Angeletos and Panousi (2011). Two forces drive these results: precautionary saving and the propensity to move resources from risky capital to safe assets until the risk-adjusted return on capital is equal to the risk-free interest rate. Under the maintained assumption of a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function, those forces are both decreasing in wealth. Debt accumulation by the agents in the advanced country, by reducing their willingness to take on risk, depresses the steady state aggregate capital stock and production. In contrast, in the developing country, the increase in wealth due to accumulation of risk-free assets boosts the propensity to take on risk, resulting in higher capital, production and consumption in the long run compared to the autarky steady state. Welfare analysis reveals that integration determines welfare losses for the advanced economy since the increase in consumption in the medium term, with respect to autarky, cannot offset the drop in the long run, and possibly also in the short term depending on the capital accumulation in the other economy at the moment of integration. In the developing country, instead, a slowdown in consumption in the medium term is compensated for by the increase in impact. In the long run, therefore, agents in this economy enjoy welfare gains. Those positive consequences are mitigated if, at the moment of financial integration, the country is very close to its autarky steady state. As described in Mendoza et al. (2009), absent any risk-sharing motive, the effect of financial integration on wealth can be negative, due to redistributional effects inside countries as a consequence of movements in the interest rate. This effect could dominate the positive impact of capital reallocation. The medium- and long-term results of the present work are driven by the assumption that the financial development gap between the two countries is not affected by financial integration. As shown by Klein and Olivei (2008), capital account openness can contribute to the development of the financial system and, therefore, should help reduce this gap. In the present framework, this could mitigate the slowdown of capital accumulation by the financially less advanced economy and reduce consumption growth in the other country, while the main forces would still be at work. However, recent data show that the gap persists even 10 years after the beginning of the large emerging market liberalization of the mid-nineties (Sahay et al. 2015).",29

A Novel Game-Theoretical and Empirical Reappraisal of the Terrorism-Aid Nexus,June 2021,Elkhan Richard Sadik-Zada,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A sizeable body of empirical literature indicates that despite the officially stated goal of socioeconomic development, geopolitical and commercial interests of donor states have been the major driver of foreign aid action during the seven decades after World War II (Apodaca 2017; Beenstock 1980; Dreher and Fuchs, 2011; McConnon 2019; Mosley 1985). The Cold War was not confined to regional confrontation between countries of the Warszawa Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Communist and capitalist systems were in global competition over binding Third World countries to their orbit of influence (Younas 2008). Implied was pursuit of proliferation of the respective forms of governance and ideologies in developing areas. Declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports from the 1980s, contemporary Congressional Research Service reports, and academic sources indicate that dominance of geopolitical calculus in determining the geography and magnitude of aid has been even more pronounced in the case of foreign aid policies of emerging donor nations, and especially member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (CIA 1975, 1984; Blanchard and Prados, 2007). Political instability in developing countries is deemed an opportunity to enhance influence or an instrument for protection of existing positions in regions of pivotal geopolitical importance for the national security interests of the donor states (Khasbulatov 1998). Unfortunately, the former Soviet Union (FSU), by supporting leftist terrorist organizations, and the U.S., by supporting groups like Mujahidin in Afghanistan or Contras in Latin America, tried to increase their geopolitical positions in unstable regions. These types of policies have been on the decline since the FSU collapse and especially 9/11. Nevertheless, there are still some forces in the oil-rich states that continue financing religiously-motivated terrorist organizations (Freeman and Ruehsen, 2013; Lee 2016). With the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and consequent end of the Cold War, the world entered a new phase of international relations. The absence of the Communist threat led to dramatic shrinkage of foreign aid between the early and late 1990s (Abadie, 2006; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2011; Drakos and Gofas, 2006). The emergence of the fourth religious wave of international terrorism was triggered by three events. These are the Munich bus attack in 1970, the massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics, and the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.Footnote 1 This wave developed into a truly globally omnipresent phenomenon in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 9/11 led to a resurgence of security issues as the central driver of official development assistance (ODA) (Gaibulliev and Sandler, 2019; Gupta 2011; Rapoport 2004). Despite substantial reforms in a number of Middle Eastern and North African states in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, religiously-motivated violence is not losing momentum and continues to shape international politics. Despite the prognosis of Rapoport (2004), it seems now that the fourth wave is not following his prediction that the fourth wave would end by the year 2025. The risk of violent religiously-motivated terrorism could potentially perpetuate for a much longer time (Rapoport 2004; Walls 2017). The present inquiry re-addresses the following research questions: 1. Do terrorism incidents affect international aid action? (assessment of causality and direction); 2. What is the impact of terrorism on the magnitude of ODA? (assessment of the strength of the relationship between the frequency of terrorism incidents and the magnitude of ODA); 3. What is the impact of the War on Terror on ODA? (assessment of the securitization conjecture); 4. What is the relationship between underdevelopment and the inflow of ODA to developing and transition countries?; 5. Did securitization of aid lead to less aid for jurisdictions with low terrorism incident levels?; 6. What is the relationship between the level of democracy in recipient countries and the magnitude of foreign aid?; 7. Is there a relationship between a predominantly Muslim population and the magnitude of aid? This paper contributes to the literature on the terrorism-foreign aid nexus in three ways. First, it augments the systematic literature on drivers of foreign aid action by scrutinizing declassified CIA records and Congressional Reports. Second, based on the literature review, the study proposes a differential game-theoretical model of aid budget distribution among targets to facilitate the socioeconomic development of recipients, geopolitical targets, and commercial interests of donor states. The third contribution of this paper is empirical. Based on the proposed theoretical model, the study revisits the terrorism-aid nexus using second-generation parametric panel cointegration techniques and nonparametric panel models with fixed effects and varying coefficients. The purpose of this inquiry is to overcome the methodological shortcomings of previous studies and intervene convincingly in the discussion on the relationship between terrorism incidents and foreign aid policies.",3

Schumpeter, in his History of Economic Analysis, posed the question “But is economics a science?” (Schumpeter, 1954) concluded that the answer almost certainly depends on the definition of what is science. Economics is clearly part of the social sciences and differs from the formal or natural sciences for several reasons. However, economics is not, and never has been, a homogenous body with a firm canon of knowledge, methods, paradigmatic world views, or topics. Analogous to other sciences, it is in a permanent dynamic state of flux with earlier positions replaced by newer ones. Additionally, a broad variety of different approaches, theories, and applications of economics exist. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, lessons from the past have not been very informative, nor are there significant prospects for the future because more indepth discussions about what economics is and what it should become rarely occur. The question of what the subject of economics encompasses has a long tradition. The oft quoted statement by Jacob Viner, “economics is what economists do” (quoted in Barber, 1997, p. 87), turned full circle when Frank Knight added “and economists are those who do economics” (quoted in Buchanan, 1964, p. 213). The ‘doings’ of economists reveal that the domain of economics is always in transition. Since no clear boundaries exist for the field of economics, current understanding of the discipline is no more advanced than in the days of Viner or Knight. The divisional order of economics is characterized by practice that mirrors the multiplicity of academic production. Of course, the twentieth century was largely a century of evolution and revival for neoclassical economics based upon earlier forms of marginal utility theory. Neoclassical economics was the focus of many decades of research and publishing, dominating textbook knowledge and student education. However, occasionally new forms of doing (and labeling) economics emerged with new applications and assumptions. Economics is a field with contributions oscillating between applied areas (e.g., tourism economics, agricultural economics, industrial economics, financial, economic and social inequality, sports or leisure economics, historical economics, cultural economics, gender economics, or economics of religion) and manifestations or approaches taken from mathematics, philosophy, psychology, engineering, (or medicine and biology, when neuroeconomics is considered). This article builds on these developments, discussing the question of quo vadis economics.",2

In principle, this relationship can be considered in three ways. Individualism sees the individual (or the human being) as the primary unit and characterizes groups by the properties, actions, and behavior of individuals belonging to them. Holism (or collectivism) starts from a group or collective (including the state) and regards individuals as primarily or completely determined by the collective. Finally, social scientists not committed to either of the two consider the individual and the collective jointly in their interplay and at the same level of analysis. Individualism and holism can refer to the existence and essence of individuals and a society, in particular the question as to whether a society exists independently of the individuals comprising it or not, the latter position being ontological individualism. The dictum of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1987, p. 30) that “There is no such thing as society” is a popular example of this attitude. Normative or moral individualism (also political individualism), on the other hand, is a normative position according to which ethical questions always refer to the behavior of and the consequences for individuals instead of addressing ethical requirements to groups, societies, or the state. Finally, methodological individualism and holism, refer to the methodology of the social sciences, and more specifically to the question as to how to explain social phenomena in the real world. Methodological individualism explains them by the behavior and actions of individuals, while methodological holism takes collectives such as society or the state as the starting point. According to Kaushik Basu (2018, p. 1815), “Methodological individualism holds that a proper explanation of a social regularity or phenomenon is grounded in individual motivations and behaviour.” This position in the philosophy of science or methodology can be regarded as a paradigm for the social sciences in the sense of Thomas Kuhn (1962). One may distinguish between a strong (strict) definition of methodological individualism demanding explanations in terms of isolated individuals and weak (mild) definition where interactions of individuals are also included in the explanation. The former version is very rarely advocated. Within economics, the claim to provide microeconomic foundations for macroeconomic phenomena is a similar (though not identical) position, and in sociology and political science the related (and again not identical) rational choice theory follows similar methodological prescriptions. It is generally acknowledged that ontological, moral, and methodological types of individualism do not follow strictly from one other, although the motivation for all of them often stems from a general normative position of advocating the freedom of the individual, i.e., political liberalism. This paper first sketches some historical aspects of methodological individualism, followed by a critical discussion of some of its versions. A position of weak methodological individualism is then developed from the perspective of critical rationalism, the philosophy of Sir Karl Popper. Consideration is then given to some recent arguments against methodological individualism. A scheme is then proposed showing by example how methodological individualists can structure the analysis of actions and interactions. The conclusion argues that methodological individualism, in spite of its long history, is still in the first phase of its potentialities and can be a successful and progressive research program for economics.",2

Brady,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Francesco was the consummate scholar, a true Renaissance man, bon vivant, and a most enjoyable colleague. Francesco and Carmen (Cignoli) Forte, his lovely wife of 59 years, were warm, inviting, hospitable, and genuinely easy to be with. They lived in a Beaux Arts building (built in the 1930s) across from a tree-lined park in Torino, Italy. Their apartment was on the top floor of a five-story building. Their other properties included a villa on the Italian Riviera in the fishing village of Portofino. Francesco’s orientation was to the political centers of the world via Rome and the capital cities of Europe. He described their Torino address, which also served as the business address for Micros Ricerche as the beginning of the road to Paris, some 773 km (480 miles) to the northwest. Equally important for Francesco’s professional work, a short walk from their apartment was the Porta Susa train station which linked Torino to the world. A trip to Rome was by high-speed rail via Milan, Bologna, and Florence. Traversing the 450 miles to Rome took four hours. The train was comfortable and quiet enough for both cell phone communication and study. His frequent travels by train to Rome’s Termini (Central Station) were conveniently scheduled. It was but a short taxi ride to his Rome apartment or his office at La Sapienza University of Rome. Access to their elegant eight room apartment in Torino was gained by ringing Micros Ricerche from the street entrance. Once granted entry to the common area, an iron elevator cage with wooden doors overlooking a grand staircase slowly climbed to the fourth floor. Francesco’s lovely wife, Carmen, passed away in January 2017, a few days after her 86th birthday. They first met 65 years earlier in 1951 and had been married for 59 years. He described her as the perfect northern Italian beauty, mother, and wife. Francesco and Carmen had warm smiles that immediately put people at ease. They were the perfect couple but differed on how they spent their time. Carmen read novels and handled family matters. The Huffpost published an interview with Francesco (unedited) on Carmen’s passing and their 59-year marriage: ""It wasn't easy to be married to someone who wrote, who worked late. She liked being alone. And she wasn't afraid to come anywhere: even to Africa, by helicopter, among the Somali rebels."" Six and a half decades (having met in 1951) together: ""When you choose someone for life you feel the need to be with a person who is a piece of us"". In every little thing. ""When I was traveling I used to make the 8 o'clock phone call. Always. Now at 8 I can't make my phone call anymore."" (Della Serra, 2017) Francesco was always on the go, facing countless deadlines, attending an endless number of meetings, conferences, and lectures. He set up meetings in distant countries (Europe, Africa and the United States) and entertained business and professional colleagues in Rome, Torino, and Portofino. In these settings, he was comfortable teaching economics, sorting through world events and political issues, exercising his finely honed intellect and applying his economic tools. He was not shy about exposing harsh political realities. Francesco was born to a prominent Italian family in Busto Arsizio in 1929. His hometown is located in the province of Varese in Lombardy in northern Italy about 35 km (22 miles) north of Milan. His father was a prosecutor and his mother was a painter. Francesco once told me his grandmother had been a baroness. Francesco became well grounded in civil law and academics very early in his life. His interest in economics, law and politics began in discussions with his father and his maternal uncle, Carlo Gray, a high-court judge and jurist. Gray wrote extensively on the work of Antonio Rosmini (1797–1855), a theologian and philosopher. Gray spent much time with Francesco and exposed him to advanced topics in philosophy, religion, and jurisprudence. Francesco attended the University of Pavia, one of Europe’s oldest universities with roots dating to the eighth century. It was chartered as an institution of higher education in 1361 by the Holy Roman emperor Charles IV. The gathering of scholars and students was given special privileges and recognition equivalent to the University of Paris and University of Bologna, which were major institutions of that time. Until the end of the nineteenth century, Pavia was the only university in greater Lombardy devoted to jurisprudence, philosophy, medicine and liberal arts. Today it has over 20,000 students scattered throughout several schools and programs offered as part of the noncontiguous Pavia campus. After graduating in Law from Pavia in 1951, Francesco remained at Pavia as a teacher and research assistant to Benvenuto Griziotti, a major contributor to the Italian school of public finance. His next career steps included positions in Milan (1954–57) and Urbino (1957–59). In the late 1950s he had an appointment at Harvard Law School to write a book on Italian tax law. From 1959–61 and 1966–68, he held appointments at the University of Virginia. (His time at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) (1969–70) to complete James Buchanan’s appointment will be discussed separately in Concluding Vignette). In 1961- 84 he was appointed to succeed Luigi Einaudi and hold the Einaudi chair in public finance at Torino. During this period, he also held political appointments and consulted with business, but academia and writing consumed much of his career. Francesco also held appointments at the Brookings Institution (1966–67), International Monetary Fund (1997), World Bank (1998) and ENI (1967–75). In 1975 he became vice president of ENI, the Italian national energy company. Earlier he served as consultant to Enrico Mattei who extensively reorganized AGIP, the energy company that became ENI in 1953. From the late 1980s to 1990s, he was Mayor of Bormio, a popular ski resort in the Province of Sondrio (Lombardy) where his family had lived during the time his father was a government official. From 1979 to 1987, Francesco was a representative in the Italian parliament. From 1987 to 1994 he served as a senator representing the region where he was born and had spent his formative years. In the 1980s, he also held cabinet positions in the governments formed by Amintore Fanfani (fifth term as prime minister 1982–83) and avowed socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi (1983–87). In 1984, Francesco returned to academia as a full professor of economic policy and financial science at La Sapienza University of Rome. He also had appointments at other universities teaching diverse subjects such as law, tourism, fashion, and technology. However, Sapienza was his home as Professore Emerito. Not to abandon politics, in the 1990s Francesco was an advisor to Silvio Berlusconi.",

This reduction resulted in extraordinary unemployment levels around the world. Accordingly, several central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, reacted to the economic developments due to COVID-19 by reducing their policy rates. This paper investigates the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy on exchange rates during the pre-COVID-19 period of 2019 and the COVID-19 period of 2020. The main objective was to investigate whether these spillover effects were effective during the COVID-19 period. The motivation for investigating these spillover effects comes from earlier studies (Maćkowiak, 2007; Ho et al., 2018; Hanisch, 2019; Tillmann et al., 2019) which showed that economic activities in both advanced economies and emerging markets were affected by the U.S. monetary policy. This may be due to international movement of capital through bond markets (Albagli et al., 2019) through bank capital flows (Bruno & Shin, 2015), or through portfolio flows into equity funds (Fratzscher et al., 2018). It is also possible for these spillovers to affect risk perceptions and thus domestic credit costs (Kalemli-Özcan, 2019). The corresponding effects on the exchange rates are due to the relative yield of dollar-denominated instruments as U.S. monetary policy changes portfolio positions between the U.S. and international assets (Albagli et al., 2019). The magnitude of the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy can be heterogenous across countries depending on their reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature (Haroon & Rizvi, 2020; Iyke, 2020; Mdaghri et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021; Garg &Prabheesh, 2021; Aloui, 2021) has shown that volatilities in exchange rates (or financial market frictions) are correlated with the country-specific developments in COVID-19 cases or deaths. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a country-specific investigation of spillovers, as achieved by the current paper. More importantly, as central banks in other countries may react to the U.S. monetary policy, as suggested by several studies (Gray, 2013; Obstfeld, 2021; Rey, 2015; Georgiadis, 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Albagli et al., 2019; Azad & Serletis, 2020), it is also important to control for the monetary policy of individual countries while investigating the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy. This paper estimates the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy on exchange rates. Country-specific analyses were conducted for 11 emerging markets and 12 advanced economies, controlling for the monetary policies of these countries. The formal analysis was based on a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model, where year-on-year growth rates of weekly measures of economic activity, exchange rates, and policy rates were used during the pre-COVID-19 versus COVID-19 periods. The spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy are investigated by accepting the U.S. economy as an exogenous block to be used in the SVAR estimation of each country. The focus is on the cumulative impulse response of exchange rates (constructed as appreciation of currencies) to a negative shock to the (shadow) federal funds rate. Also investigated is the contribution of the (shadow) federal funds rate to the exchange rate volatility of domestic currencies based on the forecast error variance decomposition. The empirical results suggest evidence for the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy for almost all countries during the during the pre-COVID-19 period, whereas they have been effective for only certain countries during the COVID-19 period. When the reasons behind the heterogeneity across countries are further investigated, the current study shows that only the exchange rates of countries that were successful in fighting against COVID-19 were subject to the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy during the COVID-19 period, consistent with earlier studies (Haroon & Rizvi, 2020; Iyke, 2020; Mdaghri et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021; Garg & Prabheesh, 2021; Aloui, 2021) which have shown that volatilities in exchange rates (or financial market frictions) are correlated with the country-specific developments in COVID-19 cases or deaths. Important policy implications follow regarding how the disease outbreak channel (Iyke, 2020; Feng et al., 2021) can be considered to fight against the economic and financial implications of COVID-19 through government interventions.",
51.0,1.0,Atlantic Economic Journal,19 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11293-023-09769-6,Asset Management as Creator of Market Inefficiency,March 2023,Dimitri Vayanos,Paul Woolley,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), formulated by Fama (1970), asset prices should equal the expectation of discounted future cash flows, and asset returns should be unpredictable. The EMH has impacted profoundly academic research, financial regulation and market practice. The following are a few examples: Most macroeconomic models embed as assumptions implications of EMH, such as the Expectations Hypothesis (EH), according to which long- and short-term bonds should earn the same expected return over the same horizon, and the Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP), according to which all currencies should earn the same expected return over the same horizon and expressed in the same currency. The EMH underlies mark-to-market regulation, according to which the solvency of financial institutions, such as insurance companies and pension funds, is evaluated based on the market value of their portfolios. The EMH also suggests a laissez-faire approach to capital markets: if asset prices are equal to expected discounted future cash flows, then markets should allocate capital efficiently towards the firms or countries with the best cash flow prospects. The EMH underlies the increasingly common practice of passive investing, according to which mutual funds track mechanically market indices. The EMH also permeates active investing because managers of active mutual funds and institutional funds are evaluated relative to benchmark indices and are often constrained in how much they can deviate from these benchmarks. A vast empirical literature in finance has tested the EMH. While many findings are supportive, there are significant and robust violations. For example, in the government bond market, the slope of the term structure predicts positively the excess returns of long-term relative to short-term bonds, in violation of the EH (Fama & Bliss, 1987); Campbell & Shiller, 1991). In the currency market, the interest-rate differential between two countries predicts positively the return of the currency carry trade, which borrows the low interest rate currency and lends the high interest rate one, in violation of UIP (Bilson, 1981; Fama, 1984). In the stock market, returns exhibit short-term momentum, whereby performance over the past 6-12 months continues on average over the next year (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993), and long-term reversal, whereby performance over the past 3-5 years reverses on average over the next year (De Bondt & Thaler, 1985). Closely related to reversal is the value effect, whereby stocks with high market value relative to book value earn low expected returns on average (Fama & French, 1992). The value and momentum anomalies have been documented not only for stocks, but also for bonds, commodities and currencies (Asness et al., 2013). The empirical findings on EMH violations call for theoretical work. Theory is needed to explain why returns are predictable and prices differ from assets’ fundamental values. Theory should also determine how the implications of EMH for academic research, financial regulation and market practice should be modified in inefficient markets. The workhorse model of asset pricing, based on a representative agent who consumes at the economy-wide consumption rate and prices assets based on her marginal utility, can generate some forms of return predictability. Nevertheless, the model’s ability to account for the full set of predictability patterns is limited. Intuitively, this is because if predictability were significant, then the representative agent would trade in such a way as to reduce it. The representative agent model is also too stylized to have meaningful implications for financial regulation and asset management, as it has no room for financial institutions and their regulation. The Limits of Arbitrage (LoA) paradigm offers a promising framework to study predictability and mispricing, as well as their implications for financial regulation and asset management. The LoA paradigm relies on two premises: (a) agents differ in their expertise to access financial markets, and (b) agency frictions limit the capital of non-experts that experts can manage. Because experts manage a limited pool of capital, mispricing can persist if the agents causing it are wealthy enough. Because the experts can be interpreted as asset managers and the non-experts as the investors or households supplying capital to them, the LoA paradigm can have implications for asset management. It can also have implications for financial regulation. Regulation can seek to mitigate adverse effects that agency frictions have on the contracting parties (micro-prudential regulation) and on equilibrium asset prices and the allocation of capital (macro-prudential regulation). The LoA paradigm can explain why mispricing is hard to correct once it arises, but not why it arises in the first place. In this paper we sketch a broader research agenda that explains both why mispricing arises and why it is hard to correct. Our research emphasizes agency frictions between financial experts and non-experts, as in the LoA paradigm, and does so in the context of asset management. We show that agency frictions can generate prime violations of EMH. We also derive implications for asset management and financial regulation. Our theory suggests that current practices for evaluating and compensating asset managers are not socially optimal and perhaps not even privately optimal. We propose changes to these practices that can mitigate mispricing and improve investor returns. We begin by reviewing the rapid growth of the asset management industry and the agency frictions inherent in the relationship between managers and investors. We next describe, drawing on our previous work, how agency frictions affect equilibrium asset prices, and how they generate prime violations of EMH: the value and momentum anomalies (Vayanos & Woolley, 2013; Polk et al., 2022), and the beta and volatility anomalies, whereby risk is unrelated or is inversely related to expected return (Buffa et al., 2022). Underlying our work is that asset prices move in response to fund flows in addition to asset cash flows, and that fund flows are procyclical. Momentum is generated by procyclical flows and is associated with price over-reaction. Building on our previous work, we derive the new results of this paper. We show that momentum is more pronounced for overvalued assets. We also show that the investors who generate the momentum and who are losing from it are those who require their asset managers to keep their portfolios close to benchmark indices. Tight tracking to benchmarks can thus be a curse for investors and markets. We conclude this paper by proposing changes to the practices for evaluating and compensating asset managers. We argue that asset management contracts should employ measures of long-run risk and return, as well as benchmark indices that emphasize asset fundamentals. There should also be greater transparency on managers’ choice of strategies.",

The main motivation for the interest rate normalization is to combat the sharpest inflation increase in decades. In some instances, policy rates have already risen, or are expected to rise, beyond the long-run equilibrium monetary policy rates for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Interest rate normalization in major economies played an important role in multiple financial crises, including the Asian Financial Crisis, Mexican banking crisis, more often called the peso crisis, and the Latin America debt crisis. This crisis is relevant now as global debt has risen to record levels. Government debt, corporate debt, and household debt around the world, rose to over $300 trillion in 2022. This is a record 350% of world gross domestic product (GDP) (Institute of International Finance, 2022). In comparison, global debt was around 270% of GDP at the onset of the global financial crisis. Much of these liabilities are funded from abroad, frequently in dollars. A buildup of risk threatens to materialize now as interest rates rise worldwide. For countries where external liability is high, debt service costs will increase and refinancing will become, in some cases, prohibitively expensive. Additionally, exchange rate movements threaten to amplify risk, as the dollar strengthens due to higher interest rates in the United States (U.S.) and investors flee to safety as debt sustainability becomes their focus. The last time major central banks increased policy rates to combat high inflation was in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Several financial crises, particularly in Latin America, happened as a direct or indirect consequence of those rate increases. This paper looks at some of those crises, considers the lessons learned and then tries to evaluate which countries may be vulnerable to debt-sustainability-driven financial crises today. The paper starts with a literature overview about systemic risk emanating from capital flows and external debt. Next is a discussion about financial crises in the 1980s and how they can be traced back to interest rate increases in major economies. Lastly, some data on liability flows and external debt levels in emerging markets and developing economies is presented.",

Truman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the principal institution of international monetary cooperation. The IMF’s institutional centrality in the post-World War II international economy and financial system rests on two key pillars. First, the IMF’s financial resources are prepositioned, allowing the IMF to expeditiously support a member or the system. The hat does not need to be passed around each time a need arises. Second, the IMF can allocate special drawing rights (SDRs) to members, enabling each holder to borrow foreign exchange directly from other members. Unless members agree to cancel outstanding SDRs, they are permanent additions to countries’ international reserves unlike currency reserves that, once spent, disappear from the system. The central monetary role for the special drawing right (SDR) is enshrined in the IMF (2020) Articles of Agreement in an obligation, not currently realized, to make the SDR the principal reserve asset of the international monetary system.Footnote 1 IMF members have failed to capitalize on the potential of the SDR tool. This paper proposes that members agree to annual SDR allocations. This would strengthen the IMF and international monetary system. The following is based on Truman (2022).",
